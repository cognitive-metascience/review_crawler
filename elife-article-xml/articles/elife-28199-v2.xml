dynamics. SUN5 is a new member of the SUN family, with little knowledge regarding its function. Here, we generated <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice and found that male mice were infertile. Most <italic>Sun5</italic>-null spermatozoa displayed a globozoospermia-like phenotype but they were actually acephalic spermatozoa. Additional studies revealed that SUN5 was located in the neck of the spermatozoa, anchoring sperm head to the tail, and without functional SUN5 the sperm head to tail coupling apparatus was detached from nucleus during spermatid elongation. Finally, we found that healthy heterozygous offspring could be obtained via intracytoplasmic injection of <italic>Sun5</italic>-mutated sperm heads for both male mice and patients. Our studies reveal the essential role of SUN5 in anchoring sperm head to the tail and provide a promising way to treat this kind of acephalic spermatozoa-associated male infertility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SUN5</kwd><kwd>ICSI</kwd><kwd>sperm head-tail connection</kwd><kwd>acephalic spermatozoa</kwd><kwd>pseudo-globozoospermia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31471277</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91649202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFA0500901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SUN5 is essential for the tight junction between sperm head and the head-tail coupling apparatus, and is the main cause of human acephalic spermatozoa syndrome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The SUN domain proteins were named for their shared homologous sequences with Sad1 and UNC-84 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malone et al., 1999</xref>); the former is an essential component of the spindle body in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hagan and Yanagida, 1995</xref>), and the latter is a nuclear membrane protein that mediates nuclear migration and positioning in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malone et al., 1999</xref>). In mammals, at least five SUN domain proteins have been reported, and three of these genes in mice have been named <italic>Sun1</italic>, <italic>Sun2</italic>, and <italic>Sun3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malone et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crisp et al., 2006</xref>). Two other SUN domain proteins were originally named rat sperm-associated antigen 4 (<italic>SPAG4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tarnasky et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shao et al., 1999</xref>) and SPAG4-like (<italic>SPAG4L</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>), by sequentially, and they are coded by <italic>Sun4</italic> and <italic>Sun5</italic>.</p><p>The SUN domain proteins possess transmembrane domains in their N-terminus and a conserved SUN domain in their C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mans et al., 2004</xref>). The transmembrane domain has been proven to integrate the SUN proteins into the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope, with their N-terminus facing the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hodzic et al., 2004</xref>). It is thought that the nucleoplasmic N-terminus of SUN proteins could interact with nuclear lamin proteins and fasten the linkage between the nuclear envelope and the nucleoplasm or chromatins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crisp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haque et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). The SUN domain in the C-terminus of SUN proteins has been reported to interact with various components in the outer nuclear membrane, mainly cytoskeleton-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apel et al., 2000</xref>) that contain a conserved KASH (Klarsicht, ANC-1 and Syne homology) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starr and Han, 2002</xref>). In this way, the SUN family builds a bridge between the nucleoskeleton and the cytoskeleton, forming the so-called LINC complexes (linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crisp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stewart-Hutchinson et al., 2008</xref>) and mediating nuclear dynamics during mitosis or meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stewart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fridkin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tapley and Starr, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kracklauer et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>SUN1 and SUN2 are two well-studied SUN proteins that are broadly expressed in both mitotic and meiotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Padmakumar et al., 2005</xref>). SUN1 is linked to F-actin filaments across the outer nuclear membrane-residing Nesprine1/2 to stabilize the nuclear anchorage and maintain nuclear envelope integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). SUN1 is also linked to microtubules via KASH5 on the outer nuclear membrane, mediating telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morimoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Penkner et al., 2009</xref>). Recent studies have found that SUN1 could mediate mammalian mRNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li and Noegel, 2015</xref>). SUN2 shares similar interactors with SUN1 and performs related functions in nuclear envelope integrity and telomere attachment. In addition, it is thought that SUN1 and SUN2 play several redundant roles in this anchoring mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lei et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>SUN3, SUN4 and SUN5, which are shorter than SUN1 and SUN2, are expressed restrictively in testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hiraoka and Dernburg, 2009</xref>). SUN3 has been reported to localize to the manchette in elongating spermatids, which is distinct from the classical nuclear membrane localization of the SUN family proteins, and its expression begins at postnatal D15. It is associated with Nesprine1, facilitating sperm head shaping during spermiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Göb et al., 2010</xref>). SUN4, which is also distributed in the manchette, can interact with SUN3, indicating the association of their localization and physiological functions. Male mice deficient in SUN4 are infertile due to globozoospermia, and SUN4 can bind to ODF1 (outer dense fiber protein 1), a sperm flagellum protein, suggesting that it might function in either nuclear remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Calvi et al., 2015</xref>) or sperm integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shao et al., 1999</xref>) during spermiogenesis.</p><p>The story of SUN5 is much more complicated. SUN5 was first found to be localized on the spermatid nuclear membrane facing the acrosome, and it was predicted to participate in acrosome biogenesis or to attach the acrosome to the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frohnert et al., 2011</xref>). However, a recent study in <italic>Dpy19l2</italic> knockout mice found that neither the expression nor the localization of SUN5 was altered, suggesting that it might not be associated with the acrosome; instead, they found that SUN5 localizes to the sperm head-tail junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yassine et al., 2015</xref>). Whether SUN5 is involved in acrosome biogenesis, head-tail integration or nuclear dynamics similar to the functional role of SUN1/2 remains elusive, due to the lack of animal models.</p><p>To address the above question, we generated a <italic>Sun5</italic> knockout mouse model via the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study its physiological functions during spermatogenesis. We found that <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> females were fertile, but the <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> male mice were sterile. Normal spermatozoa were not found in the epididymis of <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> male mice, as most of them were round-headed like spermatozoa; a few normal sperm heads could be found, but they were all separated from the sperm flagellum. Further studies uncovered that the so-called round-headed like spermatozoon from <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> male mice does not contain chromatin or acrosome; instead, it was filled with unremoved cytoplasm and misarranged mitochondria. Therefore, we proposed to name this phenotype of spermatozoa as pseudo-globozoospermia. Ultrastructural studies of spermatogenesis in <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> male mice revealed that the sperm head-tail coupling apparatus could be successfully assembled during the early stage of spermiogenesis, but without functional SUN5, the coupling apparatus together with the basal plate disassociated from the implantation fossa during the elongation of the spermatids. Most importantly, we found that healthy offspring could be obtained from <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> sterile male mice and patients by microinjection of the tailless sperm head into the oocyte. Our investigations not only settled the dispute about the physiological function of SUN5 but also provided a successful therapeutic strategy for <italic>SUN5</italic>-deficient patients. Our studies suggest that the sperm head needs to be carefully evaluated before ICSI for teratozoospermia patients to avoid this type of pseudo-globozoospermia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The generation of <italic>Sun5</italic> knockout mice</title><p>To investigate the expression pattern of <italic>Sun5</italic>, we tested the mRNA level of <italic>Sun5</italic> in various tissues from adult mice, finding that <italic>Sun5</italic> was strictly expressed in testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Further examination of testes from different-aged mice found that SUN5 expression began in the 3-week-old mouse testes, suggesting that it might participate in certain processes of spermiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Because <italic>Sun5</italic> is restricted to the testis, we applied the CRISPR-Cas9 system to achieve <italic>Sun5</italic> knockout. One Cas9-targeting sequence was found in exon 10 of the <italic>Sun5</italic> locus, which encodes the conserved SUN domain together with exon 11 and exon 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). One <italic>Sac</italic>II site was found near the PAM (protospacer-adjacent motif) sequence, which is the only <italic>Sac</italic>II site in approximately 500 bp both upstream and downstream of the Cas9-targeting sequence. For genotyping of the mutated mice, a 538 bp fragment harboring the PAM sequence and <italic>Sac</italic>II site was amplified from the genome and then digested using the <italic>Sac</italic>II enzyme. The WT genome was cut into two fragments, a 303 bp and a 235 bp fragment, while the mutated genome remained undigested.</p><p>This strategy yielded <italic>Sun5</italic> mutated mice with relatively high efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), five founders were identified among eight pups. After cloning and subsequent sequencing, the mutated sequences were identified: four of the five founders were biallelic mutants, while one was a heterozygous-mutated mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). All of the <italic>Sun5</italic> mutated mice were viable and developed normally, but all of the male biallelic mutants failed to produce offspring, while the female biallelic mutants and heterozygous-mutated males were fertile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). To establish the <italic>Sun5</italic> mutant strain, we chose the fertile heterozygous-mutated male mouse (<italic>Sun5<sup>+/−13bp</sup></italic>) to keep the mutated allele and breed <italic>Sun5</italic> knockout mice. Therefore, all of the <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice used in this study were <italic>Sun5<sup><italic><sup>−</sup></italic>13bp /<italic><sup>−</sup></italic>13bp</sup></italic> mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Defects of spermiogenesis in <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice</title><p>We found that the SUN5 protein was completely depleted in the <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> strain but not in the WT and <italic>Sun5<sup>+/−</sup></italic> males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and there were no significant differences in the viability and testis weight among the three strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). Next, we performed a systematic fertility test and found that the <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> male mice were sterile, in contrast with the <italic>Sun5<sup>+/−</sup></italic> and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Histologically, the testicular component of <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice was similar to that of <italic>Sun5<sup>+/−</sup></italic> and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), while the contents in the epididymis of <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were different from that of <italic>Sun5<sup>+/−</sup></italic> and WT mice.

As mentioned above, the <italic>Sun5</italic>-null spermatozoa contain both round-headed spermatozoa and tailless heads (their proportions were displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). To our surprise, the round-headed <italic>Sun5</italic>-null spermatozoa were negative for both sp56 and DAPI staining, indicating the absence of not only the acrosome but also the nucleus. After careful examination, we found some separated but morphologically normal sperm heads, most of them had an intact acrosome and a nucleus, and only a small amount of them had defective acrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We then measured the width and length of WT and <italic>Sun5</italic>-null sperm heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fisher et al., 2016</xref>), finding that the <italic>Sun5</italic>-null sperm heads were wider and shorter than those of the WT ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). This promoted us to investigate what exactly happened inside the so-called round-headed <italic>Sun5</italic>-null spermatozoa, so we performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of the epididymis from both WT and <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the WT sperm head was well shaped and filled with chromatin, and the sperm head and tail were tightly connected to each other, but this was never observed in the <italic>Sun5</italic>-null sperm head. The so-called round-headed <italic>Sun5</italic>-null sperm actually contained a residual droplet of cytoplasm at the top of the flagellum with misarranged mitochondria inside. In addition, the axoneme of <italic>Sun5</italic>-null sperm was also impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, the <italic>Sun5</italic>-null spermatozoa are actually acephalic spermatozoa or sperm tails only.

According to the component of the spermatids the seminiferous tubules could be divided into 12 stages (I-XII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hess and Renato de Franca, 2008</xref>). No obvious defects were found at any stage of spermiogenesis, and all of the components in the WT testes could be found in the <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, with careful examination of stage VII-VIII tubules, we observed a difference between WT and <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> testes. In the WT testis, the well-shaped spermatozoa had migrated to the edge of the seminiferous epithelium with their head and acrosomic system oriented toward the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <italic>Top</italic>). In <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> testes, it was quite different; although the shape of sperm head was normal, they were not oriented toward the basement membrane, as most of their heads were oriented toward the lumen of the seminiferous tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <italic>Bottom</italic>); peanut agglutinin (PNA, staining acrosome specifically) staining of testis sections also confirmed the mis-orientation of sperm heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Stage VII-VIII is the so-called spermiation phase when mature spermatozoa are ready to be released. This indicates that the <italic>Sun5</italic>-null sperm head and tail might break apart during spermiation so that the separated sperm head cannot align itself in the right orientation.</p><p>These observations allowed us to determine what occurred before the sperm release in <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> testes. For the differentiation of haploid spermatids could be divided into 16 steps, and each step could be recognized via TEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shang et al., 2016</xref>). We then investigated the differentiation of spermatids and the assembly of the head-tail coupling apparatus step by step via TEM. In round spermatids, the head-tail coupling apparatus in both WT and <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> testes was fully developed and consisted of a well-assembled segmented column that united the centrioles at the anterior and formed the capitulum. In WT spermatid, the well-assembled segmented column together with the capitulum and basal plate was tightly attached to the nuclear envelope in the implantation fossa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>Top</italic>), whereas in the <italic>Sun5</italic>-null spermatid, although the segmented column with the capitulum and basal plate was accurately assembled, it was only partially connected with the nuclear envelope; a large part of the coupling apparatus was missing. With the elongation of the spermatid, the WT spermatid coupling apparatus together with the flagellum was always tightly attached to the nuclear envelope until the final step of spermatid differentiation, producing structurally normal spermatozoon. In <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> testes, the elongation of the spermatid destroyed the unstable interaction between the nuclear envelope and the coupling apparatus, resulting in the separation of the basal plate-capitulum-segmented column complex from the nuclear envelope. Therefore, in the <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> testes, the decapitated flagella are released while the sperm heads remain in the seminiferous epithelium. These results indicate that SUN5 is responsible for the tight attachment of the coupling apparatus to the sperm nuclear envelope.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SUN5 is localized at the sperm head-tail coupling apparatus</title><p>All of the observations above led us to rethink the exact function of SUN5 during spermiogenesis.

Using a testis smear, we found that during spermiogenesis, SUN5 was first expressed in the nuclear envelope and later migrated to the coupling apparatus of the sperm during sperm head elongation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In mature spermatozoa, SUN5 was localized to the coupling apparatus of the sperm head and tail in the implantation fossa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Given that <italic>Sun5</italic>-null spermatozoa are actually pseudo-globozoospermia that do not contain chromatin in the round head, the regular ICSI protocol cannot be applied to these mice or patients. The traditional ICSI method favors the selection of relatively intact spermatozoa, then, after sonication, the tailless heads are injected into the oocyte, which is not applicable to the <italic>Sun5</italic> mutants.</p><p>To achieve a successful pregnancy, we selected the tailless heads of <italic>Sun5</italic>-null spermatozoa rather than the pseudo-globozoospermatozoa and injected them into WT oocytes; this strategy resulted in healthy offspring from <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). As expected, the genotypes of the offspring mice were <italic>Sun5<sup>+/−</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Similar results were achieved for WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>). The offspring of the <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice and WT mice showed no significant differences in body mass and testis weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). This strategy might also be suitable for patients with <italic>SUN5</italic> mutation-associated acephalic spermatozoa syndrome, and therefore, we selected the sperm heads rather than those with motile flagella and performed ICSI for two patients with <italic>SUN5</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Porcu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emery et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gambera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saïas-Magnan et al., 1999</xref>).

They are sometimes wrongly denominated globozoospermatozoa; they are actually isolated, headless tails with globular drops of residual cytoplasm, and the etiology of this syndrome subtype is far from complete. Our results showed that the ablation of SUN5 leads to globozoospermatozoa-like acephalic spermatozoa in the mouse model. Together with our previous report and other’s paper about <italic>SUN5</italic>-associated mutations in acephalic spermatozoa syndrome patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elkhatib et al., 2017</xref>), our studies demonstrate that defects in SUN5 may be the major cause of the acephalic spermatozoa syndrome.</p><p>Several acephalic spermatozoa-related genes, such as <italic>Odf1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Hook1</italic>(named by the hook like phenotype) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mendoza-Lujambio et al., 2002</xref>), and <italic>Oaz3</italic> (ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tokuhiro et al., 2009</xref>), have been reported in animal models. However, spermatozoa from the abovementioned gene knockout models are mostly fragile, and none of them uniformly yield 100% acephalic spermatozoa, suggesting that the head-tail coupling apparatus in these spermatozoa is still able to be formed, although it is unstable. <italic>Spata6</italic> (spermatogenesis associated 6) knockout mice were the first mouse model to produce nearly 100% acephalic spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Spata6</italic> is exclusively expressed in testes and is localized to the coupling apparatus. In the absence of SPATA6, the head-tail coupling apparatus is poorly assembled, and all of the sperm heads and tails are separated during the late stage of spermiogenesis. SUN5 is distinct from all of the above genes, as SUN5 may be localized in the inner membrane of the sperm nuclear envelope, and while the head-tail coupling apparatus can be well-assembled without SUN5, it cannot attach to the nuclear envelope. Therefore, SUN5 might be the inner-most element for flagellum anchoring; in other words, SUN5 is the root of the whole flagellum.</p><p>Sperm heads are rarely found in the <italic>Sun5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> epididymis because most heads are retained in the seminiferous epithelium when they are separated from the flagellum during spermiation. In addition, due to the loss of efficient anchoring in the last step of spermiogenesis, the last portion of the sperm cytoplasm is not able to be timely removed, which is why all <italic>Sun5</italic>-null spermatozoa carry a portion of cytoplasm at the top of the flagellum. Without normal anchoring and stable orientation, we found that the mitochondrial sheath fails to be properly arranged, and therefore, the axoneme assembly is also affected. A typical cytoplasmic droplet (CD) can be found in the normal ejaculated spermatozoa, while when cytoplasm around the sperm midpiece is present in large amounts, it may impair the sperm function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rengan et al., 2012</xref>). From the TEM analysis we can see that the retained cytoplasm droplet in <italic>Sun5</italic>-null spermatozoa is large and contains materials other than mitochondria, which may further impair sperm motility, so the retained cytoplasm droplet may not only be a result of failed spermiogenesis, but also be a second reason for infertility. All the <italic>Sun5</italic> mutated mouse and human spermatozoa are less motile than WT ones, structurally we think it is caused by the mis-arranged mitochondria inside the mutated spermatozoa, and as mentioned above, the large amount of cytoplasm might also be an obstacle for sperm motility.</p><p>Most of the spermatozoa in our recently reported infertile patients with <italic>SUN5</italic> mutations are ‘pin headed,’ and thus, they are different from the mice model. This difference might come from a partial loss of SUN5 function in those patients. There are two nonsense, one frameshift, two splice-site and five missense mutations in the infertile patients, most of which are homologous mutations or compound heterozygous mutations. The effect of these mutations might be slightly weaker than the frame-shift 13 bp deletion in the mice. The phenotype of the affected individuals was acephalic spermatozoa with a variable but low proportion of abnormal head-tail junctions and tailless heads. Some of the sperm heads in <italic>SUN5</italic>-mutated human sperm samples are linked to the tail but exhibit abnormal structures; these sperm heads do not have implantation fossa and have lost the linear alignment of the sperm axis. Therefore, depletion of <italic>Sun5</italic> leads to the loss of the key element in the sperm head-tail junction, the implantation fossa and basal plate, which is consistent with the phenotype observed in our mouse model.</p><p>Due to the conserved SUN domain, SUN5 was expected to function in meiosis, as is the case with SUN1 and SUN2, and its unclear localization in previous reports led to increased confusion regarding the role of SUN5. SUN1 and SUN2 proteins are relatively larger than the SUN3-SUN5 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Razafsky and Hodzic, 2009</xref>), and the former play roles in both mitosis and meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crisp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Padmakumar et al., 2005</xref>) while the latter are restricted to haploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Göb et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Calvi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frohnert et al., 2011</xref>). SUN1 and SUN2 directly mediate the movement of chromosomes and the migration of the whole nuclei, while SUN3-SUN5 mainly function in nuclear modeling and integrity. It has been hypothesized that the relatively larger SUN1 and SUN2 might be replaced by the smaller SUN3-SUN5 after meiosis, because with the condensation of the sperm nucleus, the space between the outer and inner layers of the nuclear envelope must be decreased, and therefore, it might not be suitable for the larger SUN1 and SUN2 proteins but is suitable for SUN3-SUN5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sosa et al., 2013</xref>). Our investigations shed light on the <italic>bona fide</italic> function of SUN5 during spermatogenesis. We found that knockout of <italic>Sun5</italic> has no effects on mouse meiosis, acrosome biogenesis or sperm nuclear remodeling, but it specifically destroyed the integrity of the spermatozoa, ultimately resulting in acephalic spermatozoa.</p><p>Our current investigation, together with the evaluation of <italic>SUN5</italic>-mutated patients, revealed that SUN5-deficient acephalic spermatozoa syndrome is an autosomal-recessive syndrome, and this type of patient could achieve healthy offspring by ICSI. For the treatment of this type of acephalic spermatozoa syndrome, our studies raised at least two very important issues. First, some <italic>Sun5</italic>-null spermatozoa look very similar to globozoospermatozoa, but there is no chromatin in the top of the flagellum. Since this type of sperms with headless flagella are still motile, they are easily regarded as globozoospermatozoa. To attract more attention, we propose to call this type of spermatozoa pseudo-globozoospermatozoa. In addition, globozoospermia-like sperms need to be carefully checked to see whether there are nuclei, as only those with real heads are able to fertilize oocytes. Second, once a male patient has been diagnosed as having <italic>SUN5</italic> mutations, <italic>SUN5</italic> mutation testing will need to be performed on a genomic sample from his wife before undergoing ICSI to avoid recessive homozygous mutations in their offspring. Our results, together with the previous report about <italic>SUN5</italic> mutations, reveal that SUN5 is essential for the integration of the sperm head to the tail, confirming that SUN5 is one of the main causes of the acephalic spermatozoa syndrome, and most importantly, we successfully found a therapeutic strategy with which to overcome infertility in the affected individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patients and clinical samples</title><p>Consent authorisation for publication has been obtained from the two couples involved in the research.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Essential role for SUN5 in anchoring sperm head to the tail&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Aminata Toure (Reviewer #1); John J.M. Bergeron (Reviewer #2); Katerina Dvorakova-Hortova (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors describe the sperm phenotype of <italic>Sun5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant mice and the localization of SUN5 in sperm cells during spermiogenesis. They also identify the co-chaperone DNAJB13, as an interactor of SUN5 protein. The authors provide a novel and exhaustive dataset on SUN5 protein and its function. They demonstrate that SUN5 is necessary for anchoring the sperm head to the flagellum, and that the absence of SUN5 in the mouse causes male infertility due to acephalic-spermatozoa. The authors also confirm in mouse and in humans that the use of the detached sperm head is successful in ICSI treatment of the male infertility. The manuscript is well written and the experiments are clearly described.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Several publications have previously characterized DNAJB13 localization and spatio-temporal distribution at sperm annulus during spermiogenesis. DNAJB13 is also well-known to co-localize with Septin proteins at the annulus. The authors state that DNAJB13 localises to the coupling apparatus; however the immunofluorescence labelling seems to indicate staining at annulus. To establish convincingly that DNAJB13 does not locate to the annulus the authors could perform co-immunodetection experiments of SUN5 with one of the septin proteins known to locate at the annulus (Sept1, 4, 6, 7 or 12) in wild type sperm.</p><p>2) In the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the authors claim that &quot;The SUN5-DNAJB13 interaction is responsible for sperm head-tail integration&quot;. However, the authors do not provide sufficient data supporting this hypothesis. AP MS should be done on n=3 separate biological experiments with appropriate quantification of the proteins (ion currents, spectral (peptide) counts). DNAJB13 appears to be lacking in Supplementary file 1 and the Y2H data is too preliminary. Moreover, the spatio-temporal distribution of DNAJB13 is not much altered in <italic>Sun5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> sperm cells during spermiogenesis. The authors should check the distribution pattern of septin protein in <italic>Sun5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant sperm (Sept1, 4, 6, 7 or 12).</p><p>3) The authors need to improve the sperm motility analysis. It is not clear whether mouse and/or human SUN5 null sperm are motile. CASA data should be provided from both KO mice and human SUN5 deficient sperm, and motility should be discussed.</p><p>4) The authors should provide statistical data showing the percentage of tails with sperm heads versus tails only, in both cauda as well as caput and corpus epididymis for mouse sperm and human ejaculate, to deliver bigger picture of phenotype and feasibility of the ICSI approach.</p><p>5) The reviewers were not convinced that SUN5-null head shape is totally normal. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> the SUN5 null sperm heads appear smaller length-wise and/or differ in hook and post acrosomal shape. They seem more like immature sperm. Morphometric analysis is required to resolve this point. Moreover, the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> images should be larger and all the abbreviations used in panel A should be explained in the legend. Specific immunofluorescence markers should be used to complement the histology. In addition, the orientation of the late spermatids should be discussed: is it due to a lack of possible interaction of SUN5 and DNAJB13 or is it a secondary effect due to the altered position in the seminiferous tubule?</p><p>6) Regarding the statement “Because the antibodies against SUN5 and DNAJB13 were both generated from rabbits, we could not directly test their co-localization by immunofluorescence”, there are other commercial antibodies on the market, and the colocalization analysis including Pearson coefficient using super-resolution should be carried out. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments should be performed in order to support the conclusions.</p><p>7) Please discuss this paper as it is relevant: Elkhatib RA et al., Homozygous deletion of SUN5 in three men with decapitated spermatozoa.

Your revised article has been favourably evaluated by Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that the manuscript has been improved. However, the new data on DNAJB13 is not compelling, specifically, iBAC of the GST pulldown of SUN5 in wt mice. Although DNAJB13 may be the most abundant testis specific protein, it is not the most abundant protein overall, and making sense of Supplementary file 1 is not straightforward. For example, pyruvate dehydrogenase appears to be the most dominant. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, it appears the pull down was only done once. In that case are the iBAC data technical repeats as opposed to different pull downs? The authors should do n=3 pull downs with GST Sun5 and the necessary reciprocal experiment of GST pulldown of DNAJB13 in wt and <italic>Sun5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (again n=3). The Y2H, mass spectrometry and GST pulldown studies are equivocal and most DNAJB13 does not colocalize with <italic>Sun5</italic>. In view of these concerns, the reviewers request that you delete the section on DNAJB13 from the manuscript.</p><p>Further points are as follows. The mass spectrometry data i.e., MaxQuant and iBAC folders (e.g. raw, peaklist, etc.) should be deposited in a public repository, e.g. http://www.proteomexchange.org.</p><p>The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> figure legend is incomplete. Both normal and abnormal heads are revealed in <italic>Sun5<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice but not indicated in the legend. The text of the Results indicates a minority were normal heads – what is the proportion?</p><p>The legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> needs clarification. Has the indicated separation of DNA JB13 in <italic>Sun5<sup>-/-</sup></italic>been measured with quantification as compared to wt?</p><p>The supplementary tables need more description in the legends, especially the supplementary file with the mass spectrometry results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28199.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Several publications have previously characterized DNAJB13 localization and spatio-temporal distribution at sperm annulus during spermiogenesis.

DNAJB13 was found to co-localize with SEPT4 in annulus, but only in developing spermatids, not mature spermatozoa (Guan J, et al. BMC Dev Biol. 2009): DNAJB13 and SEPT4 localize in the neck region at step 9 spermatids, and DNAJB13 signals migrate with annulus moving towards distal position at step 15. This is similar to our findings. To reveal the possible relationship between SUN5 and SEPT4, we performed co-immunofluorescence of them in wild type spermatozoa. We found that SUN5 and SEPT4 were first detected in the neck region of developing spermatids, and Sept4 then migrated along the annulus, but SUN5 stayed still in the neck region. In the late stage spermatids, SEPT4 was detected partially in the annulus, and partially in the neck region next to the SUN5 signal (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B). The localization and migration of SEPT4 in our result were consistent with the previous results, the overlapping of SUN5 signals and SEPT4 signals implies the possible interaction between them, but using yeasts two hybrid we found that there was no direct interaction between SUN5 and SEPT4 (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C). So, our results together with others reveal that SUN5, DNAJB13 and SEPT4 all localize to the neck region in the developing spermatids, then DNAJB13 and SEPT4 migrate to the annulus. So, DNAJB13 might have multiple functions, which might be dependent on its interaction with SUN5 or SEPT4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the authors claim that &quot;The SUN5-DNAJB13 interaction is responsible for sperm head-tail integration&quot;.

DNAJB13 is included in the Supplementary file 1 and its Protein ID is Q80Y75. The Y2H data further confirmed the MS results, and provided strong evidence for SUN5-DNAJB13 interaction. Consistent with the Y2H data, the interaction between SUN5 and DNAJB13 was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation of endogenous SUN5 by DNAJB13 antibody in testis. We also overexpressed DNAJB13 and SUN5 in Hela cells, DNAJB13 could be partially recruited to the nuclear envelop by SUN5, but DNAJB13 itself could not be recruited to the nuclear envelope (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A).</p><p>c) The distribution of DNAJB13 was altered in SUN5-null spermatids, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and the manuscript. In WT spermatids, DNAJB13 was rapidly enriched in the coupling apparatus with the elongation of the spermatid, and it was tightly attached to the nucleus during the maturation of the spermatid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, top), which is almost exactly the same as the distribution of SUN5. While in Sun5-null spermatids, although DNAJB13 was enriched to the coupling apparatus, its tight association with the nucleus was never observed, and in the late-stage spermatid, DNAJB13 was only found in the headless tail spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, bottom). In the revised version we marked the gap between nucleus and DNAJB13 in SUN5-null spermatids to make this defect could be easily found.</p><p>As required, we also examined the distribution pattern of SEPT4 in SUN5-null spermatids (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B). In SUN5-null spermatids, SEPT4 firstly appeared as a dot inside the spermatid, but different from WT, SEPT4 did not localize to the neck region of SUN5-null spermatids, because the neck region has been departed from the nucleus. Structural details of the sperm head and tail separation can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Despite the altered position of SEPT4 in SUN5-null spermatids, the absence of SUN5 does not influence the maturation of annulus and the migration of SEPT4, since SEPT4 can also be found in annulus in late stage spermatids (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors need to improve the sperm motility analysis. It is not clear whether mouse and/or human SUN5 null sperm are motile. CASA data should be provided from both KO mice and human SUN5 deficient sperm, and motility should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The sperm motility of the mouse and human SUN5-null spermatozoa was measured by CASA, which showed that SUN-defective mouse and human spermatozoa were motile, but their motility was lower than that of the WT spermatozoa. In this revised version, we provided details of sperm motility from CASA, the percentage of Rapid/Medium/Slow/Static spermatozoa were all shown, and the main part of WT and SUN5+/- spermatozoa were Rapid spermatozoa, while most of the SUN5-null mouse spermatozoa were Medium or Slow spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The motility of SUN5 mutant human spermatozoa was also shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, human sperm motility was assessed according to the WHO criteria (4<sup>th</sup> Edition). From these results we can find that over 70% of the SUN5 mutant human spermatozoa belonged to Grade D (which means static spermatozoa). The motility defects caused by SUN5 knockout or mutations were discussed in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should provide statistical data showing the percentage of tails with sperm heads versus tails only, in both cauda as well as caput and corpus epididymis for mouse sperm and human ejaculate, to deliver bigger picture of phenotype and feasibility of the ICSI approach.</p></disp-quote><p>Because spermatozoa in cauda epididymis were considered as mature ones which represents the final phase of sperm development, so usually cauda epididymal spermatozoa were examined to reveal any developmental defects. As to the development of acephalic spermatozoa, the sperm head and tail might breakup during any possible steps, so we examined the spermatozoa from different parts of the epididymis. As required, the percentage of tails with sperm heads versus tails only was measured in both cauda as well as caput and corpus epididymis for mouse sperm and human ejaculate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), we can hardly find any sperm with head in any part of SUN5 mutant mouse epididymis and human ejaculate. These results indicate that 1) the breakup of the SUN5-null sperm head and tail occurred most possibly in the seminiferous tubules rather than the duct of epididymis because spermatozoa with heads were seldom seen in the caput epididymis; 2) ICSI is the only way to treat the SUN5 mutations associated patients because nearly no intact sperm could be found in the ejaculate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The reviewers were not convinced that SUN5-null head shape is totally normal. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> the SUN5 null sperm heads appear smaller length-wise and/or differ in hook and post acrosomal shape. They seem more like immature sperm. Morphometric analysis is required to resolve this point. Moreover, the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> images should be larger and all the abbreviations used in panel A should be explained in the legend. Specific immunofluorescence markers should be used to complement the histology. In addition, the orientation of the late spermatids should be discussed: is it due to a lack of possible interaction of SUN5 and DNAJB13 or is it a secondary effect due to the altered position in the seminiferous tubule?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestions. We have performed morphometric analysis of the WT and SUN5-null sperm heads as recommended. For the morphometric analysis of the sperm head, the width and length of the sperm heads were measured according to a published method (Fisher HS, et al. Nat Commun. 2016), and we found that SUN5-null sperm heads were somehow different from the WT ones, the SUN5-null sperm heads were shorter but wider than the WT, and the length/width ratio was smaller than the WT ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-E</xref>). We also analyzed the sp56 staining pattern in SUN5-null sperm heads, finding that over 80% of sperm heads showed normal sp56 staining indicating the well-formed acrosome, while only less than 20% of the spermatozoa showed impaired sp56 staining with different patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Back to the question “whether SUN5-null sperm heads are immature sperms”, from the current data we cannot say yes or no, from the acrosome development (sp56 in single sperm and AFAF staining in testis) the SUN5-null sperm head seemed mature, and the disrupted sp56 distribution and altered length/width ratio might be resulted from the transportation in the duct of epididymis, because tail-less heads are actually dead heads which should be degraded by the Sertoli cells. But one fact should not be ignored, that is the sperm head and tail are separated in the late stage seminiferous tubules before the final maturation of the sperm in epididymis. So we intend not to judge whether the SUN5-null sperm heads are mature or not, but to discuss the specific function of SUN5 in acrosome biogenesis and the whole spermiogenesis.</p><p>As suggested, we have adjusted the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and provided explanations for abbreviations in the figure. Images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref> are PAS staining rather than HE staining which could stain the developing acrosome, and acrosome itself could serve as a marker of the spermatid development. As a complement to the PAS staining we also stained the acrosome by FITC labeled PNA (Peanut agglutintin) to show the orientation of the sperm head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Spermatids in the late stage tubules especially in stage VII-VIII were well aligned with their heads and acrosomic system oriented toward the basement membrane, this orientation required the well-assembled sperm head-coupling apparatus-tail. The coupling apparatus was destroyed in the late stage SUN5-null spermatid, the sperm tail was separated from the head, and the head could not align itself as the WT sperm, so we think it’s the loss of the coupling apparatus and sperm tail that leads to the miss-alignment of the sperm head in SUN5-null spermatids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Regarding the statement “Because the antibodies against SUN5 and DNAJB13 were both generated from rabbits, we could not directly test their co-localization by immunofluorescence”, there are other commercial antibodies on the market, and the colocalization analysis including Pearson coefficient using super-resolution should be carried out. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments should be performed in order to support the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestions, we tried to find other non-rabbit originated commercial antibodies, but failed. One goat poly-antibody against DNAJB13(F-20) was cited in a published paper, but the production has been stopped by the company (Santa Cruz). So we have to immunize mice for 6 weeks using His-FLAG tagged DNAJB13, and the anti-serum against DNAJB13 recovered from mouse blood was tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and then used in the following experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-E</xref>). The interaction between SUN5 and DNAJB13 was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation of endogenous SUN5 by DNAJB13 antibody in testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In single developing spermatids, co-localization of SUN5 and DNAJB13 in the sperm head to tail coupling apparatus was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and Pearson coefficient is 0.47 ± 0.06.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Please discuss this paper as it is relevant: Elkhatib RA et al., Homozygous deletion of SUN5 in three men with decapitated spermatozoa.

However, the new data on DNAJB13 is not compelling, specifically, iBAC of the GST pulldown of SUN5 in wt mice. Although DNAJB13 may be the most abundant testis specific protein, it is not the most abundant protein overall, and making sense of Supplementary file 1 is not straightforward. For example, pyruvate dehydrogenase appears to be the most dominant. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, it appears the pull down was only done once. In that case are the iBAC data technical repeats as opposed to different pull downs? The authors should do n=3 pull downs with GST Sun5 and the necessary reciprocal experiment of GST pulldown of DNAJB13 in wt and Sun5<sup>-/-</sup> mice (again n=3). The Y2H, mass spectrometry and GST pulldown studies are equivocal and most DNAJB13 does not colocalize with Sun5. In view of these concerns, the reviewers request that you delete the section on DNAJB13 from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have deleted the section on DNAJB13 from the manuscript, and related information has been deleted in figures, legends, and figure supplements.
