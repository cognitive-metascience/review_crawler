Five conserved tubulin cofactors/chaperones and the Arl2 GTPase regulate α- and β-tubulin assembly into heterodimers and maintain the soluble tubulin pool in the cytoplasm, but their physical mechanisms are unknown. Here, we reconstitute a core tubulin chaperone consisting of tubulin cofactors TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2, and reveal a cage-like structure for regulating αβ-tubulin. Biochemical assays and electron microscopy structures of multiple intermediates show the sequential binding of αβ-tubulin dimer followed by tubulin cofactor TBCC onto this chaperone, forming a ternary complex in which Arl2 GTP hydrolysis is activated to alter αβ-tubulin conformation. A GTP-state locked Arl2 mutant inhibits ternary complex dissociation in vitro and causes severe defects in microtubule dynamics in vivo. Our studies suggest a revised paradigm for tubulin cofactors and Arl2 functions as a catalytic chaperone that regulates soluble αβ-tubulin assembly and maintenance to support microtubule dynamics.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08811.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08811.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08811.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells contain a network of protein filaments called microtubules. These filaments are involved in many biological processes; for example, they help cells keep the right shape, and they help to transport proteins and other materials inside cells.</p><p>Two proteins called α-tubulin and β-tubulin are the building blocks of microtubules. The filaments are very dynamic structures that can rapidly change length as individual tubulin units are either added or removed to the filament ends. Several proteins known as tubulin cofactors and an enzyme called Arl2 help to build a vast pool of tubulin units that are able attach to the microtubules. These units—called αβ-tubulin—are formed by α-tubulin and β-tubulin binding to each other, but it not clear exactly what roles the tubulin cofactors and Arl2 play in this process.</p><p>Nithianantham et al. used a combination of microscopy and biochemical techniques to study how the tubulin cofactors and Arl2 are organised, and their role in the assembly of microtubules in yeast. The experiments show that Arl2 and two tubulin cofactors associate with each other to form a stable ‘complex’ that has a cage-like structure. A molecule of αβ-tubulin binds to the complex, followed by another cofactor called TBCC. This activates the enzyme activity of Arl2, which releases the energy needed to alter the shape of the αβ-tubulin. Nithianantham et al. also found that yeast cells with a mutant form of Arl2 that lacked enzyme activity had problems forming microtubules.</p><p>Together, these findings show that the tubulin cofactors and Arl2 form a complex that regulates the assembly and maintenance of αβ-tubulin. The next challenge is to understand how this regulation influences the way that microtubules grow and shrink inside cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08811.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08811.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>tubulin</kwd><kwd>cofactor</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>Arl2</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd><kwd>GTPase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM110283, GM08429</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Al-Bassam</surname><given-names>Jawdat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM092968</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Jeffrey K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM047356</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leary</surname><given-names>Julie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Soluble αβ-tubulin assembly is regulated by a cage-like molecular complex containing tubulin cofactors and Arl2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microtubules (MTs) are dynamic polymers that modulate fundamental cellular processes through dynamic αβ-tubulin polymerization and depolymerization at their ends, and serve as polarized tracks for molecular motor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2008</xref>). Polarity and dynamic instability are fundamental features of the MT polymer, originating from the head-to-tail polymerization of αβ-tubulin heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nogales et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alushin et al., 2014</xref>). The αβ-tubulin dimer contains two GTP-binding sites: an inactive non-exchangeable site (N-site) on α-tubulin, which is suggested to stabilize αβ-tubulin dimers during their biogenesis, and an active exchangeable site (E-site) on β-tubulin, which is stimulated to hydrolyze GTP upon αβ-tubulin incorporation into MT lattices at the plus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nogales et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alushin et al., 2014</xref>). GTP hydrolysis at the E-site leads to dynamic instability (catastrophe) at MT plus ends, due to the strain induced by the curvature of individual protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alushin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brouhard and Rice, 2014</xref>). Intracellular MT dynamics critically relies on a tightly controlled pool of soluble αβ-tubulin dimers in the cytoplasm. Despite their importance, the mechanisms for biogenesis, maintenance, and degradation of soluble αβ-tubulin dimers remain poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tian and Cowan, 2013</xref>).</p><p>αβ-tubulin is maintained at a high concentration (∼6 μM) in the cytoplasm through regulation of translation from tubulin mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cleveland et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cleveland, 1989</xref>). α- and β-tubulin are translated and folded as monomers in the type II chaperonin TRIC/CCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis et al., 1997</xref>). Biogenesis and degradation of the αβ-tubulin heterodimer are non-spontaneous processes that rely on five highly conserved tubulin cofactor (TBC) proteins: TBCA, TBCB, TBCC, TBCD, and TBCE (described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lundin et al., 2010</xref>). Orthologs of these proteins have been identified in all eukaryotes studied to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lundin et al., 2010</xref>). The maintenance of a concentrated pool of tubulin dimers by the TBC proteins is essential for proper MT dynamics in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tian et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lundin et al., 2010</xref>). The TBC proteins' functions are finely balanced: their loss or their overexpression are both lethal in most eukaryotes, stemming from a complete loss of the MT cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steinborn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lacefield et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin et al., 2009</xref>). In budding yeast, the first identified <underline>c</underline>hromosomal <underline>in</underline>stability (CIN) phenotypes, showing severe mitotic spindle defects due to loss of MTs, were ultimately traced to loss of TBC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoyt et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antoshechkin and Han, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steinborn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lacefield et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin et al., 2009</xref>). In humans, missense mutations in TBCE and TBCB are linked to hypo-parathyroidism facial dysmorphism (also termed Kenny-Caffey syndrome) and giant axonal neuropathy, in which developmental defects are observed due to impairment of MT cytoskeleton function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parvari et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). In addition to the five conserved TBC proteins, the small Arl2 GTPase (<underline>A</underline>DP <underline>R</underline>ibosylation <underline>F</underline>actor-<underline>L</underline>ike-2) regulates the function of TBC proteins in αβ-tubulin biogenesis/degradation through an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Although Arl2 is not considered a tubulin cofactor, its loss causes nearly identical defects to those observed with TBCC, TBCD, or TBCE loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoyt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Radcliffe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mori and Toda, 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08811.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tubulin cofactors and Arl2 GTPase: domain organization and paradigm for function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tubulin cofactors A–E, Arl2 GTPase masses, and domain organization.

The role of Arl2 GTP hydrolysis in this pathway remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhamidipati et al., 2000</xref>); Arl2 and its activation by TBCC have been suggested to operate in parallel to the TBC pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, the roles for TBCC and the Arl2 GTPase remain poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tian et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mori and Toda, 2013</xref>). Overexpression of TBC proteins results in one of two unique phenotypes: TBCA or TBCB overexpression in budding or fission yeast suppresses defects induced by overexpression of α- or β- tubulin, but does not otherwise affect MT dynamics. In contrast, overexpression of TBCC, TBCD, TBCE, or Arl2 leads to rapid MT loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Archer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feierbach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Radcliffe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lacefield et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2 assemble into a stable heterotrimeric chaperone (TBC-DEG) with a cage-like structure. This chaperone binds αβ-tubulin and TBCC sequentially, serving as a catalytic platform powered by the Arl2 GTPase for αβ-tubulin assembly and activation. A soluble αβ-tubulin dimer binds TBC-DEG and primes Arl2, followed by TBCC binding and GTP hydrolysis activation. We show that TBCC is a unique GAP for which affinity depends on αβ-tubulin binding onto TBC-DEG. TBCC promotes GTP hydrolysis through its C-terminal β-helix domain, which interfaces with both Arl2 and αβ-tubulin in a ternary complex. We further find that in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cells, a mutation locking the Arl2 GTPase into a GTP-bound state profoundly affects MT dynamics. Overall, our studies reveal a new role for tubulin cofactors TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2, which together assemble a GTP-hydrolyzing tubulin chaperone critical for the biogenesis, maintenance, and degradation of soluble αβ-tubulin, defects in which have a profound effect on MT dynamics in vivo. The finding that αβ-tubulin is assembled on a multi-subunit platform establishes a new paradigm for the mechanisms of the TBC proteins in tubulin biogenesis, maintenance, and degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tubulin cofactors TBCD, TBCE, and the Arl2 GTPase form a stable heterotrimeric chaperone</title><p>To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of tubulin cofactors and Arl2, we expressed the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> orthologs of TBCA, TBCB, TBCC, TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2 (named Rbl2, Alf1, Cin1p, Pac2p, Cin2p, and Cin4p, and referred to hereafter as TBCA, TBCB, TBCC, TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>]) both individually and in combinations, with the goal of reconstituting relevant complexes. TBCA and TBCB are small proteins (12 and 28 kDa in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) that have been suggested to sequester monomeric β- and α-tubulin, respectively, while TBCC, TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2 regulate αβ-tubulin dimer biogenesis and degradation through unknown mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Archer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feierbach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lundin et al., 2010</xref>). Sequence alignments and structure predictions identify conserved domains within each protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but the molecular functions of these domains remain unknown. We found that TBCA, TBCB, and TBCC are each soluble when expressed on their own in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, while TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2 are insoluble on their own (see ‘Materials and methods’). Co-expression of these three proteins, however, results in a stable and homogenous TBC<underline>D</underline>-TBC<underline>E</underline>-Arl2 <underline>G</underline>TPase complex that we term TBC-DEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When we coexpressed TBCA, TBCB, or TBCC with TBC-DEG, we observed no interaction with TBCA or TBCB, and an unstable, transient interaction with TBCC (as determined by mass spectrometry; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) demonstrates that TBC-DEG is a 205 kDa heterotrimer with one copy of each protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Similar analysis shows that TBCC is a 32 kDa monomer, and porcine brain αβ-tubulin is a 100 kDa heterodimer, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Monomeric TBCD, TBCE, or Arl2 subunits were not observed in vitro at any concentration and the TBC-DEG complex behaves as a single biochemical entity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). At high ionic strength, TBC-DEG complexes precipitate, presumably due to dissociation and insolubility of individual subunits (data not shown). A recent study suggests human TBCE is soluble and forms complexes with TBCB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Serna et al., 2015</xref>). We do not observe TBCE-TBCB complexes using our TBC protein bacterial expression system. TBCE is insoluble without TBCD and Arl2 coexpression in bacteria. We believe that TBCE solubility maybe due to its expression in a eukaryotic system, where assembly and co-purification with TBCD and Arl2 is possible.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08811.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Hierarchical assembly of TBCC with TBC-DEG and soluble αβ-tubulin dimer binding in the GDP·Pi state.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) intensity traces of TBC-DEG (black), TBC-DEG:αβ-tubulin (cyan), αβ-tubulin (red), and TBCC (purple).

In contrast, deleting the N-terminal Cap-Gly domain of TBCE, predicted to bind the C-terminal tail of α-tubulin, did not affect assembly of soluble TBC-DEG complexes. We next determined the effect of inserting small (6xHis) or large (GFP, green fluorescent protein) tags on TBC-DEG assembly. Consistent with the deletion analysis, large or small tags were not tolerated on either end of Arl2 or at the C-termini of TBCD or TBCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Both 6xHis and GFP tags were tolerated at the N-termini of TBCD and TBCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). These data suggest that the conserved domains of TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2 are required to assemble a TBC-DEG complex, in which the N-termini of TBCD and TBCE are exposed, while both termini of Arl2, and the C-termini of TBCD and TBCE, are buried and do not tolerate insertions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>αβ-tubulin and TBCC sequentially bind TBC-DEG depending on the state of the Arl2 GTPase</title><p>We next sought to test the idea that TBC-DEG serves as a platform for soluble αβ-tubulin dimer assembly, and to examine the role of the Arl2 GTPase in this assembly.

The TBC-DEG:αβ-tubulin complex is likely to be the ∼300 kDa tubulin biogenesis intermediate identified two decades ago by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paciucci (1994)</xref>. We next determined the conditions for TBCC binding to TBC-DEG and αβ-tubulin. TBCC does not bind either αβ-tubulin or TBC-DEG in isolation, but strongly interacts with the TBC-DEG:αβ-tubulin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). This interaction strongly depends on the GTP nucleotide present during complex assembly. We observed TBCC binding to the TBC-DEG:αβ-tubulin complex when incubated with the non-hydrolysable GTP analog GTPγS or the transition state analog GDP·ALF<sub>x</sub>, but no binding in the presence of GTP or GDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1 B–E</xref>). We measured a 340 kDa mass for the TBC-DEG:αβ-tubulin:TBCC ternary complex, indicating that the TBC-DEG:αβ-tubulin complex (310 kDa) associates with a single molecule of TBCC (34 kDa) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). To determine if the Arl2 GTPase is responsible for increasing the TBCC binding affinity to TBC-DEG, we next generated a Gln73Leu (Q73L) mutation in Arl2, which inhibits GTP hydrolysis and results in a ‘GTP-locked’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Veltel et al., 2008</xref>). Bacterial expression of recombinant Arl2-Q73L shows that it assembles with TBCD and TBCE into a TBC-DEG-Q73L complex. In contrast to TBC-DEG, TBC-DEG-Q73L interacts with TBCC in the absence of αβ-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, panel I), and assembles with αβ-tubulin and TBCC to form a stable and fully saturated ternary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, panel II; mass of 335 kDa by SEC-MALS; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) in the presence of GTP. Thus, our biochemical reconstitutions indicate that TBCC binding to TBC-DEG is promoted by both αβ-tubulin binding to TBC-DEG and the GTP-bound state of Arl2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

At 3 μM αβ-tubulin and at a 1:3:1 ratio of TBCC:αβ-tubulin:TBC-DEG, we observe the highest GTP hydrolysis rate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>: <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> = 3.0 min<sup>−1</sup>), suggesting that each TBC-DEG chaperone can undergo multiple rounds of GTP hydrolysis, upon binding and releasing multiple αβ-tubulin dimers during each experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We were unable to test αβ-tubulin concentrations higher than 3 μM in this assay, as at 6 μM αβ-tubulin or higher we expect αβ-tubulin polymerization into MTs to significantly contribute to the overall GTP hydrolysis observed. Within the tested αβ-tubulin concentration range (0–3 μM), the TBC-DEG GTP hydrolysis rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) is proportional to the αβ-tubulin concentration, starting at ∼0.8 min<sup>−1</sup> in the absence of αβ-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, Figure 3—figure supplement 3H) and climbing and then plateauing at 3.0 min<sup>−1</sup> at 3 μM αβ-tubulin. Thus, TBCC is an αβ-tubulin dependent GAP that activates TBC-DEG GTP hydrolysis in a cyclic manner where the degree of GAP activity depends on the soluble αβ-tubulin concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The TBC-DEG complex is a cage-like chaperone with a hollow central core</title><p>To determine the 3D structure of the TBC-DEG-Q73L chaperone, we used electron microscopy (EM) and single-particle image analysis.

TBC-DEG consists of a circular ‘floor’ with a large vertical ‘thumb’ extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, pink), facing a ‘bow’ density with two globular ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, blue). The bow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, blue) is attached at its center to the floor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, pink) via a ‘trunk’ density and binds a ‘pillar’ density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, orange) via one of its globular ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, cyan). Three interfaces form the TBC-DEG cage structure: (1) bow to floor interface via the trunk; (2) bow to pillar interface (cyan); and (3) floor to pillar interface. To determine the locations of individual TBC-DEG subunits within this structure, we imaged a complex with N-terminally GFP-fused TBCE (TBC-DE(N-GFP)G) using negative-stain EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). TBC-DE(N-GFP)G class averages show the addition of ordered density when compared to equivalent class averages of TBC-DEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We determined a 24 Å 3D structure for TBC-DE(N-GFP)G using a 50 Å resolution filtered TBC-DEG as a starting model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We located the TBCE N-terminus near one of the two globular domains at the end of the bow, suggesting that this density is the N-terminal Cap-Gly domain of TBCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>We built a pseudo-atomic model for TBC-DEG using the experimentally verified position for the TBCE Cap-Gly domain, followed by semi-automated docking of Arl2 and structural models for conserved domains of TBCD and TBCE, into the TBC-DEG map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>). We used the structure of Cse1p as a model for TBCD, as they share over 47% sequence identity and contain a similar number of HEAT repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cook et al., 2005b</xref>). For the TBCE LRR domain, we used the structure of TLR4, which shares 40% sequence similarity with TBCE and contains 14 LLR repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 2009b</xref>). We used the Cap-Gly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleming et al., 2013c</xref>) and ubiquitin-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fleming et al., 2013b</xref>) domains of TBCB as models for the equivalent domains of TBCE, and the human Arl2 structure as a model for yeast Arl2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanzal-Bayer et al., 2002b</xref>). We used two approaches to dock these subunit models into the TBC-DEG map, leading to similar results (see ‘Materials and methods’). First, we segmented the TBC-DEG-Q73L map, and docked the atomic models into segments using the ‘fit to segment’ feature in UCSF Chimera. Second, we used low-resolution filtered subunit models and successively fit them into an unsegmented map, using the ‘fit in map’ feature of UCSF Chimera, starting with the largest subunit (TBCD) and ending with the smallest subunit (Arl2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). The Cse1 model representing TBCD fit well to the floor and thumb segments (UCSF Chimera correlation coefficient 0.71) and its distinct circular-ring and rod shape allowed an unambiguous fit directly into the TBC-DEG map without segmentation. TLR4, representing the central LRR domain of TBCE, fit well to the bow segment of the TBC-DEG map (UCSF Chimera correlation coefficient 0.80) after placement of TBCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The TBCB Cap-Gly structure fit well into the globular end of the bow closest to the TBCE N-GFP density from TBC-DE(N-GFP)G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), while the TBCB ubiquitin-like domain fit well into the other globular end of the bow (UCSF Chimera correlation coefficient 0.82). The overall bow-shaped organization of TBCE LLR with two globular domains at its ends is similar to the TBCE organization in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Serna et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, Arl2 fit well to the pillar density located in between the TBCE and TBCD subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). The only region of the TBC-DEG map that was not accounted for in our modeling is the trunk, which likely includes the four to five HEAT repeats in TBCD that are missing from the Cse1 model according to sequence alignment comparison. Thus, our low-resolution structure and model for TBC-DEG support our domain deletion/insertion analysis of TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating a non-linear assembly of these subunits into a cage-like complex, and demonstrating critical roles for N and C-terminal domains of TBCD, Arl2, and the C-terminus of TBCE in TBC-DEG assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>TBC-DEG embraces an αβ-tubulin dimer asymmetrically above its hollow core</title><p>To examine the structural basis for TBC-DEG association with αβ-tubulin, we determined a 3D reconstruction for the TBC-DEG-Q73L:αβ-tubulin complex using the approach described above (see ‘Materials and methods’). Raw images and reference-free classification show TBC-DEG-Q73L:αβ-tubulin particles adopt a variety of orientations, with a moderate degree of preferred views (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We generated a de novo starting model using common class averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>, left panel).

The TBC-DEG:αβ-tubulin model projections match the class averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). When compared to TBC-DEG-Q73L, the TBC-DEG-Q73L:αβ-tubulin map shows an additional dual-lobed mass on top of the cage, with dimensions of approximately 80 × 40 × 40 Å, which we assigned as αβ-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

This additional information allows us to unambiguously assign the orientation of the bound αβ-tubulin, and fitting of the atomic coordinates of the αβ-tubulin dimer into the dual-lobed density (UCSF Chimera correlation coefficient 0.85) results in a pseudo-atomic model of the full TBC-DEG-Q73L:αβ-tubulin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08811.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>TBC-DEG platforms engage the αβ-tubulin dimer asymmetrically, placing it in contact with Arl2 GTPase above the hollow core.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A refined TBC-DEG-Q73L:αβ-tubulin 3D map shown in three rotated views.

The TBCE Cap-Gly domain moves ∼20 Å from its position in TBC-DEG-Q73L, shifting closer to the TBCD thumb, while interfacing with the density we assign as α-tubulin.

The domain connecting the TBCE bow to the Cap-Gly domain becomes disordered upon binding, suggesting that TBCE undergoes a conformational change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–G</xref>, dark blue). The TBCE ubiquitin domain could not be assigned in this map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–G</xref>). Importantly, our TBC-DEG:αβ-tubulin model shows that both longitudinal interfaces used in MT protofilament assembly are accessible while tubulin is engaged by TBC-DEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–G</xref>). Thus, our structural analysis suggests that the TBC-DEG chaperone organization is likely critical for recognizing α- and β-tubulin monomers during the biogenesis or degradation of αβ-tubulin dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>TBCC C-terminus is a β-helix wedge that catalyzes αβ-tubulin dependent GTP hydrolysis</title><p>Sequence alignments suggest that TBCC is a two-domain protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>), with an N-terminal spectrin-like domain (residues 1–99 of 267; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia-Mayoral et al., 2011</xref>), and a C-terminal domain predicted to consist of β-sheets (residues 100–267) that is likely to be responsible for TBCC GAP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuhnel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mori and Toda, 2013</xref>). To better understand TBCC's interactions with TBC-DEG, we sought to determine TBCC's crystal structure. We crystallized full-length <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> TBCC and determined a 2.0 Å resolution structure encompassing residues 100–267 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Electron density for the TBCC N-terminal domain was absent, indicating it is either disordered or proteolyzed during crystallization. The TBCC C-terminal domain adopts a β-helix fold composed of 13 β-strands arranged in a helical staircase in the shape of a narrow triangular wedge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). TBCC shows structural homology to retinitis pigmentosa-2 (RP-2) protein (RMSD 1.7 Å; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), a well-studied GAP for the Arl2 paralog Arl3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuhnel et al., 2006</xref>). In RP2, the β-helix domain binds Arl3 and inserts an ‘arginine finger’ into the Arl3 active site to stimulate GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Veltel et al., 2008</xref>). TBCC possesses a conserved arginine (Arg186) in the same position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which in our structure projects outward from a highly conserved surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). In addition, TBCC includes two conserved features: (1) two additional β-strands with an intervening 15-residue loop (residues 220–245) projecting above the β-helix; and (2) a short C-terminal α-helix that folds onto the TBCC β-helix domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The TBCC loop is rich in conserved hydrophobic and acidic residues, including Phe233, Phe237, Glu240, Glu241, Glu243, and Asp244 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

This model (detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>) predicts that TBCC inserts Arg186 into the Arl2 active site to catalyze GTP hydrolysis, while Phe233 and Phe237 in the TBCC loop bind Arl2 hydrophobic residues, and the TBCC acidic residues 240, 241, 243, and 244 project above the Arl2-TBCC interface.<table-wrap id="tbl5" position="float"><object-id

We first removed the TBCC N-terminal spectrin domain to generate TBCC-C (residues 100–267); this mutant showed a 38% decrease in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> when compared to wild type TBCC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), and lost the robust αβ-tubulin independent activation of GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This suggests that TBCC's N-terminal domain likely regulates the αβ-tubulin independent affinity of TBCC for TBC-DEG, while the β-helix domain is sufficient for αβ-tubulin dependent GAP activity. Mutation of the TBCC putative arginine finger, Arg186 (R186A), decreased the GTP hydrolysis rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) of TBC-DEG:αβ-tubulin by slightly more than 70% (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> = 0.53 min<sup>−1</sup> compared to 1.85 min<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). As removal of the arginine finger is expected to eliminate the GAP activity of TBCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Veltel et al., 2008</xref>), the substantial remaining GTP hydrolysis activity with TBCC R186A supports the idea that GTP hydrolysis observed in TBC-DEG:αβ-tubulin:TBCC complexes arises from a combination of Arl2 and αβ-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). A TBCC loop-deleted mutant (Δ233-245; residues 233–245 replaced with a six-residue Ser-Gly linker) reduces GTP hydrolysis activity by 82% (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> = 0.34 min<sup>−1</sup>), to a low yet still robust level of activity, similar to the rate of GTP hydrolysis for TBC-DEG:αβ-tubulin without TBCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The TBCC loop deletion is expected to interfere with Arl2 recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Our structural and biochemical analyses of TBCC suggest its β-helix domain is a non-classical αβ-tubulin dependent GAP that activates Arl2 GTP hydrolysis, and may activate αβ-tubulin to hydrolyze GTP through an unknown mechanism. Residual GTP hydrolysis after specific inactivation of Arl2 GAP activity through the R186A and Δ233-245 TBCC mutants suggests that a secondary GTPase remains robustly active in the TBC-DEG:αβ-tubulin:TBCC complex. This GTPase is likely αβ-tubulin itself; however, which GTPase site (N or E-site) is becoming activated, and which mechanism is behind its activation, both remain to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>TBCC β-helix wedge interfaces with Arl2 and αβ-tubulin dimer in the TBC-DEG chaperone</title><p>To gain insight into the TBCC GAP mechanism, we determined 3D reconstructions for TBC-DEG-Q73L:αβ-tubulin:TBCC ternary complexes using negative-stain EM and single particle image analysis (see ‘Materials and methods’). We used the TBC-DEG-Q73L complex to guarantee 100% stoichiometric TBCC binding in the TBC-DEG-Q73L:αβ-tubulin:TBCC ternary complex to ensure its full occupancy in the structural studies. Raw images and reference-free classification indicate that the hollow core of the cage becomes largely occupied in the ternary complex. This conformation is distinct in appearance from the previous conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We used angular reconstitution and refinement to generate a 24 Å TBC-DEG-Q73L:αβ-tubulin:TBCC map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>), and the model projections match well to the reference-free class averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The ternary complex map was then interpreted with respect to the TBC-DEG-Q73L and TBC-DEG-Q73L:αβ-tubulin maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The ternary complex map shows an additional wedge-shaped density inside the hollow core of the TBC-DEG cage, which we assign to the TBCC β-helix domain. A second density is observed engaging the αβ-tubulin at its intra-dimer interface, located in proximity to the TBCE Cap-Gly domain densities in previous maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). The TBCC C-terminal domain-Arl2 GTPase interface lies directly below the intra-dimer interface of tubulin. We generated a pseudo-atomic model for TBC-DEG-Q73L:αβ-tubulin:TBCC by fitting atomic coordinates for TBCC-N spectrin in the additional density along the TBC-DEG floor, and fit the C-terminal β-helix domain to the wedge density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The TBCC β-helix docked well to the wedge density engaging the Arl2 GTPase (UCSF Chimera correlation coefficient 0.85), and this fit matches the conformation of our homology model for the TBCC-Arl2 binary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Strikingly, despite the low resolution of our maps, we find that the αβ-tubulin dimer adopts a unique conformation in the ternary complex. The intact αβ-tubulin dimer did not fit into this density in the ternary complex map. Therefore, α and β-tubulin models were fit individually (UCSF Chimera correlation coefficients 0.55 and 0.67 for α and β-tubulin, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). The αβ-tubulin intra-dimer interface is wedged open by a 20 Å-wide globular density, which we assigned to be the TBCE Cap-Gly domain due to its physical proximity in the TBC-DEG and TBC-DEG:αβ-tubulin maps. We suggest that the TBCE Cap-Gly domain is repositioned by 10 Å in the ternary complex, wedging between α- and β-tubulin. TBCC C-terminal β-helix and its loop lie directly below the intra-dimer interface. At the current resolution it remains unclear how the αβ-tubulin dimer is modified and we require higher resolution studies to understand its conformation and the positioning of TBC-DEG domains in the ternary complex. Our structural analysis supports the biochemical finding that TBCC is an αβ-tubulin dependent non-classical GAP for Arl2. Our ternary complex map suggests that TBCC Arg186 activates the Arl2 GTPase while engaging αβ-tubulin at its intra-dimer interface via the extended loop. Arl2 GTP hydrolysis leads to a conformational change that involves a well-documented rotation of its conserved N-terminal helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Veltel et al., 2008</xref>); this conformational change may reposition the associated TBCE Cap-Gly domain to deform αβ-tubulin or activate αβ-tubulin GTP hydrolysis at its N-site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08811.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A TBC-DEG:αβ-tubulin:TBCC ternary complex structure shows TBCC engages both Arl2 and αβ-tubulin dimer, deforming its intra-dimer interface.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A refined 24 Å TBC-DEG-Q73L:αβ-tubulin:TBCC 3D map shown in three rotated views.

We show that TBCD, TBCE, and the Arl2 GTPase form a chaperone core (TBC-DEG), which sequentially binds intact soluble αβ-tubulin and TBCC to activate the Arl2 GTPase and possibly influence the αβ-tubulin conformation and GTPase activity.

This manipulation likely drives both biogenesis and degradation of the αβ-tubulin dimer. We find that TBCC acts as a true GAP for Arl2, likely inserting the arginine finger residue Arg186 into the Arl2 active site to stimulate GTP hydrolysis. We find that full GAP activity depends on the binding of αβ-tubulin onto the TBC-DEG chaperone, suggesting that TBCC's affinity for TBC-DEG is increased upon αβ-tubulin binding to the chaperone. We suggest that this affinity enhancement may be mediated by the extended acidic loop of TBCC, which is positioned close to the bound αβ-tubulin dimer in our pseudo-atomic model of the ternary complex, and mutation of which eliminates tubulin-dependent GAP enhancement. Finally, we observe modest but reproducible GTP hydrolysis both in the absence of TBCC and in an arginine finger-defective TBCC R186A mutant, suggesting that in addition to Arl2, a tubulin GTPase site (either N or E-site) may become active when bound to the TBC-DEG chaperone.</p><p>An important question is how TBC-DEG, through Arl2 GTPase activity, mediates both assembly and activation of the αβ-tubulin dimer, and potentially also its dissolution into α- and β-tubulin monomers. When TBC-DEG grasps α- and β-tubulin, the tubulin dimer interface is positioned directly above the Arl2 and its associated TBCC GAP. We suggest these binding interfaces are critical for setting the αβ-tubulin configuration during biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). The TBC-DEG catalytic activity is likely required to overcome the high affinity of α- for β-tubulin within tubulin dimers. Previous studies have demonstrated that αβ-tubulin dimer dissociation is an extremely slow and unfavorable biochemical process that requires an external energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caplow and Fee, 2002</xref>). The TBC-DEG chaperone system likely provides the required energy through TBCC-mediated Arl2 GTP hydrolysis to power the dissociation of αβ-tubulin dimers. The TBCC αβ-tubulin binding interface ensures that catalysis is activated more efficiently upon αβ-tubulin binding to TBC-DEG.</p><p>We suggest a revised ‘cycling chaperone’ paradigm for tubulin cofactors and Arl2: (1) TBC-DEG forms a nascent αβ-tubulin dimer through TBCA and TBCB tubulin monomer delivery, or may bind an already formed soluble αβ-tubulin dimer; and (2) TBCC binds the TBC-DEG-αβ-tubulin complex and activates the Arl2 GTPase in an αβ-tubulin dependent manner, driving TBCD and TBCE conformational changes to manipulate αβ-tubulin, leading either to its degeneration or release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). The TBCC αβ-tubulin dependent GAP may ensure the correct αβ-tubulin configuration and activate Arl2 GTP hydrolysis. The Arl2 GTPases were shown to undergo dramatic conformational change upon GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>), which likely drives tubulin cofactor chaperone catalysis. However, at the current resolution, our current EM maps do not yet show how the Arl2 GTPase conformational change catalyzes the TBC-DEG chaperone enzymatic activity, and what domains in TBC-DEG mediate the dissociation of the αβ-tubulin dimer into monomers.</p><p>In yeast, expression of tubulin cofactor chaperones with Arl2 locked in a GTP-like state (<italic>cin4</italic>-Q73L) leads to severe defects in MT dynamics, characterized by increase in pauses and loss of MT rescues. This regulation may involve soluble αβ-tubulin recycling, biogenesis, and degradation; this activity requires TBCC GAP activity, and an active Arl2 GTPase, where their mutations lead to defects in MT function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhamidipati et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fleming et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Radcliffe et al., 2000</xref>). We postulate that the tubulin cofactor/Arl2 chaperone activity may cumulatively counteract a slow decay in the soluble αβ-tubulin pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Purified soluble tubulin has a well-documented rapid decay if not polymerized into MTs, although the biochemical nature of this decay remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prasad et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sackett et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sackett and Lippoldt, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elie-Caille et al., 2007</xref>). TBC-DEG chaperones are critical for MT cytoskeletal dynamics in vivo as they may actively remove decaying αβ-tubulin by degradation. GTP hydrolysis within the tubulin dimer, coupled to MT dynamics, may lead to decay in αβ-tubulin, and thus TBC-DEG chaperones may be required to revitalize the αβ-tubulin dimer pool to support MT dynamics. Locking Arl2 in a GTP state via the Q73L mutation likely inhibits this regulation, leading to a loss in MT polymerization capacity as has been observed in vivo in many systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhamidipati et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mori and Toda, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Inactivating Arl2 GTPase leads to inhibition of TBC-DEG catalytic activity and inhibition of TBC-DEG:αβ-tubulin:TBCC ternary complex disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), and in vivo, shows a rapid decrease in MT polymerization rate and increase in MT pausing. Our in vivo analysis provides compelling evidence for the critical role of TBC-DEG in MT function. We suggest that this chaperone activity is critical for MT dynamics through an effect on the health of the soluble pool of αβ-tubulin. One possibility for the toxic effect of the Arl2 GTP-locked mutation may be the inability of soluble tubulin to cycle through the TBC-DEG chaperone, leading to either sequestration of αβ-tubulin dimer on the complex, or the release of partially dissociated soluble αβ-tubulin dimers, which then induce toxic effects on MT dynamics. In cells, TBC-DEG chaperones are at much a lower concentration of soluble αβ-tubulin, suggesting that TBC-DEG exerts its effects on a relatively small population of αβ-tubulin in the soluble cytoplasmic pool; this idea is supported by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhamidipati et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mori and Toda, 2013</xref>). Increasing concentration of these regulators may catalyze extensive soluble αβ-tubulin degradation, thereby interfering with MT polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). The regulation of the soluble αβ-tubulin pool by removing poorly active αβ-tubulin from the pool or adding new fresh αβ-tubulin to the system, may result in more polymerization-competent soluble αβ-tubulin and may enhance MT dynamics. Locking Arl2 in the GTP state (Q73L) leads to profound changes in MT dynamics leading to a pausing phenotype in vivo, and likely leads to the mitotic defects previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fleming et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Radcliffe et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Many facets of this paradigm remain to be studied in the future: for example, how is αβ-tubulin released from TBC-DEG once assembled or repaired? How do TBCA-β-tubulin and TBCB-α-tubulin complexes interface with each other and/or TBC-DEG to initially form the αβ-tubulin dimer? How are decaying αβ-tubulin dimers recognized by TBC-DEG for recycling and degradation? How would this chaperone system drive αβ-tubulin biogenesis in the presence of a concentrated soluble αβ-tubulin pool in the cytoplasm?</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We provide a revised paradigm for the assembly, biochemical activity, and organization of the well-conserved tubulin cofactors and Arl2 GTPase as a cage-like chaperone that catalytically alters tubulin dimers in the cytoplasm, powered by GTP hydrolysis. The GTPase activity of Arl2 is central to power and gate these chaperones, while tubulin cofactors TBCD and TBCE mediate molecular recognition of α- and β-tubulin in the heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tian and Cowan, 2013</xref>). The concept that tubulin cofactors and Arl2 function together as a catalytic chaperone is consistent with long-standing genetics and cell biology studies indicating that their concentration is critical for proper MT dynamics and MT homeostasis. These chaperones represent a new MT regulatory pathway that may enhance MT dynamics by improving the activities of individual soluble αβ-tubulin dimers in the cytoplasmic pool. This regulation is likely critical for the homeostasis of the MT cytoskeleton in eukaryotes, which is underscored by human disorders related to tubulin cofactor mutations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Recombinant expression and purification of tubulin cofactor complexes</title><p>Full length <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> TBCC, TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2 cDNAs (also named Cin2, Cin1, Pac2, and Cin4, respectively) were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides and inserted in two polycistronic bacterial expression vectors using isothermal assembly and confirmed by DNA sequencing.

This is an important but poorly understood facet of tubulin homeostasis, and the authors have expended considerable effort to study these complexes using a range of methods. The authors have purified and characterised the complex containing the yeast tubulin cofactors D and E together with the GTPase Arl2 and showed that they form a stable heterotrimer, which they term TBC-DEG. Using negative stain EM data, the authors investigated the structure of the TBC-DEG complex. They showed that the binding of tubulin dimer and the tubulin cofactor C activates GTP hydrolysis, and provided evidence that the ability of Arl2 to hydrolyse GTP is functionally important. Finally, the authors explored the activity of the chaperone towards tubulin using microscopy-based microtubule dynamics assays.</p><p>Several parts of the work presented – e.g. the biochemical characterisation of the chaperone components and the yeast TBCC C-terminal domain crystal structure – shed new light on aspects of the chaperone mechanism. However, there are some significant concerns, particularly about the 3D reconstruction using negative stain EM data, which would need to be addressed. The data on microtubule dynamics appear difficult to interpret, and the authors should very seriously consider saving them for another manuscript, where the effect of the complex on microtubule growth is investigated more thoroughly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> indicates that TBCC peptide coverage is 0.9%. Is this a typo? If not, what is the protein that has been studied?</p><p>2) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Tubulin cofactors D, E and Arl2 GTPase form a stable heterotrimeric TBC-DEG chaperone” the author states that ‘Monomeric TBCD, TBCE and Arl2 subunits were not observed in vitro at any concentration and the TBC-DEG complex behaves as a single biochemical entity’. Could it be that the subunits were not recovered on the column due to their tendency to precipitate?</p><p>3) 3D reconstruction using negative stain EM data is a significant proportion of the assembled evidence. Although intrinsically limited in achievable resolution, use of negative stain is legitimate with such small and apparently aggregation-prone complexes. However, as outlined below, the analysis of these EM data does not appear to be sufficiently robust and needs to be improved, in order to ensure that all potential errors and/or ambiguities are eliminated.</p><p>The authors have taken a systematic approach to reconstructing a series of multi-subunit complexes applying standard methodologies. However, for these standard methods to work, several conditions must be met:</p><p>A) Individual particles and class averages must be centred: based on the views in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</xref>, this does not appear to be the case – e.g. top row, second from right, fourth row, first on left;</p><p>B) Classes must be homogeneous – however multiple class averages show a lack of crispness that is suggestive of member heterogeneity – e.g. second row 9 along; third row 7 along. This problem is particularly acute in the larger complexes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1B</xref> but also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1B</xref>; note also there are no stars in these figures, as suggested by the legend.</p><p>When these conditions are not met, structures cannot be considered to be reliable. Unreliability is further supported by the lack of match between class averages and re-projections e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1E</xref>.</p><p>The segmentation imposed on such lower resolution reconstructions is essential for interpretation, but appears a bit arbitrary. Putting aside concerns about the structures themselves, the evidence presented for subdomain assignment is not currently justified. First, the high cross-correlation (CC) values from the docking calculations are not by themselves evidence of a unique assignment – for example, what was the CC when the HEAT repeats were fit in the pink density rather than the blue density? The lack of connectivity between the TBCE LRR and Ubiquitin is particularly unsatisfying – and the CAPGly and LRR are separated by ∼100A in the final +tub +TBCC reconstruction, which seems unlikely. Second, the data localising the GFP density in two different tagged versions of the TBC-DEG complex (Figure 3–figure supplement 2) are unconvincing because: a) the density for the GFP in the class averages is not always visible and b) it is not obvious that the same projections are being compared {+/-}GFP.</p><p>4) The experiments with dynamic microtubules represent the weakest part of the story. The authors show that in the presence of 6μM tubulin, nanomolar concentrations of TBC-DEG moderately reduce microtubule growth rate and promote rescues in a concentration-dependent manner. At concentrations above 20 nM, the effect on rescues is reduced and a bi-modal distribution of catastrophe frequencies is observed. When the concentration is increased further, microtubule pausing is observed. When the TBC-DEG complex version containing the GTP-locked Arl2-Q73L is used, very slow growth or even microtubule pausing is observed. The authors interpret the experiments in terms of the effects on the tubulin dimer (dimer re-activation, sequestration or decay, dependent on concentration, although there is very little evidence to make a justified choice between these different possibilities). However, it is well known that when tubulin concentration is increased, microtubules normally should grow faster. Slow growth, pausing and rescues – very prominent phenotypes observed by the authors – are all typically associated with proteins acting on microtubule ends or on the microtubule lattice. The authors suggest that their complexes do not bind to microtubule ends, but the data shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>) are clearly not of sufficient quality to make a strong conclusion about this: TBC-DEG-Q73L strongly binds to the GMPCPP seeds and the overall background is high. Further, it is not shown whether the ReAsH labelled complex has the same activity as the unlabelled one. The only way to exclude the direct effects of the cofactors on the microtubules would be to pre-incubate the tubulin with the cofactor for different times, remove the cofactor and perform microtubule dynamics assays. Based on these considerations, the authors are strongly encouraged to remove this section and save the results for a subsequent study, where the effects of the complex on microtubule dynamics are researched properly.</p><p>5) It remains difficult to understand the effect and the importance of GTP hydrolysis by Arl2 for the TBC-DEG cycle. While no additional experiments seem to be necessary, the authors should make a much better effort to describe their interpretation of the results discussed in the section “Sequential binding of tubulin and TBCC activates maximal GTP hydrolysis in TBC-DEG chaperones” and in the Discussion (second paragraph). What do the authors mean when they say “Arl2 GTPase state likely controls the TBC-DEG chaperone state” – to which part of the chaperone cycle does this refer? For many small GTPases, locking them a GTP state makes them constitutively active, and indeed Q73L-Arl2 promotes formation of the complex of TBC-DEG with tubulin and TBCC. Is tubulin recycling blocked in this case? If so, the complex containing Q73L-Arl2 will act as a stable tubulin sequestering agent.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Tubulin Cofactors and Arl2 are Cage-like Chaperones that regulate the soluble αβ-Tubulin pool for Microtubule Dynamics” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Putting aside concerns about the structures themselves, the evidence presented for subdomain assignment is not currently justified. First, the high cross-correlation (CC) values from the docking calculations are not by themselves evidence of a unique assignment – for example, what was the CC when the HEAT repeats were fit in the pink density rather than the blue density?</italic></p><p>We completely agree with the reviewers that the segmentation of low-resolution negative stain electron microscopy maps involves a degree of arbitrariness. However, our maps provide enough shape information that molecular models can be fit to unique positions within these maps even without using segmentation. There is a moderate to high sequence homology between TBCD and TBCE-LLR (40% identical) to the paralog structures being used for the fitting. We used an independent approach for fitting, presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>. Low-resolution models for TBCD, TBCE paralogs and Arl2, generated from high-resolution structures or homology models, were cumulatively fit into the TBC-DEG map. The paralog structure for TBCD, the largest subunit, has a distinctive “ring with rod” shape, which can be fit fairly unambiguously. Once TBCD is positioned and that region of the map is excluded, the TBCE-LLR can only be fit reasonably into the bow density with two globular densities, attached both ends of the bow, likely to be TBCE Cap-Gly and C-terminal ubiquitin domains. Finally, the more globular Arl2 matches the size of the remaining pillar density.</p><p><italic>The lack of connectivity between the TBCE LRR and Ubiquitin is particularly unsatisfying – and the CAPGly and LRR are separated by ∼100A in the final +tub +TBCC reconstruction, which seems unlikely</italic>.</p><p>The lack of connectivity between the TBCE-LLR and Ubiquitin domain is due to our choice of contour-threshold chosen to present the TBC-DEG map or potential density defects caused by negative stain. We describe these details in the revised manuscript in the subsections “The TBC-DEG complex is a cage-like chaperone with a hollow central core” and “Electron microscopy and Single particle image analysis”.</p><p>We have reevaluated the positioning of the Cap-Gly domain in the TBC-DEG Q73L:αβ-tubulin:TBCC map based on the reviewer’s comment. We agree that the Cap-Gly domain placement was likely incorrect in the previous model. We have generated a revised model for the TBC-DEG-αβ-tubulin: TBCC complex in comparison to its previous positions in the TBC-DEG and TBC-DEG:αβ-tubulin maps. We believe the revised model takes into account the positioning of TBCE-terminal domains more accurately. We have further described these details in the revised manuscript in the subsections “TBCC β-helix wedge interfaces with Arl2 and αβ-tubulin dimer in the TBC-DEG chaperone” and “Electron microscopy and Single particle image analysis”.</p><p>However, higher resolution structures will be required to further understand the conformations of individual domains in each of the different states.</p><p><italic>Second, the data localising the GFP density in two different tagged versions of the TBC-DEG complex (Figure 3–figure supplement 2) are unconvincing because: a) the density for the GFP in the class averages is not always visible and b) it is not obvious that the same projections are being compared {</italic>+/-<italic>}GFP</italic>.</p><p>We have revised the MSA particle image classification of GFP-fusion TBC-DEG complexes, as described above for the native complex. We have used projection matching to compare the TBC-DEG and TBC-DE(GFP)G projections and have identified the correct projections more accurately. The GFP density appears clearly in most revised projections.</p><p><italic>4) The experiments with dynamic microtubules represent the weakest part of the story. The authors show that in the presence of 6μM tubulin, nanomolar concentrations of TBC-DEG moderately reduce microtubule growth rate and promote rescues in a concentration-dependent manner. At concentrations above 20 nM, the effect on rescues is reduced and a bi-modal distribution of catastrophe frequencies is observed. When the concentration is increased further, microtubule pausing is observed. When the TBC-DEG complex version containing the GTP-locked Arl2-Q73L is used, very slow growth or even microtubule pausing is observed. The authors interpret the experiments in terms of the effects on the tubulin dimer (dimer re-activation, sequestration or decay, dependent on concentration, although there is very little evidence to make a justified choice between these different possibilities). However, it is well known that when tubulin concentration is increased, microtubules normally should grow faster. Slow growth, pausing and rescues – very prominent phenotypes observed by the authors – are all typically associated with proteins acting on microtubule ends or on the microtubule lattice. The authors suggest that their complexes do not bind to microtubule ends, but the data shown (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7K</italic></xref><italic>) are clearly not of sufficient quality to make a strong conclusion about this: TBC-DEG-Q73L strongly binds to the GMPCPP seeds and the overall background is high. Further, it is not shown whether the ReAsH labelled complex has the same activity as the unlabelled one. The only way to exclude the direct effects of the cofactors on the microtubules would be to pre-incubate the tubulin with the cofactor for different times, remove the cofactor and perform microtubule dynamics assays. Based on these considerations, the authors are strongly encouraged to remove this section and save the results for a subsequent study, where the effects of the complex on microtubule dynamics are researched properly</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the regulatory effects of tubulin cofactor chaperone on the soluble tubulin pools and their dynamic polymerization into microtubules are complex. The defects in GTP hydrolysis observed in the Arl2 Q73L mutant, however, lead to pausing of microtubule dynamics, that we observed both in vivo and in vitro.</p><p>As the reviewers requested, we have removed these data from the manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) It remains difficult to understand the effect and the importance of GTP hydrolysis by Arl2 for the TBC-DEG cycle. While no additional experiments seem to be necessary, the authors should make a much better effort to describe their interpretation of the results discussed in the section “Sequential binding of tubulin and TBCC activates maximal GTP hydrolysis in TBC-DEG chaperones” and in the Discussion (second paragraph). What do the authors mean when they say “Arl2 GTPase state likely controls the TBC-DEG chaperone state” – to which part of the chaperone cycle does this refer? For many small GTPases, locking them a GTP state makes them constitutively active, and indeed Q73L-Arl2 promotes formation of the complex of TBC-DEG with tubulin and TBCC. Is tubulin recycling blocked in this case? If so, the complex containing Q73L-Arl2 will act as a stable tubulin sequestering agent</italic>.</p><p>We have revised the text in the Results and Discussion sections to further clarify the role GTP-hydrolysis to address all the points described above regarding the mechanism of the tubulin cofactors/Arl2 chaperone system.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1"><italic>Figure 4–figure supplement 1</italic></xref> <italic>seems to contain colored asterisks and some other material hidden behind panel B.

Indeed, in these images all of the class averages are 1-2 pixels to the left of center. This is an image masking/display artifact, and has no effect on the quality of the resulting reconstruction or on the quality of our multivariant statistical analyses classification. Each individual image used for the electron microscopy reconstructions and validation of model projections are independently centered prior to their inclusion in projection matching or angular refinement algorithms.</p><p><italic>3) Please compare your work to the paper by Serna et al. in J Cell Science (PMID: 25908846)</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the study above is important, and have added the reference in the Results section of the manuscript where appropriate. Our conclusions, however, potentially differ from the conclusions of Serna et al., and we do not observe a TBCB-TBCE complex in our work. Our approach to co-express the TBC proteins with different tags did not lead to TBCB interacting with TBCE under any condition. In addition, we never observed isolated TBCE and thus our data indicate that recombinant TBCE is likely insoluble without TBCD and Arl2.</p><p>It is possible that the TBCE protein described in the Serna et al. manuscript is metastable. Alternatively, TBCD and Arl2 may have co-purified from insect cells where the purification of TBCE was carried out. The lack of mass-spectrometry data in this manuscript prevents us from comparing the TBCE preparation to that we present.</p><p>Despite these outstanding issues, we think it is significant that the overall shape and organization of the low resolution TBCE reconstruction presented by Serna et al. suggests a similar organization to the region we assign as TBCE in our map. The crescent shape that we assign to the TBCE LLR domain with its two globular densities supports our conclusions regarding TBCE organization, with terminal Cap-Gly and ubiquitin domains.</p></body></sub-article></article>
