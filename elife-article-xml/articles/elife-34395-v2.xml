Spatial navigation and context-dependent episodic memories are represented in several interconnected regions including the hippocampal and entorhinal cortices, but the cellular mechanisms for their dynamic coupling remain to be defined. Using monosynaptically-restricted retrograde viral tracing in mice, we identified a subcortical GABAergic input from the medial septum that terminated in the entorhinal cortex, with collaterals innervating the dorsal presubiculum. Extracellularly recording and labeling GABAergic entorhinal-projecting neurons in awake behaving mice show that these subcortical neurons, named orchid cells, fire in long rhythmic bursts during immobility and locomotion. Orchid cells discharge near the peak of hippocampal and entorhinal theta oscillations, couple to entorhinal gamma oscillations, and target subpopulations of extra-hippocampal GABAergic interneurons. Thus, orchid cells are a specialized source of rhythmic subcortical GABAergic modulation of ‘upstream’ and ‘downstream’ cortico-cortical circuits involved in mnemonic functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>medial septum</kwd><kwd>entorhinal cortex</kwd><kwd>GABAergic neurons</kwd><kwd>theta oscillations</kwd><kwd>gamma oscillations</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UU_12024/4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Viney</surname><given-names>Tim James</given-names></name><name><surname>Salib</surname><given-names>Minas</given-names></name><name><surname>Joshi</surname><given-names>Abhilasha</given-names></name><name><surname>Unal</surname><given-names>Gunes</given-names></name><name><surname>Berry</surname><given-names>Naomi</given-names></name><name><surname>Somogyi</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>108726/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Viney</surname><given-names>Tim James</given-names></name><name><surname>Salib</surname><given-names>Minas</given-names></name><name><surname>Joshi</surname><given-names>Abhilasha</given-names></name><name><surname>Unal</surname><given-names>Gunes</given-names></name><name><surname>Berry</surname><given-names>Naomi</given-names></name><name><surname>Somogyi</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Felix Doctoral Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joshi</surname><given-names>Abhilasha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>GABAergic parvalbumin-expressing 'orchid cells' of the medial septum selectively target GABAergic neurons in connected extra-hippocampal areas of the mouse, providing rhythmically bursting inhibitory input at the peak of hippocampal 5-12 Hz theta oscillatory cycles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>When an animal explores an environment, hippocampal ‘place cells’ represent different locations forming a spatial map and discharging rhythmic bursts of action potentials in temporal sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O'Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref>).

The functional roles of MSDB neurons have been investigated in vivo at the population level, with network effects mostly being studied in the dorsal CA1 (CA1d) region of the hippocampus, although most MSDB afferents to the hippocampus target CA3 and the dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freund and Antal, 1988</xref>).

It is currently unknown how different types of rhythmic bursting neurons contribute to cortical circuits outside the CA3 area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joshi et al., 2017</xref>). This is due to the wide range of preferred theta phase coupling by individual cells, the general lack of information on the topography of MSDB projections covering both the hippocampal formation and extra-hippocampal cortical regions, and until recently, a lack of information on single long-range projection axons. We have investigated the behavior-dependent firing patterns, axonal projections and cortical targets of GABAergic MSDB neurons that projected to the EC in awake mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Medial septal neurons projecting to the entorhinal cortex</title><p>We investigated MSDB projections to the EC by injecting a monosynaptically-restricted retrograde viral tracer, PRV-hSyn-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oyibo et al., 2014</xref>), into the <italic>caudo-dorsal</italic> EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>) and a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding EYFP into the MSDB.

As in the cortex, PV neurons in the MSDB represent a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons, but PV is expressed by many different kinds of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Simon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Varga et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Viney et al., 2013</xref>). GABAergic Teevra neurons are immunopositive (+) for PV <italic>and</italic> SATB1 but lack detectable immunoreactivity (–) for mGluR1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joshi et al., 2017</xref>). Within the MS, 21.0% of EC-projecting (EYFP+) neurons were triple immunopositive for PV, SATB1, and mGluR1a, while 37.1% showed no detectable signal for these three molecules (n = 62 tested neurons, six mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,f</xref>). Neurons found nearby as PV+/SATB1+/mGluR1a– did not project to the EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), consistent with the profile of CA3-projecting Teevra cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joshi et al., 2017</xref>). Within the DB, 44.8% of neurons were only SATB1+ with the remainder of cells being triple immunonegative (n = 29 tested neurons, six mice). A subset of EYFP+ neurons were tested for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kondo and Zaborszky, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Unal et al., 2015</xref>), PV and mGluR1a. Only 2/13 tested were ChAT+/PV–/mGluR1a–, 1/13 was only mGluR1a+, and 10/13 lacked detectable immunoreactivity (ChAT–/PV–/mGluR1a–). The PV– and ChAT– MSDB neurons probably comprise both GABAergic and glutamatergic EC-projecting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fuchs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonzalez-Sulser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Justus et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Firing patterns of septo-entorhinal neurons</title><p>To determine the temporal patterns of signals sent from the basal forebrain to the EC, we lowered glass electrodes into the MSDB in drug-free awake head-restrained mice to record neurons extracellularly, then visualized their axon collaterals and terminals in the cortex by juxtacellular labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Eight labeled neurons had projection axons heading towards the EC via the dorsal fornix, with 5/8 forming thin collaterals and terminals within deep layers of the caudo-dorsal EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref>). The main axons of the other three neurons faded before collateralization in the EC due to insufficient labeling (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Nevertheless, all eight neurons showed strong rhythmic burst firing occurring during both locomotion and immobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a,b,d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3f,g</xref>), with longer bursts displaying accommodation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3f,g</xref>).

We categorized four behavioral states in the head-restrained mouse: locomotion (LM); small movements (SM), which typically included postural shifts, limb and tail motion; spontaneous whisking and/or sniffing (WS) without other movements; and immobility (IM) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7">Table 7</xref>). During LM and SM, theta oscillations dominated the CA1d LFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5a</xref>). During WS and IM, LIA emerged in the hippocampus and more regular ‘delta’ 2–4 Hz oscillations were present in the MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujisawa and Buzsáki, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nerad and McNaughton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wolansky et al., 2006</xref>), often at higher power when the mouse was breathing more deeply. Orchid cell rhythmicity was evident during all four behavioral states, with autocorrelograms exhibiting robust peaks and troughs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The peak in the autocorrelograms was at 143.8 ± 19.8 ms during locomotion (mean ±s.d., n = 8 cells) but occurred later during the other states (SM: 169.6 ± 38.8 ms, n = 7; WS: 167.5 ± 18.6 ms, n = 6; IM: 174.4 ± 26.4 ms, n = 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Rhythmic firing was thus within the lower frequency range of 5–12 Hz theta oscillations (~80–200 ms) during all behavioral states, with cells exhibiting faster rhythmic firing patterns during locomotion when theta oscillations were at their highest frequency and power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Theta oscillations were observed intermittently during SM, WS and IM, which may account for orchid cell rhythmic firing at the lower theta frequency range. But when we tested for rhythmic burst firing during CA1d LIA (&lt;5 Hz) ‘non-theta’ periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>), we found that 5/8 orchid cells increased firing close to the peak of the variable duration LIA cycles, with bursts beginning on the rising phase (neurons AJ44j, TV50a, TV58g, AJ50j, and MS19b; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). These firing patterns are consistent with the preferential firing around the peak of each theta cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).

We hypothesized that this increase in mean firing rate during locomotion was due to changes in the spike burst properties. We encountered a diversity of rhythmic bursting and non-bursting neurons in the MS. The common features that we recognized for orchid cells were: (1) a high burst incidence during both locomotion and immobility (&gt;3.0 Hz); (2) long duration bursts during locomotion and immobility (median &gt;50 ms); (3) an increase in firing during locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>); (4) strong coupling mostly around the peak of CA1d theta oscillations (mean vector lengths &gt; 0.2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5d–f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">3</xref>). We occasionally observed orchid cell bursts spanning two consecutive theta cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). We did not observe any non-EC projecting MS neurons (e.g. septo-hippocampal neurons) that exhibited all 4 features of the reported orchid cells (data not shown).</p><p>We encountered other neurons (n = 7 unlabeled and n = 1 labeled PV+/SATB1+ mGluR1a + neuron) that matched the criteria and were classified as putative orchid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d,f,g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Tables 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9">9</xref>). These cells also had different mean firing rates during locomotion and immobility (61.7 ± 18.0 Hz LM versus 43.4 ± 8.9 Hz IM; n = 8, <italic>t</italic><sub>7</sub> = 3.80, p<italic>=</italic>0.0067, paired <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8">Table 8</xref>). As with the labeled neurons, most putative orchid cells showed a phase preference close to the peak of CA1d theta oscillations (group mean phase (circular mean ± circular s.d.): identified, 178.6° ± 39.1°, n = 8; putative, 183.3° ± 38.5°, n = 8; difference = 4.7°; p<italic>=</italic>0.8143, permutation test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9">9</xref>). Putative orchid cells were also coupled to mid-gamma oscillations, and like orchid cells maintained a peak phase preference (n = 3/8 tested neurons, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9">Table 9</xref>). To test the reliability of our prediction of orchid cell identity by these signature firing patterns, we recorded then labeled two medial septal neurons that had similar long bursts (TV77q, median (and IQR), 69.0 (48.1) ms; TV78l, 86.3 (60.5) ms; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10">Table 10</xref>) but a low burst incidence (TV77q, mean ± s.d., 1.5 ± 1.2 Hz; TV78l, 1.8 ± 1.2 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). These two additional cells, which were SATB1 +but PV‒, projected via the fimbria and innervated the dentate gyrus and CA3 (data not shown). Another group of neurons, the Teevra cells, which target CA3 but not the dentate gyrus, are the most rhythmic neurons of the MSDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joshi et al., 2017</xref>), and thus had a high mean burst incidence (range LM 2.0–7.2 Hz and IM 1.1–5.8 Hz, n = 13 identified cells). However, in contrast to orchid cells, Teevra cells mostly exhibited short duration bursts during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joshi et al., 2017</xref>) and preferentially fired at the <italic>trough</italic> of theta oscillations (group mean phase: identified orchid cells, 178.6°± 39.1°, n = 8; identified Teevra cells, 37.5°± 53.5°, n = 13; difference = 141.1°; p=0.0388; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Overall, no terminals of any of these septo-hippocampal neurons (n = 15 neurons) were observed in extra-hippocampal regions, indicating the reliability of our prediction of orchid cell firing characteristics.</p><table-wrap id="table8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34395.023</object-id><label>Table 8.</label><caption><title>Behavior-dependent firing patterns of putative orchid cells.</title><p>*Labeled soma observed in the dorsal MS; only a faint projection axon was recovered. **Destroyed soma observed in the dorsal MS; no axon was recovered.

In contrast, once locomotion was initiated, the interval between the bursts changed significantly, revealing the striking shorter rhythmic bursting pattern (group median inter-burst interval (and IQR) during LM = 157.8 (42.7) ms, during IM = 198.1 (69.7) ms, n = 16 neurons, p&lt;0.0001, Sign test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5a,g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8">8</xref>).

However, orchid cells project to extra-hippocampal areas, which may differ in the temporal dynamics of population activity. Orchid cell terminals were located in the caudo-dorsal EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), but multi-unit and LFP recordings from rodent EC are typically made in regions of the EC that facilitate their delineation into ‘medial’ and ‘lateral’ divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Igarashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mizuseki et al., 2009</xref>). In order to compare the relationships of LFPs directly, we targeted the EC and CA1d of mice with glass electrodes and recorded LFPs simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b–d</xref>). The most accurate way to identify LFP recording sites is by visualizing neurons, hence, we juxtacellularly labeled individual principal cells and/or interneurons at specific depths. <italic>Post hoc</italic> recovery of the labeled neurons revealed that recording sites were in the deep layers of the caudo-dorsal EC in 4 of 8 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–d</xref>). The other four mice had labeled neurons outside the EC; these animals were excluded from analysis. During locomotion, theta oscillations dominated both CA1d and caudo-dorsal EC LFPs, with theta cycles in phase as in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mizuseki et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,c,e</xref>). Accordingly, EC theta cycle troughs were significantly coupled to CA1d theta cycle troughs (p&lt;0.001 for n = 4 mice (two sites per animal), Rayleigh test; circular mean ±circular s.d., 10.5 ± 15.8°, n = 4 mice (mean of 2 sites per animal); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). During immobility, irregular LFP dynamics in the two structures showed similar activity, but the EC LFP lacked high-power ripples during hippocampal sharp waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1996</xref>). Medial septal neuron firing rate distributions during SWRs were different from a Poisson distribution (n = 4/4 orchid cells from four mice and n = 5 putative orchid cells from four mice; all p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9">9</xref>), with 4/9 neurons reducing their firing rate during SWRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d,g–i</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borhegyi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dragoi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Varga et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, a transient firing rate increase was observed after ripples, which accounted for some of the bursts that were &gt;200 ms in duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a,b,d,g</xref>).

The cellular organization of these circuits may be more diverse than previously anticipated, as we reveal by extracellular recording and selective targeting of neurons with particular firing patterns for labeling. Our observation of exclusively extra-hippocampal projecting GABAergic medial septal orchid cells innervating the caudo-dorsal EC reveals a specialized pathway that directly modulates extra-hippocampal circuits while bypassing the hippocampus.</p><p>We found the population of PV+/SATB1+/mGluR1a+ neurons within the MSDB to be relatively small, but the viral tracing revealed that a proportion of these innervated the EC, including those within the rostro-dorsal MS. It remains to be determined what other kinds of MSDB neurons apart from GABAergic orchid cells express these three markers. Orchid cells may correspond to the ‘constitutively bursting’ PV+ neurons with long burst durations and high intraburst frequencies identified in urethane-anesthetized rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borhegyi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Simon et al., 2006</xref>) (see also Type 1A cells in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaztelu and Buño, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">King et al., 1998</xref>]). Like orchid cells, neurons reported by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borhegyi et al., 2004</xref>) had local axon collaterals, which were proposed to inhibit theta-trough firing MSDB neurons, but both the theta-trough and theta-peak firing MSDB neurons were hypothesized to project the hippocampus, in contrast to orchid cells. In awake mice, four major clusters of highly rhythmic medial septal neurons have recently been defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joshi et al., 2017</xref>). The Teevra cell cluster had short burst durations during locomotion and did not significantly change their mean firing rate between locomotion and rest periods, whereas the Komal cell cluster had long burst durations and increased their firing during locomotion compared to rest periods. Juxtacellular labeling of Teevra cells revealed that they targeted CA3 but no extra-hippocampal areas. These CA3-projecting neurons preferentially fired at the trough of CA1d theta oscillations. Komal cells were not labeled but most preferentially fired around the peak of CA1d theta oscillations. In contrast to Teevra cells, rhythmically bursting orchid cells, reported here, increase firing during locomotion, have long duration bursts, fire preferentially at the peak of CA1d theta oscillations, and innervate the PrSd and EC. Thus, orchid cells represent a distinct subpopulation of Komal cells defined by their theta phase firing preferences and synaptic target regions. The other subpopulation of Komal cells that preferentially fire at the theta trough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joshi et al., 2017</xref>) remain to be defined using juxtacellular labeling in awake animals, as we have focussed on theta peak firing cells for the very difficult labeling experiments in the present study.</p><p>The sites of cortical axon terminations of orchid cells reflect well the major projections arising specifically from the PrSd that terminate in both the RSg and caudo-dorsal EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">van Groen and Wyss, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vann et al., 2009</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, most in vivo recordings within the EC have been localized to the well-characterized regions of medial and/or lateral EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgalossi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deshmukh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Igarashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ray et al., 2017</xref>), thus the caudo-dorsal EC remains to be defined in terms of its firing pattern repertoire. However, it is expected that any grid cells in this region would have tighter grid cell spacing compared to more ventral regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>). Parts of the lateral EC show weaker theta power in the LFP compared to medial EC in rats, along with lateral EC neurons displaying weaker theta modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deshmukh et al., 2010</xref>). Based on the medial septal input revealed here, we predict that the caudo-dorsal EC contains interneurons and principal cells with strong theta and gamma modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beed et al., 2013</xref>). The shared cortical target regions of single orchid cells demonstrate that orchid cells provide strong GABAergic input to presubicular, retrosplenial, and entorhinal interneurons at the peak of CA1d/EC theta cycles during locomotion, and at the peak of slower (&lt;5 Hz) cortical activity during immobility. Such multi-area innervation is likely to support the firing dynamics of spatially-modulated neurons, including grid cells, which lose their spatial periodicity upon MS inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandon et al., 2013</xref>). Encoding of information takes place preferentially at the theta peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Manns et al., 2007</xref>), coincident with the preferential firing of layer 3 EC principal neurons that project to CA1d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mizuseki et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, disinhibition of EC glutamatergic neurons by orchid cells around the theta peak may facilitate the transfer of temporal sequences relating to navigation to the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koenig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schlesiger et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Principal cell assemblies are synchronized over a 25 ms time scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harris et al., 2003</xref>), which matches the membrane time constant of hippocampal pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Spruston and Johnston, 1992</xref>) and is within the range of gamma oscillations. Orchid cells were able to couple their firing to CA1d mid-gamma frequency oscillations, which originate in the EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schomburg et al., 2014</xref>) where orchid cell terminals are located. One potential source of gamma and ripple modulation in the MS is directly from GABAergic hippocampo-septal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jinno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">TothTóth et al., 1993</xref>). The degree of coupling by individual orchid cells to mid-gamma oscillations (from lack of coupling to strong coupling) may depend on the level of habituation/training of the animal. During each theta cycle, orchid cells may coordinate the firing of principal cell assemblies in ‘upstream’ (PrSd) and ‘downstream’ (RSg, EC) regions via the phasic modulation of innervated GABAergic interneurons. We present two main hypotheses. (1) During the peak of the CA1d theta cycle, theta-peak firing orchid cells could inhibit target interneurons that preferentially fire during the trough of theta, leading to disinhibition of principal cells around the theta peak, including EC principal neurons projecting to CA1. This is counter-phased by the theta-trough firing Teevra cells and their theta-peak firing CA3 axo-axonic cell target interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joshi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Viney et al., 2013</xref>), leading to disinhibition of CA3 pyramidal neurons on the descending phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mizuseki et al., 2009</xref>), which project to CA1. (2) Alternatively or in addition, orchid cells could target theta-peak firing cortical interneurons that are modulated at mid-gamma frequency, leading to mid-gamma modulation of PrSd and EC principal cells around the peak of theta cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Manns et al., 2007</xref>). This extra-hippocampal pathway may contribute to the synchronization of inter-areal cortico-cortical loops via theta-nested gamma frequency rhythmic inhibition of cortical GABAergic circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeffery et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Such a population rhythm could then be relayed to the hippocampus from the EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chrobak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Igarashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mizuseki et al., 2009</xref>). A similar temporal coordination with a wider temporal window may exist during quiescent periods, when theta power is lower and the intraburst frequency of orchid cells decreases.</p><p>Orchid cells may also coordinate SWRs. Ripples also occur downstream of CA1 within deep layers of the PrS and EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1996</xref>), the target regions of orchid cells. Since ipsilateral entorhinal ripples occur 5–30 ms after CA1d ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1996</xref>), it is possible that the increase in firing of orchid cells following CA1d SWRs coordinates the offline replay/recall of spatial memory traces within extra-hippocampal areas; most SWRs were probably ‘awake’ SWRs under our conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roumis and Frank, 2015</xref>). Different levels of arousal may account for differences in firing rates during SWRs.</p><p>Cortical target interneurons of orchid cells included PV+ and nNOS+ neurons. Most cortical PV+ neurons are considered to be ‘fast spiking’ basket and axo-axonic cells, and display rhythmic modulation at theta frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Preston-Ferrer et al., 2016</xref>). In the PrSd, some PV+ neurons are immunopositive for nNOS, which is also expressed by other interneuronal types. The in vivo firing patterns of interneurons in FC, PrSd, and RSg are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Henriksen et al., 2010</xref>) except for ‘theta’ cells recorded in the vicinity of PrSd head direction cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Preston-Ferrer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Taube et al., 1990</xref>). ‘Fast spiking’ neurons have also been recorded in more caudal regions of PrS but do not show strong theta modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tukker et al., 2015</xref>). Visualization of interneuron axon terminals is required to define their target cortical layers as well as their target subcellular domains on postsynaptic principal cells. Based on the high density of GABAergic MSDB terminals around somata and dendrites of PV+ cells in PrSd, we hypothesize that postsynaptic targets of orchid cells will be strongly theta modulated, supporting the rhythmic coordination of pyramidal cell assemblies. The occasional bursts spanning two theta cycles may be responsible for the ‘theta cycle skipping’ observed in some EC interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandon et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In summary, orchid cells provide a specialized source of subcortical GABAergic input to specific extra-hippocampal regions that are functionally-related and converge to the caudo-dorsal EC. Their movement-related theta-rhythmic burst firing, and similarly strong rhythmic bursting during immobility, likely serve as a mechanism - via target interneurons - for the temporal coordination of cortico-cortical neurons. These cortico-cortical principal neurons project from ‘upstream’ areas (PrSd) to ‘downstream’ areas (RSg, EC) forming transient, gamma-timescale assemblies involved in mnemonic processes representing sequential information, such as routes of navigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Surgical procedures</title><p>All procedures involving experimental animals were approved by the Department of Pharmacology Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body under approved personal and project licenses in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 (UK) and associated regulations.

Membrane-bound expression of ChR2-EYFP from the AAV is dependent on the expression of Cre from PRV-hSyn-Cre within the same neurons. Both viruses were pressure-injected using glass pipettes (tip diameter: 12–20 µm) attached to 1 µl syringes at a rate of ~50 nl/min. Accordingly, we injected 400 nl of AAV into the MSDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Unal et al., 2015</xref>), and 200–400 nl of PRV-hSyn-Cre into the caudo-dorsal EC (200 nl/site in MS60, TV89; 250 nl/site in MS61, TV95; 300 nl/site in TV96, TV102; 400 nl/site in MS66, MS76, MS77, MS78). Mice were perfuse-fixed 14–30 days after injections in order to ensure axonal transport of both viruses.

Animals AJ44 and AJ50 were trained to run on the circular treadmill for 7–10 d before the craniotomy. Two separate glass electrodes filled with 2.5–3.0% neurobiotin (wt/vol) in 0.5 M NaCl (10–18 MΩ) were advanced into the brain with micromanipulators (IVM-1000, Scientifica Ltd, Maidenhead, UK), targeting CA1d at a 10° postero-anterior angle (sometimes filled only with 0.5 M NaCl), and the midline dorsal MS (0° angle, near or directly through the sagittal sinus). For EC recordings, a 0° angle was used in 7 of 8 mice. In one mouse (TV92), a 10° anterior to posterior angle was used; this mouse also had a craniotomy over the MS. All signals were amplified x1,000 (ELC-01MX, BF-48DGX and DPA-2FS modules, NPI Electronic). Both wideband (0.3 Hz to 10 kHz) and band-pass filtered (action potentials, 0.8–5 kHz; LFPs, 0.3–500 Hz) signals were acquired in parallel and digitized at 20 kHz (Power1401, Cambridge Electronic Design). HumBugs (Digitimer) were used to remove 50 Hz noise. A video camera was used to monitor behavior, and wheel movement and speed were recorded using an Arduino (see below and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7">Table 7</xref>). In some experiments, an accelerometer was placed on the wheel to detect wheel movement, and in one experiment (animal TV58) an electromyogram (EMG) was used to help detect movement of the animal (from the neck muscle). Data were recorded in Spike2 software (CED). Extracellularly recorded cells in the MSDB were juxtacellularly labeled using 200 ms current pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pinault, 1996</xref>) followed by a 4–8 hr recovery period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

A total of 16 animals were used for analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7">Table 7</xref>). Two other animals containing MS neurons with axon projecting to the EC were excluded because the axons could not be matched to a recorded neuron. Selection of MSDB neurons for recording was initially random. After recovery of the first three neurons with EC-projecting axons (TV50a, TV58g, MS14i), subsequent experiments were biased towards targeting neurons in the MS that had similar rhythmic bursting firing patterns to these three neurons; most other neurons were bypassed. Therefore, other kinds of EC-projecting GABAergic neurons may not have been recorded. Animals with recorded neurons projecting to other parts of the temporal cortex and with firing patterns that differ from orchid cells will be reported in detail in planned future studies.

Specificity information for primary antibodies is in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11">Table 11</xref>. To test the immunoreactivity of multiple markers on the same neurons (e.g. on postsynaptic targets of septo-cortical neurons), we employed an iterative strategy based on area-dependent marker frequency, subcellular localization, colocalization probability, antibody species, and fluorophore. Typically, we tested rare markers first, along with non-cytoplasmic markers (e.g. nucleus or cell membrane) to maximize the available subcellular domains for testing. Multiple fluorescence channel immunoreactivity was documented with epifluorescence or confocal microscopy (see below) followed by demounting the sections, washing in TBS or TBS-Tx, and repeating the procedure with different antibodies. Cytoplasmic markers, such as calcium binding proteins, were often tested last. In each round of immunohistochemistry, ‘negative’ controls were included that lacked the primary antibodies, along with ‘positive’ controls from a different brain that included the primary antibodies. In the next round of immunohistochemistry, the previous positive controls became new ‘negative’ controls by lacking the new primary antibodies. Thus, the number of control sections increased with each round of processing, and each control was compared to the test section, along with a comparison of images acquired in the same location before and after each round of immunohistochemistry. Undetectable immunoreactivity within the neuron for a given fluorescence channel was excluded for that particular round if no new signals were present in the vicinity of the neuron of interest. A rare marker recognized by a particular primary antibody was tested first if the antibody was raised in the same species as a primary antibody for a common marker to avoid saturation by binding to the existing secondary antibody.</p><table-wrap id="table11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34395.030</object-id><label>Table 11.</label><caption><title>Specificity information for primary antibodies.</title><p>Rb, rabbit; Gt, goat; Ms, mouse; Gp, guinea pig; Ck, chicken.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Molecule</th><th valign="bottom">Host</th><th valign="bottom">Dilution</th><th valign="bottom">Source</th><th valign="bottom">Specificity information</th><th valign="top">RRID</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Calbindin (CB)</td><td valign="bottom">Rb</td><td valign="bottom">1:5000</td><td valign="bottom">Swant, CB-38 (lot 5.5)</td><td valign="bottom">Supplementary Table 2 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Viney et al., 2013</xref>)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2721225">AB_2721225</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Calretinin (CR)</td><td valign="bottom">Rb</td><td valign="bottom">1:500-1:1000</td><td valign="bottom">Swant, 7699/3 hr (lot 18299)</td><td valign="bottom">Supplementary Table 2 in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Viney et al., 2013</xref>)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10000321">AB_10000321</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Calretinin (CR)</td><td valign="bottom">Gt</td><td valign="bottom">1:1000</td><td valign="bottom">Swant, CG1</td><td valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Unal et al., 2015</xref>)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10000342">AB_10000342</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)</td><td valign="bottom">Gt</td><td valign="bottom">1:500</td><td valign="bottom">Chemicon, AB144P</td><td valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Unal et al., 2015</xref>)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2079751">AB_2079751</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">GFP</td><td valign="bottom">Ck</td><td valign="bottom">1:500</td><td valign="bottom">Aves Labs, GFP-1020</td><td valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Unal et al., 2015</xref>)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10000240">AB_10000240</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1a (mGluR1a)</td><td valign="bottom">Gp</td><td valign="bottom">1:500-1:1000</td><td valign="bottom">Frontier Institute, mGluR1a-GP-Af660</td><td valign="bottom">Characterized by Tanaka et al. 2000 <italic>Eur.

The upper part of superficial stratum pyramidale consisted of both positive and negative sharp waves. In stratum pyramidale, pyramidal cells were often recorded. In one case (animal TV58), a hippocampal neuron weakly labeled at the recording site was used as confirmation. In addition to polarity of the SWRs, in three cases (AJ44j, AJ50h, AJ50j), mid gamma (55–80 Hz; detection threshold:&gt;1 s.d. above the mean cycle amplitude) coupling to the peak of theta oscillatory activity was also used to estimate the location of LFP recording in stratum pyramidale.

For cell MS74b, theta (and gamma, below) was detected from an electroencephalogram (EEG) at 2.10 mm posterior and −2.50 mm lateral of Bregma, which was coherent with CA1d strata oriens/pyramidale. Theta phase was calculated by linear interpolation between troughs of the band-pass filtered theta oscillations, with 0° and 360° set as the troughs. The Rayleigh test was used to test for uniformity of circular phase distributions. Mean phase and mean vector length were used as measures of the preferred phase and coupling strength, respectively, both for the spike-theta and gamma troughs-theta coupling. Mid-gamma (55–80 Hz) troughs were detected from the CA1d LFP for the entire recording period (detection threshold:&gt;1 s.d. above the mean cycle amplitude), with most gamma troughs detected during movement-related theta oscillations. If cross-frequency coupling was observed (gamma troughs coupled to theta peak), spike coupling was measured for gamma cycles as described for theta above. The troughs of EC theta cycles (detected from the 5–12 Hz filtered EC LFP) were also tested for their coupling to CA1d theta oscillations, as described above.

Bursts were defined as a train of &gt;3 spikes with interspike intervals (ISIs) &lt; 40 ms. Burst incidence was defined by the total number of bursts in 1 s windows.

On the axle was a disc for an optical quadrature encoder, providing 2000 edges per revolution (sum of rising and fall edges of channels A and B). The optical encoder was connected to an Arduino Uno microcontroller running our own code, and outputting through a 12-bit 2-channel digital to an analogue converter (DAC). The Arduino program generated a counter for the wheel movement, the counter increasing every time the wheel made 1/2000th of a rotation in the forward-running direction, and decreasing for the backward direction. The output consisted of two signals, speed and movement period, 0 to +4 V, that were re-digitized by the Power1401 and recorded concurrently with electrophysiological signals in Spike2. The speed signal was calculated at 10 ms intervals, using the distance traveled by the wheel as recorded by the counter, divided by time elapsed since the last calculation. The values sent to the DAC were calibrated so that 1 V output signal represented a speed of 0.6912 m/s at the cylinder surface. The movement period signal was raised to 4 V when the counter increased by two compared to a value 10 ms earlier, and dropped to 0 V if the counter increased by less than 11 compared to a value taken 50 ms earlier.

Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation is being overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the rather long list of major essential revisions, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work.

The reviewers agreed that it is not possible to fully evaluate the significance of these findings until the data are presented more transparently and analyzed more thoroughly. Please find the specific concerns and requests of the reviewers outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A large part of the evidence for specificity of the projection to the EC comes from the experiment described in Figure 1. However, this experiment lacks adequate quantification. In particular, to support the claim that only sparse axons collaterals target the hippocampus, while labeling is found in other extra-hippocampal areas, a more rigorous analysis is required. Similarly, the statement that &quot;A subset were immunoreactive for vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT, Figure 1C)&quot; is anecdotal and requires proper quantification. For this experiment, it's also important to show where in the EC the axons terminate. For example, Fuchs et al. suggest that septal PV axons preferentially target layer II, whereas Gonzalez-Sulser et al., indicate axons are enriched in layers II-V.</p><p>2) It is unclear how many neurons (and animals) were recorded in total in order to identify the 8 labeled neurons reported. This should be clearly stated. It's also unclear how the 8 labeled neurons were selected. This should also be clearly stated. Were these the only neurons with axons projecting towards the EC, or were additional selection criteria applied? If this population matches the &quot;21% of the virally-labeled MS neurons&quot; (subsection “GABAergic orchid cells project to multiple extra-hippocampal regions”), then it should also make up about 20% of the recorded neurons that project to the EC, and a much smaller percentage of the total number of recorded neurons. If the percentage is much greater, or less, then what is the reason for this? This could substantially affect how one interprets the data.</p><p>3) The authors need to better explain to readers how the neurons that they have identified relate to previously identified populations of MS neurons. For example, in the passage in subsection “Medial septal neurons projecting to the entorhinal cortex”, the authors should explain why they tested for PV, mGlur1a, and SATB1 (e.g., what does SATB1 immunoreactivity indicate in the medial septum with regard to cell classification?). Also, the authors should clarify which cell groups correspond to cells that have been classified previously (as they do for &quot;Teevra cells&quot;) and which correspond to cells of unknown classification. Similarly, in subsection “Preferential synaptic targets of orchid cells”, the authors write, &quot;Targets in three regions…. Were SATB1+… but CCK-…&quot; They should explain what this means, if anything. Does this point toward a particular type of cell? Another example of this is in subsection “MSDB neurons immunopositive for PV and/or SATB1 and/or mGluR1a”, where the authors write, &quot;The largest group comprised PV-/SATB1+/mGluRa- neurons&quot;. What type of cells are these? Do they correspond to cells that have been reported previously?</p><p>4) With regard to Figure 2, the authors state that 5/8 neurons formed thin collaterals/terminals in deep layers of caudo-dorsal EC (subsection “Firing patterns of septo-entorhinal neurons”). What about the other 3 neurons?</p><p>5) The description of the dendrites of labeled MS neurons is anecdotal (subsection “GABAergic orchid cells project to multiple extra-hippocampal regions”). It would be strengthened by quantitative analysis and comparison to other populations of MS neurons.</p><p>6) The authors write, &quot;We determined the molecular profiles of 13 targeted cortical neurons and used electron microscopy to test the reliability of predicting synaptic connections from light microscopy&quot; (subsection “Preferential synaptic targets of orchid cells”). Please state from how many mice. This already seems a small number of representative neurons from which to draw a strong conclusion, and maybe even less so if from few mice.</p><p>7) The authors write, &quot;The axon showed target selectively, as nearby interneurons with different molecular profiles were not targeted&quot; (subsection “Preferential synaptic targets of orchid cells”). Again, proper quantification is needed here.</p><p>8) The introduction of 8 additional neurons in subsection “Behavioral and network state-dependent firing of orchid cells” raises additional questions that require clarification. What are the false positive and false negative rates for the preceding criteria? In other words, when these criteria are applied to all neurons with recovered axons (including those that have not been reported), how many meet the criteria and don't have EC projecting axons, and how many don't meet the criteria but do have EC projecting axons / other properties of 'orchid cells'?</p><p>9) In subsection “Behavioral and network state-dependent firing of orchid cells”, it is unclear what the authors meant in the following passage: &quot;The first peak was at 143.8[…] during locomotion[…] but occurred later during the other states&quot;. What exactly does &quot;the first peak&quot; refer to?</p><p>10) In subsection “Behavioral and network state-dependent firing of orchid cells”, what is meant by &quot;due to state-dependent features of the spike bursts&quot;?</p><p>11) The results described in subsection “Behavioral and network state-dependent firing of orchid cells” are not entirely clear. At one point, the authors refer to &quot;the identified CA3-projecting Teevra cells&quot;. Which ones? Do the authors mean the 2 cells that are mentioned in this subsection?</p><p>12) In the Materials and methods section, the authors write, &quot;γ power was also used to estimate the location of the LFP recording&quot;. How exactly?</p><p>13) In the Materials and methods section, the authors write, &quot;If cross-frequency coupling was observed&quot;. How was this defined?</p><p>14) In the Materials and methods section, the authors write, &quot;Inter-burst intervals were calculated by taking the timing of the first spike of each burst&quot;. This method explanation does not make sense.</p><p>15) The experiment described in Figure 6 (subsection “Relationship between entorhinal and hippocampal oscillations”) is quite confusing. It states that 1 pyramidal cell was recorded in EC to confirm the recording location – does this imply that the data reported is only from 1 mouse? When talking about MS firing rate distributions being non-Poisson, is this referring to 9/9 neurons from the same mouse? More generally, the point of these experiments is unclear. How do they go beyond similar experiments from the Buzsaki lab (e.g. Chrobak and Buzsaki, 1998; Mizuseki et al., 2009)?</p><p>16) The data in Figure 7 would be more useful if they could be more directly compared to the cell labeling data. For example, is the proportion of triple positive neurons similar to the proportion of 'orchid cells' in the total population of recorded MS neurons? And, can the data in Figure 1fFbe normalized to the total cell populations in Figure 7?</p><p>17) Overall the organization of the manuscript makes it harder to follow than it perhaps needs to be. For example, would it be clearer if when describing the labeled neurons if their anatomy and molecular markers were described first, and then the electrophysiology was built upon from this? At present, the manuscript jumps back and forth between anatomy and electrophysiology.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Shared rhythmic subcortical GABAergic input to the entorhinal cortex and presubiculum&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The primary concern with the previous submission, namely that insufficient details and quantification were provided regarding the characterized orchid cells, has been satisfactorily addressed.

When this manuscript is resubmitted, you should either consistently mark all changes that were made or submit a clean version of the manuscript.</p><p>1) In the Introduction, &quot;such as a place cell sequences&quot; should be &quot;such as place cell sequences&quot;.</p><p>2) In subsection “Medial septal neurons projecting to the entorhinal cortex”, add &quot;for PV, SATB1, and mGluR1&quot; after &quot;triple immunopositive&quot; to avoid confusion.</p><p>3) Insubsection “GABAergic orchid cells project to multiple extra-hippocampal regions”, the authors write, &quot;mid-γ oscillations were coupled to theta cycles preferentially at the theta peak (n = 7/8 neurons)&quot;. This is confusing because γ was not recorded intracellularly in this study. So, clarification is needed to explain why measurements are given with regard to numbers of neurons.</p><p>4) In subsection “Behavioral and network state-dependent firing of orchid cells”, &quot;different in rates&quot; should be &quot;different than rates&quot;.</p><p>5) In subsection “MSDB neurons immunopositive for PV and/or SATB1 and/or mGluR1a”, the authors use the word &quot;inhibited&quot;, but it would perhaps be better to use a different word choice because &quot;inhibited&quot; implies that IPSPs or IPSCs were actually measured.</p><p>6) In the Discussion section, the authors write, &quot;orchid cells represent a distinct subpopulation of Komal cells&quot;, but this seems incorrect because the authors stated that orchid cells fire at the theta peak and Komal cells fire at the theta trough.</p><p>7) In the Discussion section, the authors should add, &quot;in the present study&quot; at the end of the sentence for the purpose of clarity.</p><p>8) In the Materials and methods section, the authors should replace &quot;elsewhere&quot; with &quot;in planned future studies&quot;.</p><p>9) In the Materials and methods section”, &quot;remove&quot; should be &quot;removal&quot;.</p><p>10) In the Materials and methods section, providing more detail (i.e., the width of the wavelet) would be helpful.</p><p>11) In Table 2, it is unclear what the letters a-k mean.

To summarise these points, from 113 implanted mice (with typically 2-3 recording days per mouse comprising hundreds of single-neuron extracellular recordings during movement and rest behaviour) we recovered 10 medial septal neurons with EC-projecting axons, with 8 defined here as ‘orchid cells’. We have found other kinds of medial septal projection neurons, but the strongly labelled ones in our database are too few in number to recognise patterns and it will still take months to years to analyse them.</p><p>The 8 labelled EC-projecting neurons in this manuscript probably represent the most comprehensively defined group of subcortical neurons reported to date, since they not only have firing patterns that we recognised as different from another group of medial septal cells we reported recently (CA3-projecting Teevra cells; Joshi et al., 2017), but they also project to specific extra-hippocampal regions (mainly the dorsal presubiculum <italic>and</italic> caudo-dorsal entorhinal cortex).</p><p>These extra-hippocampal regions have been carefully studied in terms of their local circuits and corticocortical projections in behaving rodents (e.g. interneurons and principal cells, Tukker et al., 2015; Preston-Ferrer et al., 2016; Burgalossi et al., 2014; Schmidt-Hieber and Häusser, 2013; Boccara et al., 2010), neuroanatomy/electrophysiology (e.g. Ray et al., 2017; Insausti et al., 1997; Nassar et al., 2015) and in terms of their modulation by pathway-selective inputs (e.g. thalamocortical, Simonnet et al., 2017; medial septal GABAergic inputs, Fuchs et al., 2016; Gonzalez-Sulser et al., 2014;medial septal glutamatergic inputs, Justus et al., 2017). Our discovery and combined neuroanatomical/physiological definition of orchid cells advances the field by providing data on a specific group of subcortical neurons and circuits involved in cortical neuronal coordination, particularly theta and mid-γ frequency rhythmic activity, required for spatial navigation and mnemonic processes that involve extra-hippocampal circuits (e.g. Koenig et al., 2011; Jeffery et al., 1995; Brandon et al., 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A large part of the evidence for specificity of the projection to the EC comes from the experiment described in Figure 1. However, this experiment lacks adequate quantification. In particular, to support the claim that only sparse axons collaterals target the hippocampus, while labeling is found in other extra-hippocampal areas, a more rigorous analysis is required. Similarly, the statement that &quot;A subset were immunoreactive for vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT, Figure 1C)&quot; is anecdotal and requires proper quantification. For this experiment, it's also important to show where in the EC the axons terminate. For example, Fuchs et al. suggest that septal PV axons preferentially target layer II, whereas Gonzalez-Sulser et al. indicate axons are enriched in layers II-V.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified axon collaterals in the hippocampus/dentate gyrus and extra-hippocampal areas, which is now reported in the Results section and Materials and methods section:</p><p>“We quantified the distribution of axonal collaterals in hippocampal and extra-hippocampal cortical regions (n=3 mice; 3 sections per animal). The proportion of axonal branches in the dorsal presubiculum (PrSd) and granular retrosplenial cortex (RSg) (median: 37%; interquartile range (IQR): 34.3% – 47.2%) was substantially greater than in CA1, the dentate gyrus and the dorsal subiculum (SUBd) (median: 5%; IQR: 2.4% – 9%), where only rare axonal collaterals were observed (<italic>P</italic>=1.6 x 10<sup>-7</sup>, Kruskal-Wallis test)”.</p><p>We have also quantified immunoreactivity for VGAT in virally-labelled axons (details added to Materials and methods section) and now state in the Results section:</p><p>“Within the dorsal presubiculum (PrSd) and granular retrosplenial cortex (RSg), 71.0 ± 25.9% of EYFP+ axonal terminals (mean ± s.d, n = 1046/1416 counted terminals within 12 sampled areas from 3 mice) were immunoreactive for vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT, Figure 1C).”</p><p>We have now revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1 to show in both coronal and horizontal sections where the virally-labelled axons terminate in the EC (panels a and b). Gonzalez-Sulser et al., 2014 reported that ~42% of virally-labelled neurons from the mouse MS/(DB) projecting to the <italic>medial</italic> EC were GABAergic. We found a high proportion of VGAT-immunoreactive terminals in the PrSd and RSg from collaterals of axons projecting to the <italic>caudo-dorsal</italic> EC. Gonzalez-Sulser et al., found that PV was in a minority of the mEC-projecting neurons (&lt;10%). Thus, the enrichment they observed in layers II and V of mEC may represent mostly non-PV medial septal axons. Fuchs et al., 2016 showed that the PV+ subset of GABAergic MSDB axons target primarily layer II of mEC. The results on orchid cells complement these medial EC-related studies with a different approach, since we used retrograde labelling from the EC (PRV-hSyn-Cre) and anterograde Cre-dependent labelling in the MSDB (EYFP+) to restrict the population of labelled neurons to the injected caudo-dorsal EC and to find their collaterals en route to the EC. We now show in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 that axons projecting to the caudal EC terminate in multiple layers, including deep layers. PV+ neurons were 24.2% of the virally-labelled MSDB neurons (Figure 1F).</p><p>We have added the following to the Results section: “Virally labeled medial septal axons with extensive terminals were observed in all layers of the EC (n=4 mice, from 18 coronal or horizontal sections), with collaterals traveling both radially and horizontally (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B)” and have revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1 to show greater detail of medial septal terminals in the EC.</p><p>We also add the following to the Discussion section: “GABAergic MSDB neurons projecting to the medial EC preferentially innervate layers II and V (Gonzalez-Sulser et al., 2014a), and the small PV+ subpopulation of GABAergic MSDB neurons provides a preferential input to ‘fast spiking’ interneurons in layer II (Fuchs et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is unclear how many neurons (and animals) were recorded in total in order to identify the 8 labeled neurons reported. This should be clearly stated. It's also unclear how the 8 labeled neurons were selected. This should also be clearly stated. Were these the only neurons with axons projecting towards the EC, or were additional selection criteria applied? If this population matches the &quot;21% of the virally-labeled MS neurons&quot; (subsection “GABAergic orchid cells project to multiple extra-hippocampal regions”), then it should also make up about 20% of the recorded neurons that project to the EC, and a much smaller percentage of the total number of recorded neurons. If the percentage is much greater, or less, then what is the reason for this? This could substantially affect how one interprets the data.</p></disp-quote><p>113 mice were implanted with head plates and, in each recording session, several MS neurons were extracellularly recorded with glass electrodes. This was immediately followed by the challenging juxtacellular labelling attempt while the mouse was moving or resting. The above number of mice excludes animals with labelled CA3-projecting ‘Teevra’ neurons (Joshi et al., 2017). For the revised manuscript we recorded from an additional 7 mice in order to target the EC, giving a total of 120 head-plate implanted mice.</p><p>The first experiments with recovery of axon in EC (TV50a, TV58g, MS14i) enabled us to search for neurons with similar firing pattern signatures in all subsequent experiments (e.g. burst incidence and preferred theta phase). We therefore selectively targeted the kinds of neurons that were selected for juxtacellular labelling. Our criteria for selection were thus the firing patterns of the first 3 EC-projecting neurons (Table 1).</p><p>We have now added the following to subsection “in vivo extracellular recordings and juxtacellular labeling”: “Selection of MSDB neurons for recording was initially random. After recovery of the first 3 neurons with EC-projecting axons (TV50a, TV58g, MS14i), subsequent experiments were biased towards targeting neurons in the MS that had similar rhythmic bursting firing patterns to these 3 neurons; most other neurons were bypassed. Therefore, other kinds of EC-projecting GABAergic neurons may not have been recorded.”</p><p>EC-projecting neurons were difficult to target. From the 113 mice, we found only 2 other labelled EC-projecting neurons in addition to the 8 reported in the manuscript. These 2 neurons were excluded because the axon could not be matched to a recording from the multiple attempts in the same animal. Neuron ‘TV46i’ had similar firing patterns to the 8 reported cells (based only on a short recording time), and a projection axon in this animal faded close the EC; 1 collateral was observed in the presubiculum. However, other MS cells were labelled in this animal, so the recording could not unequivocally be matched to the axon. An axon in animal ‘MS98’ projected via a different route (ventral fimbria) to the EC but due to other recorded and labelled neurons in this animal, the axon could not be matched to one recording. Neurons projecting elsewhere in the cortex require further analysis which is very demanding. For most of the unreported labelled neurons, it was not possible to follow the axons to their target regions due to weak labelling. We have updated subsection “in vivo extracellular recordings and juxtacellular labeling” accordingly.</p><p>We have removed the sentence about the ‘matching 21% of virally-labelled MS neurons’ from the Results section and revised the Discussion section accordingly: “We found the population of PV+/SATB1+/mGluR1a+ neurons within the MSDB to be relatively small, but the viral tracing revealed that a proportion of these innervated the EC, including those within the rostro-dorsal MS. It remains to be determined what other kinds of MSDB neurons apart from GABAergic orchid cells express these 3 markers”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors need to better explain to readers how the neurons that they have identified relate to previously identified populations of MS neurons. For example, in the passage in subsection “Medial septal neurons projecting to the entorhinal cortex”, the authors should explain why they tested for PV, mGlur1a, and SATB1 (e.g., what does SATB1 immunoreactivity indicate in the medial septum with regard to cell classification?). Also, the authors should clarify which cell groups correspond to cells that have been classified previously (as they do for &quot;Teevra cells&quot;) and which correspond to cells of unknown classification. Similarly, in subsection “Preferential synaptic targets of orchid cells”, the authors write, &quot;Targets in three regions…. Were SATB1+… but CCK-…&quot; They should explain what this means, if anything. Does this point toward a particular type of cell? Another example of this is in subsection “MSDB neurons immunopositive for PV and/or SATB1 and/or mGluR1a”, where the authors write, &quot;The largest group comprised PV-/SATB1+/mGluRa- neurons&quot;. What type of cells are these? Do they correspond to cells that have been reported previously?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important point about neuronal identities and we have revised our statements for clarity. To our knowledge, there is no previous report on mGluR1a and SATB1 expression in different combinations with PV in the medial septum. Previous classification has been limited to PV+/PV- or GAD+/GAD- (e.g. Simon et al., 2006), and also HCN1 immunoreactivity along the somatodendritic membrane of PV+ and PV- medial septal neurons (Varga et al. 2008). But this latter classification did not lead to a definition of cell types since the axons were not recovered. We have reported SATB1 in some medial septal neurons in the rat (Viney et al., 2003) and provide other novel marker combinations of recorded and labelled neurons in Table 4. We have now revised the first part of the Results section:</p><p>“Neuronal subpopulations in the MSDB can be defined by the expression of different molecules (Wei et al., 2012), and combinational expression profiles help define distinct cell types (Viney et al., 2013). We observed that metabotropic glutamate receptor 1a (mGluR1a), along with the transcription factor SATB1 (Huang et al., 2011), show differential immunoreactivity with parvalbumin (PV). As in the cortex, PV neurons in the MSDB represent a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons, but PV is expressed by many different kinds of neurons (Simon et al., 2006; Varga et al., 2008; Viney et al., 2013). GABAergic Teevra neurons are immunopositive (+) for PV and SATB1 but lack detectable immunoreactivity (–) for mGluR1a (Joshi et al., 2017).”</p><p>To our knowledge, no cell types in the presubiculum have been previously defined using SATB1 as one of the markers. Based on data from developmental studies of cortical SATB1 expression, we have updated the Results (lines 191-196): “Targets in three regions (PSd, RSg and FC) were SATB1+ (n=13/13; Figure 4B,E), but CCK– (n=0/10) (Table 6). The identity of SATB1+ neurons in these regions remain to be determined by visualising the processes of the cells, and are likely to include both PV+ and somatostatin+ interneurons (Nassar et al., 2015), given that SATB1 is highly expressed within these subpopulations in the cortex (Close et al., 2012; Denaxa et al., 2012)”</p><p>PV-/SATB1+/mGluRa- neurons are also undefined in the MSDB, and future work will elucidate their identities. We have updated this part of the Results to take this into account (subsection “MSDB neurons immunopositive for PV and/or SATB1 and/or mGluR1a”): “Apart from PV+/SATB1+/mGluR1‒ CA3-projecting Teevra cells (Joshi et al., 2017) and PV+/SATB1+/mGluR1a+ EC-projecting orchid cells, the identities of neurons within the other groups remain to be determined.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) With regard to Figure 2, the authors state that 5/8 neurons formed thin collaterals/terminals in deep layers of caudo-dorsal EC (subsection “Firing patterns of septo-entorhinal neurons”). What about the other 3 neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added (in subsection “Firing patterns of septo-entorhinal neurons”): “The main axons of the other 3 neurons faded before collateralization in the EC due to insufficient labeling (Table 1)”. However, the firing patterns, molecular profiles and in one case the other collaterals (AJ50j, Table 1), were similar to the 5 neurons with confirmed terminations in EC, which are reported in the subsequent Results sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The description of the dendrites of labeled MS neurons is anecdotal (subsection “GABAergic orchid cells project to multiple extra-hippocampal regions”). It would be strengthened by quantitative analysis and comparison to other populations of MS neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have counted the number and direction of primary dendrites from 4 orchid cells and 4 Teevra cells and added the following to the Results section:</p><p>“Orchid cells had 6.0 ± 1.8 primary dendrites (mean ± s.d., n=4 cells) extending from all axes, which were similar to the distributions of CA3-projecting Teevra cell dendrites (Joshi et al., 2017) (χ2 = 0.02, <italic>P</italic> = 0.8817, n=4 orchid cells versus n = 4 Teevra cells).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors write, &quot;We determined the molecular profiles of 13 targeted cortical neurons and used electron microscopy to test the reliability of predicting synaptic connections from light microscopy&quot; (subsection “Preferential synaptic targets of orchid cells”). Please state from how many mice. This already seems a small number of representative neurons from which to draw a strong conclusion, and maybe even less so if from few mice.</p></disp-quote><p>The 13 identified synaptic junctions are on one neuron from 1 mouse (neuron TV58g, Table 6). We have updated this sentence accordingly. Analysis of the molecular profiles of targets was only possible for the most strongly labelled MS cell, since terminals were visible with fluorescence microscopy where targets could be tested with immunohistochemistry. Our previous data in rat and mouse CA3 and mouse retrosplenial cortex where we established that close apposition of medial septal GABAergic terminals using fluorescence microscopy predict with high confidence type II synaptic junctions with cortical interneurons (Joshi et al., 2017, Viney et al., 2013, Unal et al., 2015), supports our current predictions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors write, &quot;The axon showed target selectively, as nearby interneurons with different molecular profiles were not targeted&quot; (subsection “Preferential synaptic targets of orchid cells”). Again, proper quantification is needed here.</p></disp-quote><p>We succeeded in identifying 13 targeted interneuron somata, all of which were SATB1 immunopositive in their nuclei and 10/10 tested were CCK-immunonegative (Table 6 and Figure 4). Only a subpopulation of MGE-derived interneurons show SATB1 expression, thus these data suggest that ‘orchid cells’ selectively innervate this subpopulation of interneurons. Full characterisation of GABAergic interneurons in the presubiculum and entorhinal cortex awaits further studies possibly using transcriptomic data (now stated in the Results section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The introduction of 8 additional neurons in subsection “Behavioral and network state-dependent firing of orchid cells” raises additional questions that require clarification. What are the false positive and false negative rates for the preceding criteria? In other words, when these criteria are applied to all neurons with recovered axons (including those that have not been reported), how many meet the criteria and don't have EC projecting axons, and how many don't meet the criteria but do have EC projecting axons / other properties of 'orchid cells'?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these important points. We have not yet recovered any neuron with an ‘orchid cell’ firing pattern that targets other areas of the temporal cortex. Likewise, neurons with different firing patterns target other areas e.g. the two septo-hippocampal/dentate cells included for comparison (subsection “Behavioral and network state-dependent firing of orchid cells”). The CA3-projecting Teevra cells (Joshi et al., 2017) did not target the dentate gyrus or other areas outside the hippocampus and had quantitatively different firing patterns to orchid cells. We have also added this sentence to the Results section: “We did not observe any non-EC projecting MS neurons (e.g. septo-hippocampal neurons) that exhibited all 4 features of the reported orchid cells (data not shown).”</p><p>Indeed, further labelling experiments will likely reveal additional cell types. For example, since the submission of the paper, we recently recorded a strongly-labelled theta trough-firing neuron with long bursts, also PV+, that targeted the RSg and CA1 but not the EC (unpublished data). It will take many months to years to obtain more of these neurons with a selective labelling targeting strategy based on differential firing patterns, as they are rarely encountered.</p><p>We state in the Materials and methods section under “in vivo extracellular recordings and juxtacellular labeling” that “animals with recorded neurons projecting to other parts of the temporal cortex and with firing patterns that differ from orchid cells will be reported in detail elsewhere”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In subsection “Behavioral and network state-dependent firing of orchid cells”, it is unclear what the authors meant in the following passage: &quot;The first peak was at 143.8[…] during locomotion[…] but occurred later during the other states&quot;. What exactly does &quot;the first peak&quot; refer to?</p></disp-quote><p>The peak refers to the peak in each autocorrelogram (highest counts); we have updated the text to state this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In subsection “Behavioral and network state-dependent firing of orchid cells”, what is meant by &quot;due to state-dependent features of the spike bursts&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been changed to: “We hypothesized that this increase in mean firing rate during locomotion was due to changes in the spike burst properties”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The results described in subsection “Behavioral and network state-dependent firing of orchid cells” are not entirely clear. At one point, the authors refer to &quot;the identified CA3-projecting Teevra cells&quot;. Which ones? Do the authors mean the 2 cells that are mentioned in this subsection?</p></disp-quote><p>To assess the reliability of predicting axon terminations from firing patterns, we included 2 novel neurons that had long duration bursts like orchid cells but had a low burst incidence and projected selectively to the dentate gyrus and CA3. We also contrasted previously published Teevra cells, which project to CA3, but not the dentate gyrus (Joshi et al., 2017). We now state that the Teevra cells are ‘another group of neurons’ separate to the 2 additional (novel) neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) In the Materials and methods section, the authors write, &quot;γ power was also used to estimate the location of the LFP recording&quot;. How exactly?</p></disp-quote><p>We now explain in the Materials and methods section as follows: “In addition to polarity of the SWRs, in three cases (AJ44j, AJ50h, AJ50j), mid γ (55-80 Hz; detection threshold: &gt;1 s.d. above the mean cycle amplitude) coupling to the peak of theta oscillatory activity was also used to estimate the location of LFP recording in stratum pyramidale. Mid-γ (55 – 80 Hz) is coupled to the peak of CA1 pyramidale theta oscillatory activity (Colgin et al., 2009; Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2014; Schomburg et al., 2014).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) In the Materials and methods section, the authors write, &quot;If cross-frequency coupling was observed&quot;. How was this defined?</p></disp-quote><p>We used the Rayleigh test for uniformity of distribution between the troughs of γ and theta cycles to establish cross frequency coupling. Mean phase and mean vector length were used as measures of the preferred phase and coupling strength, respectively. We have now clarified the Materials and methods section as follows:</p><p>“Theta phase was calculated by linear interpolation between troughs of the band-pass filtered theta oscillations, with 0° and 360° set as the troughs. The Rayleigh test was used to test for uniformity of circular phase distributions. Mean phase and mean vector length were used as measures of the preferred phase and coupling strength, respectively, both for the spike-theta and γ troughs-theta coupling. Mid-γ (55-80 Hz) troughs were detected from the CA1d LFP for the entire recording period (detection threshold: &gt;1 s.d. above the mean cycle amplitude), with most γ troughs detected during movement-related theta oscillations. If cross-frequency coupling was observed (γ troughs coupled to theta peak), spike coupling was measured for γ cycles as described for theta above. Phase histograms were smoothed by convolving with a Gaussian.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) In the Materials and methods section, the authors write, &quot;Inter-burst intervals were calculated by taking the timing of the first spike of each burst&quot;. This method explanation does not make sense.</p></disp-quote><p>We now write: “Interburst intervals were calculated by measuring the time elapsed between the first spikes of consecutive bursts.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) The experiment described in Figure 6 (subsection “Relationship between entorhinal and hippocampal oscillations”) is quite confusing. It states that 1 pyramidal cell was recorded in EC to confirm the recording location – does this imply that the data reported is only from 1 mouse? When talking about MS firing rate distributions being non-Poisson, is this referring to 9/9 neurons from the same mouse? More generally, the point of these experiments is unclear. How do they go beyond similar experiments from the Buzsaki lab (e.g. Chrobak and Buzsaki, 1998; Mizuseki et al., 2009)?</p></disp-quote><p>Data from the Buzsaki lab are from rats, and it is difficult to directly compare published data of their recording locations within the EC to the site of medial septal orchid cell terminals within the mouse EC. We have now completed revised this part and provide an updated Figure 6 with additional data based on experiments with 7 more head-plate implanted mice. Our aim was to determine whether the rhythmic network activity that we measure in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell layer (our ‘reference LFP’) is similar to that at the site of orchid cell terminals, since orchid cells do not project to CA1. For all recordings we consistently use the CA1 LFP to analyse spike timing, because in CA1 we have a consistent comparison reference point in the pyramidal cell layer, particularly in relation to theta cycles.</p><p>In the revised subsection “Relationship between dorsal hippocampal and caudal entorhinal rhythmic activity”, we report that the caudo-dorsal EC, in mouse, has similar LFP rhythmic activity to CA1, based on the strong coupling of EC theta troughs to the troughs of CA1d theta troughs. This was achieved by recording LFPs from at least 2 sites within the caudo-dorsal EC simultaneously with CA1d strata pyramidale/oriens LFPs (Figure 6). The locations were accurately determined by juxtacellularly labelling principal neurons or interneurons and measuring the relative depth. These difficult experiments were successful in 4 mice; 4 other mice had neurons labelled outside the EC and were excluded from analysis. We have updated the Results section and Materials and methods section accordingly.</p><p>We have revised the part on MS neuron firing distributions around sharp-wave ripples to state that it includes n=4 orchid cells from 4 mice and n=5 putative orchid cells from 4 mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) The data in Figure 7 would be more useful if they could be more directly compared to the cell labeling data. For example, is the proportion of triple positive neurons similar to the proportion of 'orchid cells' in the total population of recorded MS neurons? And, can the data in Figure 1fFbe normalized to the total cell populations in Figure 7?</p></disp-quote><p>Our recording strategy was based on the location of the first three recovered ‘orchid’ cells in a limited to a part of the medial septum, whereas the stereological data characterises the entire MSDB in order to provide a baseline for all studies (now stated in Results section). At this stage, we do not yet know if the molecular profile of orchid cells, which is different from Teevra cells, may include other GABAergic neurons with different axonal target areas (stated in the Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Overall the organization of the manuscript makes it harder to follow than it perhaps needs to be. For example, would it be clearer if when describing the labeled neurons if their anatomy and molecular markers were described first, and then the electrophysiology was built upon from this? At present, the manuscript jumps back and forth between anatomy and electrophysiology.</p></disp-quote><p>We consider it important to show results of anatomical and electrophysiological analysis together because the data are obtained from the same neurons and we would like to emphasize the biological unity of the cells. We departed from this in the first and last figures that provide supporting evidence of the EC-projecting subpopulation of MSDB neurons. This is consistent with our previous efforts in rats e.g. reviewed in Somogyi et al., (2014).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) In the Introduction, &quot;such as a place cell sequences&quot; should be &quot;such as place cell sequences&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been revised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In subsection “Medial septal neurons projecting to the entorhinal cortex”, add &quot;for PV, SATB1, and mGluR1&quot; after &quot;triple immunopositive&quot; to avoid confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Revised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In subsection “GABAergic orchid cells project to multiple extra-hippocampal regions”, the authors write, &quot;mid-γ oscillations were coupled to theta cycles preferentially at the theta peak (n = 7/8 neurons)&quot;. This is confusing because γ was not recorded intracellularly in this study. So, clarification is needed to explain why measurements are given with regard to numbers of neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed to: “As expected, mid-γ oscillations were coupled to theta cycles preferentially at the theta peak (detected from CA1d LFPs of n=7/8 animals with recorded septo-entorhinal neurons, Figure 2G).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In subsection “Behavioral and network state-dependent firing of orchid cells”, &quot;different in rates&quot; should be &quot;different than rates&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence now reads: “In addition to behavioral state-dependent differences in rhythmic firing, the mean firing rates of orchid cells during locomotion were different than rates during immobility”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In subsection “MSDB neurons immunopositive for PV and/or SATB1 and/or mGluR1a”, the authors use the word &quot;inhibited&quot;, but it would perhaps be better to use a different word choice because &quot;inhibited&quot; implies that IPSPs or IPSCs were actually measured.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed to: “with 4/9 neurons reducing their firing rate during SWRs”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the Discussion section, the authors write, &quot;orchid cells represent a distinct subpopulation of Komal cells&quot;, but this seems incorrect because the authors stated that orchid cells fire at the theta peak and Komal cells fire at the theta trough.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Editors for this crucial point. Teevra and Komal cell groups were clustered independently of preferred theta phase. Most Komal cells fire at the peak of CA1d theta oscillations, but there is a subpopulation that fire at the theta trough (Figure 1D in Joshi et al., 2017). Komal cells were not labelled in the Joshi et al., 2017 study. We now write:</p><p>“Juxtacellular labeling of Teevra cells revealed that they targeted CA3 but no extra-hippocampal areas. These CA3-projecting neurons preferentially fired at the trough of CA1d theta oscillations. Komal cells were not labeled but most preferentially fired around the peak of CA1d theta oscillations. In contrast to Teevra cells, rhythmically bursting orchid cells, reported here, increase firing during locomotion, have long duration bursts, fire preferentially at the peak of CA1d theta oscillations, and innervate the PrSd and EC. Thus, orchid cells represent a distinct subpopulation of Komal cells defined by their theta phase firing preferences and synaptic target regions. The other subpopulation of Komal cells that preferentially fire at the theta trough (Joshi et al., 2017) remain to be defined using juxtacellular labeling in awake animals, as we have focused on theta peak firing cells for the very difficult labeling experiments in the present study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In the Discussion section, the authors should add, &quot;in the present study&quot; at the end of the sentence for the purpose of clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now written: “as we have focused on theta peak firing cells for the very difficult labeling experiments in the present study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In the Materials and methods section, the authors should replace &quot;elsewhere&quot; with &quot;in planned future studies&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Now revised as: “Animals with recorded neurons projecting to other parts of the temporal cortex and with firing patterns that differ from orchid cells will be reported in detail in planned future studies”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In the Materials and methods section”, &quot;remove&quot; should be &quot;removal&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Revised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In the Materials and methods section, providing more detail (i.e., the width of the wavelet) would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide further details: “Time-frequency plots (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) used the ContinuousWaveletTransform in Mathematica (Morlet wavelet, 1 kHz sampling rate, 12 octaves, 16 voices).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In Table 2, it is unclear what the letters a-k mean.
