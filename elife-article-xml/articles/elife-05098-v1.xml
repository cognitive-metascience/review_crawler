study human development and disease. Here, we report the step-wise differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) (embryonic and induced) into lung organoids. By manipulating developmental signaling pathways hPSCs generate ventral-anterior foregut spheroids, which are then expanded into human lung organoids (HLOs). HLOs consist of epithelial and mesenchymal compartments of the lung, organized with structural features similar to the native lung. HLOs possess upper airway-like epithelium with basal cells and immature ciliated cells surrounded by smooth muscle and myofibroblasts as well as an alveolar-like domain with appropriate cell types. Using RNA-sequencing, we show that HLOs are remarkably similar to human fetal lung based on global transcriptional profiles, suggesting that HLOs are an excellent model to study human lung development, maturation and disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05098.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05098.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05098.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cell behavior has traditionally been studied in the lab in two-dimensional situations, where cells are grown in thin layers on cell-culture dishes. However, most cells in the body exist in a three-dimensional environment as part of complex tissues and organs, and so researchers have been attempting to re-create these environments in the lab. To date, several such âorganoidsâ have been successfully generated, including models of the human intestine, stomach, brain and liver. These organoids can mimic the responses of real tissues and can be used to investigate how organs form, change with disease, and how they might respond to potential therapies.</p><p>Here, Dye et al. developed a new three-dimensional model of the human lung by coaxing human stem cells to become specific types of cells that then formed complex tissues in a petri dish. To make these lung organoids, Dye et al. manipulated several of the signaling pathways that control the formation of organs during the development of animal embryos. First, the stem cells were instructed to form a type of tissue called endoderm, which is found in early embryos and gives rise to the lung, liver and other several other internal organs.</p><p>Then, Dye et al. activated two important developmental pathways that are known to make endoderm form three-dimensional intestinal tissue. However, by inhibiting two other key developmental pathways at the same time, the endoderm became tissue that resembles the early lung found in embryos instead.</p><p>This early lung-like tissue formed three-dimensional spherical structures as it developed. The next challenge was to make these structures develop into lung tissue. Dye et al. worked out a method to do this, which involved exposing the cells to additional proteins that are involved in lung development. The resulting lung organoids survived in laboratory cultures for over 100 days and developed into well-organized structures that contain many of the types of cells found in the lung.</p><p>Further analysis revealed the gene activity in the lung organoids resembles that of the lung of a developing human fetus, suggesting that lung organoids grown in the dish are not fully mature. Dye et al.'s findings provide a new approach for creating human lung organoids in culture that may open up new avenues for investigating lung development and diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05098.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05098.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>pluripotent stem cell</kwd><kwd>organoid</kwd><kwd>endoderm</kwd><kwd>lung</kwd><kwd>foregut</kwd><kwd>spheroid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBLI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21HL115372</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spence</surname><given-names>Jason R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000912</institution-id><institution>March of Dimes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap> </funding-source><award-id>Basil O'Connor starter scholar award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spence</surname><given-names>Jason R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01DK091415</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spence</surname><given-names>Jason R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBLI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL119215</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spence</surname><given-names>Jason R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Directed differentiation of stem cells can generate ventral-anterior foregut spheroids that can expand into three-dimensional lung organoids with striking structural, cellular and molecular similarities to the human fetal lung.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Several reports have demonstrated that directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), which include embryonic (hESCs) and induced (iPSCs) stem cells, is one of the most efficient approaches to achieving differentiation of a cell or tissue of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D'Amour et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kroon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Si-Tayeb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spence et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wong et al., 2012</xref>). Using this approach, differentiation of hPSCs into lung lineages has been achieved using diverse methodology with varying degrees of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kadzik and Morrisey, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Longmire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghaedi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Firth et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Thus far, the majority of efforts to differentiate lung lineages from hPSCs have focused on using 2-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultures. Several recent advances in generating 3-dimensional (3D) organ-like tissues, called âorganoidsâ, have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spence et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Takebe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCracken et al., 2014</xref>). Such 3D models offer several advantages; they often possess structural organization similar to the native organ, cell types from multiple germ layers (for example, mesoderm and endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spence et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCracken et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wells and Spence, 2014</xref>), and multiple cellular lineages, making them a physiologically complex model to study developmental processes, tissue homeostasis and pathological conditions in vitro.</p><p>Previous work has demonstrated that activation of FGF and WNT signaling synergistically drives CDX2+ intestinal lineage commitment in hPSC-derived endoderm and also drives âmorphogenesis in a dishâ, where the 2D tissues self-organize into 3D spheroids comprised of mesenchymal and polarized epithelial layers that detach from the adherent cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spence et al., 2011</xref>). It has also been demonstrated that inhibition of BMP and TGFÎ² signaling is able to drive tissue into a SOX2+ foregut lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Green et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCracken et al., 2014</xref>). Building on these previous studies, we show that simultaneous stimulation of WNT and FGF signaling while inhibiting BMP/TGFÎ² signaling pathways in hPSC-derived endoderm cultures prevents intestinal lineage commitment, and instead, favors a SOX2+ anterior foregut fate while also robustly generating SOX2+ anterior foregut 3D spheroid structures.</p><p>In order to further restrict foregut spheroids to the lung lineage, the current study focused on manipulating FGF and HH signaling. In the mouse, high levels of Fgf signaling have been shown to induce Shh expression in the lung endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hebrok et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morrisey and Hogan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rankin and Zorn, 2014</xref>) which is accompanied by induction of the Nkx2.1+ lung progenitor field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hebrok et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Serls, 2004</xref>). Shh then signals from the endoderm to the mesoderm, and mutations in <italic>Shh, Gli2</italic> or <italic>Gli3</italic> lead to perturbed lung development, with <italic>Gli2/Gli3</italic> double knockout mice showing lung agenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellusci et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Motoyama et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2004</xref>). Our results demonstrate that FGF2 induces NKX2.1, PAX8, and SHH in human foregut endoderm cultures. By using pharmacological inhibitors of FGF and HH signaling we demonstrate that SHH is required for NKX2.1 expression downstream of FGF2, and that FGF2 also induces PAX8 independently of HH signaling. These observations suggest a paradigm where FGF<sup>Lo</sup>/HH<sup>Hi</sup> conditions preferentially induce PAX8<sup>Lo</sup>/NKX2.1<sup>Hi</sup> lung progenitors and FGF<sup>Hi</sup>/HH<sup>Lo</sup> conditions favor a PAX8<sup>Hi</sup>/NKX2.1<sup>Lo</sup> fate. Given that Pax8 is required for thyroid development, we focused on defining the most robust conditions to induce NKX2.1 while minimizing PAX8 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kimura et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mansouri et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yuan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vilain et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kusakabe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">CarrÃ© et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Narumi et al., 2012</xref>). By applying HH<sup>Hi</sup> conditions during generation of foregut spheroids we were able to enhance NKX2.1 expression in foregut spheroids and subsequently expand spheroids in media containing FGF10, allowing them to grow into organoids. Organoids persisted in culture for over 100 days and developed well-organized proximal-like airway epithelial structures that included many cell types found in the proximal lung epithelium, including basal and ciliated cells along with rare club cells. Moreover, proximal airway structures were often surrounded by smooth muscle actin (SMA) positive mesenchymal tissue. Organoids also possessed distal-like epithelial cells that co-expressed progenitor markers, SFTPC/SOX9 and HOPX/SOX9, consistent with early bipotent alveolar progenitor cells seen in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Desai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Treutlein et al., 2014</xref>). To support the idea that organoids may be more similar to a developing lung with abundant progenitor cells, we used RNA-sequencing to compare the global transcriptional profile of organoids to the human fetal and adult lung, undifferentiated hESCs and definitive endoderm. Principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering and Spearman's correlation all show that organoids have striking similarity to the human fetal lung.</p><p>Taken together, our data demonstrates an efficient and robust in vitro system to generate complex, 3D human lung organoids that are immature/fetal in nature. We anticipate that this model will serve as an unparalleled model for the study of human lung development, maturation and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Differentiation of hPSCs into anterior foregut spheroids</title><p>We and others have reported efficient induction of human endoderm using ActivinA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D'Amour et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spence et al., 2011</xref>), and a further lineage restriction into SOX2+ anterior foregut endoderm using inhibition of BMP and TGFÎ² signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Green et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loh et al., 2014</xref>). We have recently demonstrated that inhibition of BMP signaling during intestinal lineage induction with WNT and FGF ligands is sufficient to inhibit intestinal CDX2 and induce SOX2+ posterior foregut spheroids capable of giving rise to human gastric (antral) organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCracken et al., 2014</xref>). Given that the lung is derived from the anterior foregut, we sought to define conditions to generate ventral anterior foregut spheroids. To do this, we tested if dual inhibition of BMP and TGFÎ² was able to anteriorize cultures, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Green et al., 2011</xref>). We treated hESCs with ActivinA (100 ng/ml) for 4 days to induce endoderm, followed by 4 days of Noggin (NOG, 200 ng/ml) and the small molecule TGFÎ² inhibitor, SB431542 (SB, 10 ÂµM). We confirmed that these conditions were able to induce robust mRNA and protein expression of SOX2, which co-expressed the endodermal marker FOXA2, while repressing the intestinal lineage marker CDX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâC</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

Based on our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâC</xref>, we hypothesized that combining FGF, Chir99021, NOG and SB would result in the generation of SOX2+ ventral-anterior foregut spheroids. To test this, we generated endoderm (4 days ACTA) and added no growth factors (Endoderm controls) or NOG, SB, FGF4, and Chir99021 (NOG/SB/F/Ch) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Addition of all four factors resulted in the generation of 3-dimensional SOX2+, CDX2â spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). SOX2+ spheroids also expressed the endodermal protein FOXA2, and were epithelial, co-expressing E-Cadherin (ECAD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In addition to SOX2, spheroids exhibited higher mRNA expression of anterior foregut lineage markers <italic>NKX2.1</italic> and <italic>PAX8</italic> compared to endoderm controls, suggesting that they are ventral-anterior foregut spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), however, immunofluorescence revealed that levels of NKX2.1 protein were just above the detection threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Spheroids also possess a minor population of cells that are mesodermal in origin staining positive for Vimentin protein (VIM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Given that neural tissues also express NKX2.1, PAX8, SOX2, and FOXA2, and that neural induction protocols use dual BMP and TGFÎ² inhibition, we wanted to exclude the possibility that spheroids were neural in nature. To do this, we generated endoderm control cultures, foregut spheroids (ActivinA followed by NOG/SB/F/Ch), and induced neural tissue by adding NOG/SB to hESC cultures that were not treated with ActivinA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>).

High levels of Fgf signaling have been shown to induce Shh and Nkx2.1 expression in the foregut endoderm in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hebrok et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Serls, 2004</xref>); furthermore, Gli2/3 null mouse embryos fail to form lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Motoyama et al., 1998</xref>) and Hh signaling is important for lung mesenchyme proliferation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellusci et al., 1997a</xref>). These data confirm that Fgf and Hh signaling are critical for lung specification and ligands from both signaling pathways have been applied to hPSC derived lung lineages in 2D cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). In our cultures we have reported that approximately 85â95% of cells are endoderm, but a portion of the remaining cells are mesodermal and this small mesodermal population is maintained in the spheroids and organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spence et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCracken et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, based on mouse and hPSC studies, we hypothesized that FGF and/or HH signaling would induce an NKX2.1+ lung lineage in anterior foregut endoderm. To test our hypothesis we initially focused on adherent endoderm monolayer cultures to optimize induction conditions. Cultures were treated for 4 days with ActivinA followed by an additional 4 days with NOG/SB (referred to as Foregut). Controls consisted of ActivinA treatment only followed by no additional growth factors (Endoderm controls), or ActivinA followed by NOG/SB, followed by no additional factors (Foregut controls). All experimental groups were compared to both endoderm and foregut controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We first tested the ability of FGF2 to induce <italic>SHH</italic>, <italic>NKX2.1</italic> and <italic>PAX8</italic> by exposing foregut cultures to low and high concentrations of FGF2 (50, 500 ng/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We observed a robust concentration dependent increase in <italic>SHH</italic> and <italic>PAX8</italic> mRNA expression compared to foregut or endoderm controls, and a modest increase of <italic>NKX2.1</italic> expression at the highest dose of FGF2 (500 ng/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also observed that dual NOG/SB inhibition in endoderm cultures induced robust <italic>NKX2.1</italic> and <italic>PAX8</italic> expression without adding FGF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1B, 2A</xref>). Thus, we wanted to determine if <italic>NKX2.1</italic> expression in foregut cultures was due to endogenous FGF and/or HH signaling. To test this, we inhibited the FGF or HH pathway with small molecules SU5402 (SU, 10 Âµm) and Sant-2 (10 Âµm) respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâC</xref>). Treating foregut cultures with the FGF inhibitor SU caused a significant, robust reduction in <italic>PAX8</italic> and a modest reduction in <italic>SHH</italic>, while <italic>NKX2.1</italic> expression was unchanged compared to foregut controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Conversely, inhibition of HH signaling caused a significant reduction in <italic>NKX2.1</italic> expression, but not <italic>PAX8</italic> compared to untreated foregut<italic>.</italic> When FGF2 was added to the cultures, we observed a modest increase in <italic>NKX2.1</italic> expression, and when FGF was added along with Sant-2, <italic>NKX2.1</italic> expression was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Together our results suggest a hierarchy where FGF is upstream of SHH and PAX8, and where SHH is upstream of NKX2.1. To test if HH signaling was able to induce NKX2.1 in foregut cultures, we added the Smoothened agonist, SAG (1 ÂµM) to foregut cultures. The addition of SAG induced a 6.5-fold increase of <italic>NKX2.1</italic> expression above foregut controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Therefore, we also tested several conditions that stimulated HH signaling using SAG only, without FGF inhibition. We found that the most efficient method to enhance NKX2.1 expression was by adding SAG during the foregut spheroid phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Comparing foregut spheroids (NOG/SB/F/Ch) with those treated with SAG (NOG/SB/F/Ch/SAG), we observed a substantial decrease in <italic>SOX2</italic> expression compared to NOG/SB/F/Ch spheroids and a significant increase in <italic>NKX2.1</italic> mRNA.

Specifically, the AECII marker SftpC and AECI marker Hopx can be co-expressed in a bipotent progenitor before becoming committed to one lineage or the other. Moreover, we have shown that Sox9 marks an early progenitor population in the developing mouse lung and Sox9 also marks the bipotent progenitor in late fetal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rockich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Treutlein et al., 2014</xref>).

For example, distal progenitor markers are initially robustly expressed whereas SFTPC expression is very low across time in HLOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), FOXJ1+ cells do not appear to form mature multi-ciliated structures until placed onto a decelluarized lung matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,E</xref>) and rare SCGB1A1+ cells do not resemble mature club cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

We also took advantage of publicly available RNAseq datasets for human fetal lung representing a range of gestational stages, and for adult human lung (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Although lung lineage cells have been generated with varying efficiency (â¼30â80% NKX2.1+ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Firth et al., 2014</xref>]) and can generate both both proximal (â¼5â36% of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Firth et al., 2014</xref>]) and distal cell types (up to â¼50% of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2013</xref>]), proper spatial organization of the cell types and specific tissue morphology have not been reported in 2D systems. Here, we show that HLOs possess both mesenchymal and lung epithelial (â¼60% NKX2.1+) cells with proximal airway-like structures that possess P63+ (â¼40%) and FOXJ1+ cells (â¼3%) along with distal airway-like structures that possess SFTPC+ (â¼5%) and HOPX+ (â¼4%) cells.</p><p>It is currently unclear if 2D culture systems described have the capability to give rise to mesodermal lineages. Thus, HLOs allow one to address questions regarding spatial tissue organization and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Since HLOs form organized structures that resemble bronchi and bronchioles with adjacent mesenchyme, these complex, organized tissues may allow exploration, for example, of airway remodeling after injury. Moreover, the spatial arrangement of specific cell types will be critical to study proximal airway dynamics during homeostasis and injury. For example, the location of P63+ cells adjacent to FOXJ1+ cells in the HLOs will be necessary to study basal cell differentiation into different proximal airway cell types during homeostasis or after injury. In addition to tissue morphology and structure during prolonged culture, the HLOs consist of both epithelium and mesenchyme in early cultures that are maintained over time. Since lung development requires extensive cross talk between the epithelium and mesenchyme in order to regulate developmental processes, proliferation and differentiation, HLOs may be an ideal in vitro system to study these complex tissueâtissue interactions.</p><p>Recently, there has been a push to define progenitor populations during lung development and adult homeostasis in order to better understand differentiation and the transition between branching and alveolarization. Two groups have defined a bipotent progenitor population in the embryonic/neonatal lung that gives rise to both AECI and AECII cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Desai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Treutlein et al., 2014</xref>). These bipotent cells express the distal progenitor marker Sox9 along with differentiation markers of AECI and AECII cells, including SftpC, HopX, and Pdpn. We demonstrate that HLOs expressed both AECI and II markers; however, the majority of these cells also expressed SOX9 suggesting that the majority of the distal epithelium is comprised of bipotent progenitors. Thus, HLOs will allow us to gain insight into this bipotent population, explore how bipotent progenitors are regulated, and define the mechanisms of how fate-decisions are made as terminal differentiation occurs.</p><p>The evidence supporting that HLOs are fetal in nature could reflect the fact that a block to full maturation exists in vitro, as is the case with other endoderm lineage organoids (intestinal and gastric), which appear to be immature. That is, while they possess committed lineage-specific cell types, the cells may not exhibit fully matured adult-like function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCracken et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Watson et al., 2014</xref>). This is also the case for pancreatic Î²-like cells and hepatocyte-like cells generated in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Si-Tayeb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hrvatin et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, the progenitor state may reflect the high levels of FGF10 in the culture media, since FGF10 is known to maintain progenitor cells in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ramasamy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nyeng et al., 2008</xref>). Given that HLOs are similar to human fetal lung, this tissue is an ideal model to study lung maturation of both the proximal and distal epithelium along with epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in a developmental context.</p><p>While the multi-lineage, multi-cellular composition of HLOs is a major advantage, one of the caveats to this system is that HLOs do not appear to undergo <italic>bona fide</italic> branching morphogenesis or possess transitional zones found in the adult lung, such as the bronchioalveolar ductal junction (BADJ). The HLOs possess proximal SOX2+ domain and distal SOX9+ domains observed during branching morphogenesis, but this regionalization occurs without setting up the stereotyped branching pattern. This may be due to the fact that the organoids are surrounded by media supplemented with FGF10 compared to the in vivo situation where FGF10 is expressed in a dynamic, spatially restricted manner in the distal mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellusci et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nyeng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abler et al., 2009</xref>). However, it has recently been demonstrated that localized expression FGF10 is not required for branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Volckaert et al., 2013</xref>), so this may not explain the lack of branching. Alternatively, similar to other endoderm-derived organoid models, HLOs lack several components of the native organ, including immune cells, vasculature, and innervation. Thus, it is possible that cellular inputs important for branching morphogenesis are missing from HLOs. Indeed, recent reports have shown that innervation is required for proper branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bower et al., 2014</xref>), and while vasculature may not be important for lung branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Havrilak and Shannon, 2015</xref>), others have shown the vascular endothelium is required to induce a branching-like program of isolated airway epithelium in 3D cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">FranzdÃ³ttir et al., 2010</xref>). Lastly, the microenvironment is essential for branching morphogenesis to occur including dynamic changes in the extracellular matrix around branching lung bud tips where the ECM is constantly changing and interacting with the cytoskeleton of the branching epithelium in order to facilitate cell movement and branching bifurcations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moore et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim and Nelson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wan et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that in the future, co-culture with additional cellular inputs may prove to enhance HLO branching.</p><p>Taken together, we describe here a novel system to generate human lung organoids from human pluripotent stem cells. HLOs possess both mesenchymal and epithelial lineages, as well as organized proximal airway structures with multiple cell types and surrounded by mesenchyme. HLOs also possess distal epithelial cells that are reminiscent of a bipotent alveolar progenitor cell recently described in mice which is likely a reflection of the similarities of HLOs to the human fetal lung. We believe that HLOs will be an excellent new human system to model lung differentiation, homeostasis and disease in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Maintenance of hESCs</title><p>Human ES cell lines H1 (NIH registry #0043) and H9 (NIH registry #0062) were obtained from WiCell Research Institute.

Bootstrap analysis was used to assess the uncertainty in the assigned hierarchical clustering relationships. 10,000 bootstraping iterations were generated by repeatedly randomly sampling the FPKM dataset. The bootstrap probability (BP) of a cluster is defined as the frequency of a given relationship among the bootstrap replicates. Multiscale bootstrap resampling was used to calculate an approximately unbiased (AU) p-value for a given relationship, with AU &gt; 95 indicating a high degree of statistical significance.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor and Reviewing editor) and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, the authors describe a systematically delineated 3D protocol to generate human lung organoids from human pluripotent stem cells. HLOs possess organized proximal airway structures with apparently multiple differentiated epithelial cell types, as well as smooth muscle cells. There was enthusiasm for the overall concept and the potential of the system to be used to model lung differentiation, homeostasis and disease in vitro. This work should be of interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there were concerns raised about the lack of in depth characterization of the different cell types generated and the lack of careful quantification of the extent of ordered differentiation in the system. For the paper to be reconsidered, we would ask you to address the various specific comments below, but to focus on careful characterization of the different lung cell types generated by extensive use of confocal imaging of co-staining with appropriate antibodies, such as FOXJ1, beta-tubulin, CC10, SCGB1A1, SCGB3A2, P63, Podoplanin, HOPX1, and more markers of SM compartment. It would also be important to provide more evidence that the organoids really regenerate at least partially the ordered branching seen in the lung- such that you could define a bronchioalveolar duct junction (BADJ) with the proper smooth muscle configuration. Further definition of the cell types arising from the mesenchyme would also be useful. Are there any cartilage cells or other types of cells such as lipofibroblasts, myofibroblasts, etc.</p><p>In addition, some quantification of the proportions of different cell types produced and comparison with other published lung differentiation protocols is required. We recognize that functional assessment of the cell types produced is difficult but use of EM identify lamellar bodies in type 2 cells would help.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: Foregut endoderm should be characterized by double positive for FOXA2+SOX2+.

It is also still possible that mesenchyme overgrew epithelium.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: Most differentiation marker staining is of poor quality and hard to interpret. For example, acetylated tubulin staining for ciliated cell is within the cell, rather than extend outside of the cell like cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). CCSP is dot-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). P63 expression is a general epithelial stem cell markers, therefore co-staining of P63 with NKX2.1, FOXA2 and SOX2 are needed to ensure they are airway epithelial stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: Again, all markers need to be co-stained with NKX2.1 to ensure the lung progenitor identity.

To address these concerns, we have now added a significant amount of new imaging, morphometric analysis and bioinformatics data to help paint a clearer picture of the HLO. Specifically, we have conducted the following:</p><p>1) Quantitated the % of HLOs that possess proximal airway-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>2) Quantitated the % of area in HLOs that are comprised or either proximal airway-like structures or distal airway-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>3) Quantitated the % of cells in HLOs that express NKX2.1, P63, FOXJ1, SPC, PDPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C-G</xref>).</p><p>4) Serial slices from confocal Z-stack images co-labeled with: i) ECAD/SOX9/SOX2; ii) P63/ECAD; and iii) P63/aSMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3âfigure supplement 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>5) Importantly, through our analysis, we observed that staining for some cell types, including Club cells, was very rare. Coupled with our observation that some cells were reminiscent of fetal airway progenitors (SOX9+/SFTPC+), this led us to hypothesize that the HLOs were fetal in nature. In order to determine if was indeed the case, we used RNA sequencing to compare HLOs to human fetal lungs and human adult lungs. This transcriptome-wide comparison strongly suggests that HLOs are very similar to fetal lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p><italic>It would also be important to provide more evidence that the organoids really regenerate at least partially the ordered branching seen in the lung- such that you could define a bronchioalveolar duct junction (BADJ) with the proper smooth muscle configuration</italic>.</p><p>Our new analysis suggests there is some organoid-to-organoid variation in terms of general structure/architecture. That is, greater than 80% of HLOs examined (n=48) had definitive proximal airway-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), and that these proximal airway-like structures accounted for â¼20% of the organoid cross-sectional area. The remaining 80% of the HLO was comprised of distal airway-like structures, where SFTPC+ and HOPX+ cells were found. Importantly, we also show that these distal-like airway structures had abundant myofibroblasts, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), but not cartilage. However, we did not find evidence that HLOs undergo branching morphogenesis or form proper BADJ structures.</p><p>Much like HLOs, intestinal organoids (Spence et al., Nature 2011) are poorly organized in vitro and only obtain higher order structure when transplanted in vivo (Watson et al., Nature Medicine, 2014). This higher order structure may result from a more complex growth environment that may include new cellular inputs (vasculature, innervation), circulating metabolites, or by changes in the mechanical forces placed on tissue transplanted under a kidney capsule. However, at this time, all of these possibilities are pure speculation. We have full intentions of determining if transplanting HLOs into the in vivo environment will enhance structural organization, however, due to the need to establish surgical procedures in my lab, and the time it may take for HLOs to structurally mature in vivo (&gt;12 weeks), we feel that these experiments are outside the scope of the current work.</p><p>Therefore, in order to be as forthright as possible, we have added into our Discussion section that we do not find evidence of a BADJ or branching morphogenesis.</p><p><italic>Further definition of the cell types arising from the mesenchyme would also be useful. Are there any cartilage cells or other types of cells such as lipofibroblasts, myofibroblasts, etc</italic>.</p><p>We have now included a new figure showing immunofluorescent staining to examine the mesenchymal compartment of HLOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We also stained HLOs with Safranin O, which identifies cartilage, and find that HLOs do not possess cartilage, whereas iPSC-derived teratomas had abundant Safranin O-positive cartilage staining.</p><p><italic>In addition, some quantification of the proportions of different cell types produced and comparison with other published lung differentiation protocols is required</italic>.</p><p>We agree that comparing our results to those of others is important. It is interesting that re-reviewing the literature led us to the realization that some groups making very important contributions to the field did not conduct such a detailed analysis of the proportion of cell types. In this light, we have included a section in the Discussion comparing our analysis to those of others whenever data was available.</p><p><italic>We recognize that functional assessment of the cell types produced is difficult but use of EM identify lamellar bodies in type 2 cells would help</italic>.</p><p>We have now conducted TEM and find clear evidence of lamellar bodies that are both within cells, and that have been secreted into the extracellular space.</p><p><italic>Specific comments:</italic></p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>: Foregut endoderm should be characterized by double positive for FOXA2+SOX2+.

Double-positive cells also suggest these may be less differentiated. We have tried to clarify the text around this problem.</p><p>In addition, rather than using a few molecular markers and co-stained cells to speculate on the âmaturation stateâ of HLOs, we now directly address this using RNA sequencing. By comparing whole transcriptome signatures of HLOs to fetal lung, adult lung, ES cells and definitive endoderm. This data is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Based on global RNA expression levels, this analysis strongly suggests that HLOs are more similar to fetal/immature lung.</p><p><italic>In supplemental figures for</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>, the authors indicated that the majority of cells lose epithelial identity and become vimentin positive mesenchymal cells over time. It is also still possible that mesenchyme overgrew epithelium</italic>.</p><p>This point is correct and well taken. We have now revised the text to encompass this possibility.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>: Most differentiation marker staining is of poor quality and hard to interpret.

Rather, as we state in the text, we believe that these FOXJ1+ cells are not forming proper multi-ciliated structures and may reflect the immature cellular state of HLOs. Our results from growing HLOs on acellular human lung matrix support this idea, since growth on the human matrix promotes proper multicilliated structures.</p><p><italic>CCSP is dot-like (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>We find these CCSP+ cells only very rarely, and again, believe their sparcity and staining pattern are reflective of a less differentiated tissue.</p><p><italic>P63 expression is a general epithelial stem cell markers, therefore co-staining of P63 with NKX2.1, FOXA2 and SOX2 are needed to ensure they are airway epithelial stem cells (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4B</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>Point well taken. Unfortunately, due to antibody specificity, we were unable to conduct NKX2.1/P63 co-staining. Instead, we have conducted staining on serial sections to show that cells in adjacent sections are staining positive for both markers. Additionally, we show that P63+ cells also express SOX2.

Again, due to antibody specificity limitations, some of this analysis was conducted on serial sections.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) HLOs have the ability to generate mature airway cells, but predominantly possess a bipotent alveolar progenitors. Does this protocol favors to proximal lung development? Does the length of time in 3D culture alter the ratio of proximal versus distal</italic>?</p><p>Given our new quantitative analysis of the HLOs and RNAseq comparisons to adult and fetal lung, we do not believe that our methods favor proximal lung development. Our current thought is that the relatively low abundance of mature alveolar cells may be reflective of the immature/fetal nature of the HLO. Moreover, it is possible that our culture conditions, which utilize high levels of FGF10, may promote this less differentiated cellular state, and our data suggests that distal differentiation may require prolonged time in culture, since SFTPC begins to increase after â¼65 days in culture, and continues to increase at 110 days in culture, the latest time we have examined.</p><p>We believe that the best experiment to test these possibilities is to transplant the HLOs into a recipient host (NSG mouse), and determine if they show enhanced cellular differentiation. As mentioned above, we are currently working toward establishing the techniques required to conduct these experiments in the Spence lab, but are unable to do so at this time.</p><p><italic>2) Increase in HH signaling leads to an increase in NKX2-1 expression in culture. Since HH signaling is received by mesenchymal cells, what is mediating its effect on NKX2-1</italic>?</p><p>This is a very good question, and one that does not have a definitive answer at this time. It is clear from our experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> that HH signaling is required for NKX2.1 expression in NOG/SB treated foregut endoderm. When we inhibit HH with a small molecule, Sant-2, NKX2.1 expression is reduced. However, we still do not understand the mechanism by which this happens. One strong possibility is that HH signaling enhances mesenchymal proliferation and/or survival in HLOs, thus increasing important reciprocal signaling events between the two populations. Indeed, immunostaining of NOG/SB/F/CH spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>) and NOG/SB/F/CH/SAG spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5</xref>) for the mesenchymal marker Vimentin (VIM) revealed that there may be more mesenchymal cells present in SAG treated spheroids. However, differences between these groups were not significant by QRTPCR (data not shown).</p><p><italic>3) Combined inhibition of endogenous FGF signaling with SU and activation of HH with SAG caused an additional increase in NKX2-1 expression (21 fold vs. 6.5 fold with SAG only). However, treating foregut cultures with SU along did not alter NKX2.1 expression. What is the explanation for the increase in NKX2-1 expression with the SU and HH combination</italic>?</p><p>We believe that our data supports a paradigm where both factors in combination (SAG+SU) support robust expression of NKX2.1 in more cells when compared with addition of SAG alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In this scenario, SAG alone results in robust âpatchesâ of NKX2.1+ cells in the monolayer whereas SAG+SU promotes robust protein expression of NKX2.1 in majority of cells within a field.</p><p>This may be due to the fact that with SAG alone, cells still receive endogenous FGF signals, and have more lineage choices to make, whereas removing FGF narrows the number of decisions a cell has such that more commit to an NKX2.1+ lineage.</p><p><italic>4) What effect does HH has on SMC differentiation in culture</italic>?</p><p>This is an interesting question given previously described roles for HH on smooth muscle differentiation. We conducted several experiments in an attempt to address this reviewer question, and unfortunately, we did not see definitive changes in smooth muscle differentiation when we manipulated HH signaling (data not shown). We believe that this is likely due to experimental design. For example, it is possible we did not use high enough doses or long enough exposures to see an effect. These experiments are still ongoing, however, at this time we only have negative data to report and have chosen not to comment in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) Comparing experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2C</italic></xref> <italic>versus 2D, it seems that NKX2-1 and PAX8 induction in these two experiments are quite different. Does the efficiency vary quite a bit between experiments</italic>?</p><p>We believe that this variability arises from our âendoderm controlâ group, in which we add ActivinA for four days, followed by only basal media with no growth factors for an additional 12 days. In this setting, cells that have been induced to become endoderm but given no additional cues begin to undergo stochastic differentiation into multiple lineages, as we have previously shown (Spence et al., 2011). Thus, in these types of experiments, while the trends in gene expression are usually reproducible, the level of the changes vary somewhat from experiment to experiment, as the reviewer points out in 2C vs. 2D.</p><p><italic>6) For</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref><italic>, the right panel, NOG/SB inhibition in endoderm cultures does not seem to have led to induction of PAX8, as was concluded in Results</italic>.</p><p>This reviewer brings up a good point, and we have tried to clarify the text surrounding this result, and we offer the following explanation; For this experiment, all conditions were analyzed after the same amount of time in culture. For the endoderm control, endoderm was induced for 4 days, and then placed in basal culture media for the duration of the experiment (12 days).</p><p>Similarly, the Foregut condition received ActivinA for four days, followed by four days of NOG/SB, and followed by 8 days in basal media. And so on. The likely reason PAX8 is not highly expressed in this experiment is that its expression is not maintained over time in the absence of any growth factors. This is supported by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>, where we generated foregut endoderm (NOG/SB) and then treated it with FGF2 for 8 days, and observed many PAX8+ cells within the monolayer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
