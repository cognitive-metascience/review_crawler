includes production of type I interferons (IFNs). The nature of the RNAs that trigger MDA5 activation in infected cells remains unclear. Here, we purify and characterise LGP2/RNA complexes from cells infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a picornavirus detected by MDA5 and LGP2 but not RIG-I. We show that those complexes contain RNA that is highly enriched for MDA5-stimulatory activity and for a specific sequence corresponding to the L region of the EMCV antisense RNA. Synthesis of this sequence by in vitro transcription is sufficient to generate an MDA5 stimulatory RNA. Conversely, genomic deletion of the L region in EMCV generates viruses that are less potent at stimulating MDA5-dependent IFN production. Thus, the L region antisense RNA of EMCV is a key determinant of innate immunity to the virus and represents an RNA that activates MDA5 in virally-infected cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01535.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01535.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01535.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A virus is basically molecules of DNA or RNA inside a protein shell, and in order to reproduce, it must infect a living cell and take control of it. However, the attacked cell will fight back and try to eliminate the invader. Activation of this so-called innate immune response requires the host cells to recognize that they have been infected, which they do by detecting the tell-tale molecules that indicate the presence of the virus.</p><p>When an RNA virus infects a cell, the tell-tale molecules are often atypical RNA molecules carried by the virus or produced as the virus replicates. Recognition of this ‘foreign’ material by receptor proteins inside the cell triggers the production of molecules called interferons, which activate the innate defence systems that eliminate the virus.</p><p>Different receptor proteins recognize different RNA viruses. For example, a receptor called MDA5 is known to respond to the picornaviruses, some of which can cause inflammation of the brain and heart muscle. However, the identities of the specific RNA molecules that are recognized by the MDA5 receptor have not been known. Deddouche et al. have now identified one such RNA molecule with the help of a second receptor protein, called LGP2.</p><p>The LGP2 receptor is not able to give the signal to produce interferons, so it is thought to work by binding to the RNA molecule to form a complex that is then relayed to MDA5 to give this signal. By isolating the complexes of LGP2 receptor from picornavirus-infected cells and sequencing the associated RNA, it was possible to identify the mystery RNA trigger. Deddouche et al. then tested picornaviruses in which this piece of RNA had been deleted from the genome, and found that the mutant viruses triggered a much weaker interferon response. By providing insight into the ways that some viruses are detected by the innate immune system, this research may inform future work on the development of new treatments to control viral infection.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01535.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01535.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>RIG-I-like receptor</kwd><kwd>MDA5</kwd><kwd>LGP2</kwd><kwd>picornavirus</kwd><kwd>EMCV</kwd><kwd>antiviral immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deddouche</surname><given-names>Safia</given-names></name><name><surname>Goubau</surname><given-names>Delphine</given-names></name><name><surname>Rehwinkel</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name><name><surname>Chakravarty</surname><given-names>Probir</given-names></name><name><surname>Begum</surname><given-names>Sharmin</given-names></name><name><surname>Maillard</surname><given-names>Pierre V</given-names></name><name><surname>Borg</surname><given-names>Annabel</given-names></name><name><surname>Matthews</surname><given-names>Nik</given-names></name><name><surname>Reis e Sousa</surname><given-names>Caetano</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rehwinkel</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marie Curie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deddouche</surname><given-names>Safia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Bettencourt-Schueller</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reis e Sousa</surname><given-names>Caetano</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AdG-2010-268670</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reis e Sousa</surname><given-names>Caetano</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research - Mosaic grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWO-017.006.043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Qian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Netherlands Organisation for Scientifique Research - ECHO Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWO-CW-700.59.007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Kuppeveld</surname><given-names>Frank J M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A viral RNA has been identified as a specific MDA5 agonist in cells infected with encephalomyocarditis virus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viral infection in mammals triggers a rapid innate immune response involving the production of antiviral proteins and proinflammatory mediators, prominent among which are the type I interferons (IFN-α/β; hereafter, IFN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takaoka and Yanai, 2006</xref>). IFNs are secreted cytokines that act on all nucleated cells to induce the transcription of more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes, whose products collectively limit virus replication and spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schoggins and Rice, 2011</xref>). IFN gene transcription is triggered by the activation of pattern recognition receptors that detect viral invasion. These receptors include members of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goubau et al., 2013</xref>), a sub-group of DExD/H-box helicases that surveys the cytosol for the presence of atypical RNAs associated with viral infection. The RLR family comprises three members: RIG-I (retinoic acid-induced gene I), MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5), and LGP2 (laboratory of genetics and physiology 2). Binding of agonistic RNA by RIG-I or MDA5 triggers a signalling cascade that leads to the activation of transcription factors, including several of the IFN regulatory factors (IRFs), which translocate into the nucleus to induce expression of IFN and other genes. LGP2 lacks a signalling domain and cannot act in the same manner. Rather, LGP2 is thought to potentiate MDA5-dependent IFN induction although the exact mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Satoh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruns et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Childs et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>MDA5 and RIG-I are activated by different RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato et al., 2006</xref>). RIG-I is non-redundant for detection of influenza or Sendai virus but dispensable for responses to picornaviruses whereas the opposite is the case for MDA5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2008</xref>). The basis for these differences stems from the ability of RIG-I and MDA5 to recognize different RNA patterns. RIG-I binds to and is activated by base-paired RNA containing a 5′ triphosphate extremity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hornung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pichlmair et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schlee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>) as found in influenza and Sendai virus genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rehwinkel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Weber et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, MDA5 recognizes RNA independently of 5′ phosphates and can be activated in cells by transfection of synthetic poly I:C or the double-stranded (ds) RNA genome segments of reovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2008</xref>). Based on such observations, it has been concluded that MDA5 detects long dsRNA generated during virus infection. However, natural MDA5 agonists derived from infected cells remain poorly characterised. Some studies have suggested that they might correspond to high molecular weight RNA complexes containing double and single-stranded (ss) regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pichlmair et al., 2009</xref>). Other reports have proposed that relevant MDA5 agonists are specific viral replication intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Triantafilou et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, it has been suggested that MDA5 might also be activated by RNA products of RNAseL cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Malathi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Luthra et al., 2011</xref>) or by mRNA bearing unmethylated cap structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Züst et al., 2011</xref>). Altogether, these studies provide a glimpse into the possible nature of MDA5 agonists in virally-infected cells but fall short of identifying them with precision.</p><p>Immunoprecipitation of RIG-I from cells infected with influenza A virus (IAV) or Sendai virus has allowed the identification of physiological RIG-I agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rehwinkel et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we use an analogous approach to investigate the nature of MDA5 agonists in cells infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a member of the <italic>Cardiovirus</italic> genus of picornaviruses. Picornaviruses are single-stranded positive-strand (sense) RNA viruses that replicate in infected cells via a negative-strand (antisense) intermediate. We purify RNA directly from complexes obtained by immunoprecipitation of LGP2 and show that this method enriches for MDA5 stimulatory RNA corresponding to a portion of the EMCV antisense RNA. Deletion of the region encoding this antisense RNA generates viruses that produce less stimulatory RNA and are less potent at inducing IFN in infected cells or mice. Conversely, in vitro synthesis of the same sequence generates an MDA5 agonistic RNA. Thus, a discrete region of the EMCV negative-strand RNA acts as a physiologically-relevant MDA5 agonist in infected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EMCV replication is required for MDA5/LGP2-dependent IFN induction</title><p>To confirm that both MDA5 and LGP2 are required for IFN responses to EMCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Satoh et al., 2010</xref>), we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) carrying null mutant alleles of the genes <italic>Ifih1</italic> and <italic>Dhx58</italic> encoding MDA5 and LGP2, respectively.

The upregulation of <italic>Ifit1</italic> or <italic>Ifnb1</italic> mRNA was greatly impaired in MDA5- or LGP2-deficient MEFs infected with EMCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The same cells responded normally to RIG-I-dependent viruses such as IAV and to known RIG-I agonists such as in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). To begin to define the MDA5/LGP2 agonist, we isolated the EMCV genome from purified EMCV particles and transfected it into reporter cells together with a plasmid encoding a luciferase gene under the control of the IFN-β promoter. As reporter cells, we used an easily transfectable subclone of HEK293 cells that expresses all RLRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and can respond, albeit weakly, to MDA5 agonists (data not shown; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Because transfection of positive-stranded viral RNA can lead to viral replication (even though EMCV replicates in HEK293 cells only poorly), we performed the IFN reporter assay in the presence of ribavirin, an inhibitor of viral RNA synthesis. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, EMCV genomes did not stimulate the IFN-β reporter, in contrast to the genomes of IAV, which directly activate RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rehwinkel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Weber et al., 2013</xref>). To determine whether viral replication generates stimulatory RNA, we extracted total RNA from HeLa cells that had been infected with EMCV in the presence or absence of ribavirin. RNA isolated from cells in which EMCV viral replication had been permitted to take its course (DMSO control) potently induced the IFN-β reporter upon transfection into HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, RNA extracted from HeLa cells treated with ribavirin was non-stimulatory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Treatment of the reporter HEK293 cells themselves with ribavirin did not affect the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>), which indicates that the stimulatory RNA is preformed in EMCV-infected HeLa cells. Furthermore, the response in the HEK293 reporter cells was dependent on MDA5 as demonstrated using RNA interference-mediated MDA5 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Altogether these data indicate that MDA5 and LGP2 activation results exclusively from RNA generated during active EMCV replication, as recently suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Triantafilou et al., 2012</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01535.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IFN-α/β induction requires EMCV replication.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) EMCV and IAV RNA genomes were extracted from purified viral particles and tested at the indicated doses in an IFN-β promoter luciferase reporter assay in HEK293 cells in the presence of ribavirin.

To characterise the ‘strandedness’ of the IFN stimulatory RNA generated upon EMCV replication, we extracted total RNA from non-infected or either IAV or EMCV-infected HeLa cells and separated it into ds and ssRNA fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2012</xref>). As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pichlmair et al., 2006</xref>), the ssRNA but not the long dsRNA fraction extracted from cells infected with IAV, stimulated the IFN reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). In contrast, both ds and ssRNA fractions from cells infected with EMCV triggered the IFN-β reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Similarly, treatment of total RNA from EMCV-infected cells with RNase A or RNase III, which digest unpaired or base-paired RNA, respectively, strongly reduced stimulatory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, removal of 5′ phosphates by digestion with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) or 5′ polyphophatase (PP) did not impact stimulatory activity although it abrogated that of IVT control RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Altogether these data indicate that MDA5/LGP2 stimulatory RNA accumulates in EMCV-infected cells during virus replication and contains both ssRNA and dsRNA features, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pichlmair et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Enrichment of MDA5 agonists from EMCV-infected cells by LGP2 pulldown</title><p>To further purify the RNA responsible for activation, we established a method to isolate LGP2-associated RNA from infected cells. We immunoprecipitated (IP) LGP2 from EMCV-infected HeLa cells transiently expressing a FLAG-tagged LGP2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), extracted RNA from the precipitates and analysed its stimulatory activity in reporter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Notably, RNA associated with the LGP2 precipitates, but not with control (ctrl) precipitates, stimulated the IFN-β luciferase reporter in HEK293 cells and induced expression of the IFNB1 gene in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Moreover, when compared to input material, stimulatory activity was significantly enriched in the LGP2-immunoprecipitate and was selectively depleted from the unbound fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). We additionally transfected the LGP2-associated RNA into MEFs and confirmed its ability to stimulate IFN production by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Importantly, activity was lost in LGP2- or MDA5-deficient MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that the LGP2-associated RNA isolated from immunoprecipitates is a pure MDA5/LGP2 agonist. Consistent with this notion, its IFN stimulatory capacity was unaffected by treatment with CIP, which inactivates most RIG-I agonists, or Terminator (Term), which digests RNA with 5′ monophosphates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, digestion with RNaseT1 and RNaseIII completely abolished stimulatory potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), again suggesting the presence of unpaired and base-paired RNA regions as previously observed with total RNA from EMCV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Finally, we incubated purified RNA from EMCV-infected HeLa cells together with recombinant FLAG-tagged LGP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). FLAG immunoprecipitation allowed enrichment for stimulatory activity when compared to a control IP, demonstrating that stimulatory RNA can associate with LGP2 in vitro in the absence of additional proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Altogether these results indicate that LGP2 selectively associates with a pool of MDA5 agonists in EMCV-infected cells and that LGP2 IP is a suitable approach to enrich for such agonists.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01535.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>LGP2 pulldown captures MDA5 agonistic RNA from EMCV-infected cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the experimental setup for LGP2 immunoprecipitation (IP).

We pooled RNA extracted from multiple independent control or LGP2 IPs and carried out Illumina sequencing in duplicate (‘Material and methods’). Approximately, 30 million reads of 60 nts in length were obtained from each sequencing sample and were mapped to the human and the EMCV genomes. The total number of reads mapping to EMCV represented around 30% in LGP2 IP samples vs only 4% and 6% in ctrl IP and input, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1 tbl2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which indicated that the RNA in the LGP2 IP is specifically enriched for EMCV-derived sequences. To allow better comparison across samples, the number of reads from LGP2 IP, ctrl IP and input samples was first normalised to the total number of reads (displayed as reads/million) and then aligned to the EMCV genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To allow efficient replication of the L protein-deficient viral strains, BM-DCs were derived from IFN-α/β receptor-deficient mice (IFNAR1 knockout [KO]). To monitor EMCV detection and the activation of the downstream RLRs signalling pathway, we assessed the induction of both Ifit1 and Ifnb1, which are direct transcriptional targets of IRF-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grandvaux et al., 2002</xref>).

FMDV belongs to a different picornavirus genus and the FMDV L region sequence and FMDV leader protein share little similarity with those of EMCV. Notably, the induction of both Ifit1 and Ifnb1 in response to EMCV L<sub>FMDV</sub> was comparable to that induced by EMCVΔL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>) and replication of the two strains was indistinguishable. These data suggest that the EMCV L AS RNA sequence rather than the position of the L region in the EMCV genome is the key determinant in innate stimulation. To further address this issue, we introduced the EMCV L antisense RNA sequence into the influenza virus NS segment, a known RIG-I agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rehwinkel et al., 2010</xref>). However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>, the resulting chimeric NS RNA remained dependent on RIG-I and not MDA5 for its stimulatory activity. This suggests that the L region antisense sequence needs to be somehow processed or released in the context of EMCV infection to trigger an MDA5-dependent response and this does not happen in the context of the influenza virus NS segment.</p><p>Finally, we assessed whether L region RNA is also important for responses to EMCV in vivo. Mice deficient in IFNAR1 (to allow replication of the attenuated viruses) were infected with EMCV WT, EMCVΔL and EMCV Zn<sub>C19AC22A</sub> strains and the outputs of innate immune stimulation were measured. Higher levels of IFN-α were found in the serum of mice 24 hr after infection with EMCV Zn<sub>C19AC22A</sub> when compared to EMCVΔL and WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

For example, some of the RNA species extracted from infected cells may not have access to MDA5 during infection or may be produced in quantities or at times that are irrelevant for innate immune recognition. One way to identify those RNAs most likely to be relevant agonists in infected cells is to isolate them directly from RLR complexes present in those cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baum and García-Sastre, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rehwinkel et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we describe a method to isolate relevant MDA5 agonists from cells infected with EMCV by immunoprecipitation of LGP2/RNA complexes. We show that this method simultaneously enriches for MDA5 stimulatory activity and for a discrete species of antisense RNA mapping to the EMCV L region. Notably, we establish a causal connection between the two events by showing that deletion of the L region from the virus genome abrogates the association of stimulatory RNA with LGP2 in infected cells and reduces the innate stimulatory capacity of the virus, both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that in vitro synthesis of L region antisense RNA is sufficient to generate an MDA5 agonist. Our results demonstrate that the antisense L region of EMCV associates with LGP2 and is a key determinant of MDA5 stimulation. Curiously, this determinant is derived from the same region that encodes a protein product that suppresses IFN induction. The fact that deletion of this region in EMCV reduces viral stimulatory activity is therefore counterintuitive and strengthens the notion that it is a physiologically-relevant major determinant of innate immunity to the virus.</p><p>The finding that pulldown of LGP2 allows isolation of MDA5 stimulatory RNA is in agreement with the fact that both RLRs are required for IFN production upon EMCV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and with previous reports describing LGP2 as a positive regulator of MDA5 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Venkataraman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Satoh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruns et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Childs et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, despite numerous attempts and experimental permutations, we have never been able to isolate stimulatory RNA directly from MDA5 pulldowns (data not shown). One explanation may be that LGP2 possesses higher avidity for RNA than MDA5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruns et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Childs et al., 2013</xref>) and is therefore more prone to retain bound agonist during cell lysis and precipitation. Another possibility relates to the fact that MDA5 forms filaments along RNA upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peisley et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berke and Modis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2012</xref>) and that such structures—when formed in infected cells—may be difficult to isolate. These considerations raise the question of whether LGP2 precipitation selects relevant MDA5 agonists. For example, given that LGP2 can bind to stimulatory RNAs in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), is it possible that the complexes that we precipitate result from post-lysis ‘mopping-up’ of stimulatory RNA that would never in the intact cell have come into contact with MDA5? We believe this is unlikely based on the fact that the functional relevance of the L region identified in the LGP2 pulldowns could be validated in the context of infection using mutant viruses. Furthermore, we find that LGP2 pulldown both enriches for MDA5 agonists and depletes them from input material. Therefore, it appears that the universe of LGP2-bound RNAs largely overlaps with that of MDA5 agonists in EMCV-infected cells. Although we do not exclude the possibility that there are MDA5 agonists that are not captured by LGP2 pulldown (see below), our findings suggest a model where LGP2 pre-selects RNAs for MDA5 activation prior to the formation of MDA5 filaments. Whether the two proteins form a physical complex remains to be established—it is possible that LGP2 acts upstream of MDA5 to ‘handover’ agonistic RNA and that interaction with MDA5, if any, may be indirect or transient.</p><p>Deep sequencing of LGP2-associated stimulatory RNA was revealing. We were not able to identify specific enrichment for any human sequences (data not shown), a finding that does not support a dominant role for RNAseL cleaved self RNA in MDA5 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malathi et al., 2007</xref>). This is in agreement with another recent publication that also failed to detect a significant role for RNaseL activity in EMCV-dependent IFN induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2012</xref>). Instead, the sequencing data, confirmed by strand-specific RT-PCR analysis, identified a different species of small RNA that was highly enriched in LGP2 pulldowns. This is a fragment of 171 nucleotides that corresponds to the antisense RNA in the L region of the genome. Its short length and failure to be accompanied by the complementary strand are at odds with the notion that MDA5 is activated by long dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2008</xref>). However, recent data indicate that MDA5 can form filaments along short dsRNA of around 100 nucleotides in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peisley et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, the fact that LGP2-associated RNA appears to be single-stranded is in agreement with the observation that the stimulatory activity of the LGP2-associated RNA is sensitive to RNases that degrade ssRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Interestingly, this LGP2-associated RNA is also sensitive to dsRNase treatment, which suggests the presence of base-paired regions important for MDA5/LGP2 recognition. Consistent with that notion, heat denaturation destroyed its activity (data not shown). In silico analysis reveals the potential of the L antisense RNA to form hairpins (data not shown), and such secondary and tertiary structure features may help to efficiently trigger MDA5 activation. Interestingly, by in vitro transcription of a sequence corresponding to the L antisense region we have succeeded in creating de novo an RNA that triggers MDA5 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). What endows this RNA with MDA5 agonistic activity and whether the in vitro transcribed version fully corresponds to that naturally formed in EMCV-infected cells will require further investigation.</p><p>Another intriguing question is how a fragment of L AS RNA is generated upon viral infection. We have not been able to find a report describing the generation of small antisense RNA fragments during EMCV replication. However, Northern blots of RNA from EMCV-infected cells screened with an L AS sequence probe reveal many fragments smaller than the EMCV genome ranging between 200 and 2000 nucleotides (data not shown). Moreover, a previous study has reported the generation of a short subgenomic RNA fragment derived from the degradation of the non-polyadenylated genome of flaviviruses by the exonuclease XRN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Funk et al., 2010</xref>). It is possible that a similar mechanism could generate an L antisense RNA fragment. Alternatively, stress granule formation, known to interfere with picornavirus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borghese and Michiels, 2011</xref>), could potentially lead to degradation of viral RNA and generate the L region antisense RNA agonist. Interestingly, MDA5 and LGP2 have been recently shown to associate with stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Onomoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Langereis et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Picornavirus replication involves a stage where the positive-stranded genome anneals with a newly-formed negative strand in a full-length double-stranded RNA structure known as the replicative form (RF). Negative-strand RNA from the RF then serves as the template to produce new progeny viral genomes through a replicative intermediate (RI) consisting of many positively-stranded progeny RNA genomes in the process of being synthesised and still partially hybridised to the full-length antisense RNA template. A recent study showed that negative-strand RNA synthesis is absolutely required for IFN induction during infection of mengovirus, a strain of EMCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2012</xref>). Our results that a small RNA derived from the negative-strand RNA of EMCV associates with LGP2 and activates MDA5 is in line with that report. However, it has also been shown that both the RF and RI forms can activate MDA5 upon transfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Triantafilou et al., 2012</xref>). It is conceivable that RF and RI forms could be processed by RNases within the cell following transfection or infection, releasing the L antisense fragment that associates with LGP2. Alternatively, it is possible that the L region antisense fragment enriched in our IP is only one of several agonists generated upon EMCV replication and that the RF and RI forms constitute a different set of agonists that do not strongly associate with LGP2 and have therefore been missed in our approach. This hypothesis is consistent with our data, which show that EMCVΔL viruses still possess the ability to induce low levels of IFN and IFIT-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6 and 7</xref>) and generate stimulatory RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Such data suggest the existence of at least one additional stimulatory RNA species beside the L region antisense fragment and help explain why EMCVΔL is an attenuated strain: the additional stimulatory RNA means that it cannot fully evade innate immune detection while the lack of the L protein means that it cannot suppress the consequences of detection. Although it remains to be established whether this putative additional stimulatory RNA species corresponds to the RF/RI (or even acts via MDA5—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), these observations suggest the need to determine to what extent different innate immune stimuli dominate at different stages of infection.</p><p>Our investigation has resulted in the identification of a specific region of the EMCV negative-strand RNA as a determinant of innate immunity to the virus. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify an MDA5 agonist bound to LGP2 in infected cells. Picornaviruses constitute a large family of viruses that encompasses many human and animal pathogens including some of economical or medical importance including Poliovirus, Coxsackievirus, Rhinovirus, and EMCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tuthill et al., 2010</xref>). The L regions of picornaviruses can show wide variation and it will be interesting to determine to what extent L region RNA or other small RNAs can act as MDA5 agonists across picornavirus genera. Elucidating the molecular basis of picornavirus detection will help understand the general rules underlying innate virus detection and may suggest new strategies to control viral infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>The human LGP2 sequences were amplified from cDNA derived from IFN-A/D (PBL Assay Science, Piscataway, NJ)-treated HEK293 cells using a forward primer containing the 3xFLAG epitope sequence with the following oligos (FW LGP2: 5′gccgccatggactacaaagaccatgacggtgattataaagatcatgacatcgattacaaggatgacgatgacaaggagcttcggtcctaccaatggga-3′, RV LGP2: 5′-tcagtccagggagaggtccga-3′).

Data were normalized to levels of gapdh.</p><p>For strand-specific detection of viral RNA, RNA was first reverse transcribed using Superscript II (Life Technologies) in the presence of primers specific for L antisense (5′- ggccgtcatggtggcgaataagcgcactctctcacttttga-3′) or VP1 antisense (5′- ggccgtcatggtggcgaataacaggtccggcactataaacc-3′). cDNAs were then subjected to Exonuclease I (New England Biolabs) treatment and purified using Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). In the next step, quantitative RT-PCR was performed in presence of Express Syber GreenER (Invitrogen) using the following primers: common forward primer 5′-aataaatcataaggccgtcatggtggcgaataa-3′ in combination with either L reverse primer 5′-aataaatcataatcgaaaacgacttccatgtct-3′ or 1D reverse primer 5′- aataaatcataacctcttctccccctttgtgt-3′ to detect L or 1D region respectively. RNA levels were calculated by comparison with a dilution curve of cDNA from EMCV-infected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Detection of IFN stimulatory activity</title><p>IFN-β luciferase reporter assay: 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> of HEK293 cells or IFN-A/D treated MEFs were transfected with 200 ng of p125Luc (gift from T Fujita, Kyoto university, Japan) and 50 ng pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated for 6–8 hr and were then transfected with water (mock control) or with test or control RNAs using lipofectamine. Luciferase activity was analysed in cell lysates 12 to 16 hr later using the Dual luciferase reporter Assay system (Promega). In all cases, firefly luciferase values were divided by Renilla luciferase values to normalise for transfection efficiency. All data are shown as fold increase relative to reporter cells transfected with water alone.</p><p>MEF assay: MEFs were pre-treated with 100 units/ml of IFN-A/D (PBL interferon) for 24 hr and plated into 24-well plates at 0.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cell/well. The cells were then transfected with test or control RNAs using lipofectamine. After overnight culture, mIFN-α was measured in cell supernatants by ELISA as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rehwinkel et al., 2010</xref>) or MEF RNA was extracted with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions for RT-PCR analysis of Ifit1 and Ifnb1 induction.</p><p>HeLa assay: HeLa cells were pre-treated with 100 units/ml of IFN-A/D (PBL Assay Science) for 24 hr and plated into 24-well plates at 0.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cell/well. The cells were then transfected with the indicated amounts of test or control RNAs using lipofectamine. After overnight culture, HeLa RNA was extracted for RT-PCR analysis of IFNB1 induction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>LGP2 immunoprecipitation</title><p>Around 10–15 million HeLa cells were transfected with 30 µg of 3xFLAG LGP2 IP plasmids using lipofectamine reagent following the manufacturer instructions. The cells were incubated for 16 hr, lipofectamine was washed away and the cells were incubated in fresh medium for 6–8 hr. HeLa cells expressing the 3xFLAG constructs were then infected with EMCV at an MOI of 1 for 16 hr. The cells were subsequently washed and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche, Mannheim, Germany], 0.5 U/ml RNasin [Promega]). Lysate was incubated for 30 min on ice, cleared by centrifugation for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. At this stage a small fraction of the input was collected for protein and RNA extraction. 5 μg of M2-anti-FLAG (Sigma) or IgG1 isotype control antibody was added to 500 μl of lysate and incubated on a rotating shaker for 1 hr at 4°C. 300 μl of washed Gamma Bind Plus Sepharose Beads (GE Healthcare Bioscience AB) were then added to the mixture for another 1 hr. The beads were then precipitated by centrifugation and washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The beads were then split into two samples for protein or RNA extraction. Proteins were extracted from Protein/RNA complexes by boiling the beads for 5 min in SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis. RNAs were purified from the beads by Phenol/chlorophorm extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. RNA was then quantified using a Nanodrop apparatus and the same amount of RNA from each sample was tested for IFN stimulatory activity as indicated.</p><p>For the IP using recombinant LGP2, 5 μg of the purified protein was incubated with 20 μg of total EMCV-infected RNA (MOI 1; 16 hr) in lysis buffer for 1 hr at 4°C on a rotating shaker. The rest of the IP was performed the same way as for the LGP2 IP from infected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Deep sequencing of RNA</title><p>Input material pooled from five replicate cultures was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG or control IgG1 antibody (see above). RNA extracted from 10 independent IPs was pooled and ribosomal RNA was removed using Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Human.Mouse.Rat) (Epicenter RZH1046, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After ribosomal RNA removal, the RNA was tested for its ability to activate the IFN-β promoter luciferase reporter. The RNA was then prepared for Illumina sequencing using an optimised version of the original Directional mRNA-Seq Library Prep protocol (Pre-Release Protocol Rev.A). The original protocol was optimised from 1 μg of total RNA input to a total input of up to 173 ng. Reagents supplied by Illumina included 10× v1.5 sRNA 3′ Adaptor; SRA 5′ Adaptor; SRA RT primer; PCR Primer GX1/GX2. The remaining reagents recommended on the protocol were outsourced from alternative vendors. To analyse both coding and non-coding RNA regions, the poly(A) purification step was omitted. After fragmentation of the total RNA (optimised incubation of 2 min at 80°C), the RNA was checked for efficient fragmentation sizing, ribosomal RNA contamination and RIN using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer QC Pico RNA chip. After library preparation, the PCR reaction was optimised by replacing the recommended PCR polymerase with Kapa Hifi DNA Polymerase (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA) in addition to optimising the number of PCR cycles from 12 to 18 cycles using the recommended PCR cycling conditions. The final library preparation was then size selected at 150 bp–450 bp using a 2% Agarose E-gel (Invitrogen) to remove unwanted regions in excess of 500 bp which was detected using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer QC DNA 1000 chip. Next generation sequencing and library preparation was performed in the Advanced Sequencing Facility (ASF) at the London Research Institute on the Genome Analyzer IIx (GAIIx) with a single-end 72 bp sequencing run alongside a PhiX control of 1–5% in every lane of the flowcell. Sequencing typically generated ∼30 million 60 bp single-end reads.</p><p>Alignment to the EMCV strain pEC9 genome (genbank accession ID DQ288856) was performed using Bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>; version 0.12.7) permitting a maximum of three mismatches per read. Genome-wide coverage was calculated using the genomeCoverageBed function in BEDTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>; version 2.16.2) and all subsequent plots were generated using the statistical programming language, R (R core team 2012, R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; version 2.15). To generate more comparable data across samples the number of reads were normalised to the number of reads per million.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>An unpaired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic> test was used to determine statistically significant differences. p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In the manuscript “Identification of a natural MDA5 agonist in picornavirus infected cells”, Deddouche et al. investigate the properties of MDA5 stimulatory RNA during EMCV infection. The authors use total RNA of EMCV-infected HeLa cells as a source for natural MDA5 ligands, from which they purify RNA based on affinity for the RIG-I like receptor LGP2. The authors find that RNA bound to LGP2 is enriched for MDA5-dependent stimulatory activity. Using next-generation sequencing, the authors observe an enrichment of viral sequences in the precipitated RNA, and in particular of antisense-transcripts from the EMCV L-region. By employing deletion mutants for this region, as well as point mutants, they attribute the majority of MDA5-activity generated in EMCV-infected cells to the L-region antisense RNA. Of note, this feature is clearly independent of the L-Protein encoded therein.</p><p>The finding that a specific region transcribed from the EMCV genome functions as a natural and preferential ligand of LGP2/MDA5 is novel and significant. This represents an important step towards defining the ligand of LGP2 and MDA5. In addition to its conceptual novelty, the study is important because of many infectious diseases caused by positive strand RNA viruses. However, there are several major issues that should be addressed before the paper can be considered for publication.</p><p>1) As it stands now, the definition of this ‘L’ RNA ligand is still ‘fuzzy’. In particular, the authors stated that the L fragments generated by in vitro transcription or chemical synthesis did not stimulate the MDA5/LGP2 pathway. Thus, it is not clear what makes the L antisense RNA fragment a unique ligand for LGP2. At the minimum, the authors should perform deletion and/or point mutagenesis of the L RNA sequence to determine if there are specific sequence(s) in this region that renders it a good LGP2 ligand. The EMCV mutant Zn<sub>C19AC22A</sub> can be a good starting point for mutagenesis because this virus can induce IFN-β quite well. It is formally possible that any RNA sequence, when placed in this region, could be a ligand for LGP2. It is important to have a better characterization of the antisense L RNA fragment, especially given that this RNA could not be detected by Northern blotting and that currently there is no explanation for how this RNA is generated in the EMCV infected cells.</p><p>2) Of note, the study does not identify the EMCV RNA structure that activates MDA5 but the sequence that preferentially binds to LGP2. The authors should therefore amend the claim that it identities a natural MDA5 agonist, or that the L-region RNA itself constitutes an MDA5 agonist. Given that L-region RNA on its own fails to activate MDA5, one must assume that the antisense L-region RNA enriched by LGP2 is merely contained in the same RNA strand as the actual MDA5 agonist, which also remains unidentified. Does introduction of the antisense EMCV L-region into previously inactive RNA transcripts render them MDA5 agonists?</p><p>3) How long is the antisense L RNA that is proposed to be the LGP2 ligand? Is it a uniform size or heterogeneous? Is it possible that the RNA ligand is actually longer than those detected by RNA-seq because the parts of RNA not bound (protected) by LGP2 are degraded by RNases? This could be one of the reasons that the in vitro transcribed antisense L RNA has no activity.</p><p>4) While a lot of evidence is presented that suggests that LGP2 delivers the agonist to MDA5, no direct evidence is presented. Especially considering the fact that pure L region antisense fragment does not recapitulate the observed phenotype, more evidence is required to corroborate the claim that LGP2 serves as a means to preselect agonists for MDA5 activation in the context of EMCV infection. Is MDA5 associated with the RNA in the LGP2 pulldowns? Do MDA5 and LGP2 interact after ligand capture? Does this interaction induce the formation of MDA5 filaments or IFN expression?</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>: There is still a substantial level of IFN-β induction by the EMCV virus lacking the L RNA. Is this L-independent activity dependent on RIG-I or MDA5? If it is MDA5 or LGP2 dependent, it suggests that there are other MDA5 ligands in the virus infected cells. These could conceivably be dsRNA as previously thought as MDA5 ligands. Indeed, the authors showed that dsRNA isolated from EMCV infected cells induced IFN-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>6) In cells infected by EMCV virus lacking the L region, can the dsRNA and ssRNA be isolated from the gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>) and shown to stimulate IFN-β? This could help clarify where the antisense L RNA comes from and whether it has an indirect effect on the generation of dsRNA.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01535.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) As it stands now, the definition of this ‘L’ RNA ligand is still ‘fuzzy’.

It is important to have a better characterization of the antisense L RNA fragment, especially given that this RNA could not be detected by Northern blotting and that currently there is no explanation for how this RNA is generated in the EMCV infected cells</italic>.</p><p>We have now been able to generate an L region antisense RNA by in vitro transcription that possesses MDA5-stimulatory activity (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, an RNA sequence derived from the sense strand does not possess activity (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). As such, we can now state with more confidence that we have uncovered an MDA5 agonist in the form of RNA corresponding to the EMCV L antisense region. It is unclear why we had not succeeded in generating this agonist in our earlier experiments as the only “trick” that led to success was to use a primer that makes the transcript 4 nucleotides shorter than the one we had tried before. This means that there is additional work to be done in characterising the RNA in question and in determining the “rules” for MDA5 triggering. Such detailed characterisation will be the subject of future experiments.</p><p>In relation to the other comments by the reviewers, we agree that the mutagenesis study of Zn<sub>C19AC22A</sub> EMCV would provide useful information. However, this is not a trivial exercise as it involves the rescue of hundreds of viruses. As it is, we have found it quite problematic to rescue and grow the mutant virus, which grows poorly. Nevertheless, we do show that 3 different EMCV mutants that carry either full or partial deletion of the L acidic region or the L zinc domain all display impaired ability of the viral RNA to interact with LGP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>At the suggestion of the reviewers, we also tested if any RNA sequence when placed in the L region can trigger a strong interferon response. For this, we replaced the L region of EMCV with that of another picornavirus (foot and mouth disease virus).</p><p>Notably, this recombinant EMCV behaves much like the EMCVΔL virus (amended <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> of the paper), which indicates that the specific L region sequence of EMCV and not just the location within the genome is important for IFN production. We thank the reviewers for encouraging us to do this interesting experiment.</p><p>How the L antisense fragment is generated remains mysterious. We make this point clearer in the revised discussion by pointing out that nuclease digestion may be involved and that we are able to detect RNA smaller than the EMCV RNA full length ranging from 2000 to 200nts that light up with the L antisense probe (data not shown).</p><p><italic>2) Of note, the study does not identify the EMCV RNA structure that activates MDA5 but the sequence that preferentially binds to LGP2. The authors should therefore amend the claim that it identities a natural MDA5 agonist, or that the L-region RNA itself constitutes an MDA5 agonist. Given that L-region RNA on its own fails to activate MDA5, one must assume that the antisense L-region RNA enriched by LGP2 is merely contained in the same RNA strand as the actual MDA5 agonist, which also remains unidentified. Does introduction of the antisense EMCV L-region into previously inactive RNA transcripts render them MDA5 agonists</italic>?</p><p>We thank the reviewers for these thoughtful comments. We feel that the claim that we have identified an MDA5 agonist is now warranted by the new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> showing that we can synthesise an MDA5 stimulatory RNA in vitro. But, as we do not show evidence of direct binding between MDA5 and the L antisense RNA, we have amended the title of the manuscript.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we also have tried to introduce the EMCV L antisense sequence into a heterologous RNA. For that experiment, we chose to introduce it into the influenza virus NS segment, a known RIG-I agonist. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, however, the resulting RNA remains firmly dependent on RIG-I and not MDA5 for its stimulatory activity. This may mean that the sequence needs to be somehow processed or released to trigger an MDA5 dependent response and this does not happen in the context of the flu NS segment.</p><p><italic>3) How long is the antisense L RNA that is proposed to be the LGP2 ligand? Is it a uniform size or heterogeneous? Is it possible that the RNA ligand is actually longer than those detected by RNA-seq because the parts of RNA not bound (protected) by LGP2 are degraded by RNases? This could be one of the reasons that the in vitro transcribed antisense L RNA has no activity</italic>.</p><p>We can indeed not exclude that partial degradation of the RNA does take place and that LGP2 protects a fragment of 171 nucleotides as revealed by our sequencing data. However, the fact that we can now synthesise this fragment and reveal stimulatory activity confirms that it is sufficiently long to activate MDA5. It is remains possible that the LGP2 agonist is actually smaller than 171nts. The full characterisation of this RNA will require further work, which we feel is beyond the scope of the present report.</p><p><italic>4) While a lot of evidence is presented that suggests that LGP2 delivers the agonist to MDA5, no direct evidence is presented. Especially considering the fact that pure L region antisense fragment does not recapitulate the observed phenotype, more evidence is required to corroborate the claim that LGP2 serves as a means to preselect agonists for MDA5 activation in the context of EMCV infection. Is MDA5 associated with the RNA in the LGP2 pulldowns? Do MDA5 and LGP2 interact after ligand capture? Does this interaction induce the formation of MDA5 filaments or IFN expression</italic>?</p><p>To address the reviewers’ comments, we have tried to co-immunoprecipitate MDA5 and LGP2. To do this, we have coexpressed FLAG-tagged LGP2 together with HA-tagged MDA5 in HeLa cells but, oddly, we lose MDA5 detection when the cells are infected with EMCV (data not shown). We do not know the reason for this phenomenon but attribute it to the capacity of MDA5 to form insoluble filaments upon activation that are lost from the lysate during preclearing. We have attempted to circumvent the issue by using lysate from uninfected cells that has been spiked with RNA from EMCV infected Vero cells prior to MDA5 or LGP2 immunoprecipitation but this has failed to reveal any co-precipitation (data not shown). Because these experiments are negative they remain inconclusive and, therefore, we have not included them in the paper. Thus, we do not at present have proof that LGP2/MDA5/RNA form a tripartite complex and, consequently, have amended the term “complex” throughout the text. It is in fact possible that LGP2 acts upstream of MDA5 to remodel agonistic RNA or that its interaction with MDA5 is very transient and unlikely to be captured by biochemical means. We now refer to these possibilities in the revised Discussion. We thank the reviewers for allowing us to clarify the issue.</p><p><italic>5)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C</italic></xref><italic>: There is still a substantial level of IFN-β induction by the EMCV virus lacking the L RNA.
