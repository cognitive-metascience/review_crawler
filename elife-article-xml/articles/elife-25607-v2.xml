protein-coding transcripts. Here, we systematically characterize transcriptional dynamics during hematopoiesis and in hematological malignancies. Our analysis of annotated and de novo assembled lncRNAs showed many are regulated during differentiation and mis-regulated in disease. We assessed lncRNA function via an in vivo RNAi screen in a model of acute myeloid leukemia. This identified several lncRNAs essential for leukemia maintenance, and found that a number act by promoting leukemia stem cell signatures. Leukemia blasts show a myeloid differentiation phenotype when these lncRNAs were depleted, and our data indicates that this effect is mediated via effects on the MYC oncogene. Bone marrow reconstitutions showed that a lncRNA expressed across all progenitors was required for the myeloid lineage, whereas the other leukemia-induced lncRNAs were dispensable in the normal setting.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lncRNA</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>leukemia</kwd><kwd>c-Myc</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delás</surname><given-names>M Joaquina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010434</institution-id><institution>“la Caixa” Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Studies Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delás</surname><given-names>M Joaquina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-2016-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sabin</surname><given-names>Leah R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HG007650</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hannon</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hannon</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hannon</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wolfson Professorship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hannon</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A comprehensive analysis of long noncoding RNAs in the hematopoietic system reveals their dynamic regulation and a loss-of-function screen identifies some required for leukemia progression and involved in normal myeloid differentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as an additional layer of regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rinn and Chang, 2012</xref>). Although their definition is rather arbitrary – transcripts longer than 200 bp with little or no evidence of protein coding capacity – their reported functions are essential and diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang and Chang, 2011</xref>). A number of different roles have been ascribed to lncRNAs during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fatica and Bozzoni, 2014</xref>) yet the function of most lncRNAs remains unexplored. Their cell-type-specific expression has encouraged the study of lncRNA function during development, where lncRNAs important for dendritic cell specification, epidermal, and cardiac differentiation have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grote et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klattenhoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kretz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Several recent large-scale cataloging efforts have highlighted how lncRNAs are also differentially expressed in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Du et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yan et al., 2015</xref>), with a few being the subject of more detailed mechanistic studies. In breast cancer models, <italic>HOTAIR</italic> has been shown to promote metastasis through re-location of PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>), and <italic>PVT1</italic> expression correlates with MYC protein levels and influences its stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tseng et al., 2014</xref>). In T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), expression analysis revealed many Notch-regulated lncRNAs. Amongst them, <italic>LUNAR</italic> was shown to act as an enhancer-like RNA, activating expression of <italic>IGF1R</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trimarchi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Development of T-ALL is not the only aspect of hematopoiesis regulated by lncRNAs. <italic>lncRNA-EPS</italic> promotes survival and inhibits apoptosis in murine fetal erythroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hu et al., 2011</xref>) and represses key immune genes in macrophages to restrain inflammation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atianand et al., 2016</xref>). In humans, <italic>lncRNA-DC</italic> is required for dendritic cell differentiation through its binding to STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Global analyses showed GENCODE-annotated lncRNAs to be regulated in mouse early hematopoietic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2014</xref>). Further studies have carried out de novo assemblies of the lncRNA repertoire in murine erythroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez-Dominguez et al., 2014</xref>), erythro-megakaryocytic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paralkar et al., 2014</xref>), and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), where two novel lncRNAs were characterized and found to regulate HSC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A comprehensive analysis of lncRNA dynamics through normal and malignant hematopoiesis has yet to be reported. The murine hematopoietic system is a very well characterized model of stem and progenitor cell differentiation. Decades of research have provided information on many of the genes that govern the maintenance of HSCs, as well as downstream differentiation events. Many of the same transcription factors required for progenitor self renewal and specification are involved in malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krivtsov et al., 2006</xref>). This makes hematopoiesis an excellent context for a systematic comparison of lncRNA function in normal development and cancer.</p><p>We sought to identify de novo the lncRNAs expressed during the differentiation of both the myeloid and lymphoid hematopoietic lineages, as well as those lncRNAs that are characteristic of transformed cells, using models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and B-cell lymphoma. This transcriptome analysis revealed a large number of lncRNAs that are tightly regulated during hematopoietic cell-fate choices. As a first approach to identify functionally relevant lncRNAs, we decided to focus on an in vivo model of murine AML.</p><p>AML is often driven by fusion transcription factors or chromatin modifiers, such as MLL-AF9, that maintain an aberrant transcriptional landscape in transformed cells. Consequently, interfering with these chromatin-modifying complexes can lead to a substantial reduction in proliferation of these cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dawson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zuber et al., 2011c</xref>). Interestingly, one of the reported functions for lncRNAs is the regulation of gene activity through interactions on chromatin. For example, lncRNAs <italic>HOTTIP</italic> and <italic>HoxBLinc</italic>, have been shown to activate expression of Hox genes by mediating recruitment of histone methyltransferase complexes WDR5-MLL and Setd1a/MLL1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), and <italic>HOTAIR</italic> regulates the chromatin landscape via recruitment of PRC2 and the LSD1/CoREST/REST complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rinn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsai et al., 2010</xref>). As lncRNAs have been associated with chromatin regulation, it seemed possible that these might play a role in enforcing the aberrant transcriptional landscape in AML.</p><p>Our systematic analysis of lncRNA transcription in hematopoietic differentiation and AML revealed large numbers of lncRNAs misregulated in diseased or shared between AML and normal cell types. To test whether lncRNAs could regulate the disease state, we used the MLL-AF9-driven AML model to perform an in vivo shRNA screen. We chose a set of 120 lncRNAs with varying expression patterns and levels, and identified several lncRNAs required for maintaining leukemia proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of several lncRNAs needed for AML proliferation in vitro resulted in patterns of differentiation that mimicked those that occurred upon reduction in the activity of well-established oncogenic drivers. We performed bone marrow reconstitutions for the three lncRNAs showing this phenotype and found that the lncRNA with expression across multiple hematopoietic progenitors to be required for the myeloid lineage, while the two leukemia-induced lncRNAs were dispensable in the normal setting. Collectively, this study serves as a framework for further mechanistic studies of the roles of lncRNAs in hematological malignancies and normal differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A comprehensive catalog of lncRNAs in the hematopoietic system</title><p>To characterize the lncRNA repertoire and assess how different non-coding transcripts are regulated during hematopoietic differentiation and disease, we produced a comprehensive catalog of murine hematopoietic lncRNAs.

Assembled gene models that overlapped with GENCODE coding gene models in the same orientation were discarded.

This validated our assembly pipeline. Interestingly, over half of the lncRNAs assembled were unique to our study, likely due to our sequencing depth and the number of new cell types included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We next used ATACseq data to assess chromatin accessibility at these lncRNA loci. These datasets included some of the same cell types that we analyzed, including the oligopotent myeloid progenitors, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (LSK) fraction (less pure than our LT-HSC), and differentiated cell types from both myeloid and lymphoid lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lara-Astiaso et al., 2014</xref>). A meta analysis of transcriptional start sites (TSSs) within our full lncRNA catalog revealed a correlated open chromatin signal in every cell type with ATACseq data. The number of lncRNAs in our catalog that showed enrichment varied between cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which is to be expected given that each expresses only a subset of lncRNAs. We performed the same analysis for the start of the second exon as a control region, and no signal above background was observed.</p><p>LncRNAs can have a number of different relationships to their neighboring protein coding genes. They can fall in intergenic regions, be divergently or convergently transcribed, they can overlap in antisense orientation (interspersed), or they can have the same orientation as the neighboring gene, upstream or downstream. To address the possibility that the open chromatin signatures we observed were exclusively the result of regulatory regions being shared between lncRNAs and neighboring protein-coding genes, we performed our analysis independently for each category of lncRNA defined above. Irrespective of their relationship to surrounding protein-coding genes, our assembled lncRNAs showed enrichment in ATACseq signal at their presumed TSS in at least one cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1﻿</xref>).</p><p>Using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Love et al., 2014</xref>), we performed principal component analysis (PCA) based on the 500 most variable protein-coding genes or lncRNAs from our catalog. The lymphoid differentiated cell types CD3, PreB, and ProB clustered together and clearly separated from the myeloid differentiated cell type Gr1 and the progenitors. Despite having very different functional properties, oligopotent progenitors and long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) are found in close proximity, indicating that they share some transcriptional programs. Interestingly, the closest progenitors to the lymphoid differentiated cluster were the common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs). The acute myeloid leukemia samples, both in vivo (AML) and in vitro (RN2 cell line), clustered closest to the granulocyte macrophage progenitor (GMP) population, consistent with previous reports for this AML model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krivtsov et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left). PCA based on lncRNA rather than coding gene expression replicated all the aforementioned features, indicating that lncRNA expression patterns are overall very similar to those of coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right). To confirm the identity of our sorted progenitor populations, we additionally compared the expression signatures from our data with previously published microarray data for these same cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gazit et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In general, our data was in substantial agreement with prior microarray datasets with the exception of those from CLPs. Notably, CLPs were the one cell type where our staining strategy and isolation protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) differed from those used in the previous report. Overall, we have produced a comprehensive catalog of lncRNAs in the hematopoietic system that can serve as a foundation for understanding non-coding RNA function in these very well characterized cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>lncRNAs and coding genes show similar expression patterns across hematopoietic differentiation</title><p>To understand the dynamics of lncRNA expression during hematopoietic development, we performed expression module analysis based on our RNAseq datasets. We identified differentially expressed lncRNAs and protein-coding genes that showed the same expression patterns. The modules followed expected groupings, with enriched expression in either myeloid, lymphoid, or progenitor compartments. When representing the 15% most variable lncRNAs within each module and the same number of coding genes, we identify many genes that are well-established drivers of hematopoietic differentiation and progenitor maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

A general model has even been proposed, whereby divergent lncRNAs regulate the expression of the associated coding gene during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luo et al., 2016</xref>). When we examined expression levels across cell types between lncRNAs and their closest gene neighbors, we indeed detected some level of correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, this correlation was not exclusive to divergent transcripts, as a similar level of correlation was observed for other genomic organizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the AML datasets, we observed enriched binding of transcription factors known to play a role in maintaining the transcriptional landscape of this model of leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roe et al., 2015</xref>) around the TSS of lncRNAs in our catalog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To explore this possibility, we performed differential expression analysis and identified lncRNAs that were enriched in hematopoietic stem cells, shared by the progenitor populations while showing lower expression in differentiated cell types, or enriched exclusively in the lymphoid compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

We also chose lncRNAs with different relative expression levels ranging from abundant to lowly expressed. We used the shERWOOD algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knott et al., 2014</xref>) to predict highly potent shRNAs targeting each lncRNA candidate. Because of the high isoform complexity in our assembled lncRNA catalog, a common characteristic of lncRNA assemblies, we could not simply predict on each individual transcript model assembled by our pipeline. We reasoned that targeting the regions of highest RNAseq coverage would maximize our chances of silencing the most abundant isoforms for each candidate. We also wanted the shRNA resource that we built to be applicable for studies beyond AML. Given the cell-type specificity observed in our data, we therefore decided to combine all reads for each lncRNA across libraries prior to coverage calculations, so as to focus our predictions on the most highly included exons.</p><p>We designed, cloned and sequence verified a library containing at least four hairpins per lncRNA into a doxycycline-inducible retroviral vector.

To enable the study of this impact and breadth of function in a well-characterized developmental model, we have produced a de novo catalog of lncRNAs from a representative sampling of cell types throughout the hematopoietic lineage and from two models of hematological malignancies. To globally characterize the likely impact of lncRNAs in normal and malignant hematopoiesis, we chose a subset of RNAs with a range of expression levels and patterns and tested whether these had a function in a murine model of AML. We performed a loss-of-function screen of 120 candidates and found that 20 of these were required for in vivo leukemia progression. We further characterized nine lncRNAs, all of which were required for leukemia cell proliferation in vitro but were dispensable in at least one other unrelated cancer model. A subset of these lncRNAs functioned in maintaining leukemia stem cell signatures; the leukemic blasts acquired a myeloid differentiated phenotype upon lncRNA knockdown. Amongst such lncRNAs was <italic>Pvt1</italic>, which has been shown previously to act via the transcription factor MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tseng et al., 2014</xref>). This also appeared true in our model, as enforced expression of MYC rescued the proliferation and differentiation phenotypes observed upon depletion of <italic>Pvt1</italic>. Although the same phenotype, including Myc-mediated rescue, was also observed for two other lncRNAs (<italic>Lilam</italic> and <italic>Pilna</italic>) in leukemia, only <italic>Pilna</italic> showed an effect in normal reconstitution of the myeloid lineage. This is consistent with the progenitor-wide expression of <italic>Pilna</italic> and suggests a general role in hematopoiesis for this lncRNA. Expression of lncRNAs <italic>Pvt1</italic> and <italic>Lilam</italic> is highly induced in the leukemia context and they could, on the other hand, be dispensable for normal myelogenesis.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Regulation of lncRNA expression</title><p>Expression analysis of our annotated lncRNAs revealed that differential regulation between cell types and at different stages of differentiation. Much attention has been focused on noncoding RNAs transcribed in the opposite orientation from the same promoter region as coding transcripts, known as divergent transcripts. This raises questions regarding whether these noncoding transcripts are truly functional, or whether they are simply a byproduct of transcription from an activated promoter. Expression of divergent lncRNAs has been shown to correlate with their corresponding protein-coding counterparts, and even to regulate their counterparts in pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Casero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dinger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sigova et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We indeed find a correlation between lncRNA expression and that of the closest protein-coding gene; however, this is not an exclusive property of divergent transcripts. We also observe correlation for other lncRNA-gene genomic orientations, as well as for gene-gene pairs. We therefore hypothesize that this correlation in expression arises from shared regulatory mechanisms or common regulatory environments. For the two divergent lncRNAs amongst the ones we characterized, we did not find evidence for <italic>cis</italic> regulation of their corresponding divergent gene.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>lncRNA dependencies in AML</title><p>We probed the functional relevance of lncRNAs using AML as a model. By performing an shRNA screen targeting 120 lncRNAs, we identified 20 lncRNAs whose expression confers a proliferative advantage to leukemia cells in vivo. This was striking particularly because we did not solely target AML-enriched lncRNAs but rather cast our net broadly. Thus, our findings emphasize the general importance for lncRNAs in leukemia and possibly normal hematopoiesis. We tested whether the lncRNAs that impacted AML were also required for proliferation of the breast cancer cell line 4T1. In this model, we observed no significant effect of knockdown. This could be due to cell type-restricted expression or function but can be taken as support for the specificity of the effects observed in AML.</p><p>Three lncRNAs emerged as candidates required for leukemia progression, as their depletion led to leukemic blast differentiation. Amongst these was <italic>Pvt1</italic>, a lncRNA previously reported to be a marker of poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Takahashi et al., 2014</xref>) and shown to be required in MYC-driven cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tseng et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanism for human <italic>PVT1</italic> function, as shown in breast cancer, involves <italic>PVT1</italic> stabilization of the MYC protein. We observe a similar effect in our leukemia model, with MYC protein levels being disproportionately reduced when <italic>PVT1</italic> is depleted.</p><p>Enforced expression Myc rescued the effects of <italic>Pvt1</italic>, as well as <italic>Lilam</italic> and <italic>Pilna,</italic> knockdown in MLL-AF9 leukemia cells. This suggests that these lncRNAs have a direct or indirect functional relationship with Myc, an oncogene upon which this AML model heavily depends. This finding adds a layer to the already complex regulatory landscape of AML, and fits in with published results that have shown similar phenotypes when Myc levels are reduced by disturbing bromodomain containing 4 (Brd4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zuber et al., 2011c</xref>) or the Myc superhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shi et al., 2013</xref>). lncRNA <italic>Pilna</italic>, but not <italic>Pvt1</italic> and <italic>Lilam</italic> are required for the myeloid lineage during bone marrow reconstitution. This is consistent with the pan-progenitor expression of this lncRNA in contrast with the AML-specific nature of <italic>Pvt1</italic> and <italic>Lilam</italic>. Further studies will be required to determine the breadth of lncRNA roles in the hematopoietic system, though this gives us reason to believe that the normal setting, just like AML, will be heavily dependent on these non-coding transcripts.</p><p>Considered as a whole, we have produced an extensive resource of lncRNA expression in the hematopoietic system and demonstrated that a substantial percentage of these are functional, at least in a model of malignant development. One of these lncRNAs, expressed across most hematopoietic progenitors, is additionally required in myeloid reconstitution. The data and tools that we have produced should serve a useful purpose in promoting studies in both the normal and leukemic context.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal work</title><p>Tissue extraction for transcriptome studies and the in vivo shRNA screen were performed in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories (NY, USA).

MYC values are internally normalized to the B-ACTIN within each lane.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Isolation, infection and short-term culture and transplantation of HSCs</title><p>Bone marrow from C57BL6 mice was extract by flushing, filtered through a 0.30 μm filter and lineage depleted (Mouse Lineage depletion kit, Milteny Biotec 130-090-858). Cells were stained with EPCR-PE, CD45-APC, CD150-PE/Cy7 and CD48-FITC. DAPI or LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Scientific L34963) was used for dead cell exclusion. Sorting of highly pure E-SLAM HSC and sort-term (&lt;24 hr) culture was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kent et al., 2009</xref>). In short, 1000 alive EPCR +CD45+CD150+CD48- lineage negative cells were sorted in 100 μl of media: Iscove modified Dulbecco medium supplemented with 10 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/mL insulin, and 200 g/mL transferrin, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin [purchased as BIT from StemCell Technologies], and 10<sup>−4</sup> M β–mercaptoethanol (Gibco) plus 20 ng/mL interleukin-11 (IL-11; R and D Systems) and 300 ng/mL Steel factor (R&amp;D Systems)). Ultracentrifuged viral supernatant was added aiming at a final concentration of ~2×10<sup>7</sup> IU/ml following the sorting. Each well was used to inject four animals; cells were washed prior to injecting to remove remaining viral particles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Peripheral blood extract and flow cytometry analysis</title><p>Blood was analyzed starting from 4 weeks after transplantation and every 4 weeks thereafter. 50–75 μl of blood was extracted from the animals’ tail vein into heparin coated capillary tubes. Red blood cell lysis was performed using Ammonium Chloride Solution (Stem Cell Technologies). Samples were then stained with a pre-mix antibody cocktail and analysed in a LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences). Flow data analysis was performed using FlowJo and statistical analysis using R Studio.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Antibodies used for flow cytometry analysis and sorting</title><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"><bold>Name</bold></th><th valign="bottom"><bold>Antigen</bold></th><th valign="bottom"><bold>Company</bold></th><th valign="bottom"><bold>Clone</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom"> Sca1 PE</td><td valign="bottom">Ly-6A/E (Sca-1)</td><td valign="bottom">eBioscience</td><td valign="bottom">D7</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> cKit APC</td><td valign="bottom">cKit/CD117</td><td valign="bottom">eBioscience</td><td valign="bottom">2B8</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> CD150 PE-Cy7</td><td valign="bottom">CD150</td><td valign="bottom">Biolegend</td><td valign="bottom">TC15-12F12.2</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> CD48 FITC</td><td valign="bottom">CD48</td><td valign="bottom">Biolegend</td><td valign="bottom">HM48-1</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> IL7Ra/CD127 PerCP-Cy5.5</td><td valign="bottom">CD127 (IL7Ra)</td><td valign="bottom">eBioscience</td><td valign="bottom">A7R34</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> cKit APC-Cy7</td><td valign="bottom">cKit/CD117</td><td valign="bottom">Biolegend</td><td valign="bottom">2B8</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> CD34 eFluor450</td><td valign="bottom">CD34</td><td valign="bottom">eBioscience</td><td valign="bottom">RAM34</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> FgRg FITC</td><td valign="bottom">CD16/CD32 (FcgRII/III)</td><td valign="bottom">eBioscience</td><td valign="bottom">clone 93</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> CD3 Pacific Blue</td><td valign="bottom">CD3</td><td valign="bottom">Biolegend</td><td valign="bottom">17A2</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> Gr1 Alexa Fluor 700</td><td valign="bottom">Ly-6G/Ly-6C (Gr-1)</td><td valign="bottom">Biolegend</td><td valign="bottom">RB6-8C5</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> IgM eFluor450</td><td valign="bottom">IgM</td><td valign="bottom">eBioscience</td><td valign="bottom">eB121-15F9</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> B220 Alexa Fluor 700</td><td valign="bottom">CD45R (B220)</td><td valign="bottom">Biolegend</td><td valign="bottom">RA3-6B2</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> CD43 FITC</td><td valign="bottom">CD43</td><td valign="bottom">eBioscience</td><td valign="bottom">eBioR2/60</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> CD11b/Mac-1 PE-Cy7</td><td valign="bottom">CD11b (Mac-1)</td><td valign="bottom">Biolegend</td><td valign="bottom">M1/70</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> EPCR-PE</td><td valign="bottom">EPCR</td><td valign="bottom">Stem Cell Tech</td><td valign="bottom">RMEMPCR1560</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> CD45-APC</td><td valign="bottom">CD45</td><td valign="bottom">eBiosciences</td><td valign="bottom">30-F11</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> Ly6G-APC/Cy7</td><td valign="bottom">Ly6G</td><td valign="bottom">eBiosciences</td><td valign="bottom">1A8</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> CD45.1-PE</td><td valign="bottom">CD45.1</td><td valign="bottom">eBiosciences</td><td valign="bottom">A20</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> CD45.2-BV421</td><td valign="bottom">CD45.2</td><td valign="bottom">eBiosciences</td><td valign="bottom">104</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>ATAC-seq data processing</title><p>ATAC-seq libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lara-Astiaso et al., 2014</xref>) were first adaptor trimmed with trim-galore (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/</ext-link>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Juan Valcárcel (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jan-Henning Klusmann (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Joint review:</p><p>In their study, Delas et al. systematically characterize lncRNAs expression during mouse hematopoiesis and in a well-established mouse model for AML (MLL-AF9/NRAS G12D). Their analysis of previously annotated and de novo assembled lncRNAs led them to uncover several lncRNAs with a specific expression pattern during differentiation and in AML. To investigate the function of 120 lncRNAs with such a specific expression pattern they performed a shRNA in vivo screening, using the same MLL-AF9/NRAS G12D mouse model. They identified 20 lncRNAs whose knock down by at least two hairpins reduces leukemia cell proliferation in vivo, possibly related to the maintenance of a leukemic stem cell state (and inhibition of a myeloid differentiated phenotype). 14 out of these were further validated in one cell line in in vitro competition assays. Mechanistically they linked the function of three of their candidate lncRNAs (Pilna, Pvt1 and Lilam) to the expression of MYC.</p><p>These data provide a useful resource for scientists working on hematopoiesis, leukemias and lncRNA biology and provide a proof of principle that specific lncRNAs can play distinct roles in leukemia cell maintenance, in addition to more general functions during hematopoiesis. There have been of course previous efforts to map lncRNAs in both AML and hematopoietic stem cells, as well as reports arguing for a crucial regulatory role for pvt1 in MYC-driven cancers, affecting novelty of some of the data. Nevertheless, the study remains relevant, as it can facilitate understanding the function of lncRNAs in normal and malignant hematopoiesis, which is to date poorly understood. Technically the in vivo screening was thoroughly conducted (including the use of pools of 50 shRNAs) and the candidates well chosen.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>The manuscript will benefit from addressing issues of validation and generality of the results and from additional functional characterization of the lncRNAs. Specifically:</p><p>1) Validation issues.a) Previous studies have demonstrated that lncRNA prediction based on de novo assembly of RNAseq data has a high frequency of false predictions. A recent study showed that the accuracy greatly improved by combining the RNAseq data with CAGE data (Hon et al. Nature 2017). Thus, alignment of the newly identified lncRNAs with the CAGE signals would greatly increase the confidence of their resource.</p><p>b) A major caveat for shRNA targeting of lncRNAs is the inefficiency for targeting nuclear lncRNAs due to the fact that the RNAi machinery is mostly cytoplasmic. It would be important to further document the general validity of their shRNA approach to efficiently knockdown nuclear lncRNAs (e.g. are most of the lncRNA candidates biased towards cytoplasmic lncRNA function compared to nuclear roles?). Given the high isoform complexity, the authors should comment to what extent the levels of different regions/isoforms of key lncRNAs are depleted when targeted by shRNAs directed against regions of highest RNAseq coverage.</p><p>c) As suggested previously, RNAi has some disadvantages in knocking down lncRNAs, and relying on a single methodology for all the experiments increases the likelihood of false positives. Therefore, the authors should provide an alternative approach to validate the loss of function of these lncRNA candidates, for example antisense oligonucleotides, CRISPRi and paired-guide RNA CRISPR-Cas9 (see Liu et al. Science 2017 and Zhu et al. Nat Biotech 2016).</p><p>2) Generality issues.a) They only utilized a single murine cell line model, and it will be beneficial to include another murine AML cell line to exclude cell line-specific bias in these studies. Also, in this paper, the authors claim that Lilam and Pvt1 are AML-specific but have only demonstrated the specificity with one breast cancer cell line; however other groups have shown crucial roles of Pvt1 in ovarian, cervical and colorectal cancer. To claim specificity, the authors should test if knockdown of Lilam and PVT1 is required in other hematopoietic lineages or cell types.</p><p>b) PVT1, as previously mentioned is also annotated in human cancers and it would be great to see if this phenomenon is translated into human AMLs (e.g. targeting PVT1 or/and the other lncRNAs in a panel of human MLL-AF9 cell lines).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25607.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>The manuscript will benefit from addressing issues of validation and generality of the results and from additional functional characterization of the lncRNAs.

Others, particularly stem/progenitor populations, are too rare to enable us to obtain sufficient material for conventional CAGE protocols.</p><p>Regarding the confidence in our current lncRNA catalog, our assembly is based on two types of RNA sequencing libraries, one of them produced using template switching RT (SMARTer kit from Clontech, see Chenchik et al., 1998). This strategy is specifically designed to capture full-length cDNA. Additionally, we required each individual transcript model to be independently assembled in different samples, dramatically decreasing the likelihood of false predictions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) A major caveat for shRNA targeting of lncRNAs is the inefficiency for targeting nuclear lncRNAs due to the fact that the RNAi machinery is mostly cytoplasmic.

The main focus of our work was to identify functional lncRNAs where depletion of the RNA had a robust, penetrant phenotype. We therefore felt RNAi was the best approach available, even if we could potentially be biased to cytoplasmic RNAs. Nonetheless, we have tried to address the sub cellular localization of our top candidate lncRNAs by single molecule RNA FISH and sub-cellular fractionations. However, being suspension cells with large nuclei and very little cytoplasma, the RNA FISH was inconclusive, as we could not distinguish perinuclear from true cytoplasmic or nuclear signals. Our multiple attempts at sub cellular fractionation of AML cells, with several protocols, have been unsuccessful, perhaps also due to their unusual nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio.</p><p>Regarding the second point, directing the shRNAs towards areas of highest coverage was meant to capture as many isoforms as possible. Consequently, we tend to have more shRNAs in areas that would affect most predicted isoforms. When looking both at qRT-PCR or transcriptome coverage, we can see different transcript areas equally affected. For example, for Pvt1, both hairpins are located in the same area, with shRNA 1 having a stronger knockdown than shRNA 9. However, the level of knockdown is relatively consistent between primer pairs, even though primer set 2 is located spanning two exons ~ 10kb upstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(<bold>A</bold>) Pvt1 genomic organization as predicted by our lncRNA catalog and reported on GENCODE, with the shRNA and primer locations indicated.</title><p>A representative transcriptome coverage plot used for de novo transcriptome assembly is shown.

For that reason, we evaluated every phenotype with two independent shRNAs and we carefully checked knock down with different primer sets.</p><p>We have additionally made a considerable effort in trying to establish CRISPRi to further validate our results, as suggested by the reviewers. To this end, we transduced our AML cells with a Cas9-KRAB expression vector, which also expresses Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) in a bicistronic fashion (using P2A). We then transduced these cells with a vector expressing sgRNAs against the start site of each lncRNA, against a negative control gene (human olfatory receptor 10A4, OR10A4), or our positive control Replication Protein A3 (RPA3). For RPA3, we used a published sgRNA from Liu et al. Science 2017.</p><p>Even after 14 days post sgRNA transduction, the% of sgRNA and dCas9-KRAB expressing cells remained above 50% for the positive control, RPA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). This is in stark contrast to our shRNA-mediated proliferation assay where less than 10% of shRNA-expressing cell remain after just two days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of the original paper). Upon analysis of our sgRNA-expressing cells, reductions in transcript levels were very modest (if occurring at all).</p><p>Most of our targeted lncRNAs show a slight depletion trend. Given the very mild effect on our positive control, this does not seem surprising. It is possible, though uncertain, that we might eventually optimize CRISPRi in our cell types, but as of now, we have been unsuccessful at applying this approach as a complement to shRNA.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Proliferation assay for AML cells expressing dCas9-KRAB and sgRNAs targeting the indicated genes/lncRNAs.</title><p>Percentage of cells expressing the sgRNA (zsGreen) was monitored over time. Although we made clonal cell line of dCas9-KRAB to ensure they all carry the transgene, we observed silencing of the CFP reporter.

Also, in this paper, the authors claim that Lilam and Pvt1 are AML-specific but have only demonstrated the specificity with one breast cancer cell line; however other groups have shown crucial roles of Pvt1 in ovarian, cervical and colorectal cancer. To claim specificity, the authors should test if knockdown of Lilam and PVT1 is required in other hematopoietic lineages or cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed proliferation assays following the same set up as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> (main text) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> (constitute lncRNA knockdown) in two other AML models (kind gifts from Johannes Zuber), which had not been incorporated to the main text.</p><p>Regarding the AML-specificity of Lilam and Pvt1, we did not mean to imply that these lncRNAs had a function specific to AML versus other cancers, rather that their expression was higher in AML than in the rest of the hematopoietic lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> Main text) and they were required for AML but not for normal myelogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> Main text).
