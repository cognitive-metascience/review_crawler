Its malfunction causes the severe ciliopathy Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). The complex acts as a cargo adapter that recognizes signaling proteins such as GPCRs and links them to the intraflagellar transport machinery. The underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we present a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of a human heterohexameric core subcomplex of the BBSome. The structure reveals the architecture of the complex in atomic detail. It explains how the subunits interact with each other and how disease-causing mutations hamper this interaction. The complex adopts a conformation that is open for binding to membrane-associated GTPase Arl6 and a large positively charged patch likely strengthens the interaction with the membrane. A prominent negatively charged cleft at the center of the complex is likely involved in binding of positively charged signaling sequences of cargo proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BBSome</kwd><kwd>ciliary transport</kwd><kwd>GCPR</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>Arl6</kwd><kwd>membrane</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raunser</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of the human BBSome explains how the subunits interact with each other and how disease-causing mutations hamper this interaction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ciliary research had a rocky trail to travel since the discovery of cilia in 1675 as the first known organelle by Antony Van Leeuwenhoek. Although primary cilia have long been thought to be only minor players in the cellular opera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood, 2009</xref>), they perform key functions as cellular antennae. Primary cilia contain a plethora of crucial signaling proteins with important sensory and regulatory functions particularly in development and cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Satir, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nachury, 2014</xref>). Since cilia do not contain a protein synthesis machinery, a key question of ciliary research is how proteins are transported to, from and within the cilium. The BBSome is a cargo adaptor that recognizes a diverse set of membrane-bound ciliary proteins. It binds with its cargo to the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex, a large heterooligomeric protein complex that is transported along ciliary microtubules by the molecular motors dynein and kinesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wingfield et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stepanek and Pigino, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the BBSome is also involved in the assembly and stabilization of the IFT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wei et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ou et al., 2005</xref>), with varying impact on IFT stability in different organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wei et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Williams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lechtreck et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>It has been proposed that the BBSome is assembled in a sequential order starting from a complex of BBS7, BBS chaperonins and the CCT/TRiC complex, which acts as a scaffold for further BBSome subunits to be added (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2012a</xref>). However, this route cannot hold true in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where the BBSome components BBS2 and BBS7 are missing. The lack of these domains in <italic>Drosophila</italic> raises in general the question whether these subunits are important for central BBsome functions such as cargo and membrane binding or if they are mostly involved in cilia-specific processes that require the interaction with the IFT complex. In line with this, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other organisms with a small number of ciliated cells lack the IFT proteins IFT25 and IFT27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), which are considered to be the anchor points for the BBSome on the IFT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liew et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eguether et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lechtreck, 2015</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that BBS2 and BBS7 perform functions that are mostly relevant in the context of the cilium, while the other BBSome subunits BBS1, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 18 represent a core complex with an independent set of functions, some of which might be relevant outside the cilium.</p><p>BBS1 emerged to be the most important BBSome subunit for cargo recognition, with several described interactions with ciliary cargo proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Su et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhogaraju et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ruat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2012b</xref>). The BBSome is recruited to membranes by the small GTPase Arl6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jin et al., 2010</xref>), which binds to the N-terminal β-propeller domain of BBS1. The crystal structures of this domain in complex with Arl6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mourão et al., 2014</xref>), as well as the β-propeller of BBS9 (24), provide the only currently available high-resolution structural information on BBSome subdomains. While this manuscript was in preparation, the medium-resolution structure of a BBSome complex purified from bovine retina was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chou et al., 2019</xref>). The structure revealed that BBS2 and BBS7 form a top lobe that blocks the Arl6 interaction site on BBS1. The complex, however, has been purified by affinity chromatography using Arl6 as bait. This suggests that the conformation of the BBsome in its apo state differs from that of the complex bound to Arl6.</p><p>Although the cryo-EM structure at 4.9 Å revealed the overall domain architecture of the complex, an atomic model could not be accurately built due to the limited resolution. However, this is needed to fully understand the interactions of the domains and the mechanism underlying cargo binding and membrane interaction.</p><p>We recently reconstituted a heterologously expressed core complex of the human BBSome, comprising the subunits BBS1, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klink et al., 2017</xref>). Although this complex lacks BBS2 and BBS7, it binds with up to sub-micromolar binding affinity to cargo proteins. In addition, we found that strongly binding ciliary trafficking motifs contain stretches of aromatic and positively charged residues, many of which were located in the third intracellular loop and the C-terminal domain of ciliary GPCRs. Multiple binding epitopes on cargo proteins cooperatively interact with multiple subunits of the BBSome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klink et al., 2017</xref>), which is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jin et al., 2010</xref>). A detailed insight of how these motifs interact with the BBSome requires a full molecular model of the complex to evaluate the potential interaction surfaces on the side-chain level.</p><p>Here we report the structure of the human BBSome core complex at an average resolution of 3.8 Å for BBS1, 4, 8, 9, and 18 and 4.3 Å for BBS5. The high quality of the map allowed us to build an atomic model of ~80% of the complex. The structure reveals the architecture of the complex and the sophisticated intertwined arrangement of its subunits. A large positively charged region on the surface of the complex suggests how it orients on the negatively charged ciliary membrane. We found that the complex adopts a conformation in which the Arl6 binding site would be accessible. The high-resolution structure allows us to accurately locate pathogenic patient mutations and to decipher how they perturb intra- and/or intermolecular interactions on the molecular level. We identified a negatively charged cleft in the center of the complex, which is positioned favorably for cargo interactions. Based on these findings, we propose a model for how membrane-bound ciliary cargo proteins like GPCRs can bind to the BBSome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Architecture of the BBSome core</title><p>To obtain suitable samples for high-resolution structural analysis, we chose to work on the BBSome core instead of the full complex, because the core, comprising BBS1, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 18 was considerably better soluble, more stable and homogeneous, but still bound with high affinity to Arl6 and cargo peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klink et al., 2017</xref>).

With only 92 residues of BBS18, there were 33 potential BBS18 sequence frames that could be assigned to the model. We generated all these 33 models, and further refined each of them using Phenix real-space refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) (<bold>C–F</bold>). The correlation of the map to the refined model showed a clear best fit for frame 22 (<bold>F</bold>). Indeed, model #22 agreed best to the observed density. In contrast, the other models showed significant deviations from map to model that cannot be explained by noise, imperfect modelling or a lack of resolution (e.g. obvious side chain density for a residue that should not produce such density; <bold>C,D</bold>). The second best fit (model #33) also presented obvious discrepancies with the map, and more importantly, several charged residues (e.g. D53 and E56 in model #33) are positioned in a highly unfavorable chemical environment (<bold>G</bold>).

BBS1 binds to the N-terminal end of the TPR superhelix formed by BBS4 via its N-terminal β-propeller domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), wraps around BBS4 and BBS8, and binds with its C-terminal GAE domain to the TPR domain of BBS8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C</xref>). BBS9 has a similar domain architecture as BBS1, with two additional domains at its C-terminus. The N-terminal β-propeller of BBS9 binds to the N-terminus of the TPR superhelix formed by BBS8, in analogy to the BBS1/BBS4 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). BBS9 wraps around BBS4 and parts of BBS1, and engulfs the GAE domain of BBS1 with its C-terminal GAE, platform and α-helical domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

This loop is not fully resolved in our structure, but can be partly visualized at lower resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A,B</xref>). Starting after the first TPR domain, it winds through the center of the complex and back to the following TPR domains. It interacts with BBS18 and with several TPRs of BBS8 and does not interrupt the TPR superhelix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Interestingly, the region around this loop varies in different human BBS8 splice variants, expressed in different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murphy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Riazuddin et al., 2010</xref>). For example, Exon 2a of BBS8 is only expressed in retina, resulting in an additional insert of 10 residues between helices 2 and 3 of BBS8, which is in direct proximity to the unmodeled density in our structure which we assign to the unstructured loop in BBS8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that the loop in BBS8 is also involved in tissue-specific functions of the BBSome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The C-terminus of BBS9 forms a GAE binding motif</title><p>A prominent feature in the core BBSome structure is the expanded domain arrangement of BBS1 and BBS9 which allows the wrapping of these subunits around the central BBS4 and BBS8 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). BBS1 and BBS9 interact with each other via their C-terminal domains (GAE, platform, and α-helical domain) in such a way that the β-propellers orient to the opposite direction locating to the periphery of the complex where they interact with the TPR domains of BBS4 and BBS8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The interaction of BBS1 with BBS9 is essential for the function of the BBSsome, as BBS1 mutations L518P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mykytyn et al., 2003</xref>) and N524Δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deveault et al., 2011</xref>) at the interface between the GAE domain of BBS1 and BBS9 are pathogenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>-C, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).

Indeed, in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knockenhauer and Schwartz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klink et al., 2017</xref>), it was shown that the isolated C-terminal region of BBS9, including the GAE domain, forms a dimer in solution. A superposition of BBS9 monomers reveals that an interaction via their GAE domains would not result in steric clashes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>). Taken together with our observation that the GAE domains strongly interact in the BBSome core complex, we propose that the strong heterodimeric interaction between the GAE domains is the reason for isolated BBS9 to homodimerize via its GAE domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>BBSome subcomplexes bind to phosphoinositides in the absence of BBS5</title><p>Compared to the other subunits, BBS5 is more loosely attached to the BBSome core complex, as we could only identify the subunit in a subpopulation of particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>).

We have previously found that prominent features of GPCR cargo molecules which determine binding to the core BBSome are motifs composed of aromatic and basic residues, many of which are found in the third intracellular loop and the C-terminal tail of GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klink et al., 2017</xref>). The negatively charged cleft within the BBSome probably interacts specifically with these positively charged motifs and is thereby directly involved in cargo recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–G</xref>). This would also position the motifs close to BBS1, a subunit which was shown to be particularly important for cargo recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Su et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhogaraju et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ruat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2012b</xref>).</p><p>The negative charge in the cleft is not formed by BBS1 alone, but also by residues of all other core BBSome subunits, except BBS5. There are three ‘hotspots’ of negative charge. One of them is located at the contact surface of the GAE domain of BBS1 and the 5α domain of BBS9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>), the second one is deeply buried in the core BBSome complex at the junction point where the BBS18 U-bolt ends and descends into a short α-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>), and the third one is determined by the α-helical insertion within the BBS1 β-propeller, which contains many glutamate or aspartate residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>). The α-helical insertion can only get in contact with cargo peptides that extend far into the negatively charged cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The β-propeller itself and the C-terminal GAE domain of BBS1 are also accessible from within the cleft. They have a more balanced charge distribution and might contribute to cargo binding by hydrophobic and ionic interactions at the base of the cleft, which would explain the high importance of BBS1 for cargo interactions.</p><p>The large size of the binding cleft with different ‘hotspots’ suggests that cargo recognition is likely very complex and variable, involving the interaction with different BBSome subunits. The proper study of BBSome-cargo interactions therefore requires the full BBSome complex as cargo binding to single subunits, albeit relevant, does not take interaction to multiple sites into account. For example, we previously identified a peptide fragment from the C-terminal part of SSTR3 which binds to the core BBSome with ~100 fold higher affinity than to the isolated BBS1 β-propeller (aa1-430) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klink et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Since the BBS5 and Arl6 binding sites are located on opposite sides of the core BBSome complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), a simultaneous membrane binding of both motifs would require a curved membrane surface, as it is present on the inner cilium wall, and/or conformational rearrangements of the complex. The observed dynamic properties of BBS5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>) are probably the prerequisite for the subunit to be able to reorient and position one or both of its PH domains closer to the membrane, thereby enabling interaction with the membrane.</p><p>While this manuscript was being prepared, the structure of the bovine BBSome complex at 4.9 Å was published, in which the Arl6 binding site is blocked by the subunits BBS2 and BBS7 (25). These two additional subunits form a highly intertwined lobe that contacts the BBSome core at the C-terminal hairpin in BBS9 and at the β-propeller of BBS1. While this blocks the binding site for Arl6, the complex was still able to bind to immobilized Arl6 during the purification, indicating a high degree of conformational dynamics of the lobe formed by BBS2 and BBS7 (25). The overall architecture of both BBSome complexes is very similar, but interestingly, in a rigid body overlay of our structure with the bovine BBSome, the Arl6 binding site does not clash with BBS2 or BBS7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is due to a different orientation of the BBS1 β-propeller to which Arl6 binds. In the structure of the bovine BBSome complex the BBS7 β-propeller interacts with the β-propeller of BBS1 and thereby pulls it towards the BBS2-BBS7 lobe. The small change of the BBS1 β-propeller orientation results in a ~ 20° change in the angle of Arl6 binding to the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>).</p><p>While we cannot rule out that the changed BBS1 β-propeller adopts a non-physiological conformation in the absence of BBS2 and BBS7, it is probable that the reorientation of the propeller will occur in a similar manner when the highly dynamic BBSome ‘top lobe’ formed by BBS2 and BBS7 opens up to allow Arl6 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chou et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore believe that our BBSome core structure represents the open conformation of the complex in contrast to the autoinhibited closed state of the bovine BBSome complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chou et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The additional subunits BBS2 and BBS7 extend the interaction surface that we suggest to bind to ciliary membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and narrow down the opening to the negatively charged cleft. However, it is still sufficiently large for peptides from cargo proteins to enter the cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Future perspectives</title><p>Future studies should reveal the details of how cargo proteins get recognized and how the ‘top lobe’ formed by BBS2 and BBS7 makes space for cargo binding, particularly in the context of BBSome interactions with Arl6 and the IFT complex. For this it will be crucial to obtain structures of the BBSome complex bound to different cargo peptides or full cargo proteins. The architecture of the extended negatively charged cleft within our structure of the core BBSome suggests that cargo binding depends on the 3-dimensional arrangement of all BBSome subunits, and that different cargo proteins might utilize different binding modes within the cleft. This would also suggest that the BBSome complex binds differently to cargo proteins in its open or its closed conformation.</p><p>Other intriguing questions to be addressed in the future include determining the precise orientation of the BBSome on membranes, and the relevance of interactions with phosphoinositides via BBS5 or via currently unidentified phosphoinositide binding motifs on one of the subunits BBS4, 8, 9 or 18 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

subcomplexes</title><p>The core BBSome (BBS 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 18) and the 4mer BBSome subcomplex (BBS 4, 8, 9, 18) were cloned and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr"

Briefly, the proteins were overexpressed in Hi5 insect cells (Thermofisher Scientific), harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM TCEP). The resuspended cells were lysed with a Dounce Tissue Grinder (Wheaton, Millville, NJ), cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 25.000 rpm, and the supernatant was used for further protein purification.</p><p>For affinity purification, the cell supernatant was loaded on a column filled with Strep-Tactin Superflow high capacity resin (IBA).

The eluted protein complexes were further purified by Ni<sup>2+</sup>–NTA (Qiagen, Germany) affinity and/or anti-Flag M2 affinity chromatography (Sigma, Germany). Affinity-purified proteins were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 column or on a Superose 6 5/150 column (GE Healthcare, Germany) in gel filtration buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10% glycerol and 0.1 mM TCEP).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Protein-Lipid overlay assays</title><p>The affinity of the core BBSome complex (BBS1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 18) and the 4mer BBSome complex containing BBS4, 8, 9 and 18 to different lipids immobilized on hydrophobic membranes (‘PIP-strips’ P-6001, P6002, Echelon) were probed in a protein-lipid overlay assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, PIP-strips were blocked with TBS-T + 3% fatty acid–free BSA and then incubated with 7.5 µg/ml complex for one hour at room temperature.

The protein was then concentrated and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 5/150 column (GE Healthcare, Germany) in plunging buffer (20 mM TRIS-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1 mM TCEP) to remove particles that aggregated during the crosslinking procedure.

After two minutes incubation at 13°C and 100% relative humidity (RH), the sample was manually blotted, replaced by fresh 4 µl sample, and then automatically blotted and plunged in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (FEI).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Electron microscopy and image processing</title><p>We observed the tendency of the BBSome complex to partially dissociate, which lead to a significant proportion of incomplete particles in many images, particularly in those with very thin ice, probably indicating some denaturation at the air-water interface. The problem persisted even after crosslinking and subsequent gel filtration. In addition, the particles had the tendency to aggregate, which further complicated the identification of intact single particles at the low contrast of typical EM micrographs, particularly at low defocus. We therefore pursued the use of a Volta phase plate (VPP) for data collection to enhance image contrast in order to improve the selection of complete complexes later on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Danev et al. (2014)</xref>.</p><p>Cryo-EM datasets were collected on a Titan Krios electron microscope (FEI) equipped with a post-column energy filter, a Volta phase plate (VPP) and a field emission gun (FEG) operated at 300 kV acceleration voltage. A total of 15,266 micrographs were recorded on a K2 direct electron detector (Gatan) with a calibrated pixel size of 1.07 Å. The energy filter was used for zero-loss filtration with an energy width of 20 eV. In total 50 frames (each 300 ms) were recorded, resulting in a total exposure time of 15 s and a total electron dose of 67 e<sup>-</sup>Å<sup>−2</sup>. Data was collected using the automated data collection software EPU (FEI), with a defocus range of −0.3 to −1.0 µm. The position of the VPP was changed every 60 to 120 images, resulting in phase shifts of 30–120 degrees in &gt;95% of all micrographs. Beam-induced motion was corrected for by using Motioncor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) to align and sum the 50 frames in each micrograph movie and to calculate dose-weighted and unweighted full-dose images. CTF parameters were estimated from the unweighted summed images and from micrograph movies utilizing the ‘movie mode’ option of CTFFIND4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). For subsequent steps of data processing using the software package SPHIRE/EMAN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moriya et al., 2017</xref>), dose-weighted full dose images were used to extract dose-weighted and drift-corrected particles with a final window size of 280 × 280 pixels.</p><p>A total of 10 datasets were collected from several independently prepared protein samples and were successively processed by a combination of manual and automated particle extraction using crYOLO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wagner et al., 2019</xref>), 2D sorting using the iterative stable alignment and clustering (ISAC) as implemented in SPHIRE, and merging with existing data to consecutively improve the size and quality of the derived particle stack. An initial model for 3D refinement was generated from the ISAC 2D class averages using RVIPER from SPHIRE, and was used as input for the first 3D refinement using MERIDIEN (3D refinement in SPHIRE). The obtained 3D reconstruction of MERIDIEN was then sharpened and filtered to its nominal resolution, and used as input for subsequent 3D refinements. Completeness of data collections was evaluated based on the improvements in resolution of the resulting final reconstructions, which plateaued at 4 Å resolution from a cleaned set of 724,828 particles, as estimated by the ‘gold standard’ criterion of FSC = 0.143 between two independently refined half maps.</p><p>To further improve the quality of the derived particle stack, an alternative processing attempt was tested in which all 15266 micrographs were combined and subjected to automatic particle picking using crYOLO, selecting 1,973,261 particles with a high confidence score (threshold 0.7) and additional 858,068 particles that had a lower score (threshold greater than 0.2 but smaller than 0.7). Both sets of particles were subjected to 2D sorting, and the best particles of each subset were merged and sorted again to obtain a new particle stack of 884,341 particles. After 3D refinement, the final reconstruction had a slightly improved quality compared to the first processing attempt as judged by visual inspection of the map quality. However, it was also apparent that a significant number of ‘good’ particles (i.e. particles that were kept after 2D sorting with ISAC) were only selected in one of the two sorted particle stacks, indicating that about 30% of high-quality particles were lost during 2D sorting.</p><p>To further improve the quality of the sorted particle stack, we developed a procedure to combine multiple particle stacks from independent processing attempts. Briefly, we re-extracted box files for all stacks using the PIPE restacking procedure from SPHIRE, combined all box files for a given micrograph, and then removed all boxes which are in close proximity to another box in that image with a simple bash script. The thus cleaned set of boxes was used to re-extract a stack with unique, non-overlapping particles. The use of box files has the advantage that it is straightforward to inspect the success of the procedure, and even allows to identify duplicated particles with slightly different origin, for example when the original particle selections were updated in one of the processing attempts by recentering and particle re-extraction. By combining the two particle stacks from both independent processing attempts and removing all duplicate particles, we rescued about 220,000 “good” particles that were sorted out in one or the other processing attempt. The derived combined stack of 1,103,959 particles could thus be subjected to a final, more stringent 2D sorting round to obtain a final particle stack with 862,114 particles that, after 3D refinement, resulted in a 3.8 Å reconstruction with significantly improved quality compared to the individual refinement attempts.</p><p>3D clustering using SORT3D of the SPHIRE suite was performed with a 3D-focussed mask that includes BBS5, which was first apparent in a variability map of the full particle stack as calculated using 3DVARIABILITY from SPHIRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). 3D clustering separated the particles into four 3D clusters which were then subjected to local 3D refinement using MERIDIEN. One of the generated 3D reconstructions clearly indicated BBS5 density, resulting in a 4.3 Å resolution map of the core BBSome with BBS5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). An analysis of the 3D variability in this map indicated no remaining variability in the BBS5 focus region, while the variability in other regions of the complex remained similar as in the full particle stack (e.g. indicating some conformational heterogeneity around the 4α helical insert in the β-propeller of BBS1, around the platform domain of BBS9, at the tip of the hairpin within the 5α helical domain of BBS9, and at the unresolved C-terminal end of BBS4). All of these regions with enhanced variability indeed have a lower-than-average map resolution, indicating a high flexibility in these regions. Nevertheless, the 4α helical insert in the β-propeller of BBS1 in our structure was better defined than in the bovine BBSome structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chou et al., 2019</xref>), and allowed the building of a model.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Model building</title><p>For building an atomic model of the BBSome core comples, we used the two available crystal structures of the β-propeller domains of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> BBS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mourão et al., 2014</xref>) and of human BBS9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knockenhauer and Schwartz, 2015</xref>) as starting points for the assignments of BBS domains. For this, the human homology model to the <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> BBS1 β-propeller was generated using HHpred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Söding et al., 2005</xref>), and the structure of a helical insert in the β-propeller (Pro127-Gln197) that is missing in the crystal structure was predicted using RaptorX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). For the human BBS9 β-propeller, the pdb entry 4YD8 could be directly used as starting model after minor modifications (i.e. changing the selenomethionine residues to methionine and adding a few loops that were missing in the crystal structure). The large helical insert in BBS1 that is not present in BBS9 allowed an unambiguous placement of both structures into the density. BBS4 and BBS8 are the two subunits that are predicted to fold into TPR repeats, and from biochemical data it is apparent that BBS9 forms a stable binary subcomplex with BBS8 (26). Since in the cryo-EM map two superhelical arrangements of TPR motifs are visible and BBS9 forms no interactions with one of them, the correct placement of BBS9 and BBS1 also allowed an unambiguous assignment of BBS4 and BBS8. Initial models for BBS4 and BBS8 were generated by de novo structure prediction using RaptorX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2017b</xref>) followed by flexible fitting of fractions of the RaptorX structure predictions into consistent parts of the density using iMODFIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lopéz-Blanco and Chacón, 2013</xref>) and subsequent manual model correction in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>). The validity of the fit could be verified based on side chain consistency with the map as BBS4 and BBS8 are positioned in a central region of the complex with sufficiently high local map resolution. Consistent with the RaptorX prediction, we observed that a region of about 130 residues in BBS8 (Tyr53-Lys180) is only partially structured and forms an extended loop that winds through the center of the complex and back (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A,B</xref>).</p><p>The assignments of the C-terminal parts of BBS1 and BBS9 were less obvious as they are separated by partially flexible linkers from the N-terminal β-propeller domains. We could assign the GAE domains of BBS1 and BBS9 based on the clearly resolved connection of the BBS9 GAE domain to the C-terminal platform and α-helical domains that are missing in BBS1. Furthermore, the connection of the BBS1 GAE domain could be traced up to a small gap of about 20 residues to its corresponding N-terminal β-propeller, which would not allow an alternative assignment. The structures of all these domains were also predicted with RaptorX, flexibly fitted with IMODFIT and manually corrected with Coot as described above. The resolution of the GAE domains was sufficient to verify the validity of the model based on side-chain densities, and even in the lower resolved part of the platform and α helical domains of BBS9, multiple hallmark residue side chains allowed a clear validation of the overall fold, although some solvent-exposed loops are only weakly defined.</p><p>After placing BBS1, 4, 8 and 9, a prominent stretch of well resolved density remained unexplained that winds through the superhelices formed by BBS4 and BBS8 and connects to a short α-helix. With a total length of about 60 residues and no obvious covalent connection to one of the other subunits, we were confident that this stretch represents a major part of the 93 residue subunits BBS18, which is also consistent with biophysical data showing that BBS18 forms stable subcomplexes with BBS4 and with BBS4, 8 and 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klink et al., 2017</xref>). With few initial indications how to assign the primary sequence to this linear, mostly unfolded domain, we utilized the following method to find the correct frame: We first built a 59 residue poly-alanine model, then assigned all 33 possible frames of BBS18 sequence to this model, and further refined each of them automatically using Phenix real-space refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A–F</xref>). Comparing the correlation of the map to the refined models, we observed a clearly separated best hit for one sequence assignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A,F</xref>) with no obvious discrepancies between map and model, while the other models showed significant deviations from map to model that could not be explained by noise, imperfect modeling or a lack of resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C,D,E,G</xref>). The final model was further manually refined in Coot and corresponds to residues Val26-Gln80 of BBS18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4H</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4I</xref>, the final model forms favorable interactions with neighboring BBS subunits BBS4 and BBS8.</p><p>After placing all subunits except BBS5, missing residues that were visible in the density were placed and all subunits were further manually refined in Coot. Atom clashes were removed by energy minimization (with torsion and Ramachandran restraints turned on) using PHENIX real space refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>), followed by another round of manual refinement. Compared to the other subunits of the core BBSome, BBS5 is more loosely attached at the periphery of the complex, and could only be identified in a subpopulation of particles that was isolated by 3D clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). The best 3D class containing BBS5 allowed a reconstruction with an average resolution of about 4.3 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The two PH domains of BBS5 were modeled with RaptorX and were positioned into the derived BBS5 density using Chimera (UCSF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>), followed by relaxation into the density in Coot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). An overlay of the maps derived from the full particle stack with the 3D cluster containing BBS5 allowed to position BBS5 relative to the higher resolved reconstruction from all particles in which BBS5 was not visible. BBS5 was then combined with the higher resolved full particle reconstruction to generate a combined molecular model of the human BBSome core complex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Visualization</title><p>Visualization, analysis and figure preparation was done with Chimera (UCSF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). Local resolution gradients within a map were estimated using LOCRES as implemented in the SPHIRE suite, and final densities were filtered according to the calculated local resolution unless stated otherwise. Resolution gradients were visualized by coloring the corresponding maps according to the local resolution in Chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). To visualize surface electrostatic potentials, the correct protonation state of the core BBSome was predicted using the H++ web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biophysics.cs.vt.edu/H++">http://biophysics.cs.vt.edu/H++</ext-link> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anandakrishnan et al., 2012</xref>) and the hydrogenated model was colored according to its electrostatic potential in Chimera. 3D average and variability maps were calculated using 3DVARIABILITY of the SPHIRE package and visualized in Chimera. Angular distribution plots were generated using PIPE from SPHIRE. In addition to the binned 2-D class averages produced by ISAC that were used for the particle selection process, unbinned class averages showing high-resolution features were calculated using COMPUTE_ISAC_AVG from SPHIRE for visualization purposes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Daniel Prumbaum for his support during EM data collection, the SPHIRE developer team for support in image processing and the whole Raunser lab for support and fruitful discussions.

transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This manuscript describes the cryo-EM structure of a complex of 6 recombinantly expressed human BBSome proteins (BBS1, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 18), which form what the authors refer to as the 'core' complex (lacking BBS2 and 7). The maps are at sufficiently high resolution to enable the authors to build atomic models, including side chains, for the majority of the subunits, and map known Bardet-Biedel syndrome causing mutations.</p><p>This work comes in the context of the recently published 4.9 Å cryo-EM structure of the complete bovine BBSome from Chou et al., and a pre-print describing cryo-EM structures of the complete bovine BBSome with and without ARL6 at resolutions of 3.5 and 3.1 Å, respectively. There is significant overlap between these works, but also complementarity in the analyses presented. For example, in this study the authors analyze the charge distribution to propose a mode of interaction with transmembrane protein cargo. This study also involves a recombinant complex which will be important for future mutagenesis studies.</p><p>Importantly, despite lacking BBS2, 7, and ARL6, the BBSome core complex reported here exhibited an &quot;open&quot; conformation that can bind to the substrate, and the β-propeller of BBS1 was rotated compared to the &quot;closed&quot; conformation structure of Chou et al.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structure of the human BBSome core complex in the open conformation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Masahide Kikkawa (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) EM processing and model building is described in great detail (subsection “Model building”) but it is unclear to me how the models were refined. Refinement and validation statistics are given in Table 1, which suggest that the models were indeed refined. Was real-space refinement in Coot used for the entire BBSome core structure and Phenix only used for energy minimization or was real space refinement also carried out in Phenix? If so, which restraints/constraints were used? It might be useful to include a refinement paragraph in the Materials and methods section describing the procedures used. It is also not clear to me if the last column in Table 1 reports refinement/validation statistics for the full core complex (BBS1,4,5,8,9,18) or only the BBS5 subunit given the BBS5 label for this column. The Ramachandran scores in Table 1 (in particularly for the column with the BBS5 label) are highly unusual with 0% outliers but only 80.5% in the favored regions. The 0% outliers suggest that Ramachandran restraints were used in refinement. 80% in the favored region is a very low number and strongly suggests that there are severe problems with at least part of the structure. The authors should have a careful look at regions with a large percentage of residues not falling into the favored regions and see if there are issues to be fixed.</p><p>2) Figure 1—figure supplement 2G and I: The fit of the model to the density is not super convincing. The lower part of the helix in insert G and a loop region of the GAE domain in insert I appears to be out of density. The authors may need to put some more effort into improving the initial models to obtain a structure that fits the experimentally obtained maps better. This may also help to improve the poor/unusual Ramachandran plot scores discussed in comment 1 above.</p><p>3) Figure 1—figure supplement 4: sequence assignment of BBS18. I am not convinced that the authors have assigned the entire sequence of BBS18 correctly. The authors judge the frame based purely on correlation with the map but do not appear to make use of the chemical environment of BBS18 in deciding on the correct frame. In the PDB file associated with the submitted manuscript, there are several clashes between BBS18 and sidechains from neighboring subunits and the chemistry of non-covalent interactions makes little sense in some places. For example, the side-chain of BBS18 M29 clashes with M417 of chain D; BBS18 E32 sidechain and R31 carbonyl clashes with the hydrophobic sidechain of Leu381 of chain D. This strongly suggests that the sequence of BBS18 is at least partly incorrectly assigned in the current structure. This appears to be mostly a problem for the N-terminal part of BBS18 whereas the C-terminal part (residues 37-80) makes chemical contacts that are much more plausible. Could the authors please correct the structure and provide a figure showing the interaction of BBS18 including sidechains with the neighboring BBS subunits so that the reader can judge for herself? Figure 3B does include some sidechains of BBS18 but not of interacting BBS subunits so it is impossible to judge if the frame chosen for BBS18 makes chemical sense with respect to non-covalent interactions. In addition, for Figure 1—figure supplement 4, instead of showing the density and fit of two 'bad models' (frame 2 and 5, panels C and D), it may be more informative to show only one 'bad model' and then also the second best fit (frame 33). Also, there are a total of 11 frames with correlation coefficients very similar (CCs of 0.79-0.81) to frame 22 that was chosen as the correct frame by the authors. The figure legend states that frame 22 is in full agreement with the observed density. This is clearly an overstatement. Several side-chains have missing density and one F has additional density at the tip of the aromatic ring. I suggest rewriting the sentence to better reflect what is shown in the figure. I fully appreciate that assigning the sequence to a mostly unstructured protein in a 3.8Å resolution map is a difficult task and one could take the more conservative approach of simply leaving part of BBS18 modelled as poly-alanine.</p><p>4) Open conformation: The authors describe their structure as the 'open conformation' in the title. Although it is plausible that the core complex resembles the open state of the intact BBSome, it could also be a non-physiological conformation adopted in the absence of BBS2 and BBS7. Therefore, 'open conformation' should be removed from the title, and the arguments and caveats for the core complex representing the open state should be elaborated in the main text.</p><p>5) Gels showing the purified 4mer and 6mer sub-complexes would be helpful.</p><p>6) The structure of BBS5 is at medium resolution, which does not seem sufficient to confidently build side chains. Please include examples of density to justify keeping side chains in the model or adjust model accordingly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53910.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) EM processing and model building is described in great detail (subsection “Model building”) but it is unclear to me how the models were refined.

Since we followed the suggestion to cleave back BBS5 to poly-alanine (see below), the second column became obsolete and we changed Table 1 to a single column, with BBS5-related numbers in brackets.

As we described in the Materials and methods section, we only positioned the RaptorX model of BBS5 into the density using Chimera and relaxed it into the density in Coot, but the quality of the map did not justify more detailed refinements, which explains the bad statistics. In the revised manuscript, we followed the suggestion to remove the sidechains of BBS5 to avoid overinterpretation (see below) and changed the BBS5 model to poly-alanine. With this change, the refinement statistics of the BBS5 subunit is not meaningful anymore. We removed the second column in Table 1 and added the relevant information for the BBS5-containing 3D cluster in brackets to the first column.</p><p>We also updated the first column since our refinement statistics slightly changed after changing an unstructured loop in BBS1 (residues 410-425) and the last two helices of BBS4 (see below) to poly-alanine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1—figure supplement 2G and I: The fit of the model to the density is not super convincing.

For this we also changed the threshold of the map to better visualize sidechain densities. For the GAE domain in insert I, we tried to find a loop conformation that fits the map better, but did not find another conformation of that loop that does not clash with other regions of the protein or is in an unreasonably strained conformation. We therefore conclude that minor discrepancies between map and model in the loop might be due to some noise in the map, which in this region is very close to the exterior of the complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1—figure supplement 4: sequence assignment of BBS18.

The N-terminus of BBS18 is less well defined as the C-terminal part, which leads to some ambiguities in the placement of sidechains in the last loosely attached residues. The described clashes, however less an issue in the BBS18 chain itself than in the interacting C-terminal helices of BBS4 (residues 386-423), which are poorly resolved and indeed do not justify the placement of sidechains. We therefore cleaved these residues back to poly-alanine and rebuilt the BS18 N-terminus without these potentially misleading constraints. A better fit of the BBS18 N-terminus to the map further supports the validity of our frame assignment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the authors please correct the structure and provide a figure showing the interaction of BBS18 including sidechains with the neighboring BBS subunits so that the reader can judge for herself?

We updated Figure 1—figure supplement 4 accordingly. There are several discrepancies when fitting frame #33 into the map, but even more importantly, this assignment (like many of the other potential frame assignments) would position several charged residues into a highly unfavorable chemical environment, while the assignment for frame #22 seems favorable. To be able to judge the validity of the fit, we included a panel showing a comparison between the second-best and the best frame (Figure 1—figure supplement 4G), and three more panels showing the interactions of BBS18 with neighboring BBS subunits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The figure legend states that frame 22 is in full agreement with the observed density.

By “Full agreement with the observed density” we wanted to emphasize that the discrepancies between map and model are within the expected range at 3.8 Å resolution. This means that clearly resolved sidechain density should be explained by an appropriate residue, while negatively charged sidechains or residues with the potential to “wobble around” are not unexpected to have missing density at this resolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Open conformation: The authors describe their structure as the 'open conformation' in the title.

We added a precise reference to where this gel can be found in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The structure of BBS5 is at medium resolution, which does not seem sufficient to confidently build side chains.

We agree that there are too many poorly resolved parts in the BBS5 map that cannot unambiguously be refined. We therefore changed the model of BBS5 to a poly-alanine model.</p></body></sub-article></article>
