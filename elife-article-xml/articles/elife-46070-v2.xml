Ferritin proteins are the major storage units for bioavailable forms of iron. Some organisms lack ferritins, and it is not known how they store iron. Encapsulins, a class of protein-based organelles, have recently been implicated in microbial iron and redox metabolism. Here, we report the structural and mechanistic characterization of a 42 nm two-component encapsulin-based iron storage compartment from <italic>Quasibacillus thermotolerans</italic>. Using cryo-electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography, we reveal the assembly principles of a thermostable T = 4 shell topology and its catalytic ferroxidase cargo and show interactions underlying cargo-shell co-assembly. This compartment has an exceptionally large iron storage capacity storing over 23,000 iron atoms. Our results reveal a new approach for survival in diverse habitats with limited or fluctuating iron availability via an iron storage system able to store 10 to 20 times more iron than ferritin.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46070.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>People often think of the cell as the basic unit of life. Despite this, individual cells are also subdivided into many compartments, called ‘organelles’ because they act like the internal organs of the cell. For example, organelles can break down nutrients, store information in the form of DNA, or help remove waste. Even bacterial cells, despite being smaller and simpler than most other cell types, contain organelle-like structures. These are tiny compartments, termed protein organelles, which are enclosed by ‘shells’ made from self-assembling proteins within the cell.</p><p>Cells need iron to carry out the chemical reactions necessary for life. Iron is therefore an essential nutrient, but it can also be toxic if not stored properly inside the cell. Cells often solve this problem by locking iron away inside small, specialised protein cages called ferritins until it can be used. Most organisms, from humans to bacteria, have ferritins, but some do not, and the way these organisms store iron remains largely unknown.</p><p>The bacterium <italic>Quasibacillus thermotolerans</italic> is an example of an organism that lacks ferritins. However, it does contain a recently discovered type of protein organelle, called an encapsulin. Giessen et al. wanted to find out more about the structure of this protein organelle, and to determine if it helped these bacteria store iron.</p><p><italic>Q. thermotolerans</italic>’ encapsulin turned out to be the largest of its kind discovered to date. Detailed imaging experiments, using a combination of electron microscopy and X-ray- based techniques, revealed that the protein shell of the encapsulin had an overall structure resembling chain mail and contained multiple pores. These pores were negatively charged, meaning that they could efficiently attract iron (which has a positive charge) and funnel it into the interior of the compartment. The compartment itself was able to store at least 20 times more iron than ferritins, making this encapsulin one of the most efficient methods of iron storage in any cell.</p><p>These findings will help us better understand how bacteria that lack ferritins cope with the problem of iron storage. In the future, encapsulins could also be used as a target for new therapies to fight bacterial infections, or even as the building blocks for microscopic chemical reactors or ‘storage facilities’ in industrial applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>quasibacillus thermotolerans</kwd><kwd>encapsulins</kwd><kwd>protein organelles</kwd><kwd>iron storage</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina - Nationale Akademie der Wissenschaften</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LPDS 2014-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giessen</surname><given-names>Tobias W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5506</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giessen</surname><given-names>Tobias W</given-names></name><name><surname>Silver</surname><given-names>Pamela A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giessen</surname><given-names>Tobias W</given-names></name><name><surname>Silver</surname><given-names>Pamela A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An alternative iron storage system based on a 9.6 megadalton microbial protein compartment is able to sequester and store large amounts of iron.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Iron is essential to virtually all organisms on earth. It is needed for a wide variety of catalytic and redox processes ranging from cellular energy production via oxidative phosphorylation to oxygen transport by hemoglobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sánchez et al., 2017</xref>). However, the same properties that make iron useful for cellular metabolism can result in toxicity under aerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sánchez et al., 2017</xref>). Ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) is easily oxidized to insoluble ferric iron (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) resulting in the formation of harmful precipitates and reactive oxygen species (ROS) via Fenton chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dixon and Stockwell, 2014</xref>). Cells have evolved to cope with these problems by strictly controlling the intracellular concentration and reactivity of free iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crichton, 2002</xref>). Ferritin proteins are used as the main iron storage system by animals, plants and most microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arosio et al., 2017</xref>). The main ferritin-like proteins involved in iron storage are ferritin (Ftn), bacterioferritin (Bfr) and DNA-binding proteins from starved cells (Dps) all able to oxidize Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup> via a ferroxidase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andrews, 2010</xref>). While Ftn and Bfr are primarily used as a dynamic iron storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Honarmand Ebrahimi et al., 2015</xref>), the main function of Dps proteins is to counteract oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiancone et al., 2004</xref>). Ferritins (Ftn and Bfr) assemble into 24 subunit protein compartments up to 12 nm in diameter able to store 2000 to 4,000 Fe atoms in their interior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrews, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrison and Arosio, 1996</xref>). However, some organisms do not encode ferritin genes in their genomes and their iron storage systems have remained elusive.</p><p>A newly discovered class of protein organelles called encapsulin nanocompartments have been shown to be involved in microbial iron storage and redox metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giessen and Silver, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McHugh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sutter et al., 2008</xref>). Previously reported encapsulins share an HK97 phage-like fold and self-assemble from a single capsid protein into icosahedral compartments between 24 and 32 nm in diameter with triangulation numbers of T = 1 (60 subunits) and T = 3 (180 subunits), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McHugh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sutter et al., 2008</xref>). Their key feature is the ability to specifically encapsulate cargo proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Encapsulation is mediated by short C-terminal sequences referred to as targeting peptides (TPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sutter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tamura et al., 2015</xref>). Genes encoding encapsulin shell proteins and dedicated cargo proteins are organized in co-regulated operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giessen and Silver, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sutter et al., 2008</xref>). So far, operons involved in hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide detoxification as well as iron mineralization have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nichols et al., 2017</xref>). The main cargo protein-types described to date are DyP-type peroxidases, hemerythrins and different classes of ferritin-like proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Contreras et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giessen and Silver, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McHugh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rahmanpour and Bugg, 2013</xref>).

The IMEF compartment is substantially larger than previously reported encapsulins and possesses a triangulation number of T = 4 instead of T = 1 (60 subunits, 24 nm) or T = 3 (180 subunits, 32 nm) and represents the largest encapsulin compartment reported to date (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2e</xref>). The shell is composed of 12 pentameric and 30 hexameric capsomers occupying icosahedral vertices and faces, respectively. In contrast, T = 1 encapsulins consist of only 12 pentameric capsomers while the T = 3 encapsulin shell is made up of 12 pentameric and 20 hexameric capsomers. The T = 4 IMEF-system consequently possesses an internal volume 530% and 220% larger than that of T = 1 and T = 3 encapsulins, respectively. The 5-fold symmetry axes are located at the pentameric vertices while 3-fold symmetry axes are present at all interfaces where three hexameric capsomers meet. The center of each hexameric capsomer corresponds to an icosahedral edge possessing 2-fold symmetry. The icosahedral asymmetric unit consists of one pentameric and three hexameric monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Symmetrically arranged lower resolution density (ca. 10 Å) representing the IMEF cargo is visible in the compartment interior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>). 42 distinct densities, one for each capsomer of the T = 4 structure, can be observed. No connection of cargo and shell density is visible, likely due to averaging or the flexibility of a 37 amino acid linker preceding the IMEF targeting peptide that directs and anchors the IMEF cargo to the shell interior. Averaging and linker flexibility likely also contribute to the lower resolution observed for the interior IMEF densities. The distance between the shell and cargo densities is 4.5 nm which can be bridged by the 37 amino acid linker. To further investigate and better resolve the cargo densities, we applied an approach combining symmetry expansion and focused classification with residual signal subtraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This approach was able to separate cargo densities bound at slightly different locations indicating that the symmetry observed for the cargo densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) is a result of averaging. The observed non-symmetrical densities are still weak compared to the shell density. At low threshold values possible connections between cargo densities and the shell are visible, potentially representing the linker connecting the cargo with the bound TP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The four capsid proteins of the asymmetric unit adopt different conformations with significant differences found in the E-loop and A-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). E-loops are located at capsomer interfaces and their relative orientation plays a key role in determining the overall topology and triangulation number of encapsulin compartments as evidenced by comparison of the IMEF T = 4 monomer with T = 1 (<italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic>), T = 3 (<italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic>) and T = 7 (HK97 phage) capsid proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). A-domain loops form compartment pores and are likely adapted to optimize the particular function of a given encapsulin, for example ROS detoxification or iron mineralization. In addition, local resolution maps indicate that E-loops and A-domain loops represent the most flexible parts of the shell which suggests a certain structural flexibility of the pores formed by A-domain loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Pores in the IMEF encapsulin shell</title><p>The IMEF encapsulin shell contains negatively charged pores at the 3- and 5-fold symmetry axes. The surface view of the intact shell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>) shows a tight packing with pores at the 3- and 5-fold symmetry axes and at the interface between two hexameric and one pentameric capsomer (pseudo 3-fold) representing the only conduits to the interior. Similarly, pores at the symmetry axes were also reported for T = 1 and T = 3 encapsulin systems. All pores in the IMEF-system are negatively charged on both the exterior and interior surface due to the presence of conserved aspartate, glutamate and asparagine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is similar to the negatively charged pores in ferritin systems that guide positively charged iron to the ferritin interior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arosio et al., 2017</xref>). In no other encapsulin system are all pores negatively charged indicating that pores in the IMEF-system are optimized for attracting and channeling positively charged ions. The 2-fold pores observed at the interface of two capsomers in T = 1 and T = 3 encapsulins are not present in the IMEF-system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nichols et al., 2017</xref>). The 3-fold pore forms the largest channel to the IMEF compartment interior and is 7.2 Å wide at its narrowest point, substantially larger than previously reported encapsulin pores. Extra cryo-EM density is observed at the center of both the 3-fold and 5-fold pores. This could be a result of averaging accentuating noise on symmetry axes or potentially represent bound ions (e.g. Fe<sup>2+/3+</sup>) or even water molecules. The 2-fold symmetry axes at the center of hexameric capsomers also represent potential channels, as observed in T = 3 systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nichols et al., 2017</xref>), but the conformation of two asparagine side chains prevents the formation of a 2-fold opening in the T = 4 shell leading to a closed pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). This observation combined with the flexibility observed for loops around the 2- and 5-fold symmetry axes in local resolution maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) could indicate the presence of gated pores in encapsulins that may regulate ion flux to the compartment interior, similar to some ferritins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Theil et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46070.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Non-covalent chainmail topology, thermal stability and pores of the T = 4 encapsulin shell.</title><p>(<bold>a, b and c</bold>) Electrostatic surface representation of the 5-fold (<bold>d</bold>) and 3-fold (<bold>e</bold>) T = 4 shell pores and the 2-fold symmetry axis (<bold>f</bold>).

However, in the presence of a protein shell, a characteristic hyperbolic enzyme catalysis curve is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). This suggests that the encapsulin shell strictly controls the influx of iron to the compartment interior and thus the internal concentration of iron substrate available to encapsulated IMEF cargo proteins. The overall effect of this arrangement is that mineralization inside the IMEF encapsulin is controlled and autocatalytic runaway iron precipitation prevented. This is likely of key importance for the functioning of this novel iron storage system in the bacterial cytoplasm resulting in an iron storage system able to safely store essential but also toxic iron in a soluble and bioavailable form.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46070-fig4-figsupp4-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>The IMEF encapsulin mineralizes up to 30 nm Fe-rich cores in its interior with up to 23,000 Fe atoms stored per particle. IMEF encapsulins purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> grown under high Fe conditions contain electron dense cores visible in unstained samples with an average diameter of 23 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>). The largest observed particles are up to 30 nm in diameter. The theoretical size limit imposed by the T = 4 encapsulin protein shell is 36 nm and particles close to this size are observed in thin-sections of <italic>Geobacillus</italic> natively encoding the IMEF-system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b–d</xref>). EDS analysis of particles isolated from <italic>E. coli</italic> and comparison with standards indicate a very similar elemental composition and elemental distribution as observed for thin section samples with a Fe:P ratio of 1:1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3a</xref>). To determine the number of iron atoms stored per particle, we carried out electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) on purified Fe-loaded compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3b,c</xref>). The highest observed number of stored Fe per particle was 23,293 (23.6 nm) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Extrapolating to the maximum theoretical particle diameter of 36 nm and the highest density observed (3.40 Fe atoms/nm<sup>3</sup>) leads to a maximum number of Fe atoms that can be stored by the IMEF-system of around 83,000 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Thus, IMEF-systems are able to store substantially more iron than any known ferritin system (2,000–4,000 Fe atoms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrews, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrison and Arosio, 1996</xref>).</p><p>To learn more about the mechanism of iron mineralization, we assayed peroxidase and ferroxidase activity. Due to the IMEF cargo being most closely related to Dps proteins we initially performed peroxidase assays using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. However, no peroxidase activity could be observed. Next, we assayed ferroxidase activity using O<sub>2</sub> as the oxidant. For the IMEF cargo alone, a sigmoidal ferroxidase iron oxidation curve was observed indicative of autocatalytic Fe oxidation taking place at newly formed mineral surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bou-Abdallah et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun and Chasteen, 1992</xref>). However, assaying the IMEF cargo-loaded encapsulin results in a typical hyperbolic enzyme catalysis curve. These observations imply that the encapsulin shell controls the flux of iron to the inside of the compartment leading to a controlled and low concentration of soluble iron in the encapsulin interior. Therefore, the IMEF cargo protein is able to enzymatically oxidize the majority of ferrous iron before uncontrolled autocatalytic mineralization can lead to bulk precipitation of iron which would likely destroy the iron storage function of the IMEF-system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Our structural model and functional analysis of the IMEF encapsulin system reveal an alternative way to store large amounts of Fe independent of ferritins. The IMEF-system can in principle store more than 20 times more Fe than Ftn or Bfr systems. In contrast to ferritin systems, IMEF encapsulins are two-component systems with the catalytic activity separated from the protein shell. The IMEF cargo protein is flexibly tethered and primarily localizes 4.5 nm away from the capsid interior. This suggests that once iron enters the encapsulin interior via pores, it diffuses to the ferroxidase active site of the IMEF cargo, making it necessary to strictly control interior iron concentration to prevent runaway mineralization. This is different compared with ferritin systems where the ferroxidase activity is part of the shell and negatively charged surface patches guide iron from the pores to ferroxidase sites.</p><p>It is striking that IMEF-systems are confined to spore-forming Firmicutes. They inhabit a broad range of habitats with many of them initially isolated from hot springs or soil, environments with often limited or fluctuating iron availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colombo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). The ability to store a much larger amount of iron than other microbes might benefit IMEF-encoding organisms in these environments and thereby contribute to their wide geographical distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zeigler, 2014</xref>). In sum, we have elucidated the structure and mechanism of the largest iron storage complex to date indicating that alternative systems exist across nature to address the critical problem of safe and dynamic iron storage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Cryo-EM images were collected at Harvard Medical School on a Tecnai F20 electron microscope (FEI) operating at 200 kV and equipped with a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan). Movies were collected at a nominal magnification of 29,000 with a calibrated pixel size of 0.64 Å. All movies were collected in super-resolution counting mode using UCSFImage4, with a total exposure time of 7.2 s and a frame time of 200 milliseconds.

A final round of 3D refinement was performed in RELION 3.0 after fitting individual particle defocus parameters and beam-tilt with ‘relion_ctf_refine’. Post-processing was performed with ‘relion_postprocess’ to apply a negative b-factor and correct the amplitude information in the final map.

Several rounds of real-space refinement and manual adjustment of the coordinates for four monomers in the ASU were performed in phenix.real_space_refine and COOT. During refinement of coordinates in the ASU no non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were utilized in order to avoid distortion of the E-loop in each monomer. The refined coordinates for the ASU were subsequently expanded using the symmetry matrices utilized by RELION 3.0 during 3D reconstruction to generate a model of the entire encapsulin cage containing 60 ASUs and 240 total IMEF encapsulin capsid protein polypeptide chains.

Your article has been reviewed by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Robert Crichton (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript presents a structural and mechanistic description of a recently discovered bacterial iron storage system based on a T4 icosahedral encapsulin shell carrying an iron-mineralising protein cargo of the iron mineralizing encapsulin-associated firmicute (IMEF) family. The study is sound and well communicated, and the findings are significant. The authors present a single-particle cryo-EM study of the encapsulin shell, and an X-ray crystal structure of the IMEF protein, which forms a ferroxidase center at its dimeric interface. A target peptide of the IMEF protein is shown to be essential to incorporation of the IMEF cargo into the encapsulin shell. The chemical composition of heterologously-expressed Enc-IMEF is analysed by EDS and EELS, and the ferroxidase activity is analysed to indicate that iron mineralisation by the full complex is limited by the rate of iron entry to the encapsulin shell.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Most of the comments pertain to improving the presentation and discussion of the work.</p><p>1) There seems to be a systemic problem with not introducing or explaining key ideas and relationships early enough. Some of the confusing points become partly clarified in the end after multiple readings. But for someone not well-acquainted with these systems, and frankly even for those closer to the subject, one is left without a clear sense of how different the findings and the specific structure should be considered compared to other studies on triangulated encapsulins and even HK97 phage capsids. The function, composition, equivalence or distinction compared to various encapsulins, is hard to absorb; could other encapsulins be doing this and it just hasn't been shown.</p><p>2) The authors state that 'A newly discovered class of protein organelles called encapsulin nanocompartments are implicated in microbial iron and redox metabolism and have so far only been shown to be involved in oxidative stress response (Giessen and Silver, 2017; He et al., 2016; McHugh et al., 2014; Sutter et al., 2008).', but cite a paper (McHugh, 2014) in which iron storage by an encapsulin is well documented. The authors' own work (Giessen and Silver, 2017) has previously shown that IMEF-Enc mineralises iron in vivo. I would therefore consider it established that encapsulins can function in iron storage.</p><p>3) Other issues related to clarity:</p><p>- Is IMEF a system or is IMEF a cargo protein?</p><p>-Retention of the 'cargo protein' name instead of a protein name based on homology and presumptive function allows questions to linger unnecessarily.</p><p>- The main statement about what protein construct/assembly is produced for study is (subsection “Overall structure of the cargo-loaded IMEF encapsulin”) &quot;we produced homogeneous IMEF cargo-loaded encapsulins&quot;. What does that mean? What proteins were expressed?</p><p>- Subsection “Overall structure of the cargo-loaded IMEF encapsulin”: &quot;as evidenced by comparison of the IMEF T =4 monomer with T = 1, T = 3 and T = 7 capsid proteins.&quot; What capsid proteins? Is this referring to all encapsulin and HK97 proteins or something else?</p><p>- There are places where &quot;the&quot; should probably be &quot;a&quot; instead, where a new idea hasn't been introduced previously. [subsection “Overall structure of the cargo-loaded IMEF encapsulin” on the flexibility of a linker in the cargo protein].</p><p>- Subsection “Structure and analysis of the IMEF cargo protein” says that a phylogeny analysis shows IMEF is a member of the Flp superfamily, but could not be detected as the sequence level. What is meant here? That the IMEF protein has sequence similarity to other proteins whose structures were known and could be assigned to the Flp superfamily despite not being able to detect sequence similarity to other Flp members?</p><p>A few technical issues also need to be addressed:</p><p>4) The following points can be addressed changes to the text:</p><p>- The issue of symmetry averaging and its presumptive effects on certain parts of the structure like the cargo are not handled cleanly (See subsection “Overall structure of the cargo-loaded IMEF encapsulin”; subsection “TP-mediated cargo-shell co-assembly”). The authors infer flexibility in some cases where lack of icosahedral symmetry in the presence of averaging would likely have the same effect. How would the cargo protein survive averaging if it sits as a single dimer bound to a pentamer at an icosahedral vertex?</p><p>- In subsection “Iron mineralization and storage by the IMEF system”, the logic about the shell permeability and kinetic curve shapes is unclear.</p><p>- In subsection “Iron mineralization and storage by the IMEF system”, the idea of being &quot;channeled to pores&quot; is contrasted with diffusion in the next phrase. But presumptive pore transport here is presumably diffusive. The physical ideas need to be spelled out more carefully.</p><p>- Grounds are lacking for the assertion in subsection “Overall structure of the cargo-loaded IMEF encapsulin” about the observed conformational diversity being important for pore function.</p><p>- In subsection “Non-covalent chainmail and thermal stability of the IMEF system”, the absence of a patent pore is not evidence for a gated pore.</p><p>- More caution is required on the claim of ions and density in the central regions of the capsid oligomers. For one, averaging often accentuates noise on symmetry axes. But further the identities/charge of any molecules there are entirely unknown; the densities could be water for example.</p><p>5) The authors discuss the probability that features of the cryo-EM map, including the IMEF densities, are artifacts of averaging, which is almost certainly the case. This could be mitigated by symmetry expansion (relion_particle_symmetry_expand) and focussed classification/refinement for a clearer picture of the IMEF protein within the encapsulin shell. This is not essential, but would strengthen the paper considerably.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46070.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Most of the comments pertain to improving the presentation and discussion of the work.</p><p>1) There seems to be a systemic problem with not introducing or explaining key ideas and relationships early enough.

However, we agree that for scientists not familiar with the field, additional explanation and discussion will be very helpful. Therefore, we have included a substantial amount of additional information throughout the manuscript, particularly comparing and contrasting our findings with other encapsulin systems. We have included the following sentences:</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>“So far, operons involved in hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide detoxification as well as iron mineralization have been reported (Nichols, Cassidy-Amstutz, Chaijarasphong and Savage, 2017). The main cargo protein-types described to date are DyP-type peroxidases, hemerythrins and different classes of ferritin-like proteins (Contreras et al., 2014; Giessen and Silver, 2017; McHugh et al., 2014; Rahmanpour and Bugg, 2013).”</p><p>Subsection “Overall structure of the cargo-loaded IMEF encapsulin “:</p><p>“The IMEF compartment is substantially larger than previously reported encapsulins and possesses a triangulation number of T = 4 instead of T = 1 (60 subunits, 24 nm) or T = 3 (180 subunits, 32 nm) and represents the largest encapsulin compartment reported to date (Figure 1—figure supplement 2E).”</p><p>Subsection “Overall structure of the cargo-loaded IMEF encapsulin”:</p><p>“In contrast, T = 1 encapsulins consist of only 12 pentameric capsomers while the T = 3 encapsulin shell is made up of 12 pentameric and 20 hexameric capsomers. The T = 4 IMEF-system consequently possesses an internal volume 530% and 220% larger than that of T = 1 and T = 3 encapsulins, respectively.”</p><p>Subsection “Pores in the IMEF encapsulin shell”:</p><p>“Similarly, pores at the symmetry axes were also reported for T = 1 and T = 3 encapsulin systems.”</p><p>Subsection “Iron mineralization and storage by the IMEF-system”:</p><p>&quot; Thus, IMEF-systems are able to store substantially more iron than any known ferritin system (2,000 – 4,000 Fe atoms) (Andrews, 1998; Harrison and Arosio, 1996).”</p><p>The following passages discussing our findings and comparing them with other known systems were already present in our initial submission:</p><p>Subsection “Overall structure of the cargo-loaded IMEF encapsulin”:</p><p>“E-loops are located at capsomer interfaces and their relative orientation plays a key role in determining the overall topology and triangulation number of encapsulin compartments as evidenced by comparison of the IMEF T = 4 monomer with T = 1 (Thermotoga maritima), T = 3 (Pyrococcus furiosus) and T = 7 (HK97 phage) capsid proteins (Figure 1C).”</p><p>Subsection “Pores in the IMEF encapsulin shell”:</p><p>“This is similar to the negatively charged pores in ferritin systems that guide positively charged iron to the ferritin interior (Arosio et al., 2017). In no other encapsulin system are all pores negatively charged indicating that pores in the IMEF-system are optimized for attracting and channeling positively charged ions. The 2-fold pores observed at the interface of two capsomers in T = 1 and T = 3 encapsulins are not present in the IMEF-system (Nichols et al., 2017). The 3-fold pore forms the largest channel to the IMEF compartment interior and is 7.2 Å wide at its narrowest point, substantially larger than previously reported encapsulin pores.”</p><p>Subsection “Pores in the IMEF encapsulin shell”:</p><p>“The 2-fold symmetry axes at the center of hexameric capsomers also represent potential channels, as observed in T = 3 systems (Nichols et al., 2017)”</p><p>Subsection “Non-covalent chainmail and thermal stability of the IMEF-system”:</p><p>“This architecture has only been observed in a number of viral capsids including the HK97 bacteriophage but not in a bacterial system. In contrast to HK97 where an isopeptide bond covalently links E-loops and P-domains (Duda, 1998), the IMEF encapsulin uses non-covalent interactions.”</p><p>Subsection “Structure and analysis of the IMEF cargo protein”:</p><p>“This IMEF ferroxidase motif differs from known examples and represents an alternative way of forming an inter-subunit ferroxidase center (Figure 3D).”</p><p>Subsection “TP-mediated cargo-shell co-assembly”:</p><p>“The main TP binding sites surrounding the 2-fold symmetry axes are formed by conserved residues of the P-domain and N-terminal helix (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) similar to the T. maritima T = 1 encapsulin system (Sutter et al., 2008). No TP binding site has been identified for T = 3 encapsulins yet.”</p><p>Subsection “Iron mineralization and storage by the IMEF-system”:</p><p>“Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) further indicates that this mineralized material is amorphous (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C), similar to bacterioferritin systems (Andrews et al., 1993). The high P content and amorphous cores described for the IMEF encapsulin are similar to bacterioferritin systems (Aitken-Rogers et al., 2004; Mann, Bannister and Williams, 1986). It has been hypothesized that amorphous material can be more readily mobilized under iron-limited condition than crystallized iron mineral (Watt, Frankel, Jacobs, Huang and Papaefthymiou, 1992; Watt, Hilton and Graff, 2010).”</p><p>Subsection “Iron mineralization and storage by the IMEF-system”:</p><p>“In contrast to ferritin systems, IMEF encapsulins are two-component systems with the catalytic activity separated from the protein shell. The IMEF cargo protein is flexibly tethered and primarily localizes 4.5 nm away from the capsid interior.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors state that 'A newly discovered class of protein organelles called encapsulin nanocompartments are implicated in microbial iron and redox metabolism and have so far only been shown to be involved in oxidative stress response (Giessen and Silver, 2017; He et al., 2016; McHugh et al., 2014; Sutter et al., 2008).', but cite a paper (McHugh, 2014) in which iron storage by an encapsulin is well documented.

A 3D structure was necessary to deduce which residues were involved in ferroxidase center formation which then allowed us to go back to the sequence and designate a new ferroxidase motif in the IMEF cargo protein. We have changed the text accordingly:</p><p>Subsection “Structure and analysis of the IMEF cargo protein”:</p><p>“Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the IMEF cargo protein is a member of the Flp superfamily and is most closely related to Dps proteins (Figure 3A and Supplementary file 3) but no known ferroxidase motifs could be detected based on the primary sequence alone (Andrews, 2010).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A few technical issues also need to be addressed:</p><p>4) The following points can be addressed changes to the text:</p><p>- The issue of symmetry averaging and its presumptive effects on certain parts of the structure like the cargo are not handled cleanly (See subsection “Overall structure of the cargo-loaded IMEF encapsulin”; subsection “TP-mediated cargo-shell co-assembly”). The authors infer flexibility in some cases where lack of icosahedral symmetry in the presence of averaging would likely have the same effect. How would the cargo protein survive averaging if it sits as a single dimer bound to a pentamer at an icosahedral vertex?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this could have been handled more clearly and have changed the text accordingly:</p><p>Subsection “Overall structure of the cargo-loaded IMEF encapsulin”:</p><p>“No connection of cargo and shell density is visible, likely due to averaging or the flexibility of a 37 amino acid linker preceding the IMEF targeting peptide that directs and anchors the IMEF cargo to the shell interior. Averaging and linker flexibility likely also contribute to the lower resolution observed for the interior IMEF densities.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In subsection “Iron mineralization and storage by the IMEF system”, the logic about the shell permeability and kinetic curve shapes is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have expanded our explanation of the ferroxidase time curves as follows:</p><p>Subsection “Iron mineralization and storage by the IMEF-system”:</p><p>“However, assaying the IMEF cargo-loaded encapsulin results in a typical hyperbolic enzyme catalysis curve. These observations imply that the encapsulin shell controls the flux of iron to the inside of the compartment leading to a controlled and low concentration of soluble iron in the encapsulin interior. Therefore, the IMEF cargo protein is able to enzymatically oxidize the majority of ferrous iron before uncontrolled autocatalytic mineralization can lead to bulk precipitation of iron which would likely destroy the iron storage function of the IMEF-system (Figure 4 —figure supplement 4).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In subsection “Iron mineralization and storage by the IMEF system”, the idea of being &quot;channeled to pores&quot; is contrasted with diffusion in the next phrase. But presumptive pore transport here is presumably diffusive. The physical ideas need to be spelled out more carefully.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the wording was confusing and have changed it accordingly:</p><p>Subsection “Iron mineralization and storage by the IMEF-system”:</p><p>“This suggests that once iron enters the encapsulin interior via pores, it diffuses to the ferroxidase active site of the IMEF cargo, making it necessary to strictly control interior iron concentration to prevent runaway mineralization.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Grounds are lacking for the assertion in subsection “Overall structure of the cargo-loaded IMEF encapsulin” about the observed conformational diversity being important for pore function.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have changed the text accordingly:</p><p>Subsection “Overall structure of the cargo-loaded IMEF encapsulin”:</p><p>“A-domain loops form compartment pores and are likely adapted to optimize the particular function of a given encapsulin, for example ROS detoxification or iron mineralization. In addition, local resolution maps indicate that E-loops and A-domain loops represent the most flexible parts of the shell which suggests a certain structural flexibility of the pores formed by A-domain loops (Figure 1—figure supplement 4).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In subsection “Non-covalent chainmail and thermal stability of the IMEF system”, the absence of a patent pore is not evidence for a gated pore.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have changed the wording:</p><p>Subsection “Pores in the IMEF encapsulin shell”:</p><p>“This observation combined with the flexibility observed for loops around the 2- and 5-fold symmetry axes in local resolution maps (Figure 1—figure supplement 4) could indicate the presence of gated pores in encapsulins that may regulate ion flux to the compartment interior, similar to some ferritins (Theil, Liu and Tosha, 2008).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- More caution is required on the claim of ions and density in the central regions of the capsid oligomers. For one, averaging often accentuates noise on symmetry axes. But further the identities/charge of any molecules there are entirely unknown; the densities could be water for example.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have changed the text to:</p><p>Subsection “Pores in the IMEF encapsulin shell”:</p><p>“Extra cryo-EM density is observed at the center of both the 3-fold and 5-fold pores. This could be a result of averaging accentuating noise on symmetry axes or potentially represent bound ions (e.g. Fe<sup>2+/3+</sup>) or even water molecules.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors discuss the probability that features of the cryo-EM map, including the IMEF densities, are artifacts of averaging, which is almost certainly the case. This could be mitigated by symmetry expansion (relion_particle_symmetry_expand) and focussed classification/refinement for a clearer picture of the IMEF protein within the encapsulin shell. This is not essential, but would strengthen the paper considerably.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this excellent suggestion. We have carried out the suggested analysis and have included an additional figure supplement (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) as well as a novel paragraph in the main text and Materials and methods section:</p><p>Subsection “Overall structure of the cargo-loaded IMEF encapsulin”:</p><p>“To further investigate and better resolve the cargo densities, we applied an approach combining symmetry expansion and focused classification with residual signal subtraction (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). This approach was able to separate cargo densities bound at slightly different locations indicating that the symmetry observed for the cargo densities (Figure 1b) is a result of averaging. The observed non-symmetrical densities are still weak compared to the shell density. At low threshold values possible connections between cargo densities and the shell are visible, potentially representing the linker connecting the cargo with the bound TP (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).”</p><p>Subsection “Symmetry expansion and focused classification”:</p><p>“In an attempt to better resolve cargo density within the encapsulin shell we used an approach combining symmetry expansion and focused classification with residual signal subtraction. Prior to symmetry expansion and focused classification, particles were binned to a box size of 192 with a corresponding pixel size of 3.41Å. Following refinement of binned particles with icosahedral symmetry, a 60Å low-pass filtered mask of a hexameric encapsulin shell unit with associated cargo density was generated (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A). Symmetry expansion was performed with relion_particle_symmetry_expand specifying “I” symmetry to generate a new particle stack with 60x increased particle number. Residual signal subtraction was performed as described previously (Bai, Rajendra, Yang, Shi and Scheres, 2015) to subtract encapsulin shell and cargo densities outside of the 60Å low-pass filtered mask from the symmetry expanded particle dataset (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B). Focused classification without alignment and without applied symmetry was then performed in Relion3.0 to resolve cargo density bound in different configurations to the encapsulin shell and potential connections between the cargo and targeting peptide (Figure 1—figure supplement 3C).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
