swine, an intermediate host that supports adaptation of human-preferred receptor-binding specificity by the hemagglutinin (HA) surface antigen. Other HA traits necessary for pandemic potential are poorly understood. For swine influenza viruses isolated in 2009–2016, gamma-clade viruses had less stable HA proteins (activation pH 5.5–5.9) than pandemic clade (pH 5.0–5.5). Gamma-clade viruses replicated to higher levels in mammalian cells than pandemic clade. In ferrets, a model for human adaptation, a relatively stable HA protein (pH 5.5–5.6) was necessary for efficient replication and airborne transmission. The overall airborne transmission frequency in ferrets for four isolates tested was 42%, and isolate G15 airborne transmitted 100% after selection of a variant with a stabilized HA. The results suggest swine influenza viruses containing both a stabilized HA and alpha-2,6 receptor binding in tandem pose greater pandemic risk. Increasing evidence supports adding HA stability to pre-pandemic risk assessment algorithms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>influenza A virus</kwd><kwd>swine viruses</kwd><kwd>viral fusion protein</kwd><kwd>virus transmissibility</kwd><kwd>virus adaptation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HHSN272201400006C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Meng</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Guohua</given-names></name><name><surname>DeBeauchamp</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name><name><surname>Crumpton</surname><given-names>Jeri Carol</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Hyunsuh</given-names></name><name><surname>Kercher</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Bowman</surname><given-names>Andrew S</given-names></name><name><surname>Webster</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name><name><surname>Webby</surname><given-names>Richard J</given-names></name><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>Charles J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007737</institution-id><institution>St. Jude Children's Research Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Meng</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Guohua</given-names></name><name><surname>DeBeauchamp</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name><name><surname>Crumpton</surname><given-names>Jeri Carol</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Hyunsuh</given-names></name><name><surname>Kercher</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Webster</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name><name><surname>Webby</surname><given-names>Richard J</given-names></name><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>Charles J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012524</institution-id><institution>American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Meng</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Guohua</given-names></name><name><surname>DeBeauchamp</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name><name><surname>Crumpton</surname><given-names>Jeri Carol</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Hyunsuh</given-names></name><name><surname>Kercher</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Webster</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name><name><surname>Webby</surname><given-names>Richard J</given-names></name><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>Charles J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI116744</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Xiu-Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Infection experiments in ferrets reveal swine influenza viruses need their hemagglutinin antigen to become stabilized for transmissibility, adding a new property to consider when triaging field isolates for pandemic potential.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aside from recent bat isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kandeil et al., 2019</xref>), influenza A viruses (IAVs) originate from avian species and transmit to humans directly or via other animals (e.g. swine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Long et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Russell et al., 2018</xref>). Genetically and antigenically diverse IAV strains circulate in wild and domestic birds, aquatic mammals, canine, swine, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Long et al., 2019b</xref>). IAVs contain eight RNA gene segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shaw and Palese, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noda et al., 2018</xref>), and three previous human pandemic viruses (1957, 1968, and 2009) underwent gene reassortment before spreading to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garten et al., 2009</xref>). Swine can serve as an intermediate host between avian species and humans in part by expressing both avian IAV-preferred (α2,3-linked) and human IAV-preferred (α2,6-linked) sialic-acid-terminated receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rajao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Graaf and Fouchier, 2014</xref>). Currently, H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 subtypes are endemic in swine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walia et al., 2019</xref>), and it is challenging to triage these genetically diverse viruses for pre-pandemic countermeasures.</p><p>In addition to pandemics, swine IAVs cause sporadic spillovers from swine to humans. More than 400 cases of swine-IAV infections in humans have been documented between 2005 and 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">World Health Organization (WHO), 2018</xref>). H1N1-subtype IAVs are currently enzootic in swine, constituting a pool of genetically diverse and continuously evolving strains. Swine H1N1 strains are divided into three major lineages: classical swine (1A), human seasonal (1B), and Eurasian avian (1C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>). The classical swine lineage branches into three clades based on early regional considerations: alpha (α; 1A.1), beta (β; 1A.2), and gamma (γ; 1A.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>). In approximately 1999, gamma viruses split into two branches: swine gamma (1A.3.3.3) and swine viruses that later contributed the hemagglutinin (HA) gene to the 2009 human pandemic virus (1A.3.3.2). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). Frequently after 2009, HA and other gene segments from H1N1pdm viruses transmitted from humans to swine, generating diverse reassortant viruses. Swine gamma viruses isolated after 2009 contain varying numbers of internal genes originating from human H1N1pdm viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ducatez et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we studied H1N1pdm and gamma clade viruses because these two clades contain HA genes that are closely related to the 2009 pandemic and many gamma clade viruses have one or more H1N1pdm internal genes that are already human adapted.</p><p>During IAV entry, HA trimers bind to sialic-acid-terminating moieties, triggering endocytosis of virions. Avian IAVs have HA proteins evolved to bind glycoprotein and glycolipid receptors having terminal sialic acids with an α−2,3 linkage, and human-adapted IAVs have HA proteins containing receptor-binding pocket mutations that allow higher affinity binding to α−2,6-linked sialic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Graaf and Fouchier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xiong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gambaryan and Matrosovich, 2015</xref>). Within minutes after endocytosis, virions are exposed to increasing acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mellman et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cain et al., 1989</xref>). Upon reaching a threshold pH that varies by virus and typically ranges from pH 4.8 to 6.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galloway et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Russell et al., 2018</xref>), spring-loaded HA nanomachines are triggered to irreversibly change their structures and fuse the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skehel and Wiley, 2000</xref>). Thus, IAV entry is regulated by HA receptor binding specificity and HA stability.</p><p>Avian IAVs typically have HA proteins triggered at pH 5.5–6.2 while H1N1pdm isolates (2010–2011) have been shown to trend lower at pH 5.3–5.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Russell et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that avian-to-human adaptation of the HA protein may include a decrease in activation pH. Multiple mechanisms may be operational. HA proteins with a lower activation pH have increased resistance to extracellular inactivation and have increased environmental stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poulson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Labadie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Russier et al., 2020</xref>). This may be important because the human upper respiratory tract is mildly acidic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">England et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Man et al., 2017</xref>). Intracellularly, opposing intracellular forces may select for intermediate HA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singanayagam et al., 2019</xref>), which may help minimize interferon responses both in dendritic cells triggered by high-pH HA proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Russier et al., 2020</xref>) and in late endosomes triggered by low-pH HA proteins via interactions with IFITM2 and IFITM3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerlach et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, an optimal HA stability is essential for virus replication.</p><p>A pandemic-capable IAV requires its HA protein has been unseen immunologically by the majority of the population and is able to support efficient replication and transmission between humans. Pandemic risk assessment tools developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) consider virologic, population, and ecological/epidemiological factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2019</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">World Health Organization (WHO), 2016</xref>). These are called IRAT and TIPRA, respectively. The algorithms explicitly consider HA receptor-binding specificity; however, other virologic properties that may be important are not included or are only considered indirectly by virtue of transmission experiments (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Russell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lipsitch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Long et al., 2019b</xref>). Presently, HA stability is not considered in risk assessment tools but has been linked to IAV transmission and host adaptation. HA stabilization occurred after H1N1pdm circulation in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maurer-Stroh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russier et al., 2016</xref>) and has been shown to be necessary for airborne transmission of avian H5N1 and 2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm) viruses in ferrets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Imai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herfst et al., 2012</xref>). As swine provide an established pathway for the emergence of pandemic influenza and HA stability is an intrinsic property of the key gene involved in pandemics, we considered it important to determine the impact of HA stability on swine IAV replication and transmissibility.</p><p>In this study, we hypothesized that contemporary swine viruses vary in HA stability and strains having more stable HA proteins are more likely to transmit by the airborne route in ferrets. To test this hypothesis, we measured HA activation pH for a panel of H1N1 swine gamma viruses and infected ferrets with genetically related pairs of H1N1 swine gamma viruses that differed in HA stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>H1N1 gamma isolates from swine had higher HA activation pH values than pandemic isolates from swine and humans</title><p>To survey HA stability of contemporary H1N1 influenza A viruses (IAVs), we collected 34 swine and 21 human H1N1 IAVs (2009–2016) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses of HA segments showed that 22 swine isolates were gamma clade while 21 human and 12 swine isolates were pandemic (pdm) clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

HA activation pH values for 2/3 of the P19 donor ferrets remained at pH 5.9 despite containing a majority of the stabilizing HA2-N117 variant. High-pH syncytia formation for these samples was most likely induced by the remaining minority population of the HA2-T117 variant. Upon first detection in P19 contact ferrets, HA2-N117 was over 90% abundant, and this variant comprised over 99% of the population in the airborne ferret. Contamination by P24 (also contained HA2-N117) was ruled out, as HA2-N117-containing P19-group samples retained identifying nucleotide PA-1749T (P24 had nucleotide PA-1749C at this position). Similar to Pair 1, the dominant population of P19 in the inoculum with an unstable HA protein (pH 5.9, HA2-T117) was outcompeted and did not airborne transmit. Although airborne transmission in the Pair 2 experiment was infrequent (1/6 total), a moderately stable HA (pH 5.6, HA2-N117) was necessary for efficient replication and airborne transmission.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This work showed that HA proteins from pandemic-clade human and swine IAVs are relatively stable (activation pH 5.0–5.5) while those from swine gamma viruses are less stable (pH 5.5–5.9). A moderately stable HA protein (pH 5.5–5.6) was necessary for efficient replication and partial airborne transmission of swine gamma viruses in ferrets. Despite replicating to higher levels in MDCK cells than human pandemic viruses, swine gamma viruses with unstable HA proteins (pH 5.8–5.9) were not airborne transmitted and were outgrown quickly by minor variants that contained stabilized HA proteins. Overall, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that HA stabilization is necessary for airborne transmission of swine IAVs in ferrets. The results also suggest that a stabilized HA (pH &lt;5.6) and human-like receptor-binding in tandem are necessary for IAV airborne transmissibility in ferrets.</p><p>The HA protein has two primary roles during virus entry: receptor binding and acid-induced membrane fusion. Previous studies have indicated HA binding to α−2,6-linked sialic acid receptors and a relatively low HA activation pH may contribute to airborne transmissibility in ferrets (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Graaf and Fouchier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cauldwell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Russell et al., 2018</xref>), a phenotype often considered a predictor of human adaptation. In the present study, ferrets were infected with natural isolates of swine H1N1 gamma viruses that varied in HA stability and had dual affinities toward α−2,6- and α−2,3-linked sialic acid receptors. Viruses containing an unstable HA protein did not transmit by the airborne route, and all viruses isolated from airborne recipients contained stabilized HA proteins. For A/H1N1pdm, a destabilizing mutation (HA1-Y17H, pH 6.0) eliminated airborne transmissibility in ferrets despite the virus retaining α−2,6 receptor-binding specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russier et al., 2016</xref>). This suggested that α−2,6 receptor-binding specificity was insufficient to promote airborne transmission in the absence of a stabilized HA protein. The mutant virus regained airborne transmissibility by acquiring two mutations that lowered its activation pH to 5.3. A/H5N1 viruses with relatively unstable HA proteins (pH &gt;5.5) were engineered to have α−2,6 receptor-binding specificity but did not become airborne transmissible in ferrets until acquiring a mutation that decreased the HA activation pH to 5.5 or lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Imai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herfst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Linster et al., 2014</xref>). In other studies, HA stabilization of A/H5N1 viruses in the absence of α−2,6 receptor-binding specificity increased virus growth in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets but was insufficient to promote airborne transmissibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zaraket et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shelton et al., 2013</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest α−2,6 receptor-binding and a stabilized HA protein (pH &lt;5.6) in tandem are necessary for IAV airborne transmission in ferrets; neither property appears sufficient without the other.</p><p>For the swine gamma viruses studied here, α−2,6 receptor binding and a relatively stable HA protein was necessary for airborne transmissibility in ferrets but was insufficient for robust transmission. The swine gamma viruses also bound α−2,3 receptors, which was associated with a loss of airborne transmissibility for A/H1N1/1918 in ferrets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tumpey et al., 2007</xref>), perhaps due to increased binding to human bronchial mucins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamblin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vahey and Fletcher, 2019</xref>). A/H7N9 viruses with dual receptor<bold>-</bold>binding affinities have also been shown to have limited or very poor airborne transmissibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Richard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belser et al., 2013</xref>), although these viruses may lack other properties necessary for airborne transmissibility such as a stabilized HA protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zaraket et al., 2015</xref>). Ferrets, humans, and other animals differentially express complex glycopolymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walther et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Byrd-Leotis et al., 2014</xref>), and mammalian and avian influenza viruses bind differently to both sialylated and phosphorylated, nonsialylated glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byrd-Leotis et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, refinements in binding to α−2,6-linked sialic acid (and perhaps other) receptors may be needed to enhance airborne transmissibility. For example, airborne transmission by the A/H1N1pdm09 virus was conferred by binding to long-chain α−2,6-linked sialic acids even when α−2,3 binding was retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lakdawala et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition to HA receptor binding and stability, other adaptive properties contributing to influenza virus transmission include polymerase activity, virus morphology, and resistance to host-based restrictions to replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mänz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bogdanow et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Long et al., 2019a</xref>). Such adaptations may also be needed for swine gamma viruses to adapt highly efficient airborne transmissibility in ferrets. In this study, only 1/3 of airborne-exposed ferrets in the P4 group seroconverted while G15-HA1-S210 airborne-transmitted 3/3. Both P4 and G15-HA1-S210 had identical HA sequences (including HA1-S210) and HA stabilities. As the two viruses differed only at amino-acid residues PA-271 and PB2-648, suboptimal polymerase activity is most likely responsible for the limited airborne transmissibility of P4.</p><p>Additional supporting data from follow-up studies could support the conclusion of this study that HA stabilization is necessary but not sufficient for airborne transmission of swine gamma viruses between ferrets. Samples obtained from nasal washes in this experiment could be plaque purified to isolate G15-HA1-N210, G15-HA1-S210, and P4-HA1-S210. G15-HA1-N210 and G15-HA1-S210 are identical except for the stability-altering residue at HA1-210; therefore, differences in replication and transmission in ferrets between the two viruses would map exclusively to the HA protein. Comparing infection with G15-HA1-S210 and P4-HA1-S210, which have identical HA genes but differ at polymerase residues PA-271 and PB2-648, may reveal the importance of the polymerase genes in supporting airborne transmission of the related swine gamma viruses.</p><p>Swine are susceptible to both avian and human IAVs, in part by supporting replication of viruses that bind to either α−2,3- or α−2,6-linked receptors. We speculate swine may also serve as an avian-human intermediate host for HA stabilization. H1N1 viruses of the classical, Eurasian, and triple-reassortant swine lineages isolated before 2009 have HA activation pH values of 5.4–6.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russier et al., 2016</xref>). The present study showed that gamma-clade IAVs isolated 2012–2016 also have moderately stable to unstable HA proteins (pH 5.5–6.0) and that a moderately stable HA protein (pH 5.5–5.6) is necessary for airborne transmission in ferrets. Recently, three H1N1 variant (H1N1v) viruses of the gamma clade that had been isolated from humans were found to have HA activation pH values of ~5.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pulit-Penaloza et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, an alpha-lineage H1N2v virus with an HA activation pH of 5.5 promoted airborne transmission in ferrets while delta-clade H1N2 viruses with less stable HA proteins (pH 5.6–5.7) promoted only partial airborne transmission (1 or 2 out of 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pulit-Penaloza et al., 2018</xref>). This supports the notion that increased HA stability promotes increased airborne transmissibility in ferrets. As the transmitted viruses collected from airborne recipients in the above study were not phenotyped and genotyped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pulit-Penaloza et al., 2018</xref>), it is possible that the transmitted H1N1v and H1N2v viruses had activation pH values differing from input virus, similar to our results of gamma viruses G15 and P19.</p><p>In summary, contemporary swine H1N1 gamma viruses were found to have HA activation pH values higher than those of the currently circulating pandemic-clade, and HA stabilization enhanced gamma virus growth and was necessary but not sufficient for airborne transmission in ferrets. This work, combined with other recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Imai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herfst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Linster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pulit-Penaloza et al., 2018</xref>), support the proposition that HA stability in tandem with receptor-binding specificity should be considered in pandemic risk assessment tools. Gamma viruses are one of the most prevalent lineages in swine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diaz et al., 2017</xref>) and are widely distributed in many locations including USA, Mexico, China, Hong Kong, and South Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nelson et al., 2015</xref>). These viruses have caused sporadic human infections in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">World Health Organization (WHO), 2018</xref>). Prior studies suggest IAVs endemic in swine reassort readily with 2009 pandemic viruses and many have obtained pandemic internal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rajão et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ducatez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vijaykrishna et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we found viruses G15 and P4 contained M and NP genes of 2009 human pandemic origin, while P19 and P24 contained M, PB2, PB1, and PA of 2009 human pandemic origin. The harboring of pandemic gene segments by swine gamma viruses increases their potential to evolve into a pandemic virus. For A/H3N2 swine viruses, reassortment with 2009 pandemic genes has been found to be associated with increased pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rajão et al., 2017</xref>). We conclude that the evolution of currently circulating swine IAVs, especially gamma clade, should be closely monitored for increased pandemic potential.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Animal (Mustela putorius furo)</td><td>Fitch ferret</td><td>Triple F Farms</td><td/><td>male, 5–6 months old</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Canis lupus familiaris</italic>)</td><td>MDCK, Madin-Darby Canine Kidney epithelial</td><td>ATCC</td><td>ATCC Cat# CCL-34, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0422">CVCL_0422</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Chlorocebus sabaeus</italic>)</td><td>Vero, African green monkey kidney epithelial</td><td>ATCC</td><td>ATCC Cat# CCL-81, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0059">CVCL_0059</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>)</td><td>Swine testis (ST) fibroblast</td><td>ATCC</td><td>ATCC Cat# CRL-1746, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_2204">CVCL_2204</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>293T/17 [HEK 293T/17], Human epithelial kidney expressing SV40 large T antigen</td><td>ATCC</td><td>ATCC Cat# CRL-11268, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1926">CVCL_1926</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pHW2000 A/TN/2009 cDNA reverse genetics plasmids</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russier et al., 2016</xref></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26811446/">26811446</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pHW2000 swine gamma HA and NA cDNA reverse genetics plasmids</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software</td><td>CLC Genomics Workbench 11.0.1</td><td>Qiagen</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software</td><td>Prism 7</td><td>GraphPad</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (Influenza A virus)</td><td>A/Tennessee/1-560/2009 (H1N1)</td><td>NCBI</td><td>NCBI:txid646491</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (Influenza A virus)</td><td>A/swine/Illinois/2A-1213-G15/2013 (H1N1) HA</td><td>Genbank</td><td>MT533249</td><td>A_sw_IL_1213G15_13_HA</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (Influenza A virus)</td><td>A/swine/Illinois/2B-0314-P4/2014 (H1N1) HA</td><td>Genbank</td><td>MT533251</td><td>A_sw_IL_2B0314P4_14_HA</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (Influenza A virus)</td><td>A/swine/Illinois/2E-0113-P19/2013 (H1N1) HA</td><td>Genbank</td><td>MT533255</td><td>A_sw_IL_2E0113P19_13_HA</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (Influenza A virus)</td><td>A/swine/Illinois/2E-0113-P24/2013 (H1N1) HA</td><td>Genbank</td><td>MT533252</td><td>A_sw_IL_2E0113P24_13_HA</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, swine testicular (ST) cells, and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 T cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific), Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Life Technologies), DMEM, and Opti-MEM reduced Serum Medium (Life Technologies), respectively.

Viral RNAs were extracted from ferret nasal wash samples (unless otherwise indicated). Subsequently, virus cDNAs were obtained by reverse-transcription PCR using SuperScript III First-strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). DNA libraries were prepared by PCR amplification using Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with HF Buffer (New England BioLabs). The resulting PCR products were purified by QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and submitted to the St. Jude Harwell Center for virus whole-genome sequencing. Sequencing data were analyzed using CLC Genomics Workbench version 11.0.1. Variants were reported when the predefined quality scores were met, and they were presented in forward and reverse reads at an equal ratio. All variants presented in this study were supported by at least 10 reads with a minimum frequency of 5%. Heat maps and parts of whole were generated by using GraphPad Prism version 7 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Ferret transmission experiments</title><p>Thirty-six male Fitch ferrets (five- to six-month-old, purchased from Triple F Farms, Sayre, PA) were verified to be serologically negative for currently circulating IAVs, influenza B viruses, and viruses used in this study by HAI assay.

On day 0, 3 naive ferrets each (Donor) were intranasally inoculated with 10<sup>6</sup> PFU of tested viruses in 500 μl and were caged separately. On day 1, another 3 naive ferrets each (Contact) were co-housed with the Donor ferrets. At the same time, 3 naive ferrets each (Airborne) were introduced in adjacent cages. Aerosol exposure was permitted among ferrets within tested viruses but was not allowed between the tested viruses. Ferret body weight and temperature were monitored daily until day 14. Ferret nasal washes were collected every other day until day 14. Additionally, all ferrets were euthanized on day 21 to collect whole blood.

The characteristics of these proteins that promote airborne transmission of influenza viruses are not fully established. This paper presents data supporting the notion that haemagglutinins requiring more acidic pH for fusion, i.e. that are more stable, promote airborne transmission. The authors argue that this feature should be incorporated into pre-pandemic assessments.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;HA stabilization promotes replication and transmission of swine H1N1 gamma influenza viruses in ferrets&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Karla Kirkegaard as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Based on the individual reviews below and discussions between the reviewers, we will be willing to consider a revised version of the paper that addresses the issues raised in the reviews. The most significant of these being a lack of statistical analysis, and requests for more detail on some of the experiments as well as the fusion assay. One reviewer is particularly concerned that your hypothesis is only supported by a very detailed examination of the properties of the recovered material in one of the two experimental transmissions and that the hypothesis has not been tested further. He/she is concerned that the case for HA stabilization promoting replication and transmission is overstated. You should seek to address this issue in a revised paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Hu et al. have analysed the properties of swine γ clade and pandemic flu viruses to determine whether specific properties of the hemagglutinin molecule (HA), namely receptor specificity and fusion pH, influence transmission in ferrets. Based on the data presented, the authors conclude that both properties are important and that viruses with more stable HA molecules (i.e. requiring lower pH for fusion) are better able to undergo airborne transmission in ferrets. From this analysis, and similar conclusions from other published work, the authors argue that HA stability should be included as a risk factor when considering the pandemic risk of new flu viruses.</p><p>Overall, the work is well done, though it might be argued that the animal data is somewhat compromised by the small sample size. Nevertheless, the conclusions are consistent with those published from other laboratories, using different flu viruses. I have just a few remarks for the authors to consider.</p><p>1) The conclusion that viruses with more stable HAs undergo airborne transmission more efficiently is undermined with the P4/G15 pair, in which 3/3 G15 challenges showed transmission, but only 1/3 P4 airborne challenges sero-converted. Although the authors show the virus transmitted in the G15 sample was the minority 210S virus, they do not really discuss why the P4 result was lower than might have been expected.</p><p>2) The authors should give more details of the syncytium assay used to determine the fusion pH for the different viruses. Do they score a fusion index for the different pH conditions and, if so, what is the threshold at which fusion is deemed to have occurred? Is HA expressed at similar levels for all of the viruses and, if not, would this comprise fusion efficiency?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript addresses a very important question that remains a critical area of influenza biology that is needed for assessing the risks associated with emerging influenza viruses: The virological parameters promote airborne transmission of influenza viruses is not well understood. In this manuscript this has been explored for a subset of swine influenza viruses, those in a subgroup of the swine H1N1 viruses in the γ clade. These γ clade wine influenza viruses have caused zoonotic infections and they provided six of the eight RNA segments of the H1N1pdm09 viruses. In this sense the material is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The hypothesis is that viruses able to be spread by an airborne route have hemagglutinin glycoproteins (HA) that undergo the low pH-induced conformational change of the HA required for fusion of the virus envelope with the membranes of the cell at a reduced pH. At first examination this was not apparent from the simple phenotypes of the viruses chosen for study but a detailed examination of the viruses supports this hypothesis.</p><p>1) The results compared the low pH induced show that human H1N1pdm09 viruses and swine viruses with the HA derived from the human virus displayed a lower pH of fusion of infected vero cells than did the swine viruses chosen to exemplify the swine gamma lineage viruses. The authors then chose examples of swine viruses to examine in more detail, two pairs being chosen that showed differences in their pH of fusion within the pair.</p><p>Receptor binding, fusion and replication properties of these viruses were established and then examined in transmission studies between infected ferrets, direct contact ferrets and ferrets infected by an airborne route.</p><p>2) At first examination of the results seemed not to be consistent with the hypothesis. What was seen was that in Pair 1 seemingly more efficient transmission in the virus showing a reduced pH of fusion was not apparent from the simple phenotypes of the viruses chosen for study. The results (Figure 5) show from pair 1 virus G15 showed better or earlier infection of the ferrets by an airborne route than did virus P4, notably as assessed by serology. Whether these results are statistically significant differences need to be established. In Figure 7 the results of the ferret transmission from the other pair of viruses is shown. Here virus P24, with the lower pH of fusion, showed now evidence for transmission in ferrets by the airborne route whilst P19 resulted in transmission to one of the three ferrets exposed by the airborne route. No statistical analysis were presented. In both cases the virus with the higher pH of fusion was the one that seemed to transmit by the airborne route more efficiently – taken at face value.</p><p>3) However, more work was done to examine the properties of the virus that was able to be transmitted by the airborne route. This was done for virus recovered from the P19/P24 pair. Here the virus collected from donor ferrets, contact ferrets and airborne infected ferrets were examined. The results shown in Figure 8 seemed to show that virus form the contact-infected and the airborne-infected ferrets from the donor infected with P19 showed a lower pH of fusion than seen in some of the donor ferrets whilst this drop in pH of fusion was not seen in the directly contact ferrets infected from the P24 infected ferrets. The results shown in Figure 8C are consistent with the proposal that transmission might be linked to a polymorphism at residue 117 of HA2. However, selection of N117 of HA2 was observed in the donor ferrets.

The naturally circulating gamma clade swine viruses have hemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins that generally mediate membrane fusion at relatively high pH compared to human strains and other swine strains. Comparison of ferret transmission phenotypes of virus pairs with similar genetic backbones showed that single genetic differences that lead to more stable HAs (lower fusion pH) correlated with increased airborne transmission. Notably, the increased transmission observed in one example could be traced directly to selection of a stabilizing HA change detected in the virus population of airborne-transmitted recipient ferrets. Other phenotypic changes including receptor binding specificity were not observed when comparing virus pairs. The results provide direct evidence to support the premise that HA stability serves as a potential determinant of airborne transmission and should be included in risk assessment tools and guidelines for determining pandemic potential of influenza viruses circulating in swine or other non-human hosts. The experiments are well designed and the data are solid and support the conclusions made by the investigators. The paper is well written and will be of interest to a broad readership.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56236.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Based on the individual reviews below and discussions between the reviewers, we will be willing to consider a revised version of the paper that addresses the issues raised in the reviews.

In the revised manuscript, we both limit the claims and explicitly state that the relevant conclusion requires additional supporting data. In the future when we are able, we intend to perform the recommended follow-up experiment and write a brief paper that may support the conclusions of this paper.</p><p>Limiting the claims:</p><p>1) We edited the end of the Abstract to, “These results suggest (instead of show) swine influenza viruses containing both a stabilized HA and α-2,6 receptor binding in tandem pose greater pandemic risk. Increasing evidence supports adding HA stability to pre-pandemic risk assessment algorithms.”</p><p>2) We deleted the last sentence of the Introduction that stated: “Indeed, the results confirmed HA stabilization was necessary for γ virus replication and transmission in ferrets.”</p><p>3) We edited the first paragraph of the Discussion to, “Overall, these results are consistent with (instead of confirmed) the hypothesis that HA stabilization is necessary for airborne transmission of swine IAVs in ferrets.”</p><p>4) We added the following caveat to the first sentence of the last paragraph in the Discussion, “In summary, contemporary gamma swine viruses were found to have HA activation pH values higher than those of the currently circulating pandemic-clade, and HA stabilization enhanced gamma virus growth and was necessary but not sufficient for airborne transmission in ferrets.”</p><p>Additional data that could support the conclusion:</p><p>We added the following paragraph to the Discussion: “Additional supporting data from follow-up studies could support the conclusion of this study that HA stabilization is necessary but not sufficient for airborne transmission of swine gamma viruses between ferrets. Samples obtained from nasal washes in this experiment could be plaque purified to isolate G15-HA1-N210, G15-HA1-S210, and P4-HA1-S210. G15-HA1-N210 and G15-HA1-S210 are identical except for the stability-altering residue at HA1-210; therefore, differences in replication and transmission in ferrets between the two viruses would map exclusively to the HA protein. Comparing infection with G15-HA1-S210 and P4-HA1-S210, which have identical HA genes but differ at polymerase residues PA-271 and PB2-648, may reveal the importance of the polymerase genes in supporting airborne transmission of the related swine gamma viruses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Hu et al. have analysed the properties of swine gamma clade and pandemic flu viruses to determine whether specific properties of the hemagglutinin molecule (HA), namely receptor specificity and fusion pH, influence transmission in ferrets. Based on the data presented, the authors conclude that both properties are important and that viruses with more stable HA molecules (i.e. requiring lower pH for fusion) are better able to undergo airborne transmission in ferrets. From this analysis, and similar conclusions from other published work, the authors argue that HA stability should be included as a risk factor when considering the pandemic risk of new flu viruses.</p><p>Overall, the work is well done, though it might be argued that the animal data is somewhat compromised by the small sample size. Nevertheless, the conclusions are consistent with those published from other laboratories, using different flu viruses. I have just a few remarks for the authors to consider.</p><p>1) The conclusion that viruses with more stable HAs undergo airborne transmission more efficiently is undermined with the P4/G15 pair, in which 3/3 G15 challenges showed transmission, but only 1/3 P4 airborne challenges sero-converted. Although the authors show the virus transmitted in the G15 sample was the minority 210S virus, they do not really discuss why the P4 result was lower than might have been expected.</p></disp-quote><p>In the fourth paragraph of the Discussion, we added the following two sentences to discuss the P4 results: “In this study, only 1/3 of airborne-exposed ferrets in the P4 group seroconverted while G15-HA1-S210 airborne-transmitted 3/3. Both P4 and G15-HA1-S210 had identical HA sequences (including HA1-S210) and HA stabilities. As the two viruses differed only at amino-acid residues PA-271 and PB2-648, suboptimal polymerase activity is most likely responsible for the limited airborne transmissibility of P4.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should give more details of the syncytium assay used to determine the fusion pH for the different viruses. Do they score a fusion index for the different pH conditions and, if so, what is the threshold at which fusion is deemed to have occurred? Is HA expressed at similar levels for all of the viruses and, if not, would this comprise fusion efficiency?</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following explanation to the “HA stability” section of the Materials and methods: “A baseline of no virus-induced syncytia formation was obtained by exposing the cells to pH 6.2 media, a condition under which Vero cells formed no visible syncytia. Micrographs were scored positive for syncytia formation if a field contained at least two syncytia that had at least 5 nuclei. HA activation pH values for syncytia assays were reported as the highest pH that induced syncytia as judged by positive scoring. Differences in HA cell-surface expression could affect the number of syncytia observed per field but would not be expected to alter the reported threshold pH level at which syncytia are induced.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript addresses a very important question that remains a critical area of influenza biology that is needed for assessing the risks associated with emerging influenza viruses: The virological parameters promote airborne transmission of influenza viruses is not well understood. In this manuscript this has been explored for a subset of swine influenza viruses, those in a subgroup of the swine H1N1 viruses in the γ clade. These γ clade wine influenza viruses have caused zoonotic infections and they provided six of the eight RNA segments of the H1N1pdm09 viruses. In this sense the material is suitable for publication in eLife.</p><p>The hypothesis is that viruses able to be spread by an airborne route have hemagglutinin glycoproteins (HA) that undergo the low pH-induced conformational change of the HA required for fusion of the virus envelope with the membranes of the cell at a reduced pH. At first examination this was not apparent from the simple phenotypes of the viruses chosen for study but a detailed examination of the viruses supports this hypothesis.</p><p>1) The results compared the low pH induced show that human H1N1pdm09 viruses and swine viruses with the HA derived from the human virus displayed a lower pH of fusion of infected vero cells than did the swine viruses chosen to exemplify the swine gamma lineage viruses. The authors then chose examples of swine viruses to examine in more detail, two pairs being chosen that showed differences in their pH of fusion within the pair.</p><p>Receptor binding, fusion and replication properties of these viruses were established and then examined in transmission studies between infected ferrets, direct contact ferrets and ferrets infected by an airborne route.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment describes the results and makes no suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) At first examination of the results seemed not to be consistent with the hypothesis. What was seen was that in Pair 1 seemingly more efficient transmission in the virus showing a reduced pH of fusion was not apparent from the simple phenotypes of the viruses chosen for study. The results (Figure 5) show from pair 1 virus G15 showed better or earlier infection of the ferrets by an airborne route than did virus P4, notably as assessed by serology. Whether these results are statistically significant differences need to be established. In Figure 7 the results of the ferret transmission from the other pair of viruses is shown. Here virus P24, with the lower pH of fusion, showed now evidence for transmission in ferrets by the airborne route whilst P19 resulted in transmission to one of the three ferrets exposed by the airborne route. No statistical analysis were presented. In both cases the virus with the higher pH of fusion was the one that seemed to transmit by the airborne route more efficiently – taken at face value.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following sentence to the Figure 5 legend, “The difference of 3/3 versus 1/3 airborne-transmission events was not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05).”. We added the following sentence to the Figure 7 legend, “The difference of 1/3 versus 0/3 airborne-transmission events was not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05).” P values for the titers and peak titer days are included in the Results section and in Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) However, more work was done to examine the properties of the virus that was able to be transmitted by the airborne route. This was done for virus recovered from the P19/P24 pair. Here the virus collected from donor ferrets, contact ferrets and airborne infected ferrets were examined. The results shown in Figure 8 seemed to show that virus form the contact-infected and the airborne-infected ferrets from the donor infected with P19 showed a lower pH of fusion than seen in some of the donor ferrets whilst this drop in pH of fusion was not seen in the directly contact ferrets infected from the P24 infected ferrets. The results shown in Figure 8C are consistent with the proposal that transmission might be linked to a polymorphism at residue 117 of HA2. However, selection of N117 of HA2 was observed in the donor ferrets. The selection of the variant was therefore not clear cut.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following explanation to the Results section: “HA activation pH values for 2/3 of the P19 donor ferrets remained at pH 5.9 despite containing a majority of the stabilizing HA2-N117 variant. High-pH syncytia formation for these samples was most likely induced by the remaining minority population of the HA2-T117 variant.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Overall, the hypothesis that a low pH of fusion promotes virus transmission is supported by the work described when examined in detail. The hypothesis is not supported without the very detailed examination of the properties of the recovered material from the infected ferrets in one of the two experimental transmissions. However, no further testing of the authors' hypothesis has been done on the recovered viruses to examine their transmission between ferrets.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following paragraph to the Discussion and plan to do the experiment in the future when we are able:</p><p>“Additional supporting data from follow-up studies could support the conclusion of this study that HA stabilization is necessary but not sufficient for airborne transmission of swine gamma viruses between ferrets. Samples obtained from nasal washes in this experiment could be plaque purified to isolate G15-HA1-N210, G15-HA1-S210, and P4-HA1-S210. G15-HA1-N210 and G15-HA1-S210 are identical except for the stability-altering residue at HA1-210; therefore, differences in replication and transmission in ferrets between the two viruses would map exclusively to the HA protein. Comparing infection with G15-HA1-S210 and P4-HA1-S210, which have identical HA genes but differ at polymerase residues PA-271 and PB2-648, may reveal the importance of the polymerase genes in supporting airborne transmission of the related swine gamma viruses.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
