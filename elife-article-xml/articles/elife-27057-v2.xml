Despite its vital importance, this behavior puts individuals at risk by consuming limited internal energy during locomotion. We have developed a novel assay to investigate how food-search behavior is organized in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larvae dwelling in hydrogels mimicking their natural habitat. We define three main behavioral modes: resting at the gel’s surface, digging while feeding near the surface, and apneic dives. In unstimulated conditions, larvae spend most of their time digging. By contrast, deep and long exploratory dives are promoted by olfactory stimulations. Hypoxia and chemical repellents impair diving. We report remarkable differences in the <italic>dig-and-dive</italic> behavior of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and the fruit-pest <italic>D. suzukii</italic>.

The common lab species, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, is a cosmopolitan species that breeds on multiple sites, including tomatoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mccoy, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jaenike, 1983</xref>). Most of the substrates where larvae grow are characterized by soft semiliquid structures similar to hydrogels. When placed on a slice of fresh tomato, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae readily locate the soft middle layer of the fruit, called the locular gel, and dig into it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and A’</xref>). The marked preference for the locular gel over the more external mescocarp layer appears to be mostly due to the soft composition of the locular gel rather than potential differences in nutritive values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Digging behavior is commonly observed in regular food vials and in behavioral assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Not surprisingly, digging takes place when the softness of low-density-agarose gels is similar to the natural habitats of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (for stiffness measurements related to tomato pulp, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grant et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Hereafter, exploration of the substrate along the vertical axis will be referred to as ‘dives’. As nutritional and pH conditions vary along the depth of a fruit, exploratory dives permit larvae to search for conditions that satisfy their metabolic and physiological needs. Diving is also thought to facilitate dispersal through the environment while minimizing predator encounters at the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Godoy-Herrera, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">1994</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27057.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Foraging behaviors of larvae on a fruit and in controlled laboratory conditions.</title><p>Digging and diving behaviors of larvae in (<bold>A</bold>) a tomato slice, (<bold>B</bold>) a vial of lab food (arrowheads indicate diving larvae), and (<bold>C</bold>) a plain agarose slab (2%, w/v).

Like their adult counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enjin et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae are highly sensitive to humidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benz, 1956</xref>). Dwelling into semiliquid media prevents desiccation. It also enables larvae to hide from strong daylight and from predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hwang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robertson et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast with detailed analysis of foraging and odor-driven responses elicited on flat surfaces of agarose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sokolowski, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cobb, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kreher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Louis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gershow et al., 2012</xref>), the organization of digging and diving behaviors into 3D substrates remains poorly understood. Here, we present a new experimental system, called <italic>dig-and-dive</italic> assay, to study food-search behavior in naturalistic conditions. We built a transparent chamber filled with an agarose gel in which the digging and diving of single larvae can be monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Individuals that failed to return to the surface after a few minutes stopped moving and the majority of them drowned. In the present work, we examined how the initiation of apneic dives is conditioned by physiological and sensory signals. First, we studied the effect of hypoxia on diving behavior. By partially blocking the respiratory tracks of larvae, we found evidence that the level of oxygenation determines the propensity of larvae to dive. This result suggests that diving is regulated by a cost-benefit balance, which combines internal physiological signals (e.g., oxygenation level and possibly hunger) with external cues (e.g., presence of food odor). Second, we studied the effect of the hardness of the substrate on the control of diving behavior. Third, we asked whether the detection of an attractive odor is sufficient to modulate food-search behavior and, more specifically, to promote diving. Our results demonstrate that larvae perceive and respond to liquid-borne odorant molecules. In line with the idea that diving relies on a cost-benefit balance adjusted by sensory signals, we found that the duration of apneic dives increases upon detection of an attractive odor. We compared the dig-and-dive behavior of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> with a second species of the Drosophila group, the fruit pest <italic>D. suzukii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with the innate preference of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> for fresh fruits, larvae of this species are capable of digging into harder substrates than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Our results indicate that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> is also more resistant to hypoxia. Finally, we report the existence of species-specific differences in the modulatory effects of attractive and repulsive odors on the dig-and-dive behavior of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. suzukii</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Larvae forage in hydrogels by surfacing, digging, and diving</title><p>To study food-search behavior in hydrogel structures that resemble the natural habitats of larvae, we created a miniature device using a micro-milling method and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer to build a transparent chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The whole assay consists of three sub-regions: a closeable channel at the top to load a larva, a wide air chamber, and a long and narrow agarose chamber with a length of 12 mm that corresponds to approximately three-body lengths of larvae at the third developmental instar (Materials and methods). The width of the agarose chamber is 3 mm to permit larvae to turn around in the channel and to resurface. The dig-and-dive assay was designed to limit the exploration of the chamber along the horizontal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Larvae were constrained to the chamber by a silicon cap inserted through the top of the loading channel. Although the chamber was closed, oxygen was supplied through two thin air channels on the side of the cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In this transparent assay, the behavior of individual larvae was recorded with a CCD camera. A computer vision algorithm was then applied to extract the position of the centroid of the larva during the course of a 15 min experiment.</p><p>Larvae displayed a behavior that strongly depended on their position in the assay chamber. At the surface, larvae tended to be inactive. While immersed in the agarose gel, larvae demonstrated two different types of behavior: right under the surface, they oriented head down and kept their spiracles in contact with the air at the gel’s interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We term this ‘snorkeling’ behavior <italic>digging</italic>. Larval digging is commonly observed in transparent food vials in the lab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sokolowski, 1982</xref>). Digging permits larvae to feed and breathe while staying hidden from predators at the surface. When the posterior spiracles of the larva went below the surface of the gel, larvae initiated apneic dives along the vertical axis of the chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Individual dives lasted up to a couple of hundred seconds during which the larva remained active until it returned to the surface. To classify the main behavioral modes observed in the dig-and-dive assay, we computed the probability density function (PDF) of the vertical position of the centroid of the larva (variable denoted as Z) in the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left panel). The mean of the PDF was located 2.7 mm below the surface of the gel. The PDF displayed a long tail toward each end of the chamber. Accordingly, we divided the PDF into three different regions based on two thresholds, Z<sub>digging</sub> = 0 and Z<sub>diving</sub> = −3.6 mm (see Materials and methods). In the upper tail of the PDF (Z &gt; Z<sub>digging</sub>), larvae moved in the air chamber above the surface of the gel. We defined this behavioral mode as <italic>surfacing</italic>. In the central region of the PDF (Z<sub>diving</sub> &lt; Z ≤ Z<sub>digging</sub>), larvae were engaged in digging with at least half of their bodies embedded in the gel. As larvae appeared to be actively feeding through the contraction of their mouth hook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sokolowski, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Green et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schoofs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), digging can be associated with the exploitation of the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2007</xref>). The bottom part of the PDF (Z ≤ Z<sub>diving</sub>) corresponded to <italic>diving</italic> behavior during which oxygenation at the surface was interrupted and larvae became hypoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morton, 2011</xref>). Diving can be associated with the exploration of the medium. Behaviors of individual larvae tested in the dig-and-dive assay were annotated based on these three elementary modes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Substrate hardness affects exploratory behavior</title><p>Building on our observation that larvae display a strong preference for the softer internal layer of tomato slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and A’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we investigated the effects of the stiffness of the substrate on diving behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We took advantage of the fact that the stiffness of an agarose gel is proportional to the percentage of agarose mixed with water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grant et al., 2012</xref>). In low-percentage agarose gels (0.05% w/v), surfacing was the dominant behavioral mode in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Nearly no diving was observed in 0.05% agarose gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that motion through peristalsis is inefficient in soft hydrogels (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Compared to substrate of intermediate hardness (0.4%), the probability distribution of the larval centroid was displaced toward the air chamber in 0.05% agarose gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The peak of the PDF corresponding to 0.05% agarose gels coincided with the top of the air chamber, indicating that <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae actively avoided soft substrates after having experienced their textures (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Individuals that failed to return to the surface stopped moving after a few minutes. Given that inactive larvae were found to have drowned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), immersed animals that stopped being active were not included in the analysis. In the other extreme condition of hardness, larvae were tested in hard media of 2% agarose (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). In this condition, larvae rested at the surface of the gel during ~80% of the trial with short periods of digging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This trend is reflected in the shift of the PDF of larval positions toward the air chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). For densities equal to or higher than 3% agarose, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae could neither dig nor dive into the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Louis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apostolopoulou et al., 2014</xref>). For intermediate gel hardness, larvae spent variable fractions of time in the three main behavioral modes: surfacing, digging and diving (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The largest percentage of time spent in dive mode was observed in gels of intermediate hardness (0.2% agarose). For media with an agarose percentage higher than 0.2%, the median duration of individual dives decreased with the hardness of the gel, and so did the maximum dive depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In summary, we found that <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae spent most of their time at the surface when the environment was either too soft or too hard. For media with intermediate textures, the balance between digging and diving was influenced by the stiffness of the gel: diving tended to be suppressed as the hardness of the substrate increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The difficulty of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae to dig into hard substrates probably explains their preference for the internal soft layers of tomato slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27057.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Modulation of exploratory behavior by the hardness of the substrate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Percentage of time spent in each of the three elementary behavioral modes: diving (green), digging (blue) and surfacing (red) of larvae foraging in agarose gels of different hardness.

In the tracheae of the larva, longitudinal transport of oxygen takes place by means of passive diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krogh, 1920</xref>). Upon submersion into liquid, the extremities of the anterior and the posterior spiracles are closed by hydrophobic hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manning and Krasnow, 1993</xref>). As larvae feed head-down with their posterior end in contact with the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panel), the two posterior spiracles can be viewed as ‘snorkeling’ devices that enable larvae to stay oxygenated while digging into the medium.

While larvae did not dive into the medium directly upon their introduction in a chamber devoid of odor, the presence of the odor promoted diving shortly after the beginning of the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, right panel).

These two functions showed that larvae dived deeper and longer in the presence of the odor. We found a positive correlation between diving time and the maximum depth of a dive. The durations of individual dives increased with the maximum dive depth. Moreover, the depths of individual dives increased in presence of the odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This result suggests that <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae spent more time searching for the odor source at the bottom of the chamber. On the other hand, the presence of the odor led to a non-significant increase in dive frequency while the dive speed remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>). We observed no correlation between the duration of a dive and the duration of surfacing that followed diving (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2F</xref>). This result argues that most dives did not reach their aerobic limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kooyman et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyd, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In short, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> showed an attractive response to the food odor, ethyl acetate, by increasing the time larvae spent in diving mode with a synchronization of their first dive at the beginning of the trial. To examine whether these behavioral changes were mediated by the olfactory system, we tested the dig-and-dive behavior of larvae with genetically silenced olfactory sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Larsson et al., 2004</xref>). Larvae with impaired olfactory function did not respond to the presence of the liquid-borne odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This established that the behavioral response elicited by liquid-borne odors is not predominantly mediated by the gustatory system. Taken together, the previous results indicate that larvae can make use of the detection of odors in liquid phase to direct explorative dives toward a potential food source. In agreement with this idea, diving is nearly fully impaired when larvae detect the presence of natural food (yeast) mixed with the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The addition of sugar (fructose) alone to the substrate was found to have the same blocking effect on diving (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Moreover, sugar promoted feeding behavior through repeated mouth hook contractions during digging but not during diving (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). The basal rate of mouth hook contraction observed during diving is part of the locomotor program that permits larvae to move in the agarose substrate. In conclusion, diving can be viewed as an exploratory food-search behavior that can be driven by olfactory cues but that is largely uncoupled from active feeding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Ecological differences in dig-and-dive behavior between <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic></title><p>In nature, <italic>Drosophila</italic> species experience a wide variety of food resources whose properties differ in stiffness and nutrient composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hansson and Stensmyr, 2011</xref>).

The increase of the fraction of time spent in dive mode resulted from a tenfold increase in the duration of individual dives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), reflecting the higher tolerance of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> larvae to hypoxia.

First, we established the attractiveness of ethyl acetate to <italic>D. suzukii</italic> in a standard chemotaxis assay in which the odor was delivered in gaseous phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). When presented in the dig-and-dive assay, ethyl acetate led to a significant reduction in total dive time in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) with no dramatic decrease in the duration of individual dives (median times of 1.1 and 0.8 min for the no-odor and the odor conditions, respectively; Wilcoxon rank-sum test p=0.24). The decrease in total dive time could result from the transient nature of the attractive response and/or a gradual aversion to the odor. We examined both possibilities by characterizing the change in diving behavior induced by the odor. While a decrease in the number of dives is expected for aversive responses, we found no obvious reduction in the average number of dives with and without odor (2.0 ± 1.2 and 1.9 ± 1.5, respectively).

Even in the absence of odor, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> frequently reached the bottom of the chamber. By contrast, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> performed shallower dives (the maximum dive depth for <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is 7.1 ± 3.4 mm and 5.2 ± 1.6 mm, respectively). In presence of ethyl acetate, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> dived as deep as <italic>D. suzukii</italic> (6.6 ± 2.7 mm and 6.6 ± 3.0 mm, respectively). Since the odor affected neither the time spent at the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) nor the average dive depth, we concluded that ethyl acetate is unlikely to act as a repellent in <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. Although the odor synchronized diving at the beginning of the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), the increase in dive probability was only transient compared to the sustained stimulation of diving in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> undergo a transient attractive response to the food-odor ethyl acetate in the dig-and-dive assay. The transient nature of the response in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> contrasts with the persistent attraction the odor elicited in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</p><p>Finally, we examined the modulatory effect of a repulsive odor, geosmin — an earthy volatile chemical produced by fungi and bacteria. Geosmin has been shown to elicit avoidance responses in adult flies of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. suzukii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stensmyr et al., 2012</xref>). Using the dig-and-dive assay, we tested whether geosmin (0.5 mM) induced aversive behavior in larvae. Like for the attractive odor, a small quantity of geosmin was injected near the bottom of the agarose gel. For both <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, detection of geosmin affected the dynamics of the dig-and-dive behavior. However, several aspects of the behavioral modulation were species-specific. For <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, geosmin did not induce a significant change in the fraction of time spent diving, but it significantly increased surfacing time — a trend characteristic of aversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>). While surfacing larvae avoided contact with the gel, corroborating the idea that geosmin acted as a repellent in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). It was nonetheless observed that geosmin had a synchronizing effect on the first dive at the beginning of the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Thus, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> showed a transient attractive response at the beginning of the trial that turned into prolonged aversion. For <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, geosmin produced a significant decrease in the fraction of time spent diving (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>) coupled with a significant increase in surfacing time. Geosmin suppressed diving shortly after the beginning of the trial (left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). It also decreased the probability of diving deeper and increased the probability of staying above the surface of the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The ethogram of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> illustrates the emergence of a fourth behavioral mode: escaping out of the arena through the air channels (light gray traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Considering the difference between the diameter of the air channels (~0.2 mm) through which larvae attempted to escape and the diameter of the larval body (~1 mm), escaping must be a behavior that requires substantial energy. Upon stimulation with geosmin, a quarter of the larvae escaped the assay while none did so in absence of the chemical. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>, similar escape responses were observed for <italic>D. suzukii</italic> exposed to the common insect repellent DEET (N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown and Hebert, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ditzen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Katz et al., 2008</xref>). Based on these observations, we conclude that geosmin acts as a repellent in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. suzukii</italic> species: it promotes exit and escape from the substrate.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27057.029</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Behavioral responses to an aversive odor (geosmin) in two different Drosophila species.</title><p>(<bold>A, D</bold>) Ethograms of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. suzukii</italic> larvae in the presence of 1 µL of 0.5 mM geosmin (Geos) injected at a depth of 11 mm below the surface of the gel (<italic>n</italic> = 24 and <italic>n</italic> = 22 trials).

Here we present a new assay to study how the integration of sensory cues and internal states modulate the dynamics of exploratory behaviors in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva. While larval orientation behavior has been extensively examined on planar surfaces in response to stable airborne odor gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Louis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gershow et al., 2012</xref>), larvae live in complex tridimensional hydrogel structures formed by fruits and decaying organic materials. We developed a novel assay called <italic>dig-and-dive</italic> to monitor the exploratory behavior of larvae in diving chambers filled with agarose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Like in previous analysis of crawling behavior on planar surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Green et al., 1983</xref>), we defined elementary modes of behavior. Those include: (1) surfacing when most of the body laid above the surface of the hydrogel, (2) digging when the body was immersed into the agarose but the posterior spiracles remained in contact with the surface, (3) diving when the larva broke contact with the surface. We showed that active feeding is associated with digging but not diving (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). In addition, we defined (4) escaping as the aversive response displayed by larvae that attempted to leave the assay upon detection of repulsive chemicals.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae move through peristaltic crawling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berrigan and Pepin, 1995</xref>). Although the biomechanics of peristalsis is not fully understood, locomotion results from the interactions of the body with the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Omori et al., 2009</xref>). The mechanical properties of the substrate surrounding the larva are therefore expected to affect the efficiency of its motion. Accordingly, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae were highly sensitive to the hardness of the hydrogel used in the dig-and-dive assay. Diving was impaired in hard media with an agarose percentage superior to 2% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). By contrast, diving was observed in softer gels with an agarose percentage that ranged between 0.1% and 0.6%. This result is consistent with the behavior of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> in tomato slices where larvae demonstrated a marked preference to dig into the soft part of the fruit (hardness inferior to 1% agarose), while avoiding the harder part of the fruit (hardness superior to 2% agarose, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grant et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In very soft gels with an agarose percentage of 0.05%, the insufficient friction precluded efficient motion and posed the risk of drowning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae that attempted to dive in soft gels refrained from initiating subsequent dives (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), which suggests that individual larvae were capable of assessing the risk of drowning in very soft gels.</p><p>Compared to most other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species that feed preferentially on ripe or damaged fruits having fallen from the tree, <italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic> targets fresh fruits to lay their eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keesey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karageorgi et al., 2017</xref>). Females of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> oviposit below the skin of berries and cherries. When <italic>D. suzukii</italic> larvae hatch, they must feed and grow in conditions that are stiffer than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. We therefore hypothesized about the existence of species-specific differences in the dig-and-dive behavior of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. We found that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> moved more efficiently than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> in soft substrates. In addition, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> were capable of diving into hard media impenetrable to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref> and compare the 2% agarose condition in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This hints at a possible specialization of the locomotor program of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to permit digging in stiffer conditions. While the organization of peristalsis does not appear to be grossly different between both species, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> larvae are slightly larger than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Walsh et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> larvae implement longer dives than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This behavioral difference might reflect a higher tolerance of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to oxygen deficits (hypoxia). Consistent with this idea, obstructing the posterior spiracles of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> larvae did not fully impair diving in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). In future work, it will be interesting to define whether the enhanced ability of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to dig and dive into hard media results from a specialization of specific body parts such as the mouth hooks or an adaptation of the locomotor program producing thrust during dives. As was observed in adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karageorgi et al., 2017</xref>), the ability of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> larvae to cope with stiffer substrates does not translate into a preference to feed on hard versus soft media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Peristaltic locomotion consumes large amounts of energy produced through respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berrigan and Lighton, 1993</xref>). As oxygen reserves are gradually consumed during apneic dives, larvae turn hypoxic and eventually return to the surface of the gel to re-oxygenate. Failure to re-oxygenate leads to complete immobility, which was shown to be associated with death through drowning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Diving can be viewed as a primitive form of risk-taking behavior directed by a balance between exploitation (surfacing and feeding through digging) and exploration (apneic dives). The importance of respiration in the control of diving was demonstrated here by subjecting larvae to non-lethal hypoxic stress (mechanical block of posterior spiracles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6E</xref>). Impairment of respiration reduced the probability of engaging in digging and diving in both species. <italic>D. suzukii</italic> nonetheless displayed a higher resistance to hypoxia than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The alternation between sequences of apneic dives and surfacing is reminiscent of food search behaviors in sea mammals. Whales, seals and turtles seek food during dives interspaced with resting phases at the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyd, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tyack et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Houghton et al., 2008</xref>). The lack of correlation between the duration of single dives and the subsequent resting phase suggests that most sea mammals perform aerobic dives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyd, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hooker and Baird, 1999</xref>). The same conclusion can be drawn for the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). How the duration of a dive is physiologically controlled by hypoxia remains to be elucidated.</p><p>The importance of olfactory cues has been established in the food-search behavior of terrestrial insects, reptiles and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fraenkel and Gunn, 1961</xref>) as well as birds, crustaceans and fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guilford et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeBose and Nevitt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nevitt et al., 2008</xref>). Olfaction is key to the survival of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae: attractive odors guide larvae towards food sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asahina et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gomez-Marin and Louis, 2012</xref>). Feeding in larvae is also facilitated by the aggregation of groups of larvae that expel digestive enzymes in their saliva — a process called social digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gregg et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sakaguchi and Suzuki, 2013</xref>). Spatial aggregation of larvae relies on the detection of pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mast et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Del Pino et al., 2015</xref>). Our results demonstrate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae can exploit aqueous olfactory cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). For both <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, the gradient of an attractive odor, ethyl acetate, promoted diving at the onset of the trial. In contrast with the sustained attraction elicited by ethyl acetate in gaseous phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), this odor did not promote sustained diving in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> after a first dive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Considering the fact that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> dives longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) but less frequently than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (1.9 ± 1.4 versus 4.1 ± 3.1 in absence of odor), we speculate that <italic>D. suzukii</italic> limits its exploratory dives after having experienced a first search that did not result in the successful discovery of food. By contrast, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> does not appear to be deterred by unsuccessful dives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overall, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. suzukii</italic> appear to have evolved different ways to weigh the factors that control the balance between surfacing, digging (exploitation) and exploratory dives. In both species, effective food search necessitates combining chemosensory cues with contextual information related to the physiological state and the history of the animal. Although the neural circuitry that computes the cost-benefit balance remains to be identified, recent work has highlighted the crucial role played by olfaction and nutrient homeostasis in the control of food-search behavior in adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>), and the involvement of the mushroom bodies and the lateral horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bräcker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Using the dig-and-dive assay, we examined whether aversive odors could be used as a means to deter larvae from digging and diving into fruits. We tested the effect of geosmin, an odorant volatile associated with the presence of toxic compounds in overripe fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stensmyr et al., 2012</xref>). In both <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, geosmin increased their surfacing time. In the case of <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, this trend co-occurred with a significant reduction in diving and active attempts to escape the assay chamber. For <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, we additionally tested the effect of the common insect repellent DEET (N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown and Hebert, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ditzen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Katz et al., 2008</xref>) and found that it elicited significant reduction in diving and that it promoted escapes out of the arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these observations highlight the potential of pest control strategies in which the use of non-toxic chemicals could refrain <italic>D. suzukii</italic> larvae from digging and diving, which in turn would slow down feeding and development and increase exposure to parasitoid wasps at the surface of fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cini et al., 2012</xref>). Such strategies could complement existing efforts to lure adult flies into traps filled with attractive volatile chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Walsh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the dig-and-dive assay appears well suited to identify and to characterize the effects of pheromones involved in aggregation behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gregg et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mast et al., 2014</xref>). This knowledge might guide future efforts to devise methods to interfere with the ability of larvae to aggregate and to destroy crops by feeding through their dig-and-dive behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Fly stocks were maintained on conventional cornmeal-agar molasses medium at 22°C in a 12 hr dark–light cycle.

A Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) milling machine was used to directly cut a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) substrate to create a master mold (tools down to 500 μm diameter and speeds of 20000 rpm). A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) prepolymer mixture (Sylgard 184, 10:1, Dow-Corning, Midland, MI) was then cast over the mold and cured at 80°C during 1 hr. After curing, the PDMS replica was peeled off from the mold, treated with oxygen plasma (50 W, 30 s) to activate the PDMS surface, and manually bonded to a glass slide (treated with oxygen plasma as well) to seal the chip. The inlet of each assay chamber was closed during the experiments with a PDMS cap. In both sides of the inlet, we made thin air channels (200 μm in thickness) to supply oxygen. Each assay chamber is divided into two sub-chambers excluding the inlet, air and agarose chambers, which are connected in series from the top. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, the air chamber has a width of 5 mm and a length of 2 mm.

To classify behavioral modes, the experimental PDF of larval centroid depths was smoothened by applying kernel density estimation. The PDF shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> is characterized by a long tail. We assumed that the dominant mode corresponded to digging, whereas the tail with large value corresponded to diving. Accordingly, the threshold value for diving mode (Z<sub>diving</sub> = −3.6 mm) was determined by taking the first local minimum of the estimated PDF below the mean, Z = −2.7 mm. The same methods were applied to define the threshold value for diving mode in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> (Z<sub>diving</sub> = −3.4 mm). As we could not easily define the point of overlap between the distributions of surfacing and diving modes in the estimated PDF, we arbitrarily set the threshold value for digging mode to the agarose surface (Z<sub>digging</sub> = 0 mm). This threshold was used for both species. In the experiments of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> with repellents, when the centroid of a larva was above the top of the air chamber, it was defined as the escaping mode. To quantify the percentage of escape, a given larva was labeled as having escaped as soon as its centroid had been observed out of the arena for more than 30 s. The duration of a single dive was defined as the time that a larva spent a continuous sequence of diving mode. Maximum dive depth was defined as the maximum depth reached during a given dive. Upon completion of each experiment, the behavior of individual larvae was visually inspected through a replay of the movies. The minority of larvae that were inactive (less than 10%) were excluded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavioral experiments and data analysis: quantification of mouth hook contractions during dig-and-dive behavior</title><p>The dig-and-dive assay was prepared with two types of agarose gels: 0.4% plain and 0.4% mixed with fructose (1.5 M).

After the introduction of the larvae, the cap of the tube was closed. In the 0.4% agarose gels, larvae were able to freely move up and down the gel substrate. Larvae could not move properly in the soft 0.05% gel. As a consequence, the group of larvae introduced in each tube was quickly separated into two subgroups: larvae that had sunk in the middle of the gel and larvae that managed to remain right below the surface of the gel. After 1 hr, larvae were collected from the tubes and transferred to food vials. For the 0.05% gels, the sunk and non-sunk larvae were maintained in separate food vials. The transferred larvae were kept in a 22°C incubator for 10 days before the number of adult flies was counted in the larva. We defined the survival ratio as the number of larvae that developed into adult flies divided by the total number of larvae. For 0.05% and 0.4% agarose gels, a survival ratio was calculated from the total number of larvae found in the vial.

When the test rejected the normality of a given sample with a confidence level higher than 95%, nonparametric tests were applied to compare the medians of this sample with other samples (Mann-Whitney test for pairwise comparisons and Kruskal-Wallis for comparisons of multiple samples). When the normality of samples involved in an experiment was confirmed, a two-tailed Student <italic>t</italic>-test was applied for pairwise comparisons. Whenever one of the samples to be compared was not normally distributed, we applied nonparametric statistics to treat the results of the entire collection of samples of this experiment.</p><p>For samples distributed according to normal distributions, the ‘sampsizepwr’ function from the Statistics toolbox in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) was used for sample-size estimations. To estimate the sample size (n<sub>0</sub>), we combined a standard power level of 0.8 with a suspected mean (µ) and standard deviation (σ), and desired difference (δ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zar, 1999</xref>). Suspected means, standard deviations and δ differences were derived from pilot experiments conducted with the dig-and-dive assay. To be on the conservative side, the final sample size for each experiment was chosen to be larger than the sample-size estimation. Through this procedure, we inferred that the sample size (n<sub>0</sub>) of the tests involving the dig-and-dive assay should be larger than 20. Since each assay contains six individual chambers (trials), we decided to conduct four repetitions to obtain a sample size of 24 independent trials for each experiment.</p><p>For samples distributed normally, the power of each statistical test was calculated with the sample size, mean, and standard deviation of the control group, and the difference between the control and test groups. For the experiments with more than one pairwise comparison, the power analysis was based on the least favorable pairwise comparison. We ensured that sample sizes were sufficiently large so that the power of each test exceeded 0.8. Throughout the study, we used Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> (absolute difference between means divided by the standard deviation) to control for the effect size for tests on differences in means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sheskin, 2003</xref>).

With a final sample size of 48, the power of this test was found to be 1. For the quantification of the percentages of time spent in a particular behavioral mode in the dig-and-dive assay, samples significantly departed from normal distributions and the previous power analysis did not apply. If the samples of the diving times of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> in 0.2% and 0.4% agarose chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) were assumed to be normally distributed, a <italic>t</italic>-test would be associated with a sample size n<sub>0</sub> = 20 for parameters µ = 4, σ = 15, and δ = 11.

Nailing down the relevant morphological and locomotor differences between both species will clarify how evolution acts to produce behavioral specialization. Mechanosensation and the neuromuscular systems are excellent candidates to display evolutionary differences. However a thorough comparative study would require work that goes beyond the scope of the present manuscript. Such a comprehensive study was recently achieved for egg-laying in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> (Karageorgi et al., 2017).</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) For the experiments with tomatoes: is the soft part more nutritious than the harder part? To what extent is the attraction to the soft part due to the differences in the nutritional value as opposed to textural differences like hardness? It is known that big cats first eat the soft inner organs of their prey, which presumably has greater nutritional value as well.</italic></p><p>We have conducted a series of new experiments to examine whether <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae show a preference for the locular-gel layer of tomatoes due to its stiffness or intrinsic nutritive properties. We introduced a preference assay in which a group of larvae is given a choice between two gels of equal stiffness mixed with extracts from either the locular or the mesocarp layers of regular tomatoes. Larval choice was studied in Petri dishes subdivided into 4 quadrants. The type of gel comprised in each quadrant could be laid independently. When larvae were tested for their responses to the locular and the mescocarp extracts in the absence of any differences in the substrate’s stiffness, they demonstrated no preference to any for two extracts. This result indicates that possible differences in the nutritive contents of the locular gel and mescocarp are insufficient to explain the preference for the locular gel. As reported in the following references (Grant et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012), the locular layers correspond to a hydrogel with a concentration equivalent to ~0.5%. By contrast the mesocarp is much harder and it corresponds to an agarose gel at a concentration of ~2.0%. Based on this information, we tested the preference of larvae for mesocarp extracts mixed in a gel of either 0.5% agarose (soft) or 2.0% agarose (hard). Larvae demonstrated a marked preference for the soft gel, which is sensible given that digging into softer substrates must entail a lower metabolic cost. These results are now presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. We conclude the preference of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae for the locular gel of tomatoes is due to the textural properties of this layer.</p><p><italic>2) Do Drosophila suzukii still prefer hard surfaces to lay their eggs if given a choice with a softer surface fruit? For example, between fresh and rotting cherries? What about larval behavior: do suzukii prefer harder surface when given a choice between soft and hard substrate?</italic></p><p>Recently, Prud’homme, Gompel and coworkers published an elegant study that documents the ability of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to lay eggs in substrates much stiffer than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. This aptitude explains one ecological advantage of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> over other species: by laying eggs in fresh fruits, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> ensures that its progeny populates food resources before they become suitable egg-laying sites for other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. Despite the ability of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to lay eggs in harder substrates than <italic>D. melanogaster, D. suzukii</italic> was found to prefer feeding on softer than harder fruits (Karageorgi et al., 2017). In the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, we tested the preference of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> larvae for soft (0.5% agarose) versus hard (2.0% agarose) substrates in a two-choice preference assay set in a Petri dish. Like their adult counterparts, <italic>D. suzukii</italic> larvae displayed a clear preference for soft substrates. Therefore the ability of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> larvae to cope with harder substrates does not appear to have co-evolved with a shift in preference for hard substrates in choice conditions.</p><p><italic>3) Mouth hook movements do not necessarily correlate with food intake, since these are also used for crawling and locomotion. How strict is the correlation between mouth hook movements and actual food intake in their assay? Do larvae change their mouth hook movements and decouple it with food intake when faced with increased drowning probability?</italic></p><p>In new experiments, we explored the correlation between feeding behavior and the dig-and-dive behavior. This question could not be addressed in very soft substrates where the probability of drowning is high since larvae refrained from digging and diving under such conditions and they spent most of their time surfacing (see 0.05% substrate hardness in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In the dig-and-dive assay, monitoring the mouth of hook contractions (MHC) of larvae on the surface is technically difficult and inaccurate. As an alternative, we monitored the behavior of immersed larvae exposed to food mixed with the substrate. The presence of food (sugar) has been shown to promote food ingestion through MHC, as documented by Shen and colleagues (Wang, Pu and Shen, 2013). Although we could not assess the instantaneous rate of food intake in the dig-and-dive assay, differences in food intake could be indirectly inferred from relative changes in the rates of MHC observed in presence and in absence of food. Following this logic, the rate of MHC was quantified manually from new high-resolution movies in both behavioral modes (see illustrative movie sequence in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, we had already established that yeast — a natural food source for larvae — promotes a shift from diving to digging. Unfortunately yeast-containing gels were slightly opaque, which precluded accurate tracking of the behavior of the larva. For this reason, we tested the behavior of larvae in agarose gels mixed with sugar (fructose), which produces strong attraction (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>) and is sufficient to act as an appetitive reward in classical conditioning experiments (Gerber and Stocker 2007). When placed in a sugar-containing substrate, the frequency of diving significantly decreased like in the presence of yeast (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>). The rates of MHC in the diving mode did not differ significantly in gels with and without sugar (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>), suggesting nearly no feeding activity. In agreement with the reviewer’s assertion, this basal rate of MHC might be part of the locomotor program that permits larvae to propel themselves through the agarose gel during dives. By contrast, the rate of MHC observed in digging mode significantly increased in presence of sugar. Larvae did not actively displace their whole body in digging mode, implying that the MHC might be mainly used for feeding. So, the change in MHC is likely to be due to an increase in the ingestion of food triggered by the detection of sugar. In conclusion, our observations indicate that digging is a behavioral mode that enables larvae to feed in conditions safer than on the surface. MHC during digging mostly serves the purpose of feeding without generating locomotion. Diving is a form of exploratory behavior that appears to be independent of active feeding. In line with the reviewer’s suggestion, MHC can be uncoupled from food intake during diving where it contributes to the locomotor program.</p></body></sub-article></article>
