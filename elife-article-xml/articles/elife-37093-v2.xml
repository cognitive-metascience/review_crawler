and colonization evaluated by transcript analysis or microscopy. Here we show that specific leaf-metabolites provide broadly applicable accurate proxies of these associations, suitable for HTP-screens. With a combination of untargeted and targeted metabolomics, we show that shoot accumulations of hydroxy- and carboxyblumenol C-glucosides mirror root AMF-colonization in <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> plants. Genetic/pharmacologic manipulations indicate that these AMF-indicative foliar blumenols are synthesized and transported from roots to shoots. These blumenol-derived foliar markers, found in many di- and monocotyledonous crop and model plants (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum, Solanum tuberosum, Hordeum vulgare, Triticum aestivum, Medicago truncatula</italic> and <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>), are not restricted to particular plant-AMF interactions, and are shown to be applicable for field-based QTL mapping of AMF-related genes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37093.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All plants need a nutrient called phosphorus to grow and thrive. Phosphorus is found in soil, but the supply is limited so plants often struggle to acquire enough of it. To overcome this problem, many plants form friendly relationships (or symbioses) with certain fungi in the soil known as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The fungi colonize plant roots and supply phosphorus and other nutrients in return for sugars and various molecules.</p><p>Although many crop plants – including barley and potatoes – are able to form these symbioses, farmers commonly apply fertilizers containing phosphate and other nutrients to their fields to increase the amount of food they produce. Breeding new crop varieties that are better at forming symbioses with the fungi could reduce the need for fertilizers. However, the methods currently available to study these relationships are laborious and time-consuming, typically requiring samples of plant roots to be examined in a laboratory.</p><p>Wang, Schäfer et al. used an approach called metabolomics to search for molecules in coyote tobacco plants that indicate the plants have formed symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The experiments found that a group of molecules called blumenols accumulate in the roots and also in the shoots and leaves of plants with these symbioses, but not in the tobacco plants that were not able to associate with the fungi. Experiments in several other plant species including tomato, potato and barley produced similar findings, suggesting that the blumenols may be a useful and potentially universal indicator of symbioses between many different plants and fungi.</p><p>Measuring the levels of blumenols in plant shoots and leaves is much quicker and easier than current methods of identifying fungal symbioses in plant root samples. Therefore, blumenols may be a useful tool for plant breeders who would like to screen large numbers of plants for these symbioses, and breed crops that negotiate better interactions with the beneficial fungi.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi</kwd><kwd>blumenol</kwd><kwd>colonization rate</kwd><kwd>high-throughput

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>More than 70% of all higher plants, including crop plants, form symbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brundrett and Tedersoo, 2018</xref>). While the fungus facilitates the uptake of mineral nutrients, in particular phosphorous (P) and nitrogen, the plant supplies the fungus with carbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Helber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bravo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keymer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luginbuehl et al., 2017</xref>). The interaction affects plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rooney et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolfsson et al., 2015</xref>) and resistance to various abiotic and biotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pineda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vannette et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chitarra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>). Although AMF interactions are physically restricted to the roots, they influence whole-plant performance, hence systemic metabolic responses have been anticipated, and searched for, but no general AMF-specific responses have been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Toussaint, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schweiger and Müller, 2015</xref>). While changes in foliar levels of carbohydrates, proteins, and amino acids, as well as secondary metabolites and phytohormones have been shown to respond to AMF inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schweiger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aliferis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adolfsson et al., 2017</xref>), these changes are not specific to AMF interactions and tend to be general responses to various abiotic and biotic stresses. Moreover, these metabolic responses also tend to be taxa-specific, and many are likely indirect consequences of AMF-mediated effects on plant growth and development.</p><p>In contrast, large amounts of blumenol-type metabolites accumulate in roots after AMF inoculation. These compounds are apocarotenoids, in particular C<sub>13</sub> cyclohexenone derivatives, produced by the cleavage of carotenoids. After AMF colonization, a C<sub>40</sub> carotenoid is cleaved by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 7 (CCD7) to produce a C<sub>13</sub> cyclohexenone and a C<sub>27</sub> apocarotenoid which is further cleaved by CCD1 to yield a second C<sub>13</sub> cyclohexenone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Floss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vogel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hou et al., 2016</xref>). The compounds have been found to accumulate in the roots of AMF-colonized plants in a manner highly correlated with the fungal colonization rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fester et al., 1999</xref>). Other stimuli such as pathogen infection and abiotic stresses, do not induce their accumulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maier et al., 1997</xref>). The AMF-induced accumulation of these compounds is widespread and has been observed in roots of plant species from different families, including mono- and dicotyledons, (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peipp et al., 1997</xref>); <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> and <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maier et al., 2000</xref>; e.g., <italic>Zea mays</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fester et al., 2002</xref>; <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> and <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fester et al., 2005</xref>; <italic>Ornithogalum umbellatum</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schliemann et al., 2006</xref>; <italic>Allium porrum</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schliemann et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Blumenols are classified into three major types; blumenol A, blumenol B and blumenol C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, previous studies have reported that only blumenol glycosides containing a blumenol C-based aglycone are positively correlated with mycorrhizal colonization. The aglycone can be additionally hydroxylated at the C11 or carboxylated at the C11 or C12 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maier et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, 7,8-didehydro versions of blumenol C have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peipp et al., 1997</xref>). The glycosylation usually occurs as an <italic>O</italic>-glycoside at the C9 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Strack and Fester, 2006</xref>), but glycosylations at the hydroxylated C11 position have also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schliemann et al., 2008</xref>). The glycosyl moiety can be a single sugar or combinations of glucose (Glc), rhamnose, apiose, arabinose and/or glucuronic acid, which, in turn can be additionally malonylated or contain a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate decoration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Strack and Fester, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schliemann et al., 2008</xref>).

However, most of these studies focused on the identification of natural products using large scale extractions (up to several kg of plant material) and were not performed in the context of AMF colonization. Furthermore, some blumenol compounds were also found in plant families that are known to have lost their ability to establish AMF interactions (Brassicaceae: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cutillo et al., 2005</xref>; Urticaceae: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aishan et al., 2010</xref>).

Untargeted metabolome profiling of roots using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (qTOF-MS) resulted in a concatenated data matrix consisting of 943 mass features (<italic>m/z</italic> signals detected at particular retention times).

Consequently, the investigation of AMF-mediated effects on a host plant’s physiology has been an important research field for many decades and characteristic transcriptional and metabolic changes have been observed in the roots of AMF-colonized plants. However, the cumbersome analysis of AMF-interactions, involving destructive harvesting of root tissues and microscopic or transcript analysis, restrains large-scale investigations and commercial applications. AMF interactions were also shown to affect the primary and secondary metabolism in the systemic, aerial tissues of plants; however none of these responses proved to be widespread and sufficiently specific to function as reliable markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schweiger and Müller, 2015</xref>). Here we describe the discovery of particular blumenols as AMF-indicative markers in leaves and other systemic aerial tissues and illustrate their potential application as tools for research and plant breeding.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Systemic AMF-mediated metabolite changes</title><p>Metabolites and metabolite responses are often specific to particular parts and tissues of a plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2017</xref>), but it is also known that local responses can spread to other plant parts. Additionally, metabolites do not only accumulate at their place of biosynthesis but can be readily transported throughout the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldwin, 1989</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that local changes in the roots might also be reflected in the systemic aerial tissues, either by signaling or transport. This allowed us to identify specific AMF-indicative blumenols in the shoot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) despite the occurrence of other highly abundant and constitutively produced compounds and blumenols that are not indicative of AMF-associations. Interestingly, the confirmation of compound identities in leaf samples with high resolution MS techniques proved to be challenging and required additional sample purification steps. Likely, such matrix effects thwarted the detection of these AMF-indicative, systemic blumenol responses in previous investigations. Under our conditions, AMF-indicative blumenols began mirroring the colonization rates of roots at around three wpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although microscopic methods can detect first signs of AMF colonization of the roots already after a few days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brundrett et al., 1985</xref>), the sensitivity of our method was found to be sufficient to analyze colonization rates observed in the glasshouse and, more importantly, in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). The discovery of these AMF-indicative blumenol compounds in diverse plant species interacting with different AMF species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) further indicates that these responses are widespread. AMF-induced blumenols in the roots have been shown to be quantifiable by various MS and photodiode array based detector setups. However, AMF-induced blumenols occur in many-fold lower amounts in the leaves compared to the roots (e.g., Compound 1 in <italic>N. attenuata</italic> approximately 1/10) and, at these low concentrations, their analysis is likely thwarted by complex matrix effects. Therefore, their analysis requires detection systems with advanced sensitivity and selectivity as is offered by state-of-the-art triple quadrupole technology and enhanced sample preparations (e.g., by solid-phase-extraction based purification and concentration) which were used in the quantitative detection of leaf blumenols described here. In addition to the blumenols, mycorradicin, another biosynthetically related type of apocarotenoids, was reported to accumulate in AMF-colonized roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klingner et al., 1995</xref>) and it would be interesting to investigate if mycorradicin accumulates throughout the plant, as well.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Root-to-shoot transport of AMF-indicative blumenols</title><p>Despite the AMF-induced accumulation of blumenols in the shoot, putative candidate genes of the apocarotenoid biosynthesis pathway were only induced in the roots of AMF-inoculated plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To exclude other mechanisms (e.g., post-transcriptional regulation) mediating the local production of the blumenol compounds in the leaves, we genetically manipulated the carotenoid pathway in a tissue-specific manner. It is challenging to manipulate blumenols without affecting the AMF-colonization of the plant, since other carotenoid-derived compounds, such as strigolactones, are known to play an important role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lanfranco et al., 2018</xref>). To circumvent these problems, we used the LhGR/pOp6 system for chemically inducible RNAi-mediated gene silencing of PDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schäfer et al., 2013</xref>) to impair carotenoid biosynthesis only in a particular leaf of AMF-inoculated plants. Interestingly, only the constitutively produced Compound 6 was reduced in the treated leaves, while the AMF-indicative Compounds 1 and 2 were not affected by our treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This indicated that instead of being locally produced, Compound 1 and 2 are translocated from the roots, an inference consistent with the occurrence of AMF-indicative blumenols in stem sap and the capacity of seedlings to transport blumenols from the root to the shoot from hydroponic solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B,D</xref>). It seems likely that the AMF-indicative blumenols are transported in the xylem with the transpiration stream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The blumenol glucosides (Compounds 1, 2 and 6) are hydrophilic low-molecular weight (402, 388 and 386 Da) compounds that are unlikely to pass membranes without further support, e.g., by transporters. It was recently demonstrated that ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (G-type) are involved in the root-to-shoot transport of ABA, a phytohormone with a molecular structure related to blumenols, and these transporters resemble the function of other ABCG-type proteins reported to mediate the long-distance transport of cytokinins and strigolactones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borghi et al., 2015</xref>). Whether blumenols are transported by similar mechanisms remains an interesting question.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional implication of blumenol accumulation and transport</title><p>Blumenols were shown to accumulate in large amounts in the roots of various plants after AMF-inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Strack and Fester, 2006</xref>) and our data indicate that they are subsequently distributed throughout the plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). While the conservation of this response in various plants after inoculation with different AMF species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) indicates an important functional role in the AMF-plant interaction, this function remains to be explored. Unfortunately, the current knowledge of the biological activity of blumenols only vaguely indicates potential systemic functions of AMF-induced blumenols in shoot tissues. Activity studies on vomifoliol, the aglycone of the not AMF-indicative Compound 6, showed that this compound induces stomatal closure similar to the structurally related abscisic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stuart and Coke, 1975</xref>). Additionally, blumenols are known to suppress seed germination and plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kato-Noguchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kato-Noguchi et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, AMF-induced blumenols could serve as systemic signals that mediate the large-scale adjustments in general physiology that are thought to accompany AMF-interactions. For example, AMF-induced blumenols could be involved in the regulation of differential susceptibility of AMF-inoculated plants to stresses, such as drought or pathogen infection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>AMF-indicative blumenols as tool for research and plant breeding</title><p>Even if classical tools for the quantification of AMF-plant interactions can offer superior sensitivity they are labor intensive and highly destructive which limits their application in studies that require high sample throughput, as well as in experiments that require repeated analysis of plants. We propose that the analysis of AMF-indicative blumenols in the shoot provides a convenient, easy-to-use, and minimally destructive tool to interrogate plant-AMF interactions in a HTP manner that allows for forward genetic studies even under field conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) and empowers plant breeding programs to produce mycorrhiza-responsive and P-efficient high-yielding lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van de Wiel et al., 2016</xref>).

By enabling breeding programs to select crop varieties which have negotiated AMF symbioses that deliver high yields with minimal P inputs, this discovery could help steer the ‘green revolution’ away from intense agricultural inputs and the collateral environmental damage they cause. While some of the ‘green revolution’ crop varieties with gibberellin response defects are potentially more efficient in Pi uptake as a result of their higher root colonization rates by AMF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Floss et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Foo et al., 2013</xref>) this serendipitous breeding event underscores the value of explicitly designing crop breeding programs to produce crops that negotiate more favorable AMF associations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>N. attenuata</italic>)</td><td>A-09-1212-1</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Groten et al.

Blumenol C glucoside and byzantionoside B differ only in the configuration of position C-9; blumenol C glucoside is (9<italic>S</italic>)-configured whereas byzantionoside B has a (9<italic>R</italic>)-configuration.

chromatographic separations, a UHPLC (Dionex UltiMate 3000) was used to provide a maximum of separation with short run times. This reduced the interference from other extract components (matrix effects), increased the specificity of the method, and met the requirements of a HTP analysis. The auto-sampler was cooled to 10°C. As a stationary phase, we used a reversed phase column (Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse XDB C18, 50 × 3.0 mm, 1.8 µm) suitable for the separation of moderately polar compounds. Column temperature was set to 42°C. As mobile phases, we used: A, 0.05% HCOOH, 0.1% ACN in H<sub>2</sub>O and B, MeOH, the composition of which was optimized for an efficient separation of blumenol-type compounds within a short run time. We included in the method a cleaning segment at 100% B and an equilibration segment allowing for reproducible results across large samples sets. The gradient program was as follows: 0–1 min, 10% B; 1–1.2 min, 10–35% B; 1.2–5 min, 35–50% B; 5–5.5 min, 50–100% B; 5.5–6.5 min, 100% B; 6.5–6.6 min, 100–10% B and 6.6–7.6 min, 10% B. The flow rate was set to 500 µL min<sup>−1</sup>. Analysis was performed on a Bruker Elite EvoQ triple quadrupole MS equipped with a HESI (heated electrospray ionization) ion source. Source parameters were as follows: spray voltage (+), 4500V; spray voltage (-), 4500V; cone temperature, 350°C; cone gas flow, 35; heated probe temperature, 300°C; probe gas flow, 55 and nebulizer gas flow, 60.

For WGA-Alexa Fluor 488 staining, roots were first washed with distilled water and then soaked in 50% (v/v) ethanol overnight. Roots were then boiled in a 10% (w/v) KOH solution for 10 min. After rinsing with water, the roots were boiled in 0.1 M HCl solution for 5 min. After rinsing with water and subsequently with 1x phosphate-buffered saline solution, roots were stained in 1x phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 0.2 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> WGA-Alexa Fluor 488 overnight in the dark.

Trypan blue staining was performed as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brundrett et al. (1984)</xref> to visualize mycorrhizal structures. For the counting of mycorrhizal colonization, 15 root fragments, each about 1 cm long, were stained with either trypan blue or WGA-488 followed by slide mounting. More than 150 view fields per slide were surveyed with 20x object magnification and classified into five groups: no colonization, only hyphae (H), hyphae with arbuscules (H + A), hyphae with vesicles (V + H), and hyphae with arbuscules and vesicles (A + V + H).

Sample extraction was conducted as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Inducible PDS silencing</title><p>For the temporal and spatial restriction of PDS gene silencing, we treated the petiole of the second oldest stem leaf of AMF-inoculated and non AMF-inoculated i-ir<italic>PDS</italic> and EV plants with a 100 µM dexamethasone-containing lanolin paste (1% v/v DMSO). The lanolin paste was prepared and applied as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schäfer et al. (2013)</xref>. The treatment started three weeks after potting and was conducted for three weeks. The lanolin paste was refreshed twice per week. On each plant the treated leaf and the adjacent, untreated leaves were harvested for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>QTL analysis</title><p>The field experiments for QTL analysis were conducted in 2017. Collected leaf samples were extracted as described with 80% MeOH spiked with D<sub>6</sub>-ABA as internal standard and analyzed with the method described under ‘<italic>Method for targeted blumenol analysis in N. attenuata’</italic>. The peak areas for Compound 2 were normalized by the amount of extracted tissue and internal standard and log-transformed. Samples with missing genotype or phenotype information were removed. In total, 728 samples were used for QTL mapping analysis. For quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, we used the AZ-UT RIL population and data analysis described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al. (2017)</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis of the data was performed with R version 3.0.3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org/">http://www.R-project.org/</ext-link>).

editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Blumenols as effective shoot markers for root symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Martin Parniske (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers and the editor agreed that this is potentially important work, showing that a relatively simple marker can be exploited to detect AMF colonization in the field. However, there was also agreement that you need to be clearer what the limitations of the work are (such as the apparent lag between colonization and blumenol accumulation) and that you need to give more credit to what has been possible before. In addition, we require the following essential revisions:</p><p>• Measure colonization and blumenol levels and directly compare both over a time course.</p><p>• Assess the correlation between colonisation and blumenol levels within at least a small number of RILs, to determine whether blumenol can mirror arbuscule abundance in the root at a very high level of resolution.</p><p>• Document that you can unequivocally identify blumenol C glucoside and not byzantionoside B. The two compounds are stereochemically different but carry the same molecular weight.</p><p>&quot;Good-to-have&quot; revisions:</p><p>We encourage you to look at a second CCaMK silenced line, if at all possible, and to ask how AMF colonization levels, as read out by blumenol, are reflected in plant performance in the field.</p><p>The full reviews are attached for your information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The observation that secondary plant compounds that accumulate in the leaves of all investigated plant species in response to AM colonisation is very exciting because of its novelty and its potential as a marker for the above-ground analysis of below-ground AM colonization without uprooting.</p><p>The authors observed that blumenols (and derivatives) specifically accumulate in the leaves of AM colonized plants. This phenomenon was consistently observed in all tested vascular plants species ranging from monocots such as rice to dicots such as tomato and legumes. They also show that this accumulation is specific to AM and is not induced by other tested biotic or abiotic stimuli. This in itself is already a very interesting observation. They obtained data from a cleverly designed &quot;localized RNAi&quot; assay the results of which, in combination with other analyses strongly suggest that specific AM-induced blumenols are transported from the AM colonized roots to the leaves.</p><p>The authors suggest to use blumenol levels in the leaves to screen for novel mutants/genotypes defective in AM. They present a convincing example in which they use blumenol levels in the leaves of Nicotiana RILs to map a genetic locus correlated with quantitative AM colonization differences.</p><p>Overall the work appears solid and the experiments are convincingly designed. The main claims of the authors are well supported by the data provided.</p><p>Major request: Unfortunately, the specific blumenols accumulate in the leaves only relatively late during the colonization (no signal at 4 weeks after inoculation; weak at 5 weeks; solid and screen-compatible levels only from 6 weeks onwards). This is not unexpected because blumenols were previously observed to increase over time in roots during AM development. However, depending on the cultivation and inoculation system, the colonization of the root typically happens weeks earlier. This delayed detection of the colonization somewhat limits the resolution possible with that setup. For example, slow colonizers that suffer from a slightly delayed colonization that may be detectable by microscopical analysis, may have caught up at such a late time point. To assist the evaluation of this assay by potential users, the authors should also present the data that indicate its limitations and determine the relationship between AM age, colonization level and blumenol levels. Colonization and blumenol levels should be measured and directly compared over a time course. As it stands, colonization alone was tested over a time course, but correlation between blumenol and colonization are only presented for one late timepoint.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Summary:</p><p>1) The authors summarize work which provides evidence for the existence of markers accumulating in leaves of mycorrhizal host plants indicative for root colonization by AMF. This compounds include blumenols which have previously been suggested to compose the yellow pigment which accumulates in mycorrhizal roots. Blumenols are likely to be transported from roots to leaves in good correlation with mycorrhizal colonization and marker gene expression at the root level. Moreover, a high-throughput screening of blumenol levels in a RIL population provides a proof-of-principle that blumenols can be used as markers to identify gene loci involved in the AM symbiosis.</p><p>Significance and novelty:</p><p>The identification of leaf marker metabolites for root colonization by AMF in a broad range of AM symbiotic associations is timely and their use in HTP screening for root colonization is a promising tool to identify high yielding varieties exhibiting high root mycorrhizal colonization under adverse field conditions.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>2) The authors report in the Abstract that foliar markers are not restricted to particular mycorrhizal species. It should be specified whether the foliar markers are metabolites other than blumenols or whether blumenols are addressed explicitly. Moreover, should &quot;mycorrhizal species&quot; comprise mycorrhizal host species, i.e. plants colonized by any mycorrhizal fungus, or specifically by AMF? The authors should use these terms more precisely according to their scientific definitions, because, alternatively, mycorrhizal species could also include AMF or other mycorrhizal fungi, since a mycorrhizal species, i.e. a species which is part of a mycorrhiza (root colonized by mycorrhizal fungus), could by definition be a plant or a fungus.</p><p><italic>eLife</italic> Digest:</p><p>3) In their <italic>eLife</italic> Digest draft, the authors state that AMF symbioses are usually studied destructively and the analysis of mycorrhizal roots is time consuming. This is in essence true but it misses work from other groups which have shown that specific compounds accumulate in leaves of mycorrhizal plants, such as miRNA or secondary metabolites (such as e.g. terpenoids), or that leaf elemental profiles alter in response to root colonization. It would be interesting to know whether the authors have addressed these known physiological changes in their plants (leaves) and whether they have identified said compounds in their MS survey as well. This would show whether published results can be reproduced in <italic>N. attenuata</italic>.</p><p>4) According to Matsunami et al.

It is unclear which parameters were used for their calculations. For example, do they base their claim on the work capacity of one person?</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>7) In the Introduction it is stated that no general AMF-specific metabolites have been found previously. This statement somehow stays in contradiction with what has been shown in Adolfsson et al. (2017) and in Gerlach et al. (2015; cited in Adolfsson et al. 2017). Adolfsson et al. (2017) even show that genes involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis are upregulated by AM colonization of roots. It is unclear to me why the authors believe that blumenol C glycoside is the first AM-specific compound found in leaves. Clarification is needed.</p><p>8) It is unclear in which work it has been shown that only blumenol C-based aglycone are positively correlated with mycorrhizal colonization (see Introduction, third paragraph). Moreover, I´m wondering whether it would be informative for a broad readership that blumenol is not the only apocarotenoid which accumulates in mycorrhizal roots (like e.g. mycorradicin possibly accumulating in the &quot;yellow pigment&quot; which is characteristic for AM roots). Despite my critical remarks I fully agree that a reliable leaf marker for efficient AM colonization would accelerate and facilitate breeding for beneficial AM symbiosis.</p><p>Results:</p><p>9) In Groten et al. (2015) three independent lines silenced in CCaMK were described. In the current work one of these lines was studied in detail. Why did the authors only study one line and did they confirm that the silencing effect was maintained in this line throughout their study? This is not apparent in the entire set of their results. The use of two independently transformed lines would probably have resulted in more robust results (e.g. with respect to Compound 1).</p><p>10) In Figure 2 untargeted metabolomics resulted in a number of AMF-specific hits. Wouldn´t it be interesting to know whether published work on compounds which accumulate in leaves upon mycorrhization also accumulate in <italic>N. attenuata</italic>? Moreover, blumenols and mycorradicin likely compose the yellow pigment in mycorrhizal roots. Could the authors detect mycorradicin or derivatives in the leaves of mycorrhizal plants? As I´m not a specialist in metabolomics, I don´t know, though, whether the used MS technology is sensitive enough to accurately identify these compounds.</p><p>11) As described in the Materials and methods, the field test described from line 20 onwards was performed with control and silenced plants alone or in combination in pots. It is likely that the AM symbiosis could establish at least to some degree when control and silenced lines were grown in combination. Did the authors investigate the degree of colonization by AMF in the roots of these plants and could reduced colonization in silenced plants explain why compound 2 provided a better quality marker than compound 1? Unfortunately data on growth phenotypes of field-grown as well as &quot;lab-grown&quot; plants is not provided to evaluate the impact of root interactions with AMF and other microorganisms on growth performance.</p><p>12) The authors denote the identified blumenol C-derivatives &quot;AMF-indicative metabolites&quot; and they show that the effect is not AMF taxa-specific. How can they be sure that other fungi colonizing plant roots and spanning the spectrum from parasitic over commensalistic to mutualistic interactions don´t affect blumenol biosynthesis in roots and its transport to the shoot?</p><p>13) The finding that blumenol derivatives can be used as a screening tool for forward genetics approaches is highly interesting and deserves great attention. In a HTP approach based on levels of compounds 1 and 2, the authors identify a locus which harbors the NOPE1 orthologue. They, however, do not provide evidence for differential expression of this gene in accessions UT and AZ which differ in their response to AMF. Since Figure 7 presents key data supposed to provide the proof of principle for the successful use of HTP screening towards breeding of crops improved in AM colonisation, this link between blumenol derivative levels, AMF colonization and expression of marker genes (Figure 7—figure supplement 1) should in my view include the NaNOPE1 gene. Moreover, physiological data revealing whether indicative blumenol level, marker gene expression and AMF colonization correlate with plant performance in the field would be highly interesting for agricultural applications and should be provided in this work if available.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>14) The authors should evaluate whether the literature on mycorrhizal secondary metabolites detected in leaves doesn´t provide alternative candidates for HTP screening and whether these papers deserve being cited in the submitted work.</p><p>15) The addition of references linking to the transport of root-derived compounds to the shoot in mycorrhizal plants seems to be appropriate also in the Discussion (see also 7, 8, 14).</p><p>16) Yellow pigment accumulates predominantly in old and senescent arbscules. Blumenol levels in leaves correlate with colonization, but colonization per se is not a good marker for growth performance of mycorrhizal plants due to functional diversity in AMF-host plant interactions (see e.g. Smith et al., 2003 and 2004). Since the authors propose to use their tool to produce mycorrhiza-responsive and P-efficient high-yielding lines, it would be highly interesting, if not even required, to show more correlative data suggesting that blumenol levels in leaves correlate with plant growth performance at low phosphate conditions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37093.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers and the editor agreed that this is potentially important work, showing that a relatively simple marker can be exploited to detect AMF colonization in the field.

We carefully analyzed our NMR data and compared the results with previously published reference data<sup>[1]</sup>. Blumenol C glucoside and byzantionoside B differ only in the configuration of position C-9; blumenol C glucoside is (9<italic>S</italic>)-configured whereas byzantionoside B has the (9<italic>R</italic>)-configuration. Characteristic <sup>13</sup>C-chemical shift differences can thus be found for the positions C-9, C-10 and C-1’.

This irCCaMK line has already been well-characterized by Groten et al. (2015), including growth and fitness parameters. Adding the effect of AMF colonization on plant performance is clearly out of the scope of the current manuscript as it would require another 1-2 years of work (see comments below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The full reviews are attached for your information.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Major request: Unfortunately, the specific blumenols accumulate in the leaves only relatively late during the colonization (no signal at 4 weeks after inoculation; weak at 5 weeks; solid and screen-compatible levels only from 6 weeks onwards). This is not unexpected because blumenols were previously observed to increase over time in roots during AM development. However, depending on the cultivation and inoculation system, the colonization of the root typically happens weeks earlier. This delayed detection of the colonization somewhat limits the resolution possible with that setup. For example, slow colonizers that suffer from a slightly delayed colonization that may be detectable by microscopical analysis, may have caught up at such a late time point. To assist the evaluation of this assay by potential users, the authors should also present the data that indicate its limitations and determine the relationship between AM age, colonization level and blumenol levels. Colonization and blumenol levels should be measured and directly compared over a time course.

The changes are clearly observable already at the earlier time-points (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B-C, insertions), but the strong increases in accumulation of blumenols in the later stages in root and leaves visually mask the effect in the earlier stages, when the same y-axis is used to present the data. For example, in root tissues, good signals of Compound 1 were observed at 2 wpi, and already at 3 wpi compound 1 and 2 in leaves, signals which also mirrored root colonization (Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 2). We added this information to the text (subsection “Hydroxy- and carboxyblumenol C-glucoside levels in leaves positively correlate with root colonizations”, second paragraph; subsection “Systemic AMF-mediated metabolite changes”, last paragraph) and address the differences between the available methods in the Discussion (see the aforementioned paragraph; subsection “AMF-indicative blumenols as tool for research and plant breeding”).

Quantifying the effect of the AMF interaction on the plant performance is clearly out of the scope of this manuscript as it will require many additional years of field work to robustly understand. In general, despite years of optimization, the growth conditions required for AMF association in the glasshouse produce plants which are smaller and slower growing than those grown under field conditions. So a scientifically robust answer to this question is not a trivial endeavor.
