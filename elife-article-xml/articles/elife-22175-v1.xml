pathological conditions, which makes it a promising pharmacological target. Although the activity of the enzyme is highly regulated, its molecular mechanism of activation remains largely unexplained, even after decades of research. By using state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations, we decipher the key elements of the complex molecular mechanism refined by evolution to allow for a fine tuning of p38α kinase activity. Our study describes for the first time the molecular effects of different regulators of the enzymatic activity, and provides an integrative picture of the activation mechanism that explains the seemingly contradictory X-ray and NMR data.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22175.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22175.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>metadynamics</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>kinases</kwd><kwd>p38 kinase</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7/Marie Curie Actions/COFUND, no. 600404</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuzmanic</surname><given-names>Antonija</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/M013898/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saladino</surname><given-names>Giorgio</given-names></name><name><surname>Gervasio</surname><given-names>Francesco L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project ID 294665</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nebreda</surname><given-names>Angel R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BioExcel (ID: 676559)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orozco</surname><given-names>Modesto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ELIXIR-Excellerate (ID: 675728)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orozco</surname><given-names>Modesto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIO2015/64802-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orozco</surname><given-names>Modesto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Extensive molecular dynamics simulations enhanced by advanced sampling techniques give a detailed view of p38α canonical activation mechanism, which reveals novel key electrostatic interactions that are put in context of existing experimental data.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>p38 Ser/Thr kinases are mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) involved in the regulation of multiple cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, senescence, and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuadrado and Nebreda, 2010</xref>). The p38 subgroup of MAPKs comprises four members (α-δ) where only p38α is expressed ubiquitously at high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuadrado and Nebreda, 2010</xref>). p38 signaling is strongly activated by environmental stresses (e.g. osmotic shock, ionizing radiation), and biological stimuli, such as growth factors and inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trempolec et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, p38α has been implicated in several pathological conditions, for example, chronic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and heart and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yong et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denise Martin et al., 2012</xref>), which is why elucidation of its activation mechanism is of therapeutical importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hammaker and Firestein, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Like most kinases, p38α is composed of two lobes: the smaller N-terminal lobe, consisting mostly of β-sheets, and the α-helical C-terminal lobe. The lobes are linked by a flexible hinge that forms the ATP-binding site together with structural elements from both lobes (marked regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the canonical activation pathway, MAPK kinases (MAP2Ks) dually phosphorylate the TGY sequence in the activation loop (A-loop; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) which, according to X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2011a</xref>), triggers its large conformational rearrangements and the formation of a characteristic β-sheet motif away from the ATP- and substrate-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The new position of the A-loop brings N- and C-lobes closer and facilitates the reorientation of key residues which participate in the stabilization of ATP and the catalytically crucial Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taylor and Kornev, 2011</xref>) (i.e. the universally conserved K53, E71, and D168). Moreover, p38α and other MAPKs possess two distinct structural elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): (1) the MAPK insert (MKI), which forms a lipid-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diskin et al., 2008</xref>) and (2) the L16 loop that extends from the C-lobe to the N-lobe where it folds into the C-terminal L16 helix. At its C-lobe segment, the L16 loop contains an acidic patch, called the common docking (CD) motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tanoue et al., 2000</xref>), which together with the hydrophobic groove, formed by the linker between α<sub>D</sub> and α<sub>E</sub> helices, and the β<sub>7</sub>-β<sub>8</sub> reverse turn (also termed the ED site) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), defines the peptide docking site recognized by the conserved docking motif present in activators, substrates, and regulators of MAPKs. The docking site enhances the specificity of MAPKs’ interactions, as well as its activity, albeit through an unknown molecular mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tanoue et al., 2000</xref>).

To understand the changes that take place upon p38α phosphorylation and to explain the observed discrepancies between the NMR and X-ray results, we employed state-of-the-art simulation techniques. Specifically, we used unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and parallel tempering metadynamics (PT-metaD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bussi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonomi and Parrinello, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sutto et al., 2012</xref>), a method that combines an enhanced sampling technique with a multi-replica approach and is thus able to converge very complex conformational free-energy surfaces as a function of a few relevant variables, as has been shown previously for several protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berteotti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lovera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sutto and Gervasio, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lovera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marino et al., 2015</xref>) and other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonomi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Papaleo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lambrughi et al., 2016</xref>). In total, we obtained a high level of sampling (&gt;115 μs) which allowed us to explore the molecular mechanism of p38α canonical activation in unprecedented detail and reconcile the apparently contradictory X-ray and NMR data.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We performed PT-metaD in the well-tempered ensemble to obtain free-energy surfaces (FESs) for human p38α in four different states: (1) the unphosphorylated, (2) the apo dually phosphorylated, (3) the dually phosphorylated state with bound ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and (4) the dually phosphorylated state with bound ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> and MK2 docking peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), obtaining total sampling times of 24.25, 24.85, 10.35, and 9.86 μs, respectively. To analyze the systems, we projected the FESs along two collective variables (CVs) - CV<sub>1</sub> and CV<sub>2</sub>, both of which are based on the A-loop contacts that measure the distance from the crystallographically observed inactive (CV<sub>1</sub>) and active (CV<sub>2</sub>) conformations (see Materials and methods), and which were successfully used previously to study protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sutto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sutto and Gervasio, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marino et al., 2015</xref>). When CV<sub>1</sub> &lt; 0.2 and CV<sub>2</sub> &gt; 0.8, then the system assumes an inactive conformation (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). On the other hand, when CV<sub>1</sub> &gt; 0.6 and CV<sub>2</sub> &lt; 0.2, the A-loop has formed the characteristic β-sheet motif (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) and the enzyme has adopted the canonical active state.

The P-loop is quite flexible and the K53-E71 salt bridge, which stabilizes ATP, is displaced from the C-lobe due to the broken regulatory spine that is otherwise formed with D168 upon ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taylor and Kornev, 2011</xref>).

We performed ten 500-ns-long independent runs at 380 K, all of which quickly showed a change in the A-loop conformation toward the inactive state and sampled conformations that fall in the regions explored in metadynamics simulations. Furthermore, in one of the independent runs the A-loop managed to break the β-sheet motif in the simulated time, so we extended this run to 2.675 μs to allow the protein to transition to the inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Indeed, the protein mostly remained in the global minima observed in metadynamics simulations, and the final conformation showed very similar features to the representative inactive structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) reveal a high flexibility of several structural elements besides the A-loop (i.e. α<sub>C</sub>, α<sub>D</sub>, and the MKI helices, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) that occurs due to the opening of the lobes and the local unfolding (in the case of α<sub>D</sub> helix).

In the global minimum, the A-loop moves away from the ATP-binding site, mostly due to the electrostatic interactions formed by the phosphorylated residues which subsequently also stabilize the P-loop and prevent it from collapsing into the ATP binding pocket (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). However, the sampled conformation is unlikely to bind ATP due to the formation of a salt bridge between R49 (positioned beneath the P-loop) and D112 (found at the beginning of the α<sub>D</sub> helix) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>; distance histogram is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). This interaction, which seems to be specific for the phosphorylated protein, locks the hinge and occludes the ATP-binding site. However, the protein also explores a higher energy minimum that comes closer to the active one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3b</xref>): the A-loop extends toward the L16 loop, yet does not form the β-sheet motif associated with the active conformation. Regardless, the higher energy conformation allows the A-loop to form a number of electrostatic interactions with the α<sub>C</sub> helix and the L16 loop (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), while pT180 forms a salt bridge with the highly conserved R67 preventing the P-loop from collapsing into the ATP-binding site. Furthermore, the α<sub>D</sub> helix partly unfolds allowing the ATP-binding pocket to assume a more open conformation with the key residues aligned for ATP binding. This observation explains the protein’s low affinity toward ATP in the phosphorylated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tokunaga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frantz et al., 1998</xref>) and demonstrates that the dual phosphorylation can help define a receptive ATP-binding site but is not sufficient for the protein to adopt the conformation captured by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In fact, to populate that state, we would need to add 16–18 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> of free energy to the phosphorylated system (minimum located at (CV<sub>1</sub>, CV<sub>2</sub>) = (0.6, 0.2) in the upper right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3d</xref>).</p><p>To further confirm the instability of the conformation observed by X-ray crystallography, we again used unbiased MD simulations that were started from the said conformation (PDB ID: 3PY3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) (see Materials and methods).

We generated ten 1-μs-long independent runs at 380 K, obtaining a total accumulated sampling time of 10 μs (see Materials and methods). The protein remains mostly in the regions associated with the extended conformation of the A-loop with formed β-sheet motif, but it also explores the conformational space closer to the other global minimum (also the global minimum in the system without the MK2 peptide) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Interestingly, the N-terminal part of the MK2 docking peptide binds the ED site and stabilizes the α<sub>D</sub>-α<sub>E</sub> linker hindering the flexibility of the α<sub>D</sub> helix and allowing the D112 to reorient and stabilize ATP by forming hydrogen bonds with ribose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).

As shown by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, the A-loop is very stable in the conformation captured by the X-ray model - the β-sheet motif is unperturbed during the simulation, as well as the contacts made by pT180 with the three conserved arginines (R67, R70, and R173). However, pY182 is more mobile and at times breaks away from H228 and the conserved arginines of the P+1 loop (R186 and R189). This is consistent with the electron density which is not so well defined for pY182 as it is for the rest of the A-loop. Furthermore, we could also qualitatively match the B-factors reported for the X-ray structure (PDB ID: 3PY3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b,d</xref>), while the most mobile regions in our simulations (mainly, the N- and C-terminal tails) are missing from the deposited electron density. We would like to stress that it is impossible for our MD simulations to quantitatively match the reported B-factors for the following reasons: (1) While the crystals were grown at 293 K, the data were collected at 100 K. Since MD simulations and their algorithms have not been developed for such low temperatures, we performed our crystal simulations at 293 K which increased the overall atomic motions; (2) The experimental data collected for the crystals in general are time and ensemble averages of 10<sup>23</sup> molecules which are in the end represented by a single model, while its B-factors then reflect both the static and the dynamic disorder of the crystal. Finally, two independent studies had shown that the refinement process underestimates the disorder present in the crystal thereby producing lower B-factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Janowski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuzmanic et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22175.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>(<bold>a</bold>) Free-energy surface for the dually phosphorylated p38α, obtained from metadynamics simulations, as a function of CV<sub>1</sub> and CV<sub>2</sub> which indicate the distance from the reference inactive and active structures, respectively.</title><p>The contour lines are drawn every two kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>.

Kinases, however, seem to have a few surprises left within their folds, even when it comes to the seemingly uniform active state. In the case of p38α, the protein requires dual phosphorylation of the TGY motif for its activation and subsequent ATP binding. Based on the apo X-ray structure of p38α-pTpY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2011b</xref>), the phosphorylation event has been perceived as the trigger for the conformational change in which the A-loop moves away from the ATP-binding site enabling the N- and C-lobes to reorient and align the residues necessary for the ATP stabilization. Unlike CDK5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berteotti et al., 2009</xref>), EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sutto and Gervasio, 2013</xref>), and Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shukla et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foda et al., 2015</xref>), p38α never explores the α<sub>C</sub>-out conformation (neither in any of the deposited X-ray structures - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref> nor in our simulations), in which the helix rotates by &gt;45° (breaking the K53-E71 salt bridge in the process). This likely occurs due to the extensive range of contacts formed between the α<sub>C</sub> and the L16 helix, which is unique to MAPKs, indicating that the observed feature could be family-specific. Furthermore, MAP kinases contain two conserved arginine residues (R67 and R70) in the α<sub>C</sub> helix that readily form salt bridges with numerous negatively charged residues in the A-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), thereby stabilizing various A-loop conformations which are not necessarily observed by X-ray crystallography. Despite an overwhelming amount of structural data (with 206 structures of human p38α in the PDB), just 47 structures have complete A-loops (i.e. without any missing or zero-occupancy residues), out of which only one structure contains the A-loop devoid of any crystal contacts (PDB ID: 2BAJ). Unfortunately, this structure has been solved in the DFG-out conformation with a bound inhibitor and it cannot be representative of the apo unphosphorylated state. However, the mere lack of information indicates just how flexible the A-loop is and why it is almost impossible to resolve it unless it forms crystal contacts. Our extensive simulations also indicate that the unphosphorylated p38α never explores a conformation that could possibly bind and stabilize ATP - mostly due to A-loop interactions with the DFG-Asp which is crucial for ATP stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 1995</xref>). It is worth noting that related proteins, like ERK2, are able to bind ATP in the unphosphorylated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sours et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canagarajah et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khokhlatchev et al., 1998</xref>) most likely due to longer A-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), which are then easier to stabilize away from the ATP-binding site.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22175.018</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Histograms of the minimal distances between (a) K53-E71, (<bold>b</bold>) R49-D112, and c) R49-E160 calculated from p38α X-ray structures currently deposited in PDB (March, 2017).</title><p>K53-E71 distances were calculated for structures without any mutations, while R49-D112 and R49-E160 for structures without missing R49, D112, and E160 residues.

The former of the two, as mentioned above, is MAPK-specific and its importance is highlighted further by the R67A mutation that decreases p38α kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gum et al., 1998</xref>), and the R67I somatic mutation that was found in colon adenocarcinoma (COSMIC: COSM1444062). The newly formed interactions keep the A-loop away from the ATP-binding site which is occluded by the formation of the R49-D112 salt bridge. ATP binding is therefore only possible in less populated conformations of the protein, explaining the experimentally observed low ATP-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tokunaga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frantz et al., 1998</xref>). If one looks solely at X-ray structures where R49 is ~15 Å away from D112 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>), the formation of this particular salt bridge might seem like an artifact arising from force field or methodological imperfections. However, R49 is a part of the loop positioned below the very flexible P-loop (whose residues are often unresolved) and we have often observed its interaction with E160 of the ED site in our simulations (both unbiased and biased), regardless of the protein’s phosphorylation state (R49-E160 is ~9 Å in the analyzed X-ray structures - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c</xref>). We believe that the reason for these discrepancies lies in the fact that the loop containing R49 forms crystal contacts in all the 206 deposited X-ray structures which would most likely restrict its mobility and prevent the interactions observed in MD simulations.</p><p>While the binding of ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> helps p38α come closer to the active form, it is insufficient to lead to a complete shift, as proposed by the NMR model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tokunaga et al., 2014</xref>). The full transition, however, does occur in our simulations upon binding of the MK2 docking peptide, which has been previously shown to enhance the catalytic steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tokunaga et al., 2014</xref>). We hypothesize that the docking peptide prevents the formation of the R49-D112 salt bridge in the phosphorylated protein and brings in the L16 loop. This allows the A-loop to form additional stabilizing contacts, as suggested in the case of ERK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>) and causes the observed 20-fold increase in the ATP-binding affinity by the MK2 docking peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tokunaga et al., 2014</xref>). The changes that the docking peptide introduces into the protein structure are particularly interesting when it comes to the crystal contact analysis of the dually phosphorylated p38α X-ray structure with the active A-loop conformation. We found an atypically long expression tag of the neighboring molecule bound in the docking site which, together with other crystal contacts, induces the active state stabilized within the crystal. These observations show how important it is to carefully analyze symmetry-related molecules and they call for caution in the interpretation of deposited X-ray structures, as they can be misleading.</p><p>Overall, our extensive PT-metaD calculations converge to free-energy surfaces that together with the unbiased MD simulations offer unparalleled insight into the molecular mechanism of p38α canonical activation elucidating a complex conformational behavior that is consistent with experimental observations. Despite the initial discrepancies between previous structural studies, our findings reconcile the deposited models from X-ray crystallography with the NMR data. Considering the importance of p38α for both normal physiology and pathological processes, we hope the knowledge obtained in this study will help to target the protein with more specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein structures and their preparation</title><p>The X-ray structure used as the starting conformation for the PT-metaD simulations of inactive unphosphorylated and phosphorylated human p38α is deposited under the Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 3S3I.

To relax and lose possible crystal contacts, 10 independent equilibration runs were generated for both the inactive and the active phosphorylated systems. Only those atomic pairs that appear in five or more equilibrated structures and that specifically discriminate between the inactive and active conformations were kept, that is, those that appear either in one or the other, thereby discarding the pairs common to both conformations. A set of 97 regular contacts was obtained this way to which seven salt-bridge contacts involving residues of the A-loop that were specific to the active conformation were added and weighed three times more than regular contacts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Convergence of metaD simulations</title><p>Initially, FE surfaces were produced with a bias corresponding to an exchange rate of 30% between neighboring replicas and were subsequently refined by lowering the bias on the potential energy to achieve an exchange rate of 10% and run for additional 150 ns to convergence. The simulations were considered to be converged once the free energy in the bidimensional projections and in the monodimensional projections does not change more than 2 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> in the last 100 ns. This criterion resulted in a 2.425-μs-long simulation for the unphosphorylated, 2.485-μs-long simulation for the phosphorylated system, 1.035-μs-long simulation for the phosphorylated system with bound ATP, and 0.986-μs-long simulation for the phosphorylated system with bound ATP and MK2 docking peptide.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analysis of structures populating the free-energy minima</title><p>Free-energy surfaces (FES) for the two CVs were calculated by integrating the bias deposited during the simulations. For each system, several basins from the FES plot were chosen for further analysis. All the structures that fell within each basin were clustered using the <italic>gromos</italic> algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daura et al., 1999</xref>) and the <italic>g_cluster</italic> routine (GROMACS) by using the RMSD of C<sub>α</sub> atoms as the distance between the structures and the cutoff value of 2 Å. The central structure of the most populated cluster of each basin (i.e. the structure with the smallest distance to all the other members of the cluster) was chosen as the representative of the basin. Furthermore, central structures of top five most populated clusters (which on average contain 75% of all structures) were inspected to make sure that the main structural features in terms of P-loop and A-loop positions were captured by these clusters. To avoid highlighting interactions that occur only sporadically in the simulations, only those salt-bridge interactions that are maintained in the majority of structures of the most populated cluster, as well as most of structures of the selected basin, were highlighted in the tables throughout the paper.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of X-ray structures and their symmetry-related neighbors</title><p>Symmetry-related molecules of mouse apo p38α-pTpY (PDB ID: 3PY3) that are closer than 4 Å to the original structure were generated by PyMOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schrodinger, 2015</xref>). The same distance criterion was used to determine which pairs of residues of neighboring molecules come into contact.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. R Soliva and Dr. Lucia Diaz Bueno for many helpful discussions.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports simulation studies aiming to elucidate the activation mechanism of p38α kinase. Using unbiased molecular dynamics simulations and calculation of free energy surfaces of the system, the authors attempt to reconcile the apparent contradictions between the X-ray structures of p38α (showing large structural changes associated with kinase dual-phosphorylation) and the NMR findings (the phosphorylation does not lead to significant chemical shift perturbation).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The free energy surface (FES) of ATP-bound phosphorylated system shows that the active state is accessible now, but unbiased MD simulations showed that only with substrate binding the system is stable at the active basin. To complete the paper's argument, FES of phosphorylated p38α with ATP and substrate bound should be calculated besides the unbiased simulations at 380 K. Also, showing unbiased MD on the phosphorylated and ATP-bound system without substrate and mapping the trajectory to the two CVs analogous to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> would be helpful to this argument.</p><p>2) p38α should be simulated with its crystal contacts in unbiased simulations to support the notion that crystal contacts maintain apo p38α in its otherwise unstable active conformation in crystal environment.</p><p>3) The paper is descriptive of selected conformations representative of conformational ensembles at various free energy basins; but, it is not clear how the discussed conformations are selected to represent the ensemble of each basin. The selections should be justified based on characterization of the ensemble of the entire free-energy basin; this justification is missing as is.</p><p>Other important points:</p><p>1) For phosphorylated p38α, a histogram/time-series should be shown for R49-D112 salt-bridge (ascribed to occlude ATP binding). The regions in the free energy surface allowing ATP binding should also be shown. Reviewers are concerned that the free energy surfaces of the apo unphosphorylated system are very similar to the apo phosphorylated, but the latter system binds ATP much stronger than the former. (In Tokunaga et al., 2014, the ATP affinity is 430 μM, while Frantz et al., 1998 only reported the Km[ATP] to be 25 μM. Unphosphorylated systems binds ATP much weaker at millimolar affinity.) How is the μM ATP binding reconciled with the R49-D112 salt-bridge? Another concern is that, by the energy surface of the apo phosphorylated system, the ATP-bound X-ray structure is as much as 16~18 kcal/mol higher in free energy than the inactive conformation, which seems unlikely.</p><p>2) The manuscript reports certain structural features differ considerably from any of the known crystallographic structures (e.g. 3S3I, 3PY3, 2OKR and 1CM8), which calls to question the structural details extracted from the PT-metaD trajectories (e.g. the activation-loop helix (purple in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, and the R49-D112 salt bridge, which requires D113 to move 18 Å from its positions in the X-ray structures). The reliability of these simulations generated conformations need be calibrated in Discussion.</p><p>3) Finally, how the simulation results explain the seemingly contradictory X-ray and NMR data needs to be further discussed in more explicit terms. The contradictory is understood to be the lack of chemical shift perturbation (CSP) between unphosphorylated and phosphorylated yet the x-ray structures are the closed and open alternative structures of the A-loop. The NMR study also shows a large CSP for ATP binding to phosphorylated p38α. The minima in the FE surfaces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> differ between the 3 states (unphosphorylated, phosphorylated and ATP bound phosphorylated) yet have overlapping regions. The overlap could explain the lack of CSP for unphosphorylated and phosphorylated (as stated in the subsection “Dually phosphorylated p38α”), but how the large CSP for bound ATP is rationalized by the FE surface, since, as stated in the manuscript, &quot;the representative structure of the global minimum [for ATP-bound] is still not too different from the dominant one in the apo phosphorylated state.&quot; This should be explained in more explicit terms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22175.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The free energy surface (FES) of ATP-bound phosphorylated system shows that the active state is accessible now, but unbiased MD simulations showed that only with substrate binding the system is stable at the active basin.

The additional simulations give further support to the claims we have made in the original submission.</p><p><italic>2) p38α should be simulated with its crystal contacts in unbiased simulations to support the notion that crystal contacts maintain apo p38α in its otherwise unstable active conformation in crystal environment.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers and the editor for the useful advice. The results of the new simulations strengthen the overall conclusions. We have simulated a crystal supercell of the dually phosphorylated mouse p38α (PDB ID: 3PY3) containing 4 unit cells (2x2x1), each with 4 asymmetric units (16 copies of the protein in total). By using a supercell system, we have been able to maintain crystal contacts, avoid the interaction of molecules with themselves through periodic boundary conditions, and achieve 8 µs of sampling (500 ns of the whole supercell x 16 copies of the protein). We have described the modelling process and the simulation setup in the Methods section (subsection “MD simulations”, last two paragraphs), added the results as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, and made appropriate changes in the text referring to new data (subsection “The active conformation”, fourth paragraph).</p><p>As shown by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, the A-loop is very stable in the conformation captured by the X-ray model – the β-sheet motif is unperturbed during the simulation, as well as the contacts made by pT180 with the three conserved arginines (R67, R70, and R173). However, pY182 is more mobile and at times breaks away from H228 and the conserved arginines (R186 and R189). This is consistent with the electron density which is not so well defined for pY182 as it is for the rest of the A-loop (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 1</xref>). Finally, we show an excellent qualitative agreement with the B-factors reported for the X-ray structure (3PY3), while (as expected) the most mobile regions in our simulations (mainly, the N- and C-terminal tails) are missing from the deposited electron density. While comparing the crystallographic and MD-derived B-factors it is also important to keep in mind that: 1) The data were collected at 100 K. Since MD force-fields and algorithms have not been developed for such low temperatures, we have performed our crystal simulations at 293 K which proportionally increases the overall atomic motions; 2) The experimental data collected for the crystals in general are time and ensemble averages of 10<sup>23</sup> molecules which are in the end represented by a single model, while its B-factors then reflect both the static and the dynamic disorder of the crystal. Indeed, two independent studies had shown that the refinement process underestimates the disorder present in the crystal thereby producing lower B-factors (Janowski et al., 2013, JACS, doi: 10.1021/ja401382y; Kuzmanic et al., 2014, Nat. Commun., doi: 10.1038/ncomms4220).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22175.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22175.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22175.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22175-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>3) The paper is descriptive of selected conformations representative of conformational ensembles at various free energy basins; but, it is not clear how the discussed conformations are selected to represent the ensemble of each basin. The selections should be justified based on characterization of the ensemble of the entire free-energy basin; this justification is missing as is.</italic> </p><p>We analyzed each selected free energy basin through a clustering method (as described in the Methods section) and we chose the central structures of the most populated clusters as the representative ones we had shown and discussed in the paper. Furthermore, we checked the central structures of top 5 most populated clusters (which on average contain 75% of all structures) to make sure that the main structural features in terms of P-loop and A-loop positions were captured by these clusters. To avoid highlighting interactions that occur only sporadically in the simulations, we also added the tables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) with salt-bridge interactions that are maintained in the majority of structures of the most populated cluster, as well as most of structures of the selected basin. In order to avoid confusion among the readers, we now state clearly in the main text how the structures were chosen (Results, first paragraph and subsection “Enhanced sampling”). We have also modified the aforementioned tables that now include a measure of how often the interaction occurs in the most populated cluster of each bin.</p><p><italic>Other important points:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) For phosphorylated p38α, a histogram/time-series should be shown for R49-D112 salt-bridge (ascribed to occlude ATP binding). The regions in the free energy surface allowing ATP binding should also be shown. Reviewers are concerned that the free energy surfaces of the apo unphosphorylated system are very similar to the apo phosphorylated, but the latter system binds ATP much stronger than the former. (In Tokunaga et al., 2014, the ATP affinity is 430 μM, while Frantz et al., 1998 only reported the Km[ATP] to be 25 μM. Unphosphorylated systems binds ATP much weaker at millimolar affinity.) How is the μM ATP binding reconciled with the R49-D112 salt-bridge? Another concern is that, by the energy surface of the apo phosphorylated system, the ATP-bound X-ray structure is as much as 16~18 kcal/mol higher in free energy than the inactive conformation, which seems unlikely.</italic> </p><p>Following reviewers’ suggestions, we have now included the histogram for the R49-D112 salt bridge as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, which shows that almost all the structures in the most populated cluster of the global minimum have this interaction formed (&gt;16000 structures). We have also highlighted the minimum in the free energy surface of the phosphorylated p38α which is represented by structures that we believe can bind ATP (and which are also explored by the unbiased simulations).</p><p>Furthermore, as reviewers have noted, the free energy surfaces of apo unphosphorylated and apo phosphorylated p38α are indeed similar, but they are not the same, nor are their minima populated by the same conformations. In general, free energy surface of a protein reflects its ability to populate certain states defined by collective variables. This means that at a given temperature all the conformations of the system that we have highlighted in the paper will be accessible; however, their population will be different.</p><p>Based on our analyses, apo unphosphorylated p38α does not seem to explore conformations that can bind ATP – either the highly flexible P-loop is collapsed into the ATP-binding site, or the R173 of the A-loop forms interactions that are typically viewed as autoinhibitory (e.g., forming a salt bridge with D168 of the DFG motif which stabilizes ATP upon binding). Upon the A-loop phosphorylation, two residues change their properties significantly which allows them to stabilize interactions which are inaccessible to the unphosphorylated system. However, the global minimum of the phosphorylated system is dominated by the conformation with the formed R49-D112 salt bridge which would prevent ATP binding. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the phosphorylated p38α cannot bind ATP, seeing how a higher-energy minimum is populated by conformations that can bind ATP (which are also explored by the unbiased simulations). Basically, once p38α is phosphorylated, it exists as a mixture of all the described conformations that are present at different concentrations, therefore determining the macroscopic property of ATP binding to the phosphorylated system. This agrees with the experimental observations mentioned by the reviewers, as well as the observation that the binding of the MK2 docking peptide has a profound effect on ATP binding, i.e. it causes a 20-fold increase in binding which most likely occurs due to the breaking of the salt bridge and the overall stabilization of the α<sub>D</sub> helix. However, our results do not exclude the possibility of induced fit mechanism in which the addition of ATP to the phosphorylated system would shift the populations towards structures that are more likely to bind ATP.</p><p>Finally, we have shown with our metadynamics simulations (and confirmed additionally with unbiased MD simulations) that the apo phosphorylated structure captured by X-ray crystallography is 16-18 kcal/mol higher in energy and therefore rather inaccessible to the phosphorylated system in the absence of ATP. However, the presence of bound ATP in the system causes a shift towards this conformation which is then at 2-4 kcal/mol compared to the global minimum, not at 16-18 kcal/mol. This observation agrees with the NMR data which show large chemical shift perturbations only upon ATP binding, not the dual phosphorylation.</p><p>We have amended our manuscript throughout to discuss the points above more clearly (e.g., subsections “Unphosphorylated p38α” and “Dually phosphorylated p38α with bound ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup>”, and Discussion).</p><p><italic>2) The manuscript reports certain structural features differ considerably from any of the known crystallographic structures (e.g. 3S3I, 3PY3, 2OKR and 1CM8), which calls to question the structural details extracted from the PT-metaD trajectories (e.g. the activation-loop helix (purple in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, and the R49-D112 salt bridge, which requires D113 to move 18</italic> Å <italic>from its positions in the X-ray structures). The reliability of these simulations generated conformations need be calibrated in Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that there is always a possibility that certain structural features arise from either force field or methodological imperfections, we have thus modified the Discussion which now mentions these possible pitfalls (Discussion, first and second paragraphs). However, we also find that crystal contacts introduce artifacts that can lead to misinterpretation of the structural features of p38α (as we have already described above for 3PY3). When it comes to the position of the A-loop in the unphosphorylated state, out of 206 currently deposited X-ray structures of human p38α (with 224 individual chains), only 47 molecules have complete A-loops (i.e., without any missing or zero occupancy residues). From this reduced set, a single deposited structure has the A-loop in a conformation in which the loop does not form any crystal contacts (PDB ID: 2BAJ). Unfortunately, this structure has been solved in the DFG-out conformation with a bound inhibitor and it cannot be representative of the apo unphosphorylated state. However, the mere lack of information indicates just how flexible the A-loop is and why it is almost impossible to resolve it unless it forms crystal contacts. Thus, it is not surprising that the A-loop conformations we observe do not match the ones present in X-ray structures. Furthermore, we have shown that extensive crystal contacts are in fact responsible for the conformation observed in 3PY3 (the only X-ray structure of the dually phosphorylated p38α), while we suspect that the same applies for 1CM8 (dually phosphorylated p38γ with bound ATP). While this structure does not have anything bound in the docking site, its A-loop forms crystal contacts with the N-terminal loops of a symmetry related molecule (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 2</xref>). Unfortunately, the electron density of this molecule is unavailable, so we are unable to inspect the quality of the modelled A-loop and its crystal contacts. We have also included this analysis in the manuscript (Discussion).<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22175.022</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Contact maps for interactions formed between the residues of the reported X-ray structure (PDB ID: 1CM8, p38γ-pTpY) (x-axis) and its symmetry related neighbors (y-axis).</title><p>The residues are considered to be in contact if the minimal distance between any of their atoms is under 4 Å.

R49 is a part of the loop positioned below the very flexible P-loop (whose residues are often unresolved) and is on average 9 Å away from the C-lobe residues in the deposited X-ray structures. However, in our simulations (both unbiased and biased), we have often observed R49 interacting with E160 of the ED site, regardless of the protein’s phosphorylation state. We believe that the reason for this discrepancy (as well as the formation of the R49-D112 salt bridge) lies in the fact that R49 loop forms crystal contacts in all 206 deposited X-ray structures which would most likely restrict its mobility and prevent the interactions observed in MD simulations. We have included these findings in the revised version of the manuscript (Discussion, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Finally, how the simulation results explain the seemingly contradictory X-ray and NMR data needs to be further discussed in more explicit terms. The contradictory is understood to be the lack of chemical shift perturbation (CSP) between unphosphorylated and phosphorylated yet the x-ray structures are the closed and open alternative structures of the A-loop. The NMR study also shows a large CSP for ATP binding to phosphorylated p38α. The minima in the FE surfaces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> differ between the 3 states (unphosphorylated, phosphorylated and ATP bound phosphorylated) yet have overlapping regions. The overlap could explain the lack of CSP for unphosphorylated and phosphorylated (as stated in the subsection “Dually phosphorylated p38α”), but how the large CSP for bound ATP is rationalized by the FE surface, since, as stated in the manuscript, &quot;the representative structure of the global minimum [for ATP-bound] is still not too different from the dominant one in the apo phosphorylated state.&quot; This should be explained in more explicit terms.</italic> </p><p>As also discussed above, the free energy surfaces do not only reflect which areas have been explored by p38α in MD simulations, but also how often. This means that even though the free energy surface of the phosphorylated system with bound ATP overlaps with the apo one, these systems predominantly explore different conformations. Upon ATP binding the A-loop can finally explore regions that are almost inaccessible in the absence of ATP and it also forms more stable contacts with the α<sub>C</sub> helix in the global minimum. These changes, along with the fact that ATP is in direct contact with the binding site residues, would explain the differences observed by NMR. We have modified the manuscript text to clarify these points (e.g., subsection “The active conformation”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
