Indeed, direct striatal manipulations such as self-stimulation of direct-pathway projection neurons (dMSNs) are sufficient to induce reinforcement within minutes. However, it’s unclear what role, if any, is played by downstream circuitry. Here, we used dMSN self-stimulation in mice as a model for striatum-driven reinforcement and mapped the underlying circuitry across multiple basal ganglia nuclei and output targets. We found that mimicking the effects of dMSN activation on downstream circuitry, through optogenetic suppression of basal ganglia output nucleus substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) or activation of SNr targets in the brainstem or thalamus, was also sufficient to drive rapid reinforcement. Remarkably, silencing motor thalamus—but not other selected targets of SNr—was the only manipulation that reduced dMSN-driven reinforcement. Together, these results point to an unexpected role for basal ganglia output to motor thalamus in striatum-driven reinforcement.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>reinforcement</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lalive</surname><given-names>Arnaud L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 NS094342</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kreitzer</surname><given-names>Anatol C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 DA010154</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kreitzer</surname><given-names>Anatol C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS064984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kreitzer</surname><given-names>Anatol C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>While the basal ganglia have long been thought to mediate learning through dopamine-dependent striatal plasticity, their regulation of motor thalamus plays an unexpected and critical role in reinforcement.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reinforcement refers to a process by which the frequency or intensity of a specific behavior increases over time. Standard models of reinforcement invoke dopamine-dependent corticostriatal plasticity as a mechanism underlying this form of associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schultz and Dickinson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reynolds et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Doya, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maia and Frank, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yagishita et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>). In these models, reinforcement occurs through plasticity of excitatory inputs to striatal action-related ensembles, which results in enhanced future recruitment of these motor programs in similar contexts. Yet other studies have found that activating targets of basal ganglia output can also be reinforcing (classic electrical studies reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wise, 1996</xref>); for recent optogenetic studies, see below) and reinforcement learning in songbirds and primates is proposed to involve basal ganglia regulation of cortical plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Turner and Desmurget, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fee and Goldberg, 2011</xref>). Thus, it remains unclear to what extent striatum-driven reinforcement requires engagement of basal ganglia output projections to downstream targets in brainstem or thalamus.</p><p>The striatum contains two distinct classes of projection neurons—direct (dMSNs) and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (iMSNs)—that regulate motivated behavior by increasing or suppressing movement, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>). Numerous lines of evidence support a role for the striatum in reinforcement. Early intracranial self-stimulation experiments showed that striatal stimulation is sufficient to drive operant responding in rodents, in the absence of food reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Phillips et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">White and Hiroi, 1998</xref>). In addition, striatal microstimulation biases choice in cue-guided decision tasks in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nakamura and Hikosaka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Williams and Eskandar, 2006</xref>). Although some of these effects are due to dopamine release from axon stimulation, pathway-specific optogenetic stimulation later revealed that direct pathway stimulation is reinforcing, whereas indirect pathway stimulation drives avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hikida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kravitz et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, mice readily learned an operant task to self-stimulate dMSNs and formed a memory of the stimulation-paired apparatus. This suggests that dMSN stimulation is not just acutely rewarding but can drive long-lasting changes in the brain supporting learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kravitz et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this, stimulation of direct and indirect pathways oppositely biases both choice and vigor in water-reinforced tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yttri and Dudman, 2016</xref>). Similarly, in vivo recordings from primates and rodents show that activity in discrete populations of MSNs encodes reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hikosaka et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apicella et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Oyama et al., 2010</xref>), actions and/or their values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lauwereyns et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pasupathy and Miller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Samejima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lau and Glimcher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kimchi and Laubach, 2009</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that MSNs both integrate and support motor and reinforcement functions.</p><p>The involvement of regions downstream of the basal ganglia in motor control and reinforcement has also been extensively studied. Different brainstem targets of basal ganglia are associated with regulation of distinct aspects motor behavior: the superior colliculus is implicated in orienting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hikosaka et al., 2000</xref>), the periaqueductal gray is involved in freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gross and Canteras, 2012</xref>), and the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) is engaged for locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Esposito and Arber, 2016</xref>), whereas Dorsal Raphe Nucleus (DRN) neurons are involved in mood regulation and state-dependent control of motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>). Basal-ganglia-recipient motor thalamus, which consists of ventromedial (VM), ventral anterior and lateral (VAL) nuclei, is involved in motor performance and skill learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hikosaka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Graybiel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Turner and Desmurget, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosch-Bouju et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goldberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kawai et al., 2015</xref>). Extensive intracranial self-stimulation studies have revealed that a multitude of sites across the brain, including different brainstem targets of basal ganglia, are sufficient to drive reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wise, 1996</xref>). Recent optogenetic studies also showed that activation of specific cell populations in the MLR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dautan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yoo et al., 2017</xref>) and DRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McDevitt et al., 2014</xref>) is reinforcing. Additionally, electrical stimulation of motor thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clavier and Gerfen, 1982</xref>) supports operant behavior, and lesions impair striatum-dependent learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zis et al., 1984</xref>). However, it is poorly understood whether these basal ganglia output targets are necessary for striatum-driven reinforcement. Indeed, after almost 70 years of research on the anatomical substrates of reinforcement, it is still debated whether nuclei supporting self-stimulation operate in series within a single circuit, or belong to multiple, parallel systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Routtenberg, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Phillips, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wise and Bozarth, 1984</xref>).</p><p>Here, we took advantage of optogenetic dMSN self-stimulation in mice to probe both striatal plasticity and basal ganglia circuit mechanisms in striatum-driven reinforcement. In theory, repeated pairing of operant behavior with dMSN depolarization could locally induce Hebbian synaptic plasticity onto stimulated dMSNs and/or engage downstream circuits to drive reinforcement. We found that dMSN self-stimulation was not accompanied by measurable changes in synaptic strength of excitatory afferents, nor was it impaired by disrupting NMDA receptors in stimulated neurons. Furthermore, reinforcement could be elicited by direct suppression of SNr. In order to identify the contribution of basal ganglia target regions to striatal reinforcement, we combined dMSN self-stimulation with silencing of selected basal ganglia output targets. Although brainstem and thalamic targets were sufficient to drive reinforcement, only motor thalamus was necessary for dMSN self-stimulation. Thus, our results highlight an underappreciated circuit mechanism for striatum-driven reinforcement through recruitment of motor thalamus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>dMSN self-stimulation supports reinforcement independently of NMDA receptors</title><p>We bilaterally injected Cre-dependent ChR2-eYFP virus and implanted optical fibers in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) of D1-Cre mice (D1-ChR2) for selective self-stimulation of dMSNs, which represented the primary reinforcer motivating task performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Mice learned to self-stimulate dMSNs by poking in an active (laser-paired) nosepoke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), whereas a second, inactive nosepoke had no effect. We characterized the self-stimulation behavior by varying different task parameters. Poke rate was sensitive to laser duration, stimulation pattern, effort, and contingency degradation, all of which are hallmarks of goal-directed behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). For subsequent experiments, we chose one second of constant laser stimulation per nosepoke to optimally balance poke rate and total laser stimulation. Within a single session, D1-ChR2 mice began to make more nosepokes on the active side and rapidly neglected the inactive nosepoke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>). In contrast, control mice (expressing only eYFP) produced fewer and equal numbers of nosepokes on both sides. Overall, no difference in total locomotion was observed during the session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2f</xref>). The total number of active nosepokes per session was stable over days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Similarly, poking patterns did not change over time, showing stable inter-poke interval distributions and averages between day 1 and 4. Poking behavior could be divided in epochs of poking bursts, defined here by at least two nosepokes performed in &lt;2 s, or an alternative criterion of &lt;6 s. In either case, the number of bursts and pokes/bursts did not change over days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Additionally, when mice were subjected to an extinction session 24 hr after the last training session, D1-ChR2 mice made significantly more nosepokes on the previously-active side, despite the absence of dMSN stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). In contrast, D1-eYFP mice showed no preference for either side. Together these results demonstrate that behavior was learned and stabilized within a single session, and that mice form a stable association (lasting at least 24 hr) between the nosepoke and the reinforcer (dMSN stimulation). Therefore, we focused our analysis on the first behavior session (see materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34032.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>dMSN self-stimulation elicits rapid and persistent NMDAR-independent reinforcement.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of a sagittal brain section showing optogenetic stimulation of striatal dMSNs (left), and slice showing fluorescent dMSNs after striatal infusion of a Cre-dependent virus encoding eYFP in a D1-Cre mouse (right).

We first expressed ChR2 in the SNr of vGAT-Cre mice. We prepared acute slices of VM from the same mice and performed whole-cell recordings in VM that confirmed the inhibitory nature of this projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

Within 20 ms of stimulation, most responsive VM neurons were excited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>); these excited neurons displayed a shorter latency to change firing rate than inhibited cells. Within a 100 ms of stimulation, more cells were excited, and a significant fraction of neurons with decreased activity appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>).

Our results highlight several important aspects of basal ganglia function. First, we demonstrate that activation of striatal direct pathway projection neurons can engage a form of reinforcement that is independent of NMDAR-dependent plasticity in dMSNs. Second, we find that multiple downstream targets of basal ganglia output can mediate reinforcement, not all of which are required for dMSN self-stimulation. Finally, we identify an unexpected role for motor thalamus in supporting dMSN-driven reinforcement.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>An alternative to classic mechanisms of reinforcement</title><p>Models of the basal ganglia typically propose that corticostriatal synaptic plasticity underlies reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schultz and Dickinson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Doya, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maia and Frank, 2011</xref>). We observed here that dMSN self-stimulation plateaued during the first day of training and that mice formed a memory of the dMSN stimulation-paired nosepoke, consistent with our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kravitz et al., 2012</xref>). These results suggest that behavior was learned and acquired within a single session, presumably by engaging long-term plasticity. We initially hypothesized that the repeated pairing of a specific action (entry into the active nosepoke) with depolarization of ChR2-expressing dMSNs would drive NMDAR-dependent Hebbian plasticity at active (task-related) synapses onto stimulated dMSNs. This mechanism would thereby provide a synaptic substrate for reinforcement learning, through the task-dependent recruitment of action-promoting dMSNs. However, we observed that dMSN self-stimulation was unaltered by NMDAR knockout in dMSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Additionally, despite our ability to identify and record from task-relevant ChR2-expressing dMSNs, we did not observe changes in pre or postsynaptic excitatory transmission, or in neuronal excitability, across both dMSNs and iMSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In fact, previous reports suggest that simple types of reinforcement can occur without NMDAR-dependent striatal plasticity. For example, mice with dorsal striatum lesions can still learn and perform an action to obtain food rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yin et al., 2005b</xref>). Similarly, altering MSN NMDAR composition by knocking out GluN2B, an important subunit for plasticity induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Paoletti et al., 2013</xref>), does not prevent mice from learning a basic operant task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brigman et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, genetic deletion of NMDA receptors in MSNs does not prevent mice from learning simple action-outcome associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>); although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beutler et al., 2011</xref>). Altogether, these results are consistent with the idea that simple forms of reinforcement may not require corticostriatal synaptic plasticity, but rather take advantage of a different mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Multiple basal ganglia output targets for reinforcement</title><p>Several basal ganglia output targets in the brainstem have been associated with reinforcement. Recently, a series of optogenetic studies reported a role for both DRN serotonergic and non-serotonergic populations in reinforcement. Consistent with these reports, we observed that mice self-stimulated serotonergic neurons of the DRN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We observed reinforcement in SERT-Cre mice, which failed to sustain operant behavior in a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>). In ePET-Cre mice, we did not observe reinforcement, consistent with one previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McDevitt et al., 2014</xref>), but inconsistent with another recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). These discrepancies could be explained by variable targeting of DRN subregions and stimulation parameters. Despite overall mixed observations about which exact neuronal population is sufficient for reinforcement, a common result is that DRN activation is reinforcing through direct excitation of midbrain dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McDevitt et al., 2014</xref>). In our hands, ablation of DRN SERT-positive neurons did not affect dMSN stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, the MLR receives projections from the SNr and has been associated with both locomotor control and reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Inglis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ryczko and Dubuc, 2013</xref>). Both glutamatergic and cholinergic populations of the MLR have been associated with reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dautan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yoo et al., 2017</xref>), and we have previously shown that striatal dMSNs drive locomotion by disinhibiting MLR glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roseberry et al., 2016</xref>). We observed variable levels of MLR glutamatergic neuron self-stimulation at sites that reliably drove locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, dMSN-driven reinforcement did not require MLR glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Similar to DRN, MLR self-stimulation of both glutamatergic and cholinergic populations seems to rely on direct excitation of midbrain dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yoo et al., 2017</xref>). Altogether, these results show that dMSN self-stimulation does not require DRN serotonergic or MLR glutamatergic neurons, suggesting that these nuclei belong to separate reinforcement circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A role for motor thalamus in reinforcement</title><p>VM thalamus is traditionally classified as a motor nucleus relaying basal ganglia signals toward motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Starr and Summerhayes, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Klockgether et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Turner and Desmurget, 2010</xref>). VM and VA/VL nuclei of the thalamus receive basal ganglia outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carter and Fibiger, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Di Chiara et al., 1979</xref>) and project to motor cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herkenham, 1979</xref>). However, VM differs with unique, widespread axonal projections to Layer I across many cortical areas including prefrontal and parietal cortices that are associated with more cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kuramoto et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the disinhibitory architecture of the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deniau and Chevalier, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albin et al., 1989</xref>), we observed an overall increase in VM activity upon dMSN stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Latency to excitation was short (~10–20 ms), in line with di-synaptic disinhibition via the SNr. However, a significant fraction of cells showed a decrease in firing, highlighting a degree of heterogeneity among VM neurons. These differences in response type could be based on connectivity or biophysical properties of VM neurons. Alternatively, inhibition could arise from polysynaptic network effects like recruitment of inhibition (via the reticular thalamic nucleus) by VM excited neurons or through lateral disinhibition within the SNr among VM-projecting cells. Both scenarios would be consistent with the longer latencies to inhibition observed here. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that dMSN stimulation significantly increases activity in the majority of VM neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), which is critical for dMSN-driven reinforcement (see below).</p><p>Mimicking dMSN-driven VM disinhibition with optogenetic VM activation supported operant behavior, similar to dMSN self-stimulation and SNr self-inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and consistent with VM electrical self-stimulation in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clavier and Gerfen, 1982</xref>). In contrast to results obtained with silencing of brainstem SNr targets, both extended silencing of VM with muscimol infusion, or temporally-precise SNr terminal excitation time-locked to dMSN stimulation, decreased the total number of nosepokes mice performed to obtain dMSN stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The latter approach argues for an acute role of VM disinhibition in reinforcement, rather than a global alteration of brain state. Therefore, it is possible that the magnitude of reinforcement (number of nosepokes) scales with that of VM disinhibition, similar to graded dMSN self-stimulation observed with increasing stimulation frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, VM silencing did not affect either spontaneous locomotion in the open field or dMSN locomotor drive, consistent with a primary role of MLR glutamatergic output in locomotor control. Altogether, these results identify VM as a key recipient of basal ganglia reinforcement signals.</p><p>Silencing VM did not fully block dMSN self-stimulation. This may be due to incomplete VM silencing, or the participation of additional mechanisms. For example, mediodorsal thalamus, a basal ganglia-recipient, non-motor nucleus, has been implicated in action-outcome learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chudasama et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corbit et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corbit et al., 2003</xref>) and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Parnaudeau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolkan et al., 2017</xref>), and could support striatal reinforcement. The SNr also targets the superior colliculus, which displays reward-related activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jeljeli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Doya, 2007</xref>), and MLR cholinergic population, which has been shown to drive reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, dMSN activation, through inhibition of SNc-projecting SNr neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mailly et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brazhnik et al., 2008</xref>), may disinhibit SNc dopamine neurons and thus increase DA release, which is sufficient for reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Phillips et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gratton et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ilango et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, rodent VM is embedded in circuits separate from dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Groenewegen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Papadopoulos and Parnavelas, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that the basal ganglia could engage both dopamine-dependent and dopamine-independent reinforcement mechanisms. In fact, previous reports have shown that dopamine-deficient mice can still learn to locate food in a T-maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Robinson et al., 2005</xref>) or develop place preference for morphine or cocaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hnasko et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hnasko et al., 2007</xref>), providing evidence that alternate, dopamine-independent reinforcement mechanisms can occur.</p><p>VM lesions have been shown to impair both the acquisition and consolidation of active avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zis et al., 1984</xref>), a behavior that is believed to depend on the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Delacour et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hormigo et al., 2016</xref>). In songbirds, vocal learning requires an intact basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scharff and Nottebohm, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fee and Goldberg, 2011</xref>). Other lesion studies in rodents have suggested a role for VM in spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jeljeli et al., 2003</xref>) and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey and Mair, 2005</xref>), and more specifically in sustaining cortical motor preparatory activity in a working memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, VM/VAL activation and inhibition increases and decreases cortical activity, respectively. Thus, it appears that basal-ganglia-recipient motor thalamus may be important for engaging cortical plasticity and learning.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Distinct circuits for locomotion and reinforcement</title><p>Gross manipulations of striatum, including cocaine administration and bulk dMSN stimulation drive both locomotion and reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Di Chiara et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Inglis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kravitz et al., 2012</xref>). However, it has not been clear whether those two distinct processes can be dissociated in downstream circuitry. Interestingly, direct stimulation of both VM thalamus and MLR glutamatergic neurons, two main targets of basal ganglia outputs, increases locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Klockgether et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roseberry et al., 2016</xref>) and sustains operant responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clavier and Gerfen, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yoo et al., 2017</xref>). However, we demonstrate a dissociation of these two basal-ganglia-driven functions at the level of output targets: reinforcement relies on VM but not MLR glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), whereas basal ganglia-driven locomotion depends on MLR glutamatergic neurons, but not VM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The pipette was removed 2 min later and the same procedure was repeated on the other hemisphere. The craniotomy was covered in silicone elastomer and mice were immediately transferred to the behavior boxes for training. After the last behavior session, mice were infused with 20 nl of DiI (ThermoFischer) on each side and then perfused.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Behavioral experiments</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Self-Stimulation</title><sec id="s4-5-1-1"><title>Apparatus</title><p>The self-stimulation apparatus consisted of a 10 × 20 cm box made of white acrylic, equipped with two nosepokes with infrared beams (MIX-engineering) on the same wall and a houselight (MedAssociates). For optogenetic excitation, we used 473 nm wavelength lasers (Shanghai Lasers) adjusted to 1 mW at the output of the fiber optic implant for continuous exposure or 10 mW for pulsed excitation (Master-8, A.M.P.I). For optogenetic inhibition, we used continuous 532 nm wavelength adjusted to 3–10 mW at the output of the fiber optic implant. Laser-emitted light was fed in 200 μm, 0.39NA optic fiber cable (Thorlabs), split through a 1-to-2 commutator (Doric) to two optic fiber cables connected to the mouse’s head for bilateral neuronal manipulation. Behavior was performed in the dark. Mouse position and nosepokes were tracked with Noldus software (Ethovision).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-1-2"><title>Self-stimulation</title><p>Sessions lasted 30 min. The night before the first training session, mice were food- and water-restricted. For the first training session, both nosepokes were baited with 200 nl of 10% sucrose-containing water, to ensure apparatus exploration. Mice were bilaterally connected to the laser with fiber optic cables and placed in the box. Poking in the laser-paired nosepoke (active) triggered the laser and the houselight, and poking in the other nosepoke (inactive) had no effect. The nosepoke-laser contingency was counterbalanced across mice and fixed throughout training. Mice could reinitiate a nosepoke as soon as the laser turned off, or after a similar lapse for the inactive side, by exiting and reentering the poke. After the first session, mice went back to unlimited water and food access for the rest of the training. Across all conditions, total number of nosepokes was stable from the first session onward. Mice were excluded if by day four the number of active nosepokes had declined by more than 50% or if mice performed &lt;1 poke/min on average over four sessions. Laser activation patterns and durations were set as follows: dMSN cell bodies, 1 s continuous; dMSN axons, 1 s 40 Hz, SNr, 3 s continuous; VM, 3 s 20 Hz; MLR excitation 3 s 20 Hz; MLR inhibition, 1.1 s continuous, with dMSN stimulation starting 0.1 s later, for 1 s; SNr terminals in VM, 1 s 20 Hz, simultaneous to dMSN axon stimulation; DRN 3 s 40 Hz; SNc 1 s 40 Hz. Pulse duration, 5 ms.</p><p>Throughout the manuscript, self-stimulation data come from the first behavior session, except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d,h,i</xref>, where data come from the first session with a 1 s laser/nosepoke contingency (second overall session).</p><p>The extinction session happened 24 hr after the 4<sup>th</sup> training session. Mice were placed in the apparatus for 15 min, during which the previously laser-paired nosepoke became inactive. Mice intended for ex vivo recordings were trained for 4 days and slices were prepared 24 hr later.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-1-3"><title>Locomotion</title><p>Spontaneous and dMSN-driven locomotion was measured in a 20 cm diameter circular open field arena made of transparent acrylic placed on a square of white yoga mat. Mice were habituated for 30 min to the open field 1 day prior to the experiment. After VM infusions, mice were placed in the open field for 5 min to measure baseline locomotion. For dMSN-driven locomotion, we repeated five cycles consisting of 10 s pre-stimulation, 10 s of bilateral optogenetic stimulation and 10 s post-stimulation epochs, followed by 30 s of recovery. Each mouse received both saline and muscimol infusions in VM in a random order, 24 hr apart. For dMSN stimulation paired with MLR glutamate neurons inhibition, the same protocol was applied, except that dMSN stimulation alone cycles were alternated with dMSN stimulation paired with bilateral MLR inhibition cycles, 5 cycles of each. Total distance travelled was summed for each epoch type, and averaged across mice.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electrophysiology in acute slices</title><p>Mice were euthanized with a lethal dose of ketamine and xylazine followed by transcardial perfusion with 8 ml of ice cold artificial corticospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): glycerol (250), KCl (2.5), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (2), CaCl2 (2), NaH2PO4 (1.2), HEPES (10), NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (21) and glucose (5). Coronal slices (250 <underline>µ</underline>M) containing the DMS or the SNr were then prepared with a vibratome (Leica) in the same solution, before incubation in 33°C recording aCSF containing (in mM): NaCl (125), NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (26), NaH2PO<sub>4</sub> (1.25), KCl (2.5), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (1), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (2), glucose (12.5), continuously bubbled with 95/5% O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub>. After 30 min of recovery, slices were either kept at room temperature or transferred to a recording chamber superfused with recording aCSF (2.5 ml/min) at 33°C. Whole‐cell current‐clamp recordings were obtained using an internal solution containing (in mM): KGluconate (130), NaCl (10), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (2), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (0.16), EGTA (0.5), HEPES (10). Voltage-clamp recordings were obtained using an internal solution containing (in mM): CsMeSO<sub>3</sub> (120), CsCl (15), NaCl (8), EGTA (0.5), HEPES (10), Mg-ATP (2), Na-GTP (0.3), TEA-Cl (10), QX-314 (5). EPSCs were evoked with a monopolar stimulation electrode (glass pipet) placed in the striatum, between the recorded cell and the cortex, and isolated in presence of picrotoxin (100 μM). TTX (1 μM) was added to isolate miniEPSCs. Cells were held at −70 mV except for NMDAR currents, which were recorded at +40 mV (measured 50 ms after stimulus onset). dMSNs were identified by tomato fluorescence. ChR2-positive neurons were identified by the presence of a photocurrent evoked by 500 ms blue light. eYFP-positive neurons were identified by eYFP fluorescence. SNr terminal excitation was achieved by flashing 470 nm filtered LED (Thorlabs LED4C driven by a Prizmatix BLCC-2) light through a 40x immersion objective (1–5 ms pulse, 0.1–1 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>). Holding current was varied from −70 to +40 mV. In VM, currents evoked from SNr terminal stimulation were only observed at positive potential and were blocked by picrotoxin (100 μM). Stimulation was applied every 10 s. Holding currents were not corrected for junction potential. Recordings were obtained with 3–4 MW resistance pipettes pulled from glass capillaries (Harvard Apparatus GC150TF-10) on a puller (Zeitz). Picrotoxin (Tocris) was prepared at stock concentration in H<sub>2</sub>O, then diluted in aCSF while kynurenic acid (Sigma) was directly added to aCSF for bath application. Data was acquired with custom written code in Igor software, which can be found in the source code files linked to this article.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vivo electrophysiology</title><p>D1-Cre mice were injected with DIO-ChR2 virus, implanted with optical fibers over DMS, and implanted with headbars as described above. Recordings were performed in head-fixed mice sitting in an acrylic tube. Mice were acclimated to head-fixation in several habituation sessions during the week before recording. On the day of recording, craniotomies (500 <underline>µ</underline>m diameter) were performed over VM (0.7 mm posterior of Bregma, 0.8 lateral of midline) in the left and right hemispheres. The dura was left intact. Craniotomies were covered with a drop of surgilube followed by silicon elastomer and the animal was allowed to recover for at least 4 hr. Acute recordings were performed using a 64 channel silicon probe (H2 Cambridge Neurotech) mounted on a micromanipulator. The probe was inserted into the craniotomy and driven vertically to a depth of ~4 mm. To reduce movement, the craniotomy was covered with 2% agarose in saline and a layer of mineral oil. The probe was allowed to settle for at least 15 min before acquiring data. Continuous broadband data were acquired at 30 kHz using a SpikeGadgets acquisition system and Trodes software. Blue light was delivered to the DMS ipsilateral to the recording site using a fiber-coupled LED (M470F3, Thorlabs). 1 s of stimulation was delivered every 10 s for 100 trials. The power at the fiber tip was 1 mW. Probe shanks were coated with CM-DiI.</p><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Analysis</title><p>Spike sorting was performed using MountainSort software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung et al., 2017</xref>). After a manual merging step, clusters with a clear refractory period in their autocorrelogram, noise overlap metric &lt;0.03 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung et al., 2017</xref>), and amplitude distribution without a sharp cutoff at low amplitudes were considered single units. Only units whose peak signal was recorded on an electrode site within VM were included in the analysis. We report data from 163 units recorded across 8 hemispheres of 4 mice. Peri-event time histograms (PETH) aligned to the onset of stimulation were computed for each unit’s firing rate using 10 ms bins. Z-scored PETHs were computed using the average and standard deviation of the PETH in a 1000 ms baseline period preceding stimulus onset.</p><p>To determine whether a unit’s firing was significantly modulated by the stimulation, a paired t-test was performed to compare the firing rate in a 20 ms, 100 ms, or 1000 ms response window following stimulus onset with the firing rate in a 1000 ms baseline window preceding stimulus onset in each trial. Units with p&lt;0.05 were considered significantly modulated for a given response window. Significantly modulated units were defined as excited if their average firing rate during the response window was greater than the baseline and inhibited if it was less. The modulation index was calculated as:</p><p>(AvgFiringRespWindow-AvgFiringBaselineWindow) / (AvgFiringRespWindow + AvgFiringBaselineWindow)</p><p>The latency to significant modulation was defined as the second time bin in which two consecutive bins of the PETH were outside of the 97% confidence level of the poisson distribution calculated from the average firing rate 1000 ms prior to stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeles, 1982</xref>). Latency was not computed for units lacking two consecutive bins outside of the 97% confidence level within the first 100 ms after stimulus onset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Histology</title><p>After recordings were completed, animals were prepared for histology as described below. To identify recording sites, 100 μm coronal sections were cut on a freezing microtome and DiI signal from the electrode was identified using fluorescence microscopy. Location of electrode sites relative to VM were determined by matching the histological images to the Paxinos mouse atlas.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Histology</title><p>Animals were euthanized with a lethal dose of ketamine and xylazine (400 mg ketamine plus 20 mg xylazine per kilogram of body weight, i.p.) and transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Following perfusion, brains were transferred into 4% PFA for 16–24 hr and then moved to a 30% sucrose solution in PBS for 2–3 d (all at 4 deg C). Brains were then frozen and cut into 30 μm coronal sections with a sliding microtome (Leica Microsystems, model SM2000R) equipped with a freezing stage (Physitemp). Free-floating slides were blocked for 1 hr in 10% Normal Donkey Serum (NDS) in 0.5% phosphate-buffer saline in Tween 20 (PBST) then incubated overnight in primary antibody (1:500; Aves chicken anti-YFP, #GFP-1020; Pel-Freez rabbit anti-TH, P40101; ImmunoStar goat anti-5HT, 20079), 3% NDS in 0.5% PBST. The following day, they were washed 3 times for 10 min each in 0.5% PBST and incubated for 1 hr in secondary antibody (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Donkey anti-Chicken 488, #703-545-155; Invitrogen Alexa-fluor donkey anti-rabbit 647, A-31573; Invitrogen Alexa-fluor donkey anti goat 647, A21447), 3% NDS in 0.5% PBST. Slices were then incubated for 5 min with 1:2000 DAPI. After this, slides were washed for 10 min in 0.5% PBST and 2 more 10 min periods with 1:1 PBS. Slides were then washed with 0.05% lithium carbonate and alcohol, rinsed with diH2O, mounted and coverslipped with Cytoseal 60.</p><p>Slides were scanned on a VS120 semi-automated fluorescent slide scanner (Olympus Scientific Solutions Americas Corp, USA). Some figure images were acquired using a 6D high throughput microscope (Nikon, USA). All images shown were made brighter for better print quality using Photoshop function ‘Vibrance’, ‘Brightness’ and ‘Contrast’ to change LUT. No detail was lost during this manipulation. Manual registration of slices was performed by scaling whole slice images in Adobe Illustrator, using the Paxinos mouse atlas (Academic Press, Orlando, FL) panels as a background reference.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistics were calculated with Prism 7 (Graphpad) or Igor Pro (WaveMetrics). Distribution normality was tested for each data set to determine whether parametric or non-parametric tests would be adequate. Based on the number of groups and independent variables, we used t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, 1-way and 2-way ANOVAs, followed by posthoc tests correcting for multiple comparisons. Only two-tailed tests were used. Tests and p-values are mentioned in figure legends. p-value&lt;0.05 was considered significant (p&lt;0.05*, p&lt;0.01**, p&lt;0.001***). Results are reported as mean +- SEM. Error bars represent SEM. When possible, sample size was calculated based on pilot cohort (powerandsamplesize.com) with a power of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05). All behavioral experiments were independently repeated at least twice.

includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Motor Thalamus Supports Striatum-Driven Reinforcement&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Michael Frank as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: D James Surmeier (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study uses optogenetic approaches to assess the role of circuitry downstream to the basal ganglia (BG) for mediating reinforcement. First, the authors demonstrate that stimulation of direct pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSN) is highly reinforcing but ostensibly not dopamine dependent. They moved on to directly stimulate BG output nucleus, substantia nigra reticulata (SNr), and find that its direct inhibition is also mildly reinforcing. SNr projection targets, including thalamus and brainstem were also directly stimulated to assess if they can support reinforcement. Similar to some previous reports, the authors find that stimulation at these sites is indeed reinforcing. Interestingly, this study also suggests that thalamic, but not brainstem, nuclei is directly involved in reinforcement produced following dMSN stimulation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All involved found the study to be highly interesting and provocative. However, they also expressed a few major reservations that would need to be addressed.</p><p>1) There was particular concern among all three reviewers about the claims regarding dopamine independence. Their respective comments on this issue are pasted below, but the key point is that to establish this properly would require much more extensive experiments (as well as other statistics, see comments from reviewer 3) than possible for a revision at <italic>eLife</italic>. Nevertheless, we all agreed that the dopamine-independence is not critical for the key contribution of this study, which is mainly to show that the thalamic output is at least partially involved in dMSN-driven reinforcement. Hence, we suggest that you strongly temper the conclusions regarding DA-independence.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1</italic>:</p><p>It is not clear that the reinforcing effects of dMSN stimulation are independent of dopamine (DA). Neural networks, like neurons, are non-linear. The implicit assumption made by the authors is that partial inhibition of DA signaling should result in partial inhibition of dMSN stimulation induced behavior. I don't see any compelling reason to believe this is true. Given the novelty of the conclusions drawn by the authors, the burden of proof is on their shoulders. The author's assertion is based upon two negative observations: nosepokes were not affected by (1) cocktail of a D1R (SCH23390) and D2R (eticlopride) antagonists administered i.p. and (2) deletion of NR1 subunits from dMSNs. The D1R/D2R cocktail produced a very modest reduction in motor behavior and in self-stimulation of SNc. For this to be convincing, there must be no 'spare' receptors in the circuitry mediating the behavior. Second, not all of the effects of DA on reinforcement need to be mediated by NMDARs – DA receptors also change the intrinsic excitability of basal ganglia neurons; only long-term memory of reinforcing events is thought require long-term potentiation of glutamatergic synapses and NMDARs (behavior over days was examined (Results section) but not discussed; why?). At the very least, the authors should determine how dMSN optical stimulation interacts with forms of reinforcement that are well known to depend upon DA. For example, does nosepoking for dMSN stimulation affect nose-poking for sucrose? Previous work by Tai et al., and Yttri and Dudman suggests it should, implicating DA signaling.</p><p>DA-dependent synaptic plasticity may be necessary for long-term memories associated with goal directed behavior, but not necessarily the short-term memory examined in this study.

The paper is about the circuitry mediating the effects of dMSN stimulation. Yet, outside of a few recordings from VM neurons, there is no attempt to determine the electrophysiological consequences of optogenetic stimulation on key circuit elements. This also is true in other parts of the study (e.g., SNr terminal stimulation is assumed to have a simple effect on VM neurons). More work needs to be done characterizing the thalamic response. Characterizing an area with 13 neurons, and making broad claims with 6 of those 13, is troubling. In supplemental Figure 5 there are very modest differences between excitation and inhibition of VM neurons by dMSN stimulation. In fact, excitation won by only 3 cells out of 13! Parametric Z-scores cannot be used to assay population behavior with a sample size of 13. The experiment illustrated in Figure 4F-H is elegant, but the nose-pokes evoked by terminal stimulation are twice those evoked by striatal stimulation in the previous figures. This makes it difficult to evaluate. Moreover, what is to be made of the change in slope, rather than the shift in curves seen in panel B?</p><p>Moreover, the questions the authors could answer would greatly and easily strengthen the impact of the paper – not only to give a better sense of the thalamic response (there appears to be evidence of excitatory responses early, middle and late follow stim – but it's impossible to tell with such a small sample size), but to get an idea how the thalamus responds during behavior. The one recording was done in a head-fixed mouse that passively received stimulation. Answering anything along the lines of how do the neurons respond during unstimulated nose pokes, how does the response change over a session, and how/why do the two populations of early excite and early inhib+late excite come about would be wonderful to see. I think this falls in line with the earlier comment concerning the assumption of simple linearity. That a brain region responds when another is stimulated says almost nothing about its potential to modulate learning or behavior. In my opinion, this could be done in a week with a few animals, taking the recording from troubling weakness to outstanding strength.</p><p>3) The experiments performed do not exclude a role for the MLR in mediating the effects of dMSN stimulation. None of the experiments address the potential role of cholinergic or GABAergic neurons in this region. The cholinergic neurons here have widespread projections, including to the thalamus. Moreover, it is not clear that the optogenetic inhibition of glutamatergic neurons in this region included those projecting to the SNc and basal ganglia. So, the assertion that the brainstem circuits don't play a role needs to be qualified, or else the cholinergic inputs studies.</p><p>4) In Figure 1D, dMSN stimulation routinely promotes ~400 pokes/30 minute session (ignoring a couple of outliers), and Figure 2 indicates that the direct stimulation of projection targets individually contribute ~ 100-200 pokes/ 30 minutes. Finally, disruption of Vm with muscimol or activation of GABAergic input from SNr reduce nosepoke responding to ~150 pokes/30 minutes. Altogether these results suggest a capacity of DRN and MLR for reinforcement, but the authors claim that &quot;dMSN self stimulation does not engage DRN or MLR for reinforcement&quot;. What structure, then, is responsible for the remaining reinforcement when SNr-&gt; VM is activated coincideRt-pcrnt with dMSN activation. In other words, VM thalamus modulates the reinforcing effects of dMSN stimulation, though inhibition only blunts, not eliminates the effect. This is potentially and due to very interesting non-VM mechanisms, and it would be a great addition for the authors to address it.</p><p>5) Situating these results in context of a previous extensive ICSS literature. The reinforcing effects of ICSS have been shown to occur throughout the brain, including cerebellum, PFC, LC, Raphe, brainstem (including putative MLR), thalamus – and under the control of either DA, Ach, 5HT, and/or noradrenaline. ICSS 'reinforced' behavior had been studied in depth in the late 60's and 70's and continues to today, with particularly excellent work done in the early 70's by Routtenberg et al. The absence of any citation of this extensive literature, save for one focusing on the BG and dopamine by Phillips, (1976), is problematic given that this paper focuses on ICSS (even though it does study a more specific component related to dMSN stimulation and downstream targets).</p><p>Given this, I would like the authors to read some of the seminal work on ICSS throughout the brain in order to better understand the context (that most positive ICSS is observed outside of the BG and is DA-independent was common knowledge in 1975). Wise, 1996 would be a wonderful start, and his list of positive ICSS locations is below. The authors re-discovery of non-DA ICSS everywhere is not exciting – it happens even in primary sensory cortex. However, their dissociation and mapping of the pathways that execute striatum's reinforcing and motor roles is certainly valuable. I would recommend a reworking of the manuscript to take this into account.</p><p>The authors' overcoming &quot;the requirement for dopamine in reinforcement (Discussion section)&quot; is a terrible straw man, one that the authors identify as already having been torn down in the very next paragraph.

To better mimic behavior, we recorded VM responses during a 1second stimulation window (versus only 100ms in the previous version). These results are now presented in Figure 6. After 20ms of dMSN stimulation, most responsive VM neurons were excited. After 100ms of stimulation, a significant fraction of neurons with decreased activity appeared. After 1second, a majority of neurons were excited. Overall, these results fit with our model of dMSN-driven VM disinhibition for reinforcement. Additionally, we now discuss the heterogeneous response properties of VM neurons during dMSN stimulation. We believe head-fixed recordings are not only optimal but also necessary to properly isolate VM responses during dMSN stimulation from any movement-related activity. Given the known role of VM in motor control, recording from freely-moving animals is highly likely to confound dMSN-driven activity with spontaneous movement related activity. In order to further link specific VM activity patterns with reinforcement versus movement, future studies should take advantage of head-fixed operant tasks combined with in vivo recordings.
