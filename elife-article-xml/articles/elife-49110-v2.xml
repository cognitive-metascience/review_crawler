Evolutionary pressure by CRISPR-Cas has driven bacteriophage to evolve small protein inhibitors, anti-CRISPRs (Acrs), that block Cas enzyme function by wide-ranging mechanisms. We show here that the inhibitor AcrVA4 uses a previously undescribed strategy to recognize the <italic>L. bacterium</italic> Cas12a (LbCas12a) pre-crRNA processing nuclease, forming a Cas12a dimer, and allosterically inhibiting DNA binding. The <italic>Ac. species</italic> Cas12a (AsCas12a) enzyme, widely used for genome editing applications, contains an ancestral helical bundle that blocks AcrVA4 binding and allows it to escape anti-CRISPR recognition. Using biochemical, microbiological, and human cell editing experiments, we show that Cas12a orthologs can be rendered either sensitive or resistant to AcrVA4 through rational structural engineering informed by evolution. Together, these findings explain a new mode of CRISPR-Cas inhibition and illustrate how structural variability in Cas effectors can drive opportunistic co-evolution of inhibitors by bacteriophage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR-Cas</kwd><kwd>anti-CRISPR</kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HR0011-17-2-0043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Doudna</surname><given-names>Jennifer A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Paul G.

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins provide adaptive immunity in which Cas nucleases are deployed together with CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to base-pair with foreign genetic material and trigger its destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knott and Doudna, 2018</xref>). The potency of CRISPR-Cas immunity drives mobile genetic elements to evolve mechanisms that enable escape from CRISPR-Cas targeting. While genetic diversity offers some advantages when facing innate immune systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Labrie et al., 2010</xref>), nucleotide variation alone is insufficient to evade the adaptability of CRISPR-Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Houte et al., 2016</xref>). To avoid CRISPR-Cas targeting, many bacteriophage employ small anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins to inactivate specific CRISPR-Cas systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borges et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stanley and Maxwell, 2018</xref>). Since the initial discovery of type I-F CRISPR-Cas inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013</xref>), a wide diversity of viral proteins have been found to inhibit CRISPR-Cas enzymes. Furthermore, genomic data analysis suggests that unique Acrs may exist for the majority of CRISPR-Cas subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watters et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Cas12a, like Cas9, is a biotechnologically relevant CRISPR-Cas enzyme for which novel Acrs have been recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watters et al., 2018</xref>). Cas12a (formerly Cpf1) is an RNA-guided Class II type V-A CRISPR nuclease which cleaves DNA following recognition of a 20-nucleotide DNA sequence containing a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zetsche et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Unlike Cas9, Cas12a directly catalyzes precursor crRNA (pre-crRNA) processing to generate a mature surveillance complex whose crRNA bears a hydroxyl on its 5’ terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zetsche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fonfara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Swarts et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Previously identified inhibitors of Cas12a, known as type V-A Acrs (AcrVA), either reversibly block substrate association through stoichiometric binding or irreversibly inactivate the enzyme complex through a chemical transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Suresh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knott et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dong et al., 2019</xref>). While exhibiting stoichiometric inhibition of Cas12a, the inhibitor AcrVA4 appears to be unique in several ways. At 234 amino acids, AcrVA4 is almost twice as large as other anti-CRISPR proteins and it contains a predicted coiled-coil domain not observed in other Acrs. In addition, similar to specific Acrs that target Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harrington et al., 2017</xref>) or Cas10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2018</xref>), its mode of action appears to involve dimerization of Cas12a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knott et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49110.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overall structure of the LbCas12a-crRNA-AcrVA4 complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of Cas12a activity.

Using single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we find that AcrVA4 recognizes the conserved pre-crRNA processing nuclease of Cas12a and the specific chemistry of a mature crRNA bound within the enzyme. This specific association serves to position AcrVA4 proximal to highly conformationally dynamic domains that are locked by the inhibitor to cage the enzyme in a state incompatible with dsDNA binding. Structure-guided mutagenesis revealed that AcrVA4 dimerization is not required for inhibition of Cas12a in vitro and provided no advantage to bacteriophage targeted by Cas12a in vivo. Finally, we identified the structural basis for AcrVA4 ortholog specificity and engineered the AsCas12a enzyme to be susceptible to AcrVA4 in phage assays and human cell editing experiments.

The beta-stranded body of AcrVA4 sits directly on the solvent exposed surface of the LbCas12a processing nuclease, forming a number of charged or polar contacts. AcrVA4 inserts a glutamate (VA4:E178) to interact with the 5’-hydroxyl of the processed crRNA and a conserved histidine (Cas12a:H759) within the WED domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These interactions are further stabilized by T201 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and an extended series of main chain interactions across the WED domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test the importance of residues contributed by AcrVA4 in this interaction, we substituted AcrVA4 residues E184 or T201 for alanine and assayed inhibition of LbCas12a-catalyzed dsDNA <italic>cis-</italic>cleavage. While the substitutions did not compromise the fold or oligomerization state of the inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), we observed that both individual AcrVA4 point mutations reduced the inhibition of LbCas12a activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The interface between LbCas12a and the CBD of AcrVA4 extends beyond the conserved crRNA processing nuclease to include an elongated β<sub>3</sub>-β<sub>4</sub> loop of AcrVA4 that sits deep in a solvent accessible pocket formed between the crRNA hairpin, REC2 and RuvC domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>). AcrVA4 contributes K202 from the β<sub>3</sub>-β<sub>4</sub> loop into a negatively charged pocket formed between N895 and E898 of the RuvC domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This interaction is proximal to another charged interaction in which E204 of AcrVA4 is buried within a positively charged pocket formed by K514 and K785 between Cas12a’s REC2 and WED interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Given this observation, we wondered if AcrVA4 would be able to block dsDNA <italic>cis</italic>-cleavage by LbCas12a in the presence of an unprocessed pre-crRNA substrate. To test this, we complexed LbCas12a with crRNA bearing either a 5’-PO<sub>4</sub> or 5’-dT(−21), RNA substrates that are uncleavable by Cas12a but mimic the structure of an unprocessed pre-crRNA. LbCas12a pre-complexed with a crRNA bearing a 5’-hydroxyl, mimicking the processed mature crRNA, was capable of robust dsDNA <italic>cis</italic>-cleavage that was sensitive to inhibition by AcrVA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). LbCas12a pre-complexed with crRNA bearing a 5’-PO<sub>4</sub> or 5’-dT(−21) were still effective at catalyzing dsDNA <italic>cis</italic>-cleavage; however, AcrVA4-mediated inhibition was compromised in the presence of a 5’-PO<sub>4</sub> crRNA and lost in the presence of an unprocessable 5’-dT(−21) pre-crRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To demonstrate that the loss of AcrVA4 inhibition activity was due to a binding defect, we carried out size exclusion chromatography (SEC) experiments to assay binding between LbCas12a-crRNA and AcrVA4. Binding of AcrVA4 to the LbCas12a-crRNA complex was substantially decreased in the presence of crRNA bearing either a 5’-PO<sub>4</sub> or 5’-dT(−21), indicative of a binding defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Collectively, these structural and biochemical data demonstrate how the bacteriophage-derived AcrVA4 exploits recognition of the conserved Cas12a crRNA processing nuclease through mimicry of the pre-crRNA substrate to bind at the active site and contact the 5’-hydroxyl of the mature crRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>AcrVA4 forms a heterotetrameric complex with LbCas12a-crRNA</title><p>Under our experimental conditions, the AcrVA4 homodimer assembles with LbCas12a-crRNA into a distribution of two complexes at equilibrium: a monomeric LbCas12a-crRNA bound to the AcrVA4 homodimer and a heterotetrameric assembly of two LbCas12a-crRNA complexes bound to an AcrVA4 homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knott et al., 2019</xref>). To investigate the nature of the heterotetrameric assembly and what effect it might have on the disposition of the bound Cas12a-crRNA complexes, we reprocessed our cryo-EM data to generate a map corresponding to the heterotetrameric arrangement. Taking a subset of 79,786 particle images identified by 3D classification, we reconstructed a 3D cryo-EM density map at 4.9 Å resolution representing State II (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using this reconstructed map, two copies of our high-resolution State I LbCas12a-crRNA-AcrVA4 structure were rigid-body modeled to generate a butterfly shaped dimer of dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Each copy of the LbCas12a-crRNA complex is held against a CBD of AcrVA4, with ɑ<sub>1</sub> of each AcrVA4 protomer forming the heterotetramer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Assessing the local environment surrounding the AcrVA4 dimer revealed that the two Cas12a molecules do not make any direct contacts to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that the interaction between Cas12a and AcrVA4 is due solely to the CBD contact interface. While lower in resolution, this map of the heterotetrameric complex included additional density not visible in our higher resolution State I reconstruction, enabling further de novo modeling to extend the CBD ɑ<sub>1</sub> helix as a poly-alanine sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Although EM density for the unmodelled N-terminal domain (residues 1–125) in each AcrVA4 protomer was clearly present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), it was not possible to model this region of the AcrVA4 dimer due to the limited resolution. Intriguingly, the ɑ<sub>1</sub> coiled-coil domain projects away from the interface with LbCas12a-crRNA and makes no additional contacts with either Cas12a protomer. This analysis of the heterotetramer architecture suggests that, although visually striking, the contacts stabilizing the interaction between AcrVA4 and Cas12a are limited to those observed and validated through inspection of our State I structure.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49110.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Overall structure of the heterotetrameric LbCas12a-crRNA-AcrVA4 complex.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Dimeric LbCas12a-crRNA complex (cartoon) bound to homodimeric AcrVA4 (cartoon, two shades of red) shown related by a 90° rotation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49110-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>AcrVA4 is an allosteric inhibitor of Cas12a DNA binding</title><p>AcrVA4 blocks dsDNA binding to the LbCas12a-crRNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knott et al., 2019</xref>).

This structural observation suggested that AcrVA4 might function through a mode of allosteric, rather than competitive, inhibition. To identify the nature of AcrVA4 allosteric control, we superimposed the LbCas12a-crRNA complex (PDB code: 5ID6) on our AcrVA4-bound state revealing that inhibitor binding did not change the overall architecture of the complex (r.m.s.d = 1.17 Å, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

To form a stable R-loop structure upon DNA binding, LbCas12a must undergo a large conformational change (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). Significant among these domain motions is the movement of the LbCas12a bridge-helix which drives a conserved arginine residue, R887, towards the cRNA: DNA heteroduplex (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamano et al., 2017</xref>).

To verify that the loss of inhibition by AcrVA4-W178A was not due to misfolding, we assayed the ability of AcrVA4-W178A to form a complex with LbCas12a-crRNA. Using size-exclusion chromatography coupled to di-angle light scattering (SEC-DALS) we determined that, like wild-type AcrVA4, AcrVA4-W178A was itself a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>) able to form a monomeric or heterotetrameric assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>).

Intriguingly, both wild-type and AcrVA4-W178A form obligate homodimers that associate with one or two copies of LbCas12a-crRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, LbCas12a-crRNA complexes formed with AcrVA4-W178A can catalyze dsDNA <italic>cis</italic>-cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These data suggested that higher order assembly alone was insufficient to block Cas12a dsDNA targeting. To test this hypothesis, we generated a dimerization incompetent AcrVA4 truncation (AcrVA4 Δ1–134) bearing only the CBD as resolved in our higher resolution cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We reasoned that this construct would exist as a monomer in solution and bind with 1:1 stoichiometry to an LbCas12a-crRNA complex. To determine the solution behavior of AcrVA4 Δ1–134, we carried out size-exclusion chromatography coupled to small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). Using SEC-SAXS analysis, we observed that the full-length AcrVA4 was considerably larger than the truncated AcrVA4 Δ1–134 as indicated by its greater radius of gyration (<italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub>), maximum dimension (<italic>D</italic><sub>max</sub>), and calculated MALS and SAXS molecular weights (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Due to the low sequence identity between Cas12a orthologs (~30%), it was not possible to attribute any single difference at the sequence level to AcrVA4 susceptibility. Careful inspection of the LbCas12a-crRNA-AcrVA4 binding interface superimposed onto the available AsCas12a ternary structure revealed the presence of a helical bundle in the AsCas12a WED domain that forms a compact arrangement proximal to the pre-crRNA processing nuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We next investigated if the exposed vulnerability to AcrVA4 in engineered As*Cas12a would support anti-CRISPR rescue of phage lambda infection. While the chimeric effector maintained the capacity to confer immunity to phage lambda, removal of the helical bundle rendered the enzyme sensitive to AcrVA4, efficiently restoring plaquing of targeted phage to levels consistent with the positive control anti-CRISPR protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, the Lb*Cas12a chimera was sensitive to AcrVA4 inhibition during phage lambda infection, despite efficient phage interference in the absence of Type V-A anti-CRISPRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This result suggested that the AsCas12a helical bundle might somehow destabilize the Lb*Cas12a chimera in <italic>E. coli</italic>. To circumvent this, we created an alternative chimera, Lb<sup>#</sup>Cas12a, by inserting a putative helical bundle from a closely related <italic>L. bacterium</italic> strain (OF09-6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast to Lb*Cas12a, Lb<sup>#</sup>Cas12a achieved complete immunity against phage lambda, even in the presence of AcrVA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>Given that AcrVA4-susceptible As*Cas12a maintained DNA targeting activity, we wondered if it might be susceptible to AcrVA4 in the context of mammalian genome editing. To test this, we generated C-terminal NLS-tagged constructs of the wild-type AsCas12a and the AcrVA4 sensitive chimera for ribonucleoprotein delivery into HEK293T-based human reporter cells stably expressing mCherry and one of several anti-CRISPRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Consistent with our biochemical data, wild-type AsCas12a was not susceptible to AcrVA4 whereas the chimeric enzyme was modestly inhibited from inducing genome edits in the presence of either AcrVA4 or the C-terminal truncated form AcrVA4 Δ1–134 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the limited spectrum of inhibition available to some anti-CRISPRs might be expanded by protein engineering, effectively reprogramming anti-CRISPR susceptibilities.</p><p>Our experimental exchange of the two-helix bundle between LbCas12a and AsCas12a suggested that this structural feature might represent an evolutionary path to escape AcrVA4-like activity through WED domain insertion. To explore this possibility, we generated a phylogenetic reconstruction of Cas12a orthologs rooted to the proposed ancestral transposon-encoded nuclease TnpB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shmakov et al., 2015</xref>). We found that Cas12a orthologs harboring the helical bundle appeared more closely related to TnpB than Cas12a variants lacking the bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A</xref>). This was further supported by a phylogenetic tree constructed from the RuvC domains of Cas12a and TnpB, an inference independent from the presence or absence of the helical bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5B</xref>). These observations suggest that AsCas12a containing the helical bundle is likely more closely related to a Cas12a common ancestor than LbCas12a which lacks the helical bundle. In summary, these results reveal an apparent evolutionary trajectory describing the loss of an ancestral two-helix bundle which may have driven opportunistic co-evolution of the AcrVA4 inhibitor by bacteriophage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Anti-CRISPRs (Acr) have co-evolved with CRISPR-Cas proteins to provide bacteriophage with broad-spectrum, or in some cases, highly selective protection from RNA-guided destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pawluk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hwang and Maxwell, 2019</xref>). Inhibitors of Cas12a, AcrVA1 and AcrVA5, each utilize a distinct mechanism to enzymatically inhibit DNA targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Suresh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knott et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dong et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we present structural and functional data demonstrating that the inhibition mechanism of AcrVA4 is also unique.</p><p>CRISPR-Cas12a, like Cas13a, are systems that carry out autonomous CRISPR array processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zetsche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fonfara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">East-Seletsky et al., 2016</xref>). We demonstrated that AcrVA4 specifically recognizes Cas12a by binding directly to this pre-crRNA processing nuclease and the mature crRNA 5’-end. While a number of Acrs have been described that effectively mimic target DNA to block DNA binding, AcrVA4 is the first example of an anti-CRISPR that exploits recognition of a pre-crRNA processing nuclease. Binding at the site of pre-crRNA processing positions AcrVA4 to allosterically lock the bridge-helix of Cas12a to prevent dsDNA target recognition and subsequent interference, consistent with a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). The existence of such bacteriophage-derived inhibitors targeting the pre-crRNA processing nuclease highlights a unique vulnerability in CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity. Other single component effectors that directly catalyze pre-crRNA processing, including Cas13, might also be susceptible to a similar mode of inhibition, although such Acrs have not yet been identified. It also raises the possibility that bacteriophage might evolve inhibitors targeted to alternative pre-crRNA processing machinery such as Csy4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Przybilski et al., 2011</xref>) or Cas6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carte et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, the specific recognition of the crRNA 5’-end chemistry by AcrVA4 provides opportunities to create orthogonal enzymes bearing modified crRNA that do or do not respond to AcrVA4 in genome editing applications.</p><p>Unlike other Acrs that prevent DNA binding by Cas9 or Cas12a, AcrVA4 is unusually large (234 amino acids) and forms a dimer whose binding to Cas12a does not competitively inhibit the DNA binding site in Cas12a. Although dimerization of AcrVA4 and formation of a heterotetrameric interaction with Cas12a is structurally striking, our biochemical data, phage interference assays, and human gene editing data demonstrated that dimerization is not necessary for inhibition. However, we did observe subtle phenotypic differences between AcrVA4 and AcrVA4 Δ1–134, observations that could be attributed to distinct rates of protein translation and turnover which can vary independently of transcriptional inducer concentration. It is possible that the N-terminal domain of AcrVA4 serves an additional function in an endogenous context to provide a selective advantage against activated and <italic>trans</italic>-cleaving Cas12a. For example, the dimerization of Cas12a may elicit a cellular response influencing Cas12a half-life or cellular localization. However, further experiments are needed to elucidate the true function of the apparently dispensable N-terminal domain of AcrVA4.</p><p>Our data also suggest that structural variability in divergent Cas12a effectors may be a driver for opportunistic co-evolution of specific bacteriophage inhibitors. The narrow spectrum of inhibition for AcrVA4 results from the presence of a structural feature in some Cas12a orthologs that occludes inhibitor binding. Although such a structural elaboration might have been expected to evolve as an insertion to protect Cas12a from Acr targeting, phylogenetic analysis suggested that this AcrVA4 shield is instead ancestral and was lost in a group of Cas12a orthologs after divergence from a common ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These data suggest that the fitness advantage driving helical-bundle deletion created the co-evolutionary opportunity by exposing an exploitable site on Cas12a. This raises the possibility that anti-CRISPR surveillance may drive selection in bacteria for Cas enzymes bearing local insertions or deletions that have little to no effect on the activity of functionally constrained elements such as the pre-crRNA processing nuclease or RuvC nuclease. In this way, bacteria might avoid anti-CRISPR activity by accommodating indels that do not interfere with activity but provide steric protection from Acr association. Such a process could help explain the prevalence of large indels seemingly scattered at random throughout CRISPR-Cas effectors and the diversification of CRISPR systems leading to anti-CRISPR resistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pausch et al., 2017</xref>). Understanding the modes of anti-CRISPR inhibition will continue to reveal new aspects of CRISPR biology and provide opportunities to harness these inhibitors to control Cas activities in biotechnological applications.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49110.027</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for the co-evolution of AcrVA4 susceptibility.</title><p>The ancestral Cas12a likely possessed a helical bundle, hindering any exploitation of the processing nuclease and bridge-helix (bottom left).

The LbCas12a-crRNA complex was prepared at 3.6 mg/mL by incubating LbCas12a with a 1.5 molar excess of crRNA at 37°C for 15 min before storage on ice and subsequent data collection.

X-ray wavelength was set at λ = 1.127 Å and the sample-to-detector distance was 2,105 mm, resulting in scattering vector q, ranging from 0.01 Å<sup>–1</sup> to 0.4 Å<sup>–1</sup>. The scattering vector is defined as q = 4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle. Data were collected using a Dectris PILATUS3 × 2M detector at 20°C and processed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hura et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, a SEC-SAXS flow cell was directly coupled with an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC system using a Shodex KW-803 column. The column was equilibrated with running buffer with a flow rate of 0.45 mL/min. 3 s X-ray exposures were collected continuously over the 30 minute SEC elution. The SAXS frames recorded prior to the protein elution peak were used to subtract the signal for SAXS frames across the elution peak. The corrected frames were investigated by radius of gyration <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> derived by the Guinier approximation I(q)=I(0) exp(–q<sup>2</sup><italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub><sup>2</sup>/3) with the limits q<italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> &lt;1.3.

The frames in the regions of least <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> variation were averaged and merged in SCÅTTER to produce the highest signal-to-noise SAXS curves for the corresponding elution peak. These merged SAXS curves were used for further SAXS analysis including solution structure modeling. The Guinier plot indicated an aggregation-free state of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hong-Wei Wang (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Knott and colleagues characterize the interactions of the Cas12a RNP with its inhibitor AcrVA4, one of an emerging class of molecules that can suppress CRISPR mediated bacterial defense systems. AcrVA4 is interesting in being able to inactivate Cas12a from some species, such as <italic>L. bacterium</italic>, but not others. The authors present two cryo-EM structures of the LbCas12a/crRNA/AcrVA4 complex, termed State I and State II. State 1 includes density for one copy of Cas12a and one well resolved copy of AcrVA4, while State II represents the heterotetrameric complex. Interestingly while AcrVA4 is known to homodimerize, the authors show that dimerization of AcrVA4 is not required for Cas12a inhibition in vitro or in vivo. Within the complex, AcrVA4 makes specific interactions with the 5' end of the mature Crispr RNA and with the WED, Rec and RuvC domains of Cas12a. The structure points to an allosteric interaction of AcrVA4 blocking the conformational change needed for R-loop formation as the mechanism of Cas12a inhibition. The authors also examine the AsCas12a protein that is not inhibited by AcrVA4, and show that this is due to an extra two helix bundle in the AsCas12a preventing AcrVA4 interaction with the AsCas12a WED domain. All of the above interactions are tested with a variety of point mutations, single domain proteins, and chimeric constructs.</p><p>The two reviewers both found this manuscript to be well written and the study well supported through multiple experimental approaches. The work provides important new insights into the biology of CRISPR defense systems and has technological implications for the design of new genome editing tools. With some revision the paper is an appropriate and interesting publication for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 2 the authors nicely show that the 5' end of the crRNA is critical for AcrVA4 inhibition. Does the 5' end of the crRNA influence AcrVA4 recruitment to LbCas12a? Is the loss in inhibition due to a binding defect?</p><p>2) There is no quality control shown for any of the AcrVA4 mutants. The authors should include some type of quality control (SEC curves, SEC-MALS, etc.) to ensure that the AcrVA4 mutants are stable, properly folded, and have the appropriate oligomeric state.</p><p>3) It is not always clear whether the effects described were the only ones occurring/tested or the only ones being presented. For example, the logic is not clear as to why the authors chose W178 of AcrVA4 to test effects on LbCas12a dsDNA cis-cleavage. As seen in Figure 4, there seem to be other residues involved in the interaction between AcrVA4 and the BH. Were other amino acids in AcrVA4 also tested? Similarly, in addition to the conformational changes of BH, do any other domains exhibit conformational rearrangements when the AcrVA4 binds to the LbCas12a-crRNA?</p><p>4) Did the authors try to apply a C2 symmetry to the dimeric State II structure during the refinement to improve the resolution or map quality?</p><p>5) There are lots of acronyms in this paper that are hard to keep track of. It would be useful if the authors could define the acronyms in the figure legends and not just the main text.</p><p>6) In Figure 4—figure supplement 4 it is difficult to distinguish between the alternative loop conformations.</p><p>7). In Figure 5F it looks as if there is a small difference in phage survival with the delta1-134 mutant, suggesting a minor role for dimerization in vivo. The authors should comment on this.</p><p>8) Figure 6A is difficult to see and should be enlarged and AcrVA4 should be shown as a transparent surface.</p><p>9) EM reconstructions cannot be described as &quot;electron density&quot;. Electron density is determined by X-ray crystallography. The authors should replace &quot;electron density&quot; with &quot;EM density&quot; throughout the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49110.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>Knott and colleagues characterize the interactions of the Cas12a RNP with its inhibitor AcrVA4, one of an emerging class of molecules that can suppress CRISPR mediated bacterial defense systems.

We have made a number of minor changes to the text and figures to improve the clarity of the narrative, included additional experiments that further support our conclusions, and directly addressed the reviewer comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 2 the authors nicely show that the 5' end of the crRNA is critical for AcrVA4 inhibition.

Is the loss in inhibition due to a binding defect?</p></disp-quote><p>Given the extent of the interface between AcrVA4 and the WED domain of LbCas12a, we hypothesize that the presence of any steric bulk in place of the mature crRNA 5’-OH (such as the tested 5’ PO<sub>4</sub> or an uncleavable pre-crRNA) would result in a loss of binding. To directly address this question, we carried out size exclusion chromatography to assay binding of AcrVA4 to an LbCas12a RNP in the presence of varied crRNA 5’ chemistry. Consistent with our hypothesis, the presence of a 5’PO<sub>4</sub> or an uncleavable pre-crRNA reduced formation of the LbCas12a-crRNA-AcrVA4 complex. These data are now described within the Results section as related to Figure 2—figure supplement 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is no quality control shown for any of the AcrVA4 mutants.

All of the AcrVA4 mutants described in this study eluted from the SEC at volumes comparable to wild-type AcrVA4, consistent with appropriate folding and oligomeric state. We now include the SEC traces for each AcrVA4 point mutant as Figure 2—figure supplement 2A.

Additionally, a number of the contacts between AcrVA4 and LbCas12a are formed by main chain interactions. We now describe this clearly within the text. With respect to W178, this residue was selected because it dominates the interface between AcrVA4 and the Cas12a bridge-helix (BH). We have updated the Results section to better explain our logic for mutagenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Did the authors try to apply a C2 symmetry to the dimeric State II structure during the refinement to improve the resolution or map quality?</p></disp-quote><p>We did attempt refinement with C2 symmetry applied, but this did not improve the resolution or quality of the cryo-EM map, likely due to the particles not having perfect C2 symmetry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There are lots of acronyms in this paper that are hard to keep track of.
