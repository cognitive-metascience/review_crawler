evidence testifying that a Palaeolithic group of people explored a deep cave in northern Italy about 14 ky cal. BP. Ichnological data enable us to shed light on individual and group level behavior, social relationship, and mode of exploration of the uneven terrain. Five individuals, two adults, an adolescent and two children, entered the cave barefoot and illuminated the way with a bunch of wooden sticks. Traces of crawling locomotion are documented for the first time in the global human ichnological record. Anatomical details recognizable in the crawling traces show that no clothing was present between limbs and the trampled sediments. Our study demonstrates that very young children (the youngest about 3 years old) were active members of the Upper Palaeolithic populations, even in apparently dangerous and social activities.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45204.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The fossil traces of Stone Age humans and other animals in the Grotta della Bàsura cave system in Italy have been studied since the 1950s. Italian archaeologist Virginia Chiappella published the first studies; she documented bones from an extinct cave bear, human and animal footprints, charcoal from torches, finger marks, and lumps of clay stuck on the walls. Since then, many more archeologists and anthropologists have studied the cave and its fossils. Yet there are still lessons to be learned from this prehistoric site.</p><p>Now, Romano et al. have combined a number of different approaches and used some of the latest technology and cutting-edge software to analyze 180 footprints and other tracks found in the cave. These trace fossils date to about 14,000 years ago, and the analysis revealed that they were left by a group of Stone Age humans who descended at least 400 meters into the cave. The group consisted of two adults, an adolescent and two children of about three and six years old. At one point they had to crawl through a low tunnel – something that has not previously been documented in the fossil record. The group were all barefoot, had no clothing on their arms and legs and used wooden torches to light the way.</p><p>Together, these findings suggest that young children were active group members during the late Stone Age, even when carrying out apparently dangerous activities. Romano et al. now hope that their multidisciplinary approach may help other scientists looking to understand how humans behaved elsewhere in the world at various points in history.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>bear</kwd><kwd>dog</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Comune di Toirano</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Starnini</surname><given-names>Elisabetta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Università di Genova</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rellini</surname><given-names>Ivano</given-names></name><name><surname>Firpo</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name><name><surname>Negrino</surname><given-names>Fabio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010478</institution-id><institution>Museo delle Scienze</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salvador</surname><given-names>Isabella</given-names></name><name><surname>Avanzini</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders provide financial assistance for fieldwork and publication fees.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Traces of crawling locomotion, including children younger than 3 years old, are documented for the first time in the global human ichnological record.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Discovered in 1950, the hypogeal part of the ‘Grotta della Bàsura’ is a large and deep cave that has produced some of the most important Italian Palaeolithic discoveries of the twentieth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiappella, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tongiorgi and Lamboglia, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanc, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamboglia, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giacobini, 2008</xref>) consisting of traces of human activity, especially footprints, dating back to 14 ky cal. BP. Up till 1890 only the atrial part of the cavity was known where Neolithic and late Roman archaeological finds had been unearthed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maineri, 1985</xref>). The cave opening is situated at 186 m a.s.l. about 1 km north of Toirano (Savona, Italy - 436253.433 E; 4887689.739 N), and extends 890 m into Mount S.

The exceptional prehistoric and paleontological value of the cave was firstly recognized by Virginia Chiappella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiappella, 1952</xref>) who was the first scholar to visit the site soon after its discovery. Chiappella identified several bones of <italic>Ursus spelaeus</italic> and traces both of animal and human frequentation (footprints, charcoals, digital tracks, lumps of clay adhering to the walls) in different areas of the cave within approximately 350 m of the entrance. Regrettably, destruction of most of the ichnological record occurred as a result of uncontrolled cave visits by local villagers and tourists lured to the remarkable discovery as a result of media reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanc et al., 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Lumley and Giacobini, 1985</xref>).</p><p>The first study of human footprints from the Cave of Bàsura was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pales (1960)</xref>, based on original images and 13 plaster casts of the best-preserved specimens from various sectors of the cave. Analysis of the bone architecture of the footprint makers and the apparent relationship with remains of <italic>Ursus spelaeus</italic>, led the author to consider that the footprints were made by ‘Neanderthal-type’ producers. Subsequent analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Lumley and Vicino, 1984</xref>), accompanied by radiometric dating, placed the prehistoric visitation of the Bàsura in the Upper Palaeolithic, between 12,000 and 14,000 years uncal BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Lumley and Vicino, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Lumley and Giacobini, 1985</xref>). Dating of charred wood fragments found on the trampled surface provided a more precise age for cave visitation at 12,340 years ± 160 years BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Molleson et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Molleson, 1985</xref>).</p><p>Based on the ichnological study of Pales, Blanc proposed that the inner room called ‘Sala dei Misteri’ was reached by multiple individuals, including a juvenile. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanc (1960)</xref> described, from the same room, a group of seven human footprints identified by heel tracks positioned only a few centimeters from the main wall of the chamber to which numerous lumps of clay were attached. The close association of the footprints with lumps of clay resulted in it being considered the result of initiation rites involving young hunters. This hypothesis was supported by the presence of a stalagmite concretion (defined by Blanc as ‘<italic>acephalous sphinx</italic>’ or ‘<italic>zoomorphic stalagmite’</italic>) placed against the terminal wall of the ‘Sala dei Misteri’ (Mysteries’ Hall) chamber on which several sinuous furrows had been made intentionally by several individuals using their fingers. This interpretation is currently under review by two of the present authors (ES, MZ). The aim of this work is to review and improve understanding of the Grotta della Bàsura’s human ichnology, soil micromorphology, sedimentology and radiocarbon chronology. A preliminary report from this study focused on human footprints preserved in the innermost chamber of the cave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Citton et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the present paper, we expanded our study to analyze and interpret all human traces (footprints and handprints as well as other traces) from the ‘Grotta della Bàsura’, providing new insight on the behavior, identity of the members, their exploratory techniques, and the social structure of an Upper Palaeolithic group.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Data</title><p>A total of 180 footprints and traces <italic>sensu lato</italic> were recorded and studied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Differing moisture content of the substrate accounts for the variable preservation of detail of the tracks (e.g. registration of plantar arch, heel and metatarsal regions, digit tips, track walls), particularly of the associated extra-morphologies (e.g. expulsion rims, slipping traces). The surface of the substrate and the footprints are cross-cut by mud cracks, suggesting a loss of moisture in sediments after trampling. Carbonate crusts (comprising both calcite and dolomite) cover many of the footprints in areas subjected to more intense dripping. Iron and manganese oxide coatings were found in the crust, probably due to repeated immersion in ponded water.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Geometric morphometry performed on human footprints highlighted five main morphotypes (hereafter Morphs.) indicating a possible minimum number of five individuals entering the cave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Morph. 1 includes footprints with a length of 13.55 ± 0.49 cm showing characters indicative of an early ontogenetic stage of the producer, such as digit traces and the heel area proportionally wider than those of the longer tracks. Morph. 2, with a length of 17 cm, is distinguished from Morph. one on the basis of a more pronounced plantar arch. Morph. 3 comprises footprints 20.83 ± 0.51 cm in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). The plantar area is characterized by a very pronounced medial embayment. This corresponds with a strongly convex external margin, as is shared together with a strong adduction of digit I trace, an overall larger divarication of digit traces and a consistent separation between adjacent digits II-III and IV-V.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45204.011</object-id><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Measurements

Some semi-plantigrade footprints (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, C44, C44b) show a strongly adducted trace of digit I and an apparent alignment with the other digits, probably because of the intra-rotation movements of the distal portion of the foot during the thrust phase. Footprints included in the Morph. 3 show a peculiar pedal morphology. While the resulting morphology of the digit I trace is explained by walking on a waterlogged substrate, the separation between digit pairs II-III and IV-V suggest an inherited familiar trait or a pathological condition of the producer’s feet.

Stature varies with race, age, sex, heredity, climate and nutritional status. Based on skeletal evidence, it is thought that the body proportions of terminal Upper Palaeolithic individuals was similar to that of modern humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trinkaus, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruff et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shackelford, 2007</xref>) but the foot length/stature ratio was considered highly uncertain, between 0.15 and 0.16. Consequently, we calculated the foot length/stature ratio based on a sample of terminal Upper Palaeolithic adult individuals (n.8) from the Italian Peninsula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corrain, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paoli et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Formicola et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mallegni and Fabbri, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mallegni et al., 2000</xref>).

Stature estimation from the length of long bones is commonly used in forensic medicine. In this study, we used the percutaneous length of the tibia to check the stature of the Morph. 5 as this measurement is known to have a strong correlation with body height. We used the relation S = 101.85 + 1.81 x PCTL ±3.73 for male and S = 77.86 + 2.36 x PCTL ±2.94 for female (where S = stature and PCTL = Percutaneous tibial length) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lemtur et al., 2017</xref>). For a tibial length of 35 cm, the stature of Morph. 5 is 165.2 ± 3.73 cm, which is comparable to the stature assumed from foot length (166.99 ± 2.93 cm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Body mass</title><p>Body mass estimates were derived from footprint parameters, based on the assumption that human body proportions have been constant through time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dingwall et al., 2013</xref>).

We have used these formulae for the individual taller than 147 cm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), stature: (b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bavdekar et al., 2006</xref>), (c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grivas et al., 2008</xref>).

Studies on the relationship size/age of the foot in extant juvenile individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fryar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Müller et al., 2012</xref>) have highlighted that 1-year-old individuals have a foot length equal to 13.07 ± 1.59 cm, reaching 24.4 ± 2.96 cm at the age of 13 years. The age estimation based on growth curves built on extant populations is very similar. However, we must bear in mind that the reference anthropometric data mainly refer to modern well-nourished populations, with a body mass most likely higher at the same age. Anthropometric studies suggest that the morphology of the foot changes and becomes more elongated when the arch stabilizes around the age of six (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Müller et al., 2012</xref>). In extant human populations, from the fifth or sixth years of age, arch angles vary from 21° (3–4 years) to 43° (9–11 years) in young males, and from 26° (3–4 years) to 47° (9–11 years) in young females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forriol and Pascual, 1990</xref>). As a result, morphotypes 2 and 3 seem to be similar, likely suggesting a corresponding similarity of age between producers of the two morphotypes. Growth curves based on extant populations with an average height similar of those of the Late Upper Paleolithic provided an estimate of the age of the trackmakers. For MP5, the wide and stout morphology is here interpreted as an adult stage with the partial collapse of the plantar arch.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Gender</title><p>Sex determination established from the foot has been proposed using Foot index and threshold values. However, this approach is not entirely accepted and some researchers pointed out that the threshold value could vary significantly between populations, thus making it very speculative that gender estimations could be determined from foot morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Walia et al., 2016</xref>). These variations could be due to fact that anatomic structures of the foot manifest ethnic and regional variations owing to climatic factors, physical activities, socio-economic status and nutritional conditions. Despite the method, uncertain arch angle and footprint morphology suggests a possible male as trackmaker of the largest footprint group. No definitive gender can be inferred for Morphotypes 1, 2, 3, 4.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Soprintendenza Archeologia Belle Arti e Paesaggio per la Città Metropolitana di Genova e le province di Imperia, La Spezia e Savona, Genoa, Italy and the Municipality of Toirano.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jessica C. Thompson as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor.

The authors complete a multidisciplinary study that complements the ichnological one based mainly on sedimentology, geochemistry, archaeobotany, geometric morphometrics, and 3D-modeling. They described footprints, handprints, knee and digit traces, etc. along two corridors and a cave chamber. The authors were able to identify 5 morphotypes of human footprints, which related to five ontogenetic states, two adults, an adolescent, and two children. The data and the methodology that the authors used in this study were high-quality and comprehensive: laser scanner and photogrammetrical 3D models of the cave and the trampling surfaces; new geochronological data; multivariate statistical analysis; biomorphic and biomechanical equations, etc. Therefore, the reconstruction proposed by the authors is based on solid arguments.</p><p>This is an excellent, thorough study on important material from an important site. It further uses innovative and cutting-edge methods (notably morphometrics) to reach new, original conclusions about human behavior in the Upper Paleolithic, shedding new light on what is essentially a snapshot of life at that time. The paper makes a real contribution to our understanding of life ca. 14,000 years ago. The combined findings about the number of individuals who visited the cave, their likely ages and the mode of their locomotion during their exploration are major contributions, as is the description of some of the behaviors in Sala dei Misteri. To this we can add the inference about the lack of footwear or clothing over the part of the bodies that left traces in the cave, which is instructive in its own right. The images are appropriate, convincing, and well-executed, and the video offers considerable vividness to their reconstruction. This work should finally give Grotta della Bàsurathe exposure in the international paleoanthropological community which it richly deserves by virtue of its uniqueness and remarkable degree of preservation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Details of the dating: What is the evidence that this set of tracks represented a single event, rather than multiple events by different people over several visits? The close 14C dates on charcoal are compelling, but there is little context provided as to where the charcoal was recovered relative to the tracks. In the methods, the exact place from which the samples were derived relative to the marks should be made clear. There are data such as the square number etc. provided for each sample, but without knowing how the excavations and samples were positioned relative to the traces, it is unclear how they relate. Also, where the 14C dates are reported in the body of the manuscript, they should be indicated as being uncalibrated 14C dates BP (right now they don't specify). This becomes confusing where in the text, the authors suggest that the human explored the cave about 14,000 years ago, but the new data of the charcoal remains (Table 1) are around 12,000 years ago.</p><p>2) Details and discussion of the canid tracks: What is the significance of the canid tracks? With ongoing interest in the domestication of the dog, and the strong evidence that this process began in the Paleolithic, what are the implications of these tracks being interspersed with human tracks? Are they continuously associated with the human tracks, or do they appear incidental, as do the cave bear tracks? Figure 3 shows some tantalizing patterns, but they are not discussed further. This would be unusual behavior for most canids to enter the dark zone of a deep cave, although denning cannot be ruled out. Were there also canid bones as well as ursids? In the absence of such evidence, the authors should make an effort to establish why they do or do not believe the canid tracks are actually associated with the human entry. This could potentially be one of the more significant findings of the paper, but it is barely mentioned.</p><p>3) Details of the methods for trace recording, and which traces still remain in the cave: The methods are not quite detailed enough to establish the basis for the original data collection. Many of the figures describe casts from 1950, and this is noted in the methods, but then there are also parts of the methods that refer to tracing prints in situ. Are all of the traces now gone, or just some of them? How reliable are the casts likely to be? How much of the original traces are likely preserved in the casts? Are the positions of the traces as noted in the cave based only on casts, or on a combination of casts, historical notes, and modern remaining traces? If possible, each print described in Table 4 should have a descriptor saying where in the cave it is from and if it was in situ or a cast.</p><p>4) Details of other findings/context from the cave: The manuscript says Bàsura Cave contains some of the most significant human Paleolithic discoveries in Italy, and citations are provided, but a summary of what those discoveries are would be useful. What are they? How old are they? How do they likely relate to the activities recorded in the deeper parts of the cave?</p><p>5) Discussion of the symbolic context of the traces: What is the evidence that the finger flutings and finger traces shown in Figure 2 were created in a symbolic context? The presence of humans at the rear of the cave might suggest such behavior, but some finger traces themselves may be accidental, especially if they co-occur with the knee marks and suggest crawling. Perhaps those inferred to be symbolic should be in a separate figure from those inferred to derive from locomotion? The flutings appear significant, but without a bit more description of them it is difficult to discern which ones are actually on the walls/stalactites and which ones are just incidental and/or located on the floor. Also, what is the evidence that clay was collected from the floor? Are there places where this excavation seems to have taken place? The citations direct the reader to some of the primary descriptions, but a summary would be invaluable here.</p><p>6) Restriction of discussion to the evidence: In the discussion, there are some areas when the manuscript over-interprets the data. How do the trackways cause the inference that body sizes were slender and muscular? Is this based mostly on body mass estimates? The knee impressions do not seem to speak to this, since they are a part of the anatomy that has protruding bones and ligaments when kneeling in spite of the degree of slenderness and muscularity. Also, the ensuing interpretation that this was a hyper-active teenage explorer is an over-interpretation of the data and should be removed. It distracts from the more solid findings.</p><p>7) Revision of the discussion about the role of children: Another important conclusion of this study is that even very young children were included in potentially dangerous activities at the time. In that light, however, the authors should nuance their discussion of local comparative data from the Arene Candide and Arma Veirana, because all these show is that children were considered important members of their groups rather than saying anything about how they participated in their societies. In this sense, perhaps a better indirect referent for the social place of children in Epigravettian groups would be the small size of the pebbles argued to have been broken as part of mortuary behavior at the Arene Candide argued by Gravel-Miguel. I think this speaks more about the involvement of children as opposed to simply mentioning they were interred, which shows they were there but says little about their role.</p><p>8) Ichnological terminology: The authors used footprint, traces, tracks, etc. However, for all the ichnological record sensu lato, trace is the best option. If the trace is impressed by the foot, footprint, if it is impressed by the hand, handprint, etc.</p><p>9) Copy-editing: The paper needs to be thoroughly edited for the quality of its English. There are currently many odd turns of phrase and instances of transliteration from Italian to English that can be a bit jarring and impede smooth reading.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45204.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Details of the dating: What is the evidence that this set of tracks represented a single event, rather than multiple events by different people over several visits?

The charcoal remains are those of the bundles originally utilized to illuminate the cave and preserved on the trampling palaeosurface of the “Sala dei Misteri”.</p><p>We add a new paragraph in the text highlighting all the evidences that make a single exploratory event for the cave more parsimonious, and the only one possible on the base of the available data. In particular, the short radiometric interval documented by both previous radiometric data and those derived from the latest research here presented (Table 1), together with the superimpositions between footprints allowing to decipher the timing of each singular impression, suggest that all individuals entered the cave in a single episode. In particular, the group of footprints C34, C35b, C36, C35 in the terminal part of the corridor of the footprints provides the timing of the impression: C35 (morph4) is superimposed on C36 (morph3) and the latter by C35 (morph4) (Figure 8). In the initial part of the same corridor it is observed that C63 (morph4) is superimposed by C64 (morph3) proving that morphs 3 and 4 are certainly contemporary. It is also difficult to assume that morphs 1 and 2 may have entered the deepest part of the cave without the presence of some older individual: if the older individuals who were leading the exploration were either morphs 3 or 4, the group consequently increases to include at least 4 individuals. No relationship can be established for the larger individual; however, as reported below, the fact that the footprints of this individual are regularly trampled and followed exactly on its path by all the other individuals, suggests that the larger one performed very likely the function of leader during a synchronous exploration. Therefore, the set of available evidences, and in particular the complex interference between the studied footprints, strongly suggests that a single exploration event by a heterogeneous restricted group of five individuals represents the most parsimonious and better supported hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Details and discussion of the canid tracks: What is the significance of the canid tracks? With ongoing interest in the domestication of the dog, and the strong evidence that this process began in the Paleolithic, what are the implications of these tracks being interspersed with human tracks? Are they continuously associated with the human tracks, or do they appear incidental, as do the cave bear tracks? Figure 3 shows some tantalizing patterns, but they are not discussed further.

In the absence of such evidence, the authors should make an effort to establish why they do or do not believe the canid tracks are actually associated with the human entry. This could potentially be one of the more significant findings of the paper, but it is barely mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, considering the importance of dog’s footprints as evidence for the domestication of the dog in the Paleolithic, this material is currently still under study and the object of a separate dedicated project; the latter includes the analysis of numerous trackways of extant dogs, hyenas and wolves to test whether the Bàsura dog footprints can be morphometrically referred to a single individual, and a detailed study of the interferences with the human footprints, to verify the real contemporaneity of frequentation of the hypogeal environment by dogs and humans. In any case, we included a short sentence in the new manuscript, along with some related bibliography, highlighting the possible importance of this material in the framework of dog domestication in the Paleolithic, stressing that this material is the subject of still ongoing study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Details of the methods for trace recording, and which traces still remain in the cave: The methods are not quite detailed enough to establish the basis for the original data collection. Many of the figures describe casts from 1950, and this is noted in the methods, but then there are also parts of the methods that refer to tracing prints in situ.

If possible, each print described in Table 4 should have a descriptor saying where in the cave it is from and if it was in situ or a cast.</p></disp-quote><p>We add a paragraph in the Material and methods section stressing that in our direct analysis in the site we have also considered and analyzed the original casts from the 50s. Their position has been identified in the cave and it has been verified that all the footprints identified during the first explorations are still visible in situ (Figure 1). Some of them have suffered alterations and loss of details, others have been partially damaged. For this reason, in some cases we have integrated the morphometric data of the original in situ with those of plaster casts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Details of other findings/context from the cave: The manuscript says Bàsura Cave contains some of the most significant human Paleolithic discoveries in Italy, and citations are provided, but a summary of what those discoveries are would be useful. What are they? How old are they? How do they likely relate to the activities recorded in the deeper parts of the cave?</p></disp-quote><p>In this regard we add some additional paragraphs in the Introduction, highlighting chronologically the first studies and published contributions to the Bàsura Cave immediately after the discovery. The historical overview, reported with sufficient detail, but without overloading to much the new version of the text, highlights the major contributions made by Tongiorgi, Lambroglia, Chiappella, Blanc and Pale, with the original interpretation of the human footprints, number of individuals and ritual interpretation of some traces and evidences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Discussion of the symbolic context of the traces: What is the evidence that the finger flutings and finger traces shown in Figure 2 were created in a symbolic context? The presence of humans at the rear of the cave might suggest such behavior, but some finger traces themselves may be accidental, especially if they co-occur with the knee marks and suggest crawling. Perhaps those inferred to be symbolic should be in a separate figure from those inferred to derive from locomotion? The flutings appear significant, but without a bit more description of them it is difficult to discern which ones are actually on the walls/stalactites and which ones are just incidental and/or located on the floor. Also, what is the evidence that clay was collected from the floor? Are there places where this excavation seems to have taken place? The citations direct the reader to some of the primary descriptions, but a summary would be invaluable here.</p></disp-quote><p>Also, in this case, we are conducting a work totally dedicated to the analysis of the authors and age of the finger flutings, with 3D reconstruction of the “zoomorphic stalagmite” and identification of the possible source area from which the clay material was excavated. A figure has been added where a sample of involuntary types from those created in a possible symbolic context is differentiated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Restriction of discussion to the evidence: In the discussion, there are some areas when the manuscript over-interprets the data. How do the trackways cause the inference that body sizes were slender and muscular? Is this based mostly on body mass estimates? The knee impressions do not seem to speak to this, since they are a part of the anatomy that has protruding bones and ligaments when kneeling in spite of the degree of slenderness and muscularity. Also, the ensuing interpretation that this was a hyper-active teenage explorer is an over-interpretation of the data and should be removed. It distracts from the more solid findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the slender and muscular body have been inferred on the base of body size estimate starting from footprint parameters. In this regard we add the following sentence to the new version of the text: “Body mass estimates derived from footprints parameters suggest slender and muscular body size for all the trackmakers. Arch angle and footprint morphology suggests a possible male as trackmaker of the largest footprint group. For the morphotypes 1, 2, 3, 4 any inference of gender result possible although the presence of almost a female (morph.4?) it seems probable.”</p><p>As properly suggested, the mention to ‘hyper-active teenage explorer’ has been completely removed from the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Revision of the discussion about the role of children: Another important conclusion of this study is that even very young children were included in potentially dangerous activities at the time. In that light, however, the authors should nuance their discussion of local comparative data from the Arene Candide and Arma Veirana, because all these show is that children were considered important members of their groups rather than saying anything about how they participated in their societies. In this sense, perhaps a better indirect referent for the social place of children in Epigravettian groups would be the small size of the pebbles argued to have been broken as part of mortuary behavior at the Arene Candide argued by Gravel-Miguel. I think this speaks more about the involvement of children as opposed to simply mentioning they were interred, which shows they were there but says little about their role.</p></disp-quote><p>In this respect, we have underlined the fact that not only some young individuals were buried, but that they were instead the object of particular attention. Indeed, we have added a mention to the grave goods found in association with the newborn from Arma Veirana and references are made to the sepulchral rites brought to light at the Arene Candide cemetery, along with the related bibliography. In our opinion, the constant association of adults and young individuals both in the burials and in external activities underlines the complex organization of Epigravettian and Mesolithic social groups, where even very young individuals, such as a newborn, could be fully included in the band structure both sharing their own responsibilities with adults and making themself object of elaborate funeral rites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Ichnological terminology: The authors used footprint, traces, tracks, etc. However, for all the ichnological record sensu lato, trace is best option. If the trace is impressed by the foot, footprint, if it is impressed by the hand, handprint, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We prefer to use the general term ‘trace’ sensu lato, since the material is not represented only by footprints and handprint (e.g. traces of knee and proximal shin).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Copy-editing: The paper needs to be thoroughly edited for the quality of its English. There are currently many odd turns of phrase and instances of transliteration from Italian to English that can be a bit jarring and impede smooth reading.</p></disp-quote><p>The new version of the manuscript was kindly reviewed carefully by the native speaker Professor Bruce Rubidge, consistently improving the quality of the English.</p></body></sub-article></article>
