However, due to the attenuation of visible light by tissue, and the limited set of near-infrared bioluminescent enzymes, BLI is largely restricted to monitoring single processes in vivo. Here we show, that by combining stabilised colour mutants of firefly luciferase (FLuc) with the luciferin (LH<sub>2</sub>) analogue infraluciferin (iLH<sub>2</sub>), near-infrared dual BLI can be achieved in vivo. The X-ray crystal structure of FLuc with a high-energy intermediate analogue, 5’-O-[N-(dehydroinfraluciferyl)sulfamoyl] adenosine (iDLSA) provides insight into the FLuc-iLH<sub>2</sub> reaction leading to near-infrared light emission. The spectral characterisation and unmixing validation studies reported here established that iLH<sub>2</sub> is superior to LH<sub>2</sub> for the spectral unmixing of bioluminescent signals in vivo; which led to this novel near-infrared dual BLI system being applied to monitor both tumour burden and CAR T cell therapy within a systemically induced mouse tumour model.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45801.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Fireflies and some other insects glow to attract mates or prey. This so-called bioluminescence occurs when an enzyme called luciferase modifies the molecule luciferin, which can then emit bright yellow-green light. The gene that encodes the luciferase enzyme has been introduced into cells from mammals, including cancer cells. In the presence of luciferin, these cells begin to glow. The brightness of the bioluminescence depends on how many cancer cells are growing and dividing. The light is bright enough for the cancer cells making luciferase to be transplanted into mice so their behaviour can be examined.</p><p>However, blood and other tissues absorb the yellow-green light, making it hard to see the cancer cells deep within a mouse. To circumvent this problem, researchers designed a new type of luciferin, called infraluciferin, which emits red light that shines through blood and tissues. There are now also different variants of the luciferase enzyme, which act on infraluciferin to make different shades of red light.</p><p>Stowe et al. wanted to test if two different biological events happening at the same time could be observed using two shades of bioluminescent red in a single live mouse. First, a mixture of cancer cells containing two versions of luciferase were transplanted into mice. When the mice were then given infraluciferin, the two types of cancer cells could be distinguished based on the different shades of red bioluminescence. In a second experiment, Stowe et al. tracked the treatment of cancer cells with immune cells, by introducing a different version of luciferase into each of the two groups of cells. Over time, the red light produced by the immune cells grew stronger than that of the cancer cells, indicating that the number of cancer cells had decreased and that the treatment was effective.</p><p>Together, this work shows that it can be simple, cheap and efficient to observe more than one cell type, or even disease, in a living system. This technique may be used by scientists to study different diseases and treatment options in mice. Importantly, it will also reduce the number of animals used to do this research.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bioluminescence</kwd><kwd>dual imaging</kwd><kwd>near infrared</kwd><kwd>infraluciferin</kwd><kwd>luciferase crystal structure</kwd><kwd>CAR T cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1410390</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Southworth</surname><given-names>Tara L</given-names></name><name><surname>Branchini</surname><given-names>Bruce R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000181</institution-id><institution>Air Force Office of Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FA9550-18-1-0017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Southworth</surname><given-names>Tara L</given-names></name><name><surname>Branchini</surname><given-names>Bruce R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/L504889/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allan</surname><given-names>Helen</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>James C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000765</institution-id><institution>University College London</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allan</surname><given-names>Helen</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>James C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stowe</surname><given-names>Cassandra L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two cellular populations can be tracked in the same small animal model using near-infrared bioluminescence imaging, for the first time opening up the window for multi-coloured bioluminescence.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is used extensively for the sensitive, longitudinal and high-throughput monitoring of biological processes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paley and Prescher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mezzanotte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yeh and Ai, 2019</xref>). Bioluminescence light emission is produced through the catalysis of a small molecule substrate, most commonly D-luciferin (D-LH<sub>2</sub>), by a luciferase enzyme. The mutagenesis of bioluminescent enzymes has improved the sensitivity and accuracy of BLI in small animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Branchini et al., 2010</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Iwano et al., 2018</xref>). However, despite its widespread use in scientific research, BLI is still largely restricted to tracking a single parameter in vivo. The ability to discretely monitor two biological parameters (dual-BLI) simultaneously within a single animal is highly desirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xu et al., 2016</xref>) with potential uses ranging from the monitoring of tumour burden alongside cellular therapy, to the visualisation of dynamic biological processes such as protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Prescher and Contag, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Previous approaches to dual-BLI have been disappointing. The use of multiple bioluminescent proteins which catalyse different substrates is the most frequently used method but suffers from a number of limitations. Sequential substrate administration is normally required, in addition this method commonly employs a combination of a coelenterazine and a D-LH<sub>2</sub> utilising luciferase (with the blue emission from the former being heavily absorbed compared to the yellow-green emission from the latter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Maguire et al., 2013</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stacer et al., 2013</xref>). Differences in biodistribution and reaction kinetics of two substrates can make image co-registration and interpretation difficult. The development of orthogonal luciferase-luciferin pairs has solved some of these limitations but this approach still requires multiple substrate administrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rathbun et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>An ideal dual-BLI approach would use two spectrally distinct bioluminescent proteins utilising a single substrate followed by spectral unmixing of the signal. However, this approach is not currently feasible using LH<sub>2</sub>. Although luciferases can be mutated to alter the colour of their emission, a limit appears to have been reached for mutational colour modulation of firefly and related luciferases. The most red-shifted of these enzymes have maximal peak emissions between 610 and 620 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Branchini et al., 2010</xref>). This is insufficient for dual BLI in vivo. Due to the differential attenuation of light by biological tissue spectral unmixing of a red-shifted luciferase paired with a standard or green-shifted enzyme is challenging, especially in deeper tissue models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mezzanotte et al., 2011</xref>). Shifting the emission of both enzymes into the near infrared must be achieved to allow adequate unmixing. To further red-shift peak emission we and others have turned to chemical modification of the D-luciferin (LH<sub>2</sub>) substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Miller, 2014</xref>). We recently described the LH<sub>2</sub> analogue infraluciferin (iLH<sub>2</sub>) which has a luciferase dependent red-shifted peak emission of up to 706 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jathoul et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We hypothesised that combining colour modulation of bioluminescence through mutagenesis of the FLuc protein along with red-shifting bioluminescence by chemical modification of LH<sub>2</sub> would allow dual-BLI, an approach that has not been described previously.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45801.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of Firefly luciferase in complex with a iLH<sub>2</sub> analogue.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Chemical structures of native D-Luciferin (LH<sub>2</sub>) and the LH<sub>2</sub> analogue infraluciferin (iLH<sub>2</sub>). (<bold>b</bold>) The crystal structure of Firefly luciferase (FLuc) in complex with the infraluciferyl-adenylate analogue 5’-O-[(N-dehydroinfraluciferyl)-sulfamoyl] adenosine (iDLSA) resolved to a 3.2 Å resolution (PDB ID: 6HPS).

First, the X-ray crystal structure of FLuc in complex with a high-energy intermediate analogue, 5’-O-[(N-dehydroinfraluciferyl)-sulfamoyl] adenosine (iDLSA) was determined to provide insight into the FLuc-iLH<sub>2</sub> light-emitting reaction. Next, we selected a pair of stabilised colour-shifted FLuc mutants, which emit with a 20 nm separation in peak emission wavelength with iLH<sub>2</sub> in the near infrared. We demonstrated the ability to spectrally unmix these two biological signals in vivo at depth using iLH<sub>2</sub>. Finally, we show a proof-of-concept of utility using this novel dual imaging technique to longitudinally monitor both tumour burden and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy within a single animal model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crystal structure of firefly luciferase in complex with a iLH<sub>2</sub> analogue</title><p>To help understand the red shift in bioluminescence emission from FLuc that is observed in its reaction with iLH<sub>2</sub>, the X-ray crystal structure of FLuc in complex with iDLSA was resolved and is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> (PDB ID: 6HPS). Data collection and refinement statistics (molecular replacement); and data collection, phasing and refinement statistics for mad (semet) structures can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. iDLSA captures FLuc in the adenylation step of the light emitting reaction (<sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C data spectra synthetic chemical compounds can be found in). The conformation of the iLH<sub>2</sub> heterocyclic rings with respect to the alkene, as drawn in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, is confirmed to be as predicted by computational studies and is the most likely conformation of the light emitting form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berraud-Pache and Navizet, 2016</xref>). This newly crystallised FLuc structure was aligned with the reported structure of FLuc with 5’-O-[(N-dehydroluciferyl)-sulfamoyl] adenosine (DLSA) (PDB ID: 4G36) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sundlov et al., 2012</xref>). The structures show good alignment to each other, however there is evidence of a more open active site supported by a reduction in root-mean-squared (RMSD) score when aligned based on just the N-terminal domain of FLuc rather than the entire structure (RMSD = 0.688 and 0.783 respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>All FLuc residues in close proximity (4 Å) to DLSA were also found to be within the same distance to iDLSA, with the exception of Arg437, &gt;4 Å away from iDLSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and e</xref>). We noted that despite differences in the conformation of iDLSA compared to DLSA in both 4G36 and <italic>L. cruciata</italic> 2D1S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakatsu et al., 2006</xref>) structures, the positions of the phenolic groups are quite similar (~0.5 Å). The altered position of the benzothiazole ring and the greater size of iDLSA may be the cause of a series of small active site changes that affect residues Glu311, Arg337, Asn338, Gly339, and Thr343 resulting in a total of six differences in H-bonding interactions. When specific residues implicated in the light emitting reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sundlov et al., 2012</xref>) were measured between the two structures differences ranged from 0.7 to 1.6 Å; with the biggest divergence being Lys529 (found in the C-terminal cap) which had a 2.4 Å difference in the nitrogen residue found in the side chain of the amino acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). The resulting increase in active site polarity due to the rotation of the C-terminal cap, if maintained during the light emitting conformation, could contribute to the red-shift in light emission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakatsu et al., 2006</xref>), in addition to the increased π-conjugation through the chemical structure of the emitter. This X-ray structure will help the future design of more efficient FLuc-iLH<sub>2</sub> pairs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Spectral unmixing of firefly luciferase mutants in vitro</title><p>A range of colour-shifted, thermo- and pH stable FLuc mutants were spectrally characterised in vitro with a comparative selection of LH<sub>2</sub> analogues proven to red-shift bioluminescence emission (CycLuc1– <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evans et al., 2014</xref>; Aka-Lumine-HCL – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kuchimaru et al., 2016</xref>; and iLH<sub>2</sub>– <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jathoul et al., 2014</xref>).

Both CycLuc1 and Aka-Lumine-HCL showed a consistent red-shift in peak bioluminescence emission wavelength to ~600 nm and ~660 nm respectively for all FLuc mutants, making these substrates unsuitable for dual colour BLI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The data confirmed that with LH<sub>2</sub> both FLuc_natural and FLuc_green have a peak emission of ~560 nm, whilst FLuc_red has a peak emission of ~620 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jathoul, 2012</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Branchini et al., 2005</xref>). When tested with iLH<sub>2</sub> all FLuc mutants were shifted &gt;100 nm into the near infrared but maintained their relative spectral shift [FLuc_green ~ 680 nm, FLuc_natural ~ 700 nm and FLuc_red ~ 720 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>)]. From this, we progressed further with two FLuc mutants, FLuc_green and FLuc_red to explore their utility for dual-BLI.</p><p>The ability to spectrally unmix FLuc_green and FLuc_red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) in vitro was investigated by mixing the two FLuc_mutants expressed in the Raji B lymphoma cell line at various ratios followed by spectral imaging and unmixing with both LH<sub>2</sub> and iLH<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). As would be expected from accurate spectral unmixing, the top wells were classified as containing mostly FLuc_green signal, which gradually decreased down the plate in line with the decreasing proportions of FLuc_green expressing cells, with the bottom wells being largely classified as FLuc_red signal for both LH<sub>2</sub> and iLH<sub>2</sub>. The percentage unmixed signal of FLuc_green and FLuc_red was plotted for each ratio of FLuc expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Correlation analysis was performed on this data comparing input cellular proportions with unmixed signal, giving R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.9983 and 0.9972 for LH<sub>2</sub> and iLH<sub>2</sub> respectively. Even though all 18 bandpass filters equipped on the IVIS Spectrum were utilised for spectral unmixing in this in vitro testing, we appreciate that not all potential users of this novel dual bioluminescence methodology will have access to machines with such a wide selection of bandpass filters. Therefore, further analysis of our data showed that spectral unmixing could be achieved with high accuracy just using a subset of filters. For LH<sub>2</sub>, the use of 3 bandpass filters (500 nm, 660 nm, 820 nm) gave an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.9958; For iLH<sub>2</sub>, the use of 3 bandpass filters (600 nm, 700 nm, 800 nm) gave an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.9937. The highest accuracy of spectral unmixing we could achieve using just two filters were R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.9776 and 0.9775 for LH<sub>2</sub> (500 nm and 720 nm) and iLH<sub>2</sub> (600 nm and 720 nm), respectively. Additionally, an experiment was carried out where FLuc_green and FLuc_red have been expressed at different levels in the same cell. Spectral bioluminescence imaging and unmixing has subsequently been performed to successfully reflect these differing expression levels with both LH<sub>2</sub> and iLH<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This spectral imaging data show that both LH<sub>2</sub> and iLH<sub>2</sub> can be used for dual bioluminescence reporting in vitro.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45801.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Spectral unmixing of Firefly luciferase mutants in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Bioluminescence spectral unmixing of cells expressing colour-shifted Firefly luciferase (FLuc) mutants, for both in vitro assays and in vivo animal models, requires spectral bioluminescence imaging through a series of bandpass filters. Bioluminescence spectral imaging acquires spectral data, which can then be deconvoluted into its separate components.

Currently, most dual BLI has been achieved with two luciferases each utilising a different substrate, one of which is normally the auto luminescent coelenterazine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Maguire et al., 2013</xref>). A simpler approach would be to use a single LH<sub>2</sub> substrate and two firefly (or related) luciferases which emit at different wavelengths. This in theory has advantages of higher quantum yield and a more favourable substrate. Such an approach has been attempted: for instance Mezzanotte et al tested dual BLI in vivo using LH<sub>2</sub> with the green luciferase (CBG99) with the red luciferase (Ppy RE8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mezzanotte et al., 2011</xref>). However, in deeper tissues the shorter wavelength component of green emitting enzyme emission is heavily attenuated by mammalian tissues leaving an ‘in vivo spectrum’ which is almost indistinguishable from that of the red luciferase.</p><p>To illustrate this, and as a control for subsequent experiments, we attempted dual BLI using a pair of stabilised firefly luciferases, which are green/red shifted to 546 nm and 610 nm respectively using LH<sub>2</sub> as a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Branchini et al., 2007</xref>). Whilst in vitro the spectra could be easily distinguished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) in vivo the spectral separation between the two FLuc enzymes was lost due to the differential attenuation of the green enzyme by biological tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). An obvious solution is to red-shift both enzymes into the optic window while maintaining an adequate separation. However, although bioluminescence emission has been successfully red-shifted through mutagenesis of firefly luciferase the structure of the LH<sub>2</sub> substrate ultimately limits this approach. Dual BLI with a single substrate in the near-infrared should be better; this has been described using BRET based reporters with an coelenterazine derived substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rumyantsev et al., 2016</xref>). To move bioluminescence into the near infrared modification of the LH<sub>2</sub> substrate was required. Indeed, red-shifted luciferin analogues have been reported. These include CycLuc1 and Aka-Lumine, however neither permit variation in emission spectra with different Luciferase mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evans et al., 2014</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kuchimaru et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Iwano et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). More recently, two Naphthyl luciferins, NH<sub>2</sub>-NpLH<sub>2</sub> and OH-NpLH<sub>2</sub>, were reported to red shift the in vitro bioluminescence emission of CBR to 664 nm and 758 nm respectively (emission max 614 nm with LH<sub>2</sub>). Interestingly, NH<sub>2</sub>-NpLH<sub>2</sub> was shown to have an in vitro peak emission of 730 nm with an optimised version of CBR (CBR2). The potential application of CBR and CBR2 with NH<sub>2</sub>-NpLH<sub>2</sub> for dual-BLI in vivo was not explored; and the reported broad emission spectrum of optCBR2 in live cells is likely to make any near-infrared dual BLI with NH<sub>2</sub>-NpLH<sub>2</sub> challenging, however this approach cannot be discounted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hall et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We described previously iLH<sub>2</sub>, which has a near-infrared emission and in contrast to other LH<sub>2</sub> analogues maintains the 6’ hydroxyl benzothiazole group of LH<sub>2</sub> that preserves the colour-shifts of mutant luciferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jathoul et al., 2014</xref>). Analysis of the x-ray crystal structure of FLuc in complex with the iLH<sub>2</sub> analogue (iDLSA) revealed that the hydrogen-bonding network, thought to be critical in stabilising the phenolate ion of the emitter, is disrupted in the FLuc-iDLSA due to the accommodation of the larger iLH<sub>2</sub> substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Branchini et al., 2017</xref>). This enables full charge delocalization of the phenolate ion, in addition to extended conjugation, resulting in a red-shifted emission as suggested by homology modelling experiments with the recently described near infrared emitting naphthyl analogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hall et al., 2018</xref>). Evidence for the disruption of the network is the absence of a H-bond between Arg337 and Glu311 that is found in the DLSA structures of FLuc and <italic>L. cruciata</italic> Luc. This H-bonding interaction has been proposed to be important for stabilising an active site conformation for green light emission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Viviani et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, the resulting increase in active site polarity due to the rotation of the C-terminal cap could also contribute to the red-shift in light emission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakatsu et al., 2006</xref>). It must be noted that the crystal structure reported here has captured FLuc in the adenylation step of the reaction, therefore further computational modelling/crystal structure elucidation would be expected to provide further information on the light-emitting step of the reaction with iLH<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakatsu et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, the more open adenylation conformation of FLuc -iDLSA may affect the adenylate significantly, altering light production by decreasing the yield of the electronically excited state emitter and/or the efficiency in which the emitter produces a photon. Moreover, small differences in the binding position of the adenylate seen here, caused by positional changes of key active site residues could have a similar effect.</p><p>Given that iLH<sub>2</sub> preserves the colour modulation of mutant luciferases (in addition to the 100 nm red shift), we set about to explore dual-BLI with iLH<sub>2</sub>. We identified two stabilised FLuc enzymes with colour shifting mutations: FLuc_green (V241I/G246A/F250S) and Fluc_red (S284T). Both exhibit a wide separation in peak emission wavelength, and were also balanced in their relative intensities. We next compared in vitro spectra with in vivo spectra from luciferase expressing cells implanted subcutaneously, systemically and intracranially (to approximate superficial, intermediate and deep light source) with both LH<sub>2</sub> and iLH<sub>2</sub>. The near-infrared emission of the FLuc mutants with iLH<sub>2</sub> meant spectral separation was maintained for all animal tumour models. Importantly, the spectra of the two FLuc mutants remained consistent over tissue depth, meaning this dual BLI system could be applied to animal models without prior spectral characterisation. This maintenance of spectral separation, and similarity of relative intensities, between FLuc_green and FLuc_red when imaged with iLH<sub>2</sub> meant this near-infrared bioluminescence system was found to be significantly better at spectral unmixing in vivo than using LH<sub>2</sub>. This was demonstrated when the unmixed bioluminescent signals were correlated with actual cellular populations, determined by flow cytometry, (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99 and 0.89 for iLH<sub>2</sub> and LH<sub>2</sub> respectively).</p><p>One potential limitation of this system in its current state is the lower quantum yield of the FLuc-iLH<sub>2</sub> reaction when compared to the FLuc-LH<sub>2</sub> reaction,~2–3 orders of magnitude dimmer. However, in this study, all mice were successfully spectrally imaged with both LH<sub>2</sub> and iLH<sub>2</sub>, which can be attributed to the sensitivity of the photon counting capabilities of the CCD cameras fitted in optical imagers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cool et al., 2013</xref>). The crystal structure reported here will be important for further optimisation of this near-infrared dual BLI system, particularly to increase the brightness of the current enzymes with iLH<sub>2</sub>, as well as the discovery of novel luciferase colour-mutants which could be used for multi-coloured BLI in the near-infrared. Additionally, the use of this system in combination with luciferases utilising other substrates for multi-coloured BLI could also be explored, as well as its application to monitoring more complex processes in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kleinovink et al., 2018</xref>). This work represents an important step forward in increasing the utility of BLI and opens up the window for multi-coloured BLI in the near-infrared.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Photinus pyralis</italic>)</td><td>FLuc</td><td>this paper</td><td>N/A</td><td>Amino acid changes from ref 21 and 23, codon optimised for mammalian expression for use in this paper</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (mouse, male)</td><td>NSG</td><td>Jax mouse strain (<italic>Charles River)</italic></td><td valign="bottom">NOD.Cg-<italic>Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1WjI</italic>/SzJ</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (Human, male)</td><td>Raji B lymphoma</td><td>ATCC CCL-86</td><td>N/A</td><td>Mycoplasma tested by GATC (Eurofins Genomics)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-human CD34-PE</td><td>Biolegend</td><td>Clone 581, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1731862">AB_1731862</ext-link></td><td>(1:20)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-human CD271-APC</td><td>Biolegend</td><td>Clone ME20.4, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10645515">AB_10645515</ext-link></td><td>(1:20)</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, dye</td><td>Viability APC eFluoro780</td><td>eBioscience</td><td>N/A</td><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-mouse/human CD11b PerCP/Cy5.5</td><td>Biolegend</td><td>Clone M1/70, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_893232">AB_893232</ext-link></td><td>(1:20)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-human CD19 FITC</td><td>eBioscience</td><td>Clone HIB19, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10669461">AB_10669461</ext-link></td><td>(1:20)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-human CD20 eFLuor 450</td><td>eBioscience</td><td>Clone 2H7, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1633384">AB_1633384</ext-link></td><td>(1:20)</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Luciferin</td><td>Regis technologies</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Living Image</td><td>Perkin Elmer</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Prism</td><td>Graphpad</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Excel</td><td>Microsoft</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Flow Jo</td><td>Tree Star Inc (Oregon, USA)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td valign="bottom">PyMOL software</td><td valign="bottom">Schrodinger</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td valign="bottom">CrysalisPro</td><td valign="bottom">Agilent Technologies</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td valign="bottom">BD FACSDIVA</td><td valign="bottom">BD biosciences</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">infraluciferin</td><td valign="bottom">Anderson, J.C.; Grounds, H.; Jathoul, A.P.; Murray, J.A.H.; Pacman, S.J.; Tisi, L.

A 20 mg/mL solution of <italic>P. pyralis</italic> luciferase (PpyWT that contains the N-terminal peptide GPLGS-) in the same buffer (500 µL) was mixed gently with the iDLSA at room temperature and then incubated at 15°C for 20 min. The concentration of iDLSA in the protein-inhibitor mixture was determined by UV absorbance to be 620 µM, giving an inhibitor:enzyme ratio of ~3:1, at this point the bioluminescence activity of the mixture was assayed and the enzyme was 85% inhibited. A small amount of a separate iDLSA solution (available from solubility trials) was added to bring the inhibitor:enzyme ratio to ~4:1, and based on activity the enzyme was 91% inhibited. Finally, the protein-inhibitor solution was added to ~0.5 mg of iDLSA and mixed gently and incubated at 15°C for 15 min. Based on activity, 99% of the enzyme was inhibited and based on UV absorbance the inhibitor:enzyme ratio was 5.6:1 (950 µM:170 µM) The protein-inhibitor solution was centrifuged and a very slight amount of inhibitor was evident. The supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen in ~18–50 µL aliquots and stored at −80°C. A single aliquot was thawed and the solution remained clear.

Animals were anaesthetised using 2% Isofluorine (flow rate 1 L/min O<sub>2</sub>). Spectral imaging was commenced 10 min post IP injection to allow stabilisation of light output. If the same animal was being imaged with both LH2 and iLH2, at least 24 hr was left between imaging to allow for full clearance of substrate. In vivo bioluminescent images were acquired using IVIS Spectrum (FOV 24, f/1, Medium (8)bin, automatic acquisition mode for imaging with LH<sub>2</sub>, FOV 24, f/1, Medium (8)bin, 120 s acquisition, total imaging time 24 mins for imaging with iLH<sub>2</sub>). These parameters are calculated to keep the binning, exposure time and f/stop within an optimal range for quantification. Up to five animals could be imaged at once and the stage was heated to 37°C. Open filter images were acquired prior to and post spectral imaging to confirm the stability of photon emission during spectral acquisition. Spectral imaging acquired images through 14 and 12 of the 20 nm bandpass filters on the IVIS Spectrum depending on substrate used (530–830 nm for LH2 and 590–830 nm for iLH2), starting from the lowest to the highest filter. It was not necessary to acquire images through all filters as the bioluminescent emissions of FLuc mutants did not cover the full spectral range from 490 to 850 nm. Living image software was used for ROI analysis of spectral images and spectral unmixing analysis. Radiance values for bioluminescence are shown using pseudo-colour scales detailed in each image. Image analysis involved placing an ROI over the tumour signal for every animal in each model. If a series if spectral images were acquired, the same ROI was placed over tumour signal in every image for each mouse. For spectral unmixing analysis, guided spectral unmixing was first used on pure expressing FLuc_green and FLuc_red populations from spectral characterisation experiments to create a library spectra for each mutant with each substrate. The relevant library spectra was then used to perform spectral unmixing on mixed FLuc_green and FLuc_red populations.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and David Ron as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Laura Mezzanotte (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The work presented here represents an innovative approach and an advance in the field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please address if different ratios of the two enzymes expressed in one cell type be distinguished similarly to in different cells?

In this context, it was felt that Figure 1 could be improved to incorporate such discussion and better clarify the design and goals of the study.</p><p>3) Please discuss how some of the best aspects of other published systems might be combined with the systems described here, for example, to do three colour BLI. Along these lines, in the second paragraph of the Discussion, is there a reason the click-beetle luciferase/naphthyl luciferin system wasn't used as benchmark? This system is mentioned in the Discussion and discounted for two-color work because of a broad emission peak. It does indeed have a broad peak, however, given the success of the spectral unmixing achieved in this study, we question whether the emission peak is so broad as to discount its use for multiplexing.</p><p>4) The role of the structure in the study is not clear. The authors should better integrate the structural information or remove it to allow more of a focus on relevant information. Currently its stated that it may be valuable to improve the performance of infraluciferin, but was it of any direct use in the current work? This should be clarified.</p><p>5) The nature of the green and red mutants needs more description. It is assumed the green is the same as x11 + three additional mutations but it is not clear why this mutant was engineered. It is assumed that red is x11 + S284T + R354I (or is it E?) but it is not clear why this mutant was engineered. It is also a gap in the story that there isn't any biochemical analysis on these mutants (aside from spectra). Were they purified?</p><p>6) Its surprising that the very low photon yield from the infraluciferin system can enable collection of a useable signal. Can the authors comment on how the signal for infraluciferin is processed and if any special care was needed regarding substrate concentration/availability, camera settings, exposure time, binning or other strategies to enhance signal to noise. Along these lines, the authors used iLH<sub>2</sub> concentration of 100mg/kg for their in vivo experiments. Could you go higher to enhance emission intensities? Is there toxicity data available, or would cost become a limitation?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Near-infrared dual bioluminescence imaging in mouse models of cancer using infraluciferin&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by David Ron as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The paper should be a resource for future potential users to see an exemplar, but also have the nuts and bolts information to for potential users to effectively judge that the method might work for other applications. The comments below are an effort to incorporate the necessary information to achieve this. Please read the comments carefully and work to address them in the spirit of making this a fantastic resource. But all feel it’s moving in the correct direction and this is now a minor revision that will result in a big benefit.</p><p>The reviewers have provided a set of detailed points for you to address in revision (points 1-5, the comments of reviewer 1 and points 2-3 of reviewer 1). I hope you will be able to present a revised manuscript that deals with all seven points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed the major issues raised in the preview round of review as clearly described in the rebuttal letter. The change in the title confers to the manuscript a clear focus on a specific application. However, the manuscript still require some improvement since some points need to be better clarified.</p><p>1) In the last paragraph of the subsection “Spectral characterisation of firefly luciferase mutants with LH<sub>2</sub> and iLH<sub>2</sub> in vivo” the authors comment that the relative intensities of the luciferases are comparable, thus the dynamic range of radiance values for both enzyme will be more similar giving a more accurate comparison of the process being monitored. The sentence results vague. For example in the case one reporter is used under the control of a constitutive promoter and the second under a control of an inducible and much weaker promoter the fact that the luciferases have similar relative intensities would not help. The authors proved that they could successfully separate in signals in cases where one reporter expression is around 10 times higher than the other (e.g. in the case of 90%/10% mixed population of cells). What happens if the expression is 99% and 1% for example? Will then the process be monitored with accuracy?</p><p>2) In the proof of concept experiment using CAR T cells, the authors show that red signal is present in &quot;green tumor only&quot; animals, which is probably due to leakage of green signal in the red filters even after unmixing. This demonstrates that for this application accuracy in the separation of signals may be compromised. It would be helpful if the authors explain and comment in the Results and Discussion sections how they discriminate which red signal is representative of CAR T cells and which one is not. Is it maybe just necessary to image a &quot;green tumor only&quot; animal together with the CAR T cells treated one? This is important and need to be clarified for making readers able to reproduce the results.</p><p>3) In the proof of concept experiments author shows an image at day 6 in which CAR T cells highly proliferate in tumors so red and green signal originate mostly in the same location in the animals. An image at earlier time point in which CAR T cells are in lymph nodes (for example 1-24 hours after injection) will allow the reader to see red and green signals in different locations in the animals. This is a minor point but will better illustrate the power of the dual color technology for cancer immunotherapy studies.</p><p>4) In the Materials and methods (subsection “in vivo bioluminescence imaging”) the authors report that imaging acquisition time is 120 sec. How long is the imaging session then using all the filters? More than 20 minutes? And is the emission of the reporters stable during this time? A comment about the length of the imaging session should be added in the Discussion.</p><p>5) In Figure 5 the percentage of red or green injected cells should be added to the unmixed images of the animals. The figure will result then clearer and of immediate interpretation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have done an acceptable (though not ideal) job of revising this manuscript. It is in my opinion suitable for publication as a marginally impactful, yet solid report.</p><p>1) The manuscript needs editing from someone versed with the English language. For example, see incomplete sentence in Abstract (third sentence). As another example, though minor, the use of the word &quot;origins&quot; is awkward. The origin of luminescence emission is the photons released as a byproduct of the oxidative reaction between a luciferase and a luciferin substrate. The authors should consider an alternative word.</p><p>2) The report would benefit greatly if the authors were able to share more information about their substrate formulation, specifically for the in vivo experiments. What is the buffer? Are there any adverse effects from the substrate that the formulation was designed to address? What about solubility? Does it matter what you dissolve substrate in? In its current state I do not believe a reader could reproduce the in vivo experiments.</p><p>3) On another technical level, the final compound in the synthetic pathway does not appear to have been fully characterized: no HRMS and NMR spectra are in poor signal/noise ratio. The authors should consider taking advantage of the acidity of the N-acyl sulfomyl moiety, converting the final probe into its tertiary ammonium salt form to improve solubility and subsequently the quality of the NMR spectra.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45801.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please address if different ratios of the two enzymes expressed in one cell type be distinguished similarly to in different cells?

Due to the characterisation nature of this study, we always used 12-18 filters to ensure optimal spectral unmixing. However, we have performed further analysis of our in vitro data which has shown that even with a subset of these filters spectral unmixing of a similar accuracy can be achieved, meaning users only having access to systems with a limited set of bandpass filters will still be able to successfully use this dual-bioluminescence system (subsection “Spectral unmixing of firefly luciferase mutants in vitro”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please discuss how some of the best aspects of other published systems might be combined with the systems described here, for example, to do three colour BLI. Along these lines, in the second paragraph of the Discussion, is there a reason the click-beetle luciferase/naphthyl luciferin system wasn't used as benchmark? This system is mentioned in the Discussion and discounted for two-color work because of a broad emission peak. It does indeed have a broad peak, however, given the success of the spectral unmixing achieved in this study, we question whether the emission peak is so broad as to discount its use for multiplexing.</p></disp-quote><p>The potential use of this system for multi-coloured BLI has been discussed (Discussion, last two paragraphs), through the further mutagenesis of the Firefly luciferase protein to produce further colour mutants with iLH<sub>2</sub> in the near infrared. Additional comments have been added to the Discussion section addressing other potential uses of this system combined with already published systems.</p><p>The click-beetle luciferase/naphthyl luciferin system was reported too late to be used as a comparison in this work. Without these substrates been included in this work we do not want to make any comparisons with regards to its spectral unmixing capabilities compared to iLH<sub>2</sub> reported here. Additional comments have been added to the revised manuscript to clarify this (subsection “Spectral unmixing of firefly luciferase mutants in vitro”, Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The role of the structure in the study is not clear. The authors should better integrate the structural information or remove it to allow more of a focus on relevant information.

This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>Our multidisciplinary research team has been developing the near infrared dual colour imaging we present in this paper. We selected the journal <italic>eLife</italic> as it reports upon all aspects of the life sciences, to inform other researchers broadly in this field and at the periphery. We did not directly use this new structural information to derive improved novel luciferase mutants, as the focus of this work was to explore near-infrared bioluminescence imaging in vivo. In this particular work, the crystallisation and analysis of the luciferase/iLH<sub>2</sub> complex has provided important insights into our understanding the phenomenon of the near infrared emission from iLH<sub>2</sub>. For example, the Arg337 H-bonding pattern differences in our 6HPS structure (compared to 4G36 containing the native luciferin inhibitor) appear to be necessary to accommodate the phenolic OH group of iLH<sub>2</sub> in the same position as 4G36. It is interesting that a click beetle luciferase variant (CBR2), which contains an Arg to Ser mutation at equivalent residue 337, significantly red shifts the emission of an amino naphthyl analog that, like iLH<sub>2</sub>, is larger than native substrate luciferin ~ 65 nm.</p><p>In addition, other biological and physical scientists will find this informative and it will help others to design other near infrared bioluminescent emitters that will further bioluminescence imaging. We have added a sentence in the third paragraph of the Introduction and small addition to the Abstract to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The nature of the green and red mutants needs more description. It is assumed the green is the same as x11 + three additional mutations but it is not clear why this mutant was engineered. It is assumed that red is x11 + S284T + R354I (or is it E?) but it is not clear why this mutant was engineered. It is also a gap in the story that there isn't any biochemical analysis on these mutants (aside from spectra). Were they purified?</p></disp-quote><p>More description on the rationale for engineering luciferase mutants has been added to the revised manuscript (subsection “Spectral unmixing of firefly luciferase mutants in vitro”). The specific mutations contained in FLuc_green and FLuc_red are detailed in Materials and methods (subsection “Firefly luciferase mutants and cell lines”).As the mutations used have been previously reported (papers cited in manuscript), and the aim of this work was for use in vivo, all testing was carried out with the FLuc mutants expressed in the Raji B lymphoma cell line not with purified luciferases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Its surprising that the very low photon yield from the infraluciferin system can enable collection of a useable signal. Can the authors comment on how the signal for infraluciferin is processed and if any special care was needed regarding substrate concentration/availability, camera settings, exposure time, binning or other strategies to enhance signal to noise. Along these lines, the authors used iLH<sub>2</sub> concentration of 100mg/kg for their in vivo experiments. Could you go higher to enhance emission intensities? Is there toxicity data available, or would cost become a limitation?</p></disp-quote><p>The acquisition settings are stated in the Materials and methods section of the manuscript (subsection “In vivo model”). The only difference between imaging with LH<sub>2</sub> and iLH<sub>2</sub> is a longer acquisition time with iLH<sub>2</sub> (a time of 120s which was determined by initial imaging using automatic acquisition mode on the Living Image software (Perkin Elmer)). We used a concentration of 100mg/kg of iLH<sub>2</sub> for in vivo experiments to be consistent with the concentrations of LH<sub>2</sub> used for imaging of in vivo models. No specific toxicity experiments were performed, but no adverse side effects were observed with iLH<sub>2</sub> (subsections “In vitro bioluminescence assays” and “In vivo models”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have addressed the major issues raised in the preview round of review as clearly described in the rebuttal letter. The change in the title confers to the manuscript a clear focus on a specific application. However, the manuscript still require some improvement since some points need to be better clarified.</p><p>1) In the last paragraph of the subsection “Spectral characterisation of firefly luciferase mutants with LH<sub>2</sub> and iLH<sub>2</sub> in vivo” the authors comment that the relative intensities of the luciferases are comparable, thus the dynamic range of radiance values for both enzyme will be more similar giving a more accurate comparison of the process being monitored. The sentence results vague.</p></disp-quote><p>The sentence is a direct comparison of the relative intensities of Fluc_Green and Fluc_Red after administration of each substrate i.e. with LH<sub>2</sub> Fluc_Red had a much higher photon count than Fluc_Green but with iLH<sub>2</sub> the photon counts for Fluc_Red are similar to Fluc_Green and are therefore more comparable. I have added the wording in the subsection “Spectral unmixing of firefly luciferase mutants in vivo” to help make this clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example in the case one reporter is used under the control of a constitutive promoter and the second under a control of an inducible and much weaker promoter the fact that the luciferases have similar relative intensities would not help.</p></disp-quote><p>In our case both the Fluc_Green and Fluc_Red mutants have the same plasmid backbone and constitutive promotor, which is IRES. The cells have been also been sorted so that they are a 100% expressing population (see Materials and methods subsection “Firefly luciferase mutants and cell lines”). A study involving an inducible promotor would indeed lead to a reduction in expression compared to a constitutive promotor and therefore this would exhibit a similar presentation to LH<sub>2</sub> i.e. one reporter having a much higher photon count than the other which will affect the accuracy of the spectral unmixing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors proved that they could successfully separate in signals in cases where one reporter expression is around 10 times higher than the other (e.g. in the case of 90%/10% mixed population of cells). What happens if the expression is 99% and 1% for example? Will then the process be monitored with accuracy?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose known mixes of cell numbers that we were confident we could reliably count (in vitro) and inject (in vivo). The attenuation of green light is greater than red in biological tissue and therefore when Fluc_Green is shifted into the red by iLH<sub>2</sub> this attenuation is reduced, resulting in a more accurate% when compared to the known cell numbers. However, light attenuation is an inherent problem of optical imaging and is dependent on depth, which is why bioluminescence can only be considered semi-quantitative. We have therefore validated our images by obtaining cells after imaging from the bone marrow and performing flow cytometry, which again confirms that iLH<sub>2</sub> is more accurate than LH<sub>2</sub>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the proof of concept experiment using CAR T cells, the authors show that red signal is present in &quot;green tumor only&quot; animals, which is probably due to leakage of green signal in the red filters even after unmixing.</p></disp-quote><p>Mice are not imaged by a “green” and the “red” filter but through a sequence of 20 nm bandpass filter sets (for iLH<sub>2</sub> we use 12 filters over 590-830nm) to obtain the spectrum which is used by the deconvolution algorithm to spectrally unmix. There is no leakage of green signal in the red filters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This demonstrates that for this application accuracy in the separation of signals may be compromised. It would be helpful if the authors explain and comment in the Results and Discussion sections how they discriminate which red signal is representative of CAR T cells and which one is not. Is it maybe just necessary to image a &quot;green tumor only&quot; animal together with the CAR T cells treated one? This is important and need to be clarified for making readers able to reproduce the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Images 3 show the images obtained through each filter set and Image 4 shows the spectra obtained for Fluc_Green only when used to produce tumours in the systemic model. Figure 4 shows that Fluc_Green spectra when imaged as a single population provides distinctly different spectra than Fluc_Red. We therefore believe that the low level of “red” in the “green tumour only” mouse is most likely due to Fluc_Red photons from the treated mouse due its close proximity and sensitivity of the IVIS camera. I have therefore changed the wording of the sentence to “As would be expected, the tumour only control showed consistently high levels of FLuc_green signal which increased overtime compared to FLuc_red, which is likely due to the close proximity of Fluc_red photons emitted by the neighbouring treatment mouse.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the proof of concept experiments author shows an image at day 6 in which CAR T cells highly proliferate in tumors so red and green signal originate mostly in the same location in the animals. An image at earlier time point in which CAR T cells are in lymph nodes (for example 1-24 hours after injection) will allow the reader to see red and green signals in different locations in the animals. This is a minor point but will better illustrate the power of the dual color technology for cancer immunotherapy studies.</p></disp-quote><p>Although photons were detectable, images taken at day 1 after injection showed no Fluc_red signal. Whereas, images taken at day 3 showed Fluc_Red within the same regions as day 6 just at a lower level as indicated by the graph. This is due to the amount of CAR T cells initially injected and their expansion on CAR T cell activation. We injected 5x10<sup>6</sup> CAR T cells which when diluted</p><p>throughout the body was not high enough to produce a photon image at day 1 due to attenuation. However, once the CAR T cells targeted the Raji tumours the CAR T cell activation causes local expansion and recruitment, thus giving signal only in these areas.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the Materials and methods (subsection “in vivo bioluminescence imaging”) the authors report that imaging acquisition time is 120 sec. How long is the imaging session then using all the filters? More than 20 minutes? And is the emission of the reporters stable during this time? A comment about the length of the imaging session should be added in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Automatic acquisition was used for LH2 but 120 sec acquisition was used for iLH<sub>2</sub> as the light produced is dimmer. 12 filters were used for iLH<sub>2</sub> which takes 24 minutes. An open filter image was taken before and after to check that the total photon counts had not altered throughout this time. I have added the wording, “IVIS Spectrum (FOV 24, f/1, Medium (8)bin, automatic acquisition mode for imaging with LH<sub>2</sub>, FOV 24, f/1, Medium (8)bin, 120 s acquisition, total imaging time 24 mins for imaging with iLH<sub>2</sub>).” and “Open filter images were acquired prior to and post spectral imaging to confirm the stability of photon emission during spectral acquisition.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 5 the percentage of red or green injected cells should be added to the unmixed images of the animals. The figure will result then clearer and of immediate interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>The cell ratios are the same for all experiments and have therefore been represented by the green/red bars with the numbers on the corresponding graphs below. As the mice are not uniformly spaced adding the numbers to the bars gives the image a somewhat cluttered appearance and therefore even more confusing to the eye. For clarity we believe the diagram is better as is.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have done an acceptable (though not ideal) job of revising this manuscript. It is in my opinion suitable for publication as a marginally impactful, yet solid report.</p><p>1) The manuscript needs editing from someone versed with the English language. For example, see incomplete sentence in Abstract (third sentence). As another example, though minor, the use of the word &quot;origins&quot; is awkward. The origin of luminescence emission is the photons released as a byproduct of the oxidative reaction between a luciferase and a luciferin substrate. The authors should consider an alternative word.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their careful editorial eye.</p><p>- The sentence in the Abstract had been altered inadvertently and has been changed back to make a full sentence.</p><p>- We have changed the word ‘origin’ and have made a more accurate sentence ‘In this work, we explored the possible structural interactions in the enzyme that may account for the near infrared emission of iLH<sub>2</sub> and its application to dual-BLI’.</p><p>- I am an English native, a senior academic who has a log track record in publishing accurate and high impact papers. As far as my poof reading skills go, I cannot see any other mistakes or ambiguities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The report would benefit greatly if the authors were able to share more information about their substrate formulation, specifically for the in vivo experiments. What is the buffer? Are there any adverse effects from the substrate that the formulation was designed to address? What about solubility? Does it matter what you dissolve substrate in? In its current state I do not believe a reader could reproduce the in vivo experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Stock solutions of LH<sub>2</sub> or iLH<sub>2</sub> where made up in sterile PBS. Sterile PBS is the recommended solute for LH<sub>2</sub> for in vivo use although it can also be dissolved in sterile water. Using PBS we experience no solubility issues for iLH<sub>2</sub> as it dissolved on gentle mixing by inversion the same as LH<sub>2</sub>. I have added the wording, “For imaging of in vivo models, LH<sub>2</sub> and iLH<sub>2</sub>was solubilised in sterile PBS and animals were administered with substrate (2mg (or 100mg/kg) of either LH<sub>2</sub> or iLH<sub>2</sub> in 200μl or 400μl bolus respectively) via intraperitoneal (IP) injection.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) On another technical level, the final compound in the synthetic pathway does not appear to have been fully characterized: no HRMS and NMR spectra are in poor signal/noise ratio. The authors should consider taking advantage of the acidity of the N-acyl sulfomyl moiety, converting the final probe into its tertiary ammonium salt form to improve solubility and subsequently the quality of the NMR spectra.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer suggests a sensible method to try and get a more soluble compound. Unfortunately, we only have a few mg’s left and trying to form a salt on that scale would be virtually impossible. Repeating the synthesis is out of the question due to cost, time and restrictions on man power. I think the 1H NMR proves the identity of the product, especially bearing in mind the fully characterised starting material it is derived from. It is unfortunate we could not get a reasonable 13C NMR due to solubility issues. We also tried to obtain an accurate mass measurement under a variety of conditions and on different spectrometers, but did not obtain any M+ or sensible fragmentation that we could elucidate. This is unsatisfactory, however the precursor is fully characterised and there is no doubt of the compounds identity due to the 1H NMR and X-ray structure determination. I have added a sentence, “MS did not give M+ or meaningful fragment for accurate mass measurement”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
