Despite decades of research, understanding AD progression at the molecular level, especially at its early stages, remains elusive. Here, we identified several presymptomatic AD markers by investigating brain proteome changes over the course of neurodegeneration in a transgenic mouse model of AD (3×Tg-AD). We show that one of these markers, heme-binding protein 1 (Hebp1), is elevated in the brains of both 3×Tg-AD mice and patients affected by rapidly-progressing forms of AD. Hebp1, predominantly expressed in neurons, interacts with the mitochondrial contact site complex (MICOS) and exhibits a perimitochondrial localization. Strikingly, wildtype, but not Hebp1-deficient, neurons showed elevated cytotoxicity in response to heme-induced apoptosis. Increased survivability in Hebp1-deficient neurons is conferred by blocking the activation of the mitochondrial-associated caspase signaling pathway. Taken together, our data highlight a role of Hebp1 in progressive neuronal loss during AD progression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuron</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>Hebp1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CH 1385/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chua</surname><given-names>John JE</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001352</institution-id><institution>National University of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chua</surname><given-names>John JE</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chua</surname><given-names>John JE</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>International Max Planck Research School for Molecular Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yagensky</surname><given-names>Oleksandr</given-names></name><name><surname>Kohansal-Nodehi</surname><given-names>Mahdokht</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Increased levels of brain Hebp1 starting from the presymptomatic stage of Alzheimer’s disease contributes to progressive neuronal loss by triggering mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in neurons exposed to elevated heme.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to memory loss and cognitive decline. It is the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly and is projected to affect more than 40 million people worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">GBD , Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators et al., 2017</xref>). At the molecular level, AD is characterized by a disturbed metabolism of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides that results in formation of toxic oligomers and insoluble aggregates (plaques) in the brains of afflicted individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Selkoe and Hardy, 2016</xref>). AD pathology is also accompanied by formation of neurofibrillary tangles comprising of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau. Aβ deposits and phospho-tau-containing neurofibrils serve as molecular hallmarks of AD and are thus useful for histopathological diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vinters, 2015</xref>). However, the aggregation of Aβ and tau alone does not fully account for the cognitive decline observed in AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis et al., 1999</xref>). Although mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its proteases presenilin-1 and 2 have a causative relationship with the onset of familiar form of Alzheimer’s disease (FAD), overt manifestation of clinical AD is often preceded by a prolonged incubation period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ryman et al., 2014</xref>). This leads to recognition of AD as a complex multifaceted disorder that strongly depends on the intricate interplay between neuronal survival, synaptic function, activation of glial cells, inflammatory response, blood-brain barrier impairment and other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Strooper and Karran, 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, the knowledge of the biological processes that are first affected in AD remain limited. Identification of these processes will expand our understanding of early AD pathogenesis and may lay the ground for the development of more effective therapeutics in the future.</p><p>Changes in gene expression can be indicative of underlying physiological and pathological alterations during disease progression. Indeed, studies utilizing cDNA microarray, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry approaches to analyze such changes in human postmortem brain tissue have broadened our understanding of genes and proteins involved in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alkallas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Donovan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mathys et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moya-Alvarado et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Musunuri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Podtelezhnikov et al., 2011</xref>). While such studies provide important insights into molecular pathology at later stages, they offer limited information about prior alterations that occur over the course of the development of the disorder. In particular, early changes in protein expression preceding the clinical onset of the disease would be missed. Detection of such presymptomatic protein markers would not only aid the earlier diagnosis of afflicted individuals but also potentially enable the identification of early targets for therapeutic intervention.</p><p>To identify such markers, we probed for temporal changes in the brain proteome of 3×Tg-AD transgenic mice that harbor three mutated genes associated with the disease (<italic>PSEN1</italic> M146V, <italic>APP</italic> Swe, <italic>MAPT</italic> (tau) P301L). These mice develop Alzheimer-related phenotypes in a progressive manner mimicking the human disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oddo et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oddo et al., 2003b</xref>). Quantitative mass spectrometry was employed to compare the brain proteomes of 3×Tg-AD transgenic mice against age-matched controls at four time points corresponding to various stages of the disorder. Both age- and disease-dependent alterations could be observed in the brain proteome of 3×Tg-AD mice. Significantly, the analyses further revealed several potential presymptomatic protein markers that are differentially expressed between 3×Tg-AD and control mice. One of these markers, heme-binding protein-1 (Hebp1), is significantly elevated in the brains of both 3×Tg-AD mice and human patients exhibiting rapidly-progressing forms of AD. Hebp1 is primarily expressed in neurons where it is associated with mitochondria via the MICOS complex. Functionally, Hebp1 mediates heme-induced cytotoxicity via an apoptotic pathway. Thus, it is of relevance both as an early marker and contributing factor to the development of AD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Brain proteomes of wild-type and 3×Tg-AD mice exhibit age- and disease-related changes</title><p>To identify proteins involved in early stage AD, we monitored for changes in the brain proteomes of control and 3×Tg-AD mice at four different time points using label-free quantitative mass spectrometry.

Of these, only proteins that were identified in at least two out of four biological replicates for each group (disease or control) at each time point were used for further analyses. In this way, between 2414 and 2574 proteins were quantified depending on the time point. Pearson's correlation coefficients for quantified proteins between biological replicates were above 0.96 attesting to the high reproducibility of the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Principal component analysis of the datasets revealed that these proteins can be clustered according to age (component 1, 40.9% of total variation) as well as disease state (component 2, 18.3% of total variation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Notably, increasing difference between control and AD brain proteome could be observed with aging and disease progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The segregation by age was mainly driven by extracellular matrix proteins (Hapln2, Tnc, Acan, Vcan, Hapln1) and increased expression of microglia markers (S100b, Ctpd) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Many of these proteins have been previously reported as markers of brain aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sato and Endo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Végh et al., 2014</xref>). The samples segregated by principle component two varied primarily in the expression of AD-related genes. As expected, APP and tau (MAPT) were clustered together with proteins upregulated in AD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Relating proteome changes to biological processes in AD progression</title><p>To determine which biological processes were significantly affected with relation to disease progression, we subjected the dataset to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (QIAGEN Inc, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis">https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis</ext-link>). We grouped the processes based on the trend of their activation z-score at early (6 months, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), intermediate (12 months, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and late symptomatic time points (18 months, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Remarkably, cumulative upregulation in expression of proteins involved in cell death and apoptotic processes could already be detected at the first symptomatic time point (6 months) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Signatures of mitochondria dysfunction were also among the very first signs of altered AD proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Significant changes in regulation of proteins associated with seizures were also observed at the transition point between presymptomatic phase and 6 months which corresponds to the stage where changes in long-term potentiation (LTP) in 3×Tg-AD mice were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oddo et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Palop et al., 2007</xref>). Neurodegeneration-related processes (amyloid load of hippocampus, demyelination of axons and degradation of mitochondria) were also noticeably exacerbated with AD progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Notably, disturbance of the cytoskeleton, which is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative disorders including AD, became prominent only at the late stage of the disorder (18 months) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and correlated with the emergence of hyperphosphorylated tau in 3×Tg-AD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47498.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparative proteome analysis of 3×Tg-AD and control samples at different stages of AD.</title><p>(<bold>A, B, C</bold>) Activation of biological processes at different stages of the disease assessed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).

Interestingly, the proteins that are regulated by tau, APP and PSEN1 in our dataset largely overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Therefore, proteins demonstrating more than 50% change in expression level between disease and control that was statistically significant (t-test, p&lt;0.05) were shortlisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–G</xref>). Among these, groups of proteins involved in the same biological function could be identified. For instance, several proteins involved in mRNA processing (Hnrnpm, Hnrnpl, Nono, Matrin3) were strongly upregulated at the later time points. Remarkably, expression of these proteins increased gradually in coordinated manner throughout the progression of the disorder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). A similar coordinated expression pattern was also observed for the group of serine protease inhibitors (Serpina1c, Serpina3k, Mug1) which were significantly downregulated by the latest time point examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). This result is particularly interesting in light of recent findings linking a reduction in protease inhibitors levels to aging and cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castellano et al., 2017</xref>). We have also identified several inflammation-related proteins (C1qc, Ilf2, Igh-3) and components of myelin sheath (Mag, Mog) to be strongly up- or downregulated at the preterminal stage of the disorder (18 months). This hints towards progressive inflammation and demyelination in the analyzed 3×Tg-AD model which has been linked to AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wyss-Coray and Rogers, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhan et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Presymptomatic protein markers of AD</title><p>We further narrowed our analyses to focus on proteins with the strongest fold changes at the pre-symptomatic stage for two main reasons. First, these proteins could be useful as potential early markers indicative of disease onset. Second, they might be responsible for causing the initial pathogenic alterations. Thus, deciphering their function can help us better understand the initial cascade of events driving the onset of AD. We identified strongly up- or downregulated proteins at the 2 month time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) and corroborated the most prominent hits by immunoblotting against protein samples obtained from the respective 2-month-old animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Many of these presymptomatic markers maintained their expression levels across later time points in 3×Tg-AD mice, suggesting their relevance for the late stages of AD as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L,M</xref>). Noteworthy, half of the identified putative early markers were previously associated with AD or other neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

We further confirmed the interaction between Hebp1 with Mic60 by probing the immunoprecipitated complexes with their respective antibodies via immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Taken together these data indicate that Hebp1 locates in close proximity to the mitochondrial outer membrane where it interacts with MICOS complex potentially through association with outer mitochondria membrane proteins such as SAMM50 or Mtx2.

Dysregulation of proteins linked to heme metabolism has been reported in AD (Hani Atamna &amp; Frey, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schipper et al., 1995</xref>). Moreover, Aβ can form a complex with heme which possesses strong peroxidase and superoxide activities that can contribute to oxidative stress and cytotoxicity during AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atamna and Boyle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiziane et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ghosh et al., 2015</xref>). Accumulation of Aβ around brain vasculature results in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), microvessel destruction and leakage of free heme into brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiziane et al., 2018</xref>). Due to its strong hydrophobicity, heme is almost exclusively bound to carrier proteins within cells.

We wondered whether Hebp1 could protect neurons by acting as an intracellular heme buffer to maintain the latter at low levels. To test this hypothesis, we successfully eliminated expression of Hebp1 in rat hippocampal neurons using CRISPR/Cas9 using three different gRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, KO1-3).

Strikingly, Hebp1-deficient neurons exhibited no significant cell death. This effect was consistently observed in both the gRNA sequences used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, KO1 and KO2). Thus, contrary to our expectations, Hebp1 does not protect neurons from excessive heme. Rather, the protein apparently mediates its toxic effect. To confirm the specificity of heme as the inducer of Hebp1-dependent cell death, we also exposed the neurons to <italic>tert</italic>-butyl-hydroperoxide (stable analog of hydrogen peroxide) or staurosporine, both of which are known inducers of apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belmokhtar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). As expected, all 3 groups of neurons exhibited increased levels of cellular toxicity, confirming that loss of Hebp1 is protective towards hemin-induced cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). We also evaluated if over-expression of Hebp1 could affect cytotoxicity. Increased hemin-induced cytotoxicity was observed for Hebp1-EGFP expressing neurons as compared to EGFP-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, this increase did not reach statistical significance. Instead, statistically significant increases in cytotoxicity were observed when hemin concentrations were raised from 5 to 10 µM within the EGFP or EGFP-Hebp1 expressing group. These results indicate that endogenous levels of Hebp1 are sufficient to trigger neuronal cell death that is, in turn, influenced by heme concentrations.</p><p>As described in the preceding paragraphs, Hebp1 is localized to mitochondria via its interaction with the MICOS complex. Of note, Mic60 plays important roles in critical aspects of mitochondrial function and integrity and has been linked to mitochondrial-associated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Van Laar et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, reduction of Mic60 in cells has been associated with release of Cytochrome C (Cyt<sub>C</sub>) and increased sensitivity to apoptosis triggers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Release of Cyt<sub>C</sub>, often associated with loss of mitochondrial potential, is followed by Apaf1 activation and the ensuing conversion of procaspase 9 into caspase 9 and procaspase 3 into caspase 3, thereby committing the cells into apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Franklin and Robertson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zou et al., 1999</xref>). The interaction of Hebp1 with Mic60 suggests that Hebp1-dependent apoptosis in response to excess heme might be initiated at the mitochondria. Indeed, exposure of neurons to hemin decreases mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in wildtype, control as well as Hebp1-deficient neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). However, a steeper decrease in MMP was observed in Hebp1-deficient neurons (58.7 ± 2.83% and 60.9 ± 1.77% in KO1 and KO2 neurons) as compared to the other two groups (15.1 ± 2.77% and 14.1 ± 0.22% in wildtype and control neurons, respectively) strongly suggesting that effects on mitochondrial membrane potential alone cannot be the sole explanation for Hebp1’s role in causing neuronal apoptosis.</p><p>Indeed, using mitochondria isolated from these neurons, we observe that Cyt<sub>C</sub> was released from these organelles in all neurons (wildtype, control and Hebp1-deficient) treated with hemin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>), confirming that this step of mitochondria-associated apoptosis is not affected by loss of Hebp1 function. Strikingly, we observe that while procaspase 9 was cleaved in wildtype and control neurons upon hemin-treatment, the protein was not activated in Hebp1-deficient neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In agreement with this, hemin exposure caused a dramatic increase in the population of caspase 3<sup>+</sup>/7<sup>+</sup> cells in wildtype (58.5 ± 2.89%) and control neurons (62.4 ± 1.88%) but not in Hebp1-deficient neurons (8.69 ± 1.55% and 9.86 ± 2.09% in KO1 and KO2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>). Noteworthy, Hebp1, found almost exclusively in the mitochondrial fraction in untreated wildtype and control neurons, was released from the mitochondria of these neurons upon exposure to hemin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that release of mitochondrial Hebp1 in the presence of excessive heme is a critical trigger linking mitochondrial damage to neuronal apoptosis via activation of the procaspase 9 pathway. Interestingly, Mic60 was also released from mitochondria, but only in Hebp1-deficient cells, while Cox4 remained in the mitochondrial pellet for all groups of neurons. The significance of this remains unclear.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47498.020</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Neuronal cell death occurs by triggering mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway in Hebp1-expressing neurons.</title><p>Western blot analyses of (<bold>A and B</bold>) Cyt<sub>C</sub> and Mic60 leakages and (<bold>C</bold>) caspase 9 activation in Hebp1-deficient, wildtype and control neurons.

Concurrent exposure of these neurons to Aβ<sub>42</sub> and hemin caused an additional 2-fold increase in cytotoxicity (87.9 ± 1.04% for wildtype and 89.1 ± 0.63% for control neurons), an additive effect presumably caused by formation of an Aβ-heme complex that can contribute to oxidative stress and cytotoxicity during AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atamna and Boyle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiziane et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ghosh et al., 2015</xref>).

Even more significantly, cytotoxicity levels remained low even after concurrent treatment with Aβ<sub>42</sub> and hemin (22.9 ± 0.84% and 23.9 ± 0.84% in KO1 and KO2, respectively).

Of these, Hebp1 is consistently elevated in the brains of 3×Tg-AD mice from early stage of the disease and is also significantly increased in postmortem brains of patients affected by rapidly-progressing forms of AD. Hebp1 appears to be mainly expressed in neurons where it is associated with mitochondria via the MICOS complex. Strikingly, knockdown of Hebp1 expression in neurons protects them from both heme- and Aβ42-induced apoptosis, suggesting that Hebp1 plays a role in sensitizing neurons to cytotoxicity over the course of AD progression.</p><p>Our study indicated that proteins related to cell death, mitochondria function and seizures are among the first affected in AD. Alterations of cytoskeleton-related proteins became apparent only at the late stage of the disorder which coincides with the timeline of tau aggregation. Several proteins in our dataset exhibited gradual increases in expression that correlated with disease progression in 3×Tg-AD mice. These included proteins that are involved in mRNA processing such as Matrin-3 and Nono that form a complex involved in DNA damage response and recognition and retention of incorrectly processed mRNA in nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Salton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang and Carmichael, 2001</xref>). Similar expression patterns were detected for Hnrnpm and Hnrnpl, which regulate alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Passacantilli et al., 2017</xref>). Bai and colleagues have previously found U1 snRNP components to be enriched in insoluble brain proteome of AD patients and demonstrated impaired splicing of AD-related transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bai et al., 2013</xref>). While the role of mRNA processing and alternative splicing in AD has not been studied extensively, our observations point towards dysregulation of this process in 3×Tg-AD mice. We also observed that several inhibitors of serine proteases (serpins) appear to progressively decrease in expression during the monitoring period. Interestingly, a recent study of the hippocampal proteome in the 5 × FAD mouse model of AD also identified downregulation of serpins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gurel et al., 2018</xref>). Protease inhibitors hold a potential as therapeutic targets since their levels in the brain can be restored through injection of recombinant protein. This approach was recently tested with metalloprotease inhibitor TIMP2 which was injected intraperitoneally to reach the brain and improve the cognitive function of aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castellano et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The present study uncovered two proteins, Hebp1 and Glo1, that were highly elevated already at the presymptomatic stage in 3×Tg-AD mice, suggesting that they could be of potential relevance as early AD markers. Both proteins were also expressed at significantly higher levels - particularly in rapidly progressing cases of AD - indicating that they could be of use to identify this group of patients. While Glo1 has been previously linked to neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">More et al., 2013</xref>), our study is the first to report the involvement of Hebp1 in AD.</p><p>According to our data, Hebp1 is predominantly expressed in neurons in both wild-type and 3×Tg-AD mice where it is associated with mitochondria via interaction with the MICOS complex. Interestingly, Mic60, a component of the MICOS complex that binds Hebp1, is also an important player in cell death. Loss of Mic60 increases the rate of apoptosis due to dissipation of cristae junctions and intensifies leakage of Cyt<sub>C</sub> from mitochondria to cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, SOUL, a homolog of Hebp1, promotes cell death presumably through permeabilization of mitochondria membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Szigeti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Szigeti et al., 2010</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that Hebp1 itself could also be involved in causing cellular toxicity.</p><p>What implications might heme-mediated cell death have for AD? Loss of neurons is a key event leading to cognitive decline in AD and is mainly attributed to intensified apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cotman and Su, 1996</xref>). Overexpression of proteins counteracting apoptotic response has been previously shown to decrease pathology in 3×Tg-AD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rohn et al., 2008</xref>). Degradation of heme by heme oxygenase-1 was demonstrated to reduce cytotoxicity caused by Aβ1–42 peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hettiarachchi et al., 2014</xref>). Heme synthesis is impaired in AD and accumulation of immature heme species can be a potential source of heme overload (Hani Atamna &amp; Frey, 2004). Excessive heme can also come from circulating blood. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy contributes significantly to AD both in human and the 3×Tg-AD model starting from the early stage of the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ghiso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li and Praticò, 2015</xref>). Moreover, pathophysiological changes in brain vasculature have also been reported in 3×Tg-AD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grammas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, CAA may lead to disruption of brain vasculature and release of heme outside the vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiziane et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Natté et al., 2001</xref>) and is also associated with apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fossati et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mattson, 2000</xref>). Collectively, these data highlight a possible link between impairments of heme metabolism, neuronal loss and increased expression of Hebp1 early in AD.</p><p>In agreement with this, we observe that Hebp1 is intimately involved in heme-induced neuronal death. Indeed, while neurons expressing Hebp1 showed dramatically elevated levels of cell death, Hebp1-deficient neurons were resistant to hemin-induced apoptosis. Likewise, neuronal cell death via apoptosis triggered upon exposure to Aβ<sub>42</sub> was also significantly attenuated in Hebp1-deficient neurons. Remarkably, Hebp1 sits at a critical, albeit currently unknown, position between upstream activating events (mitochondrial membrane potential changes and Cyt<sub>C</sub> leakage) and the initiation of the caspase cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galluzzi et al., 2018</xref>). In Hebp1-deficient neurons, loss of Hebp1 and the consequent lack of release of the protein into the cytosol halted the activation of caspases 9 and 3/7 in spite of the occurrence of upstream activating events, suggesting that it could play a role in regulating apoptosome formation which is vital in cleaving procaspase 9 to its functional form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Saleh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zou et al., 1999</xref>). The significance accompanying the observed concurrent release of Mic60 in Hebp1-deficient neurons observed in response to hemin-treatment remains unclear despite reduced levels of Mic60 being linked to Cyt<sub>C</sub> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). This would be an important subject for further studies.</p><p>Hebp1 might also play further roles in AD pathology in addition to its newly uncovered functions in this study. Two previous publications demonstrated that N-terminal cleavage of Hebp1 by cathepsin D results in generation of 21 amino acid long peptide called F2L that is capable of binding FPRL1/FPR2 receptor on the surface of mouse neutrophils and promote their migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Devosse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gao et al., 2007</xref>). In the mouse brain, FPR2 is expressed predominantly by activated microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cui et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, FPRL1-positive microglia was shown to be recruited to Aβ plaques in AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Le et al., 2001</xref>). In our dataset, expression of the Hebp1 protease cathepsin D also strongly correlates with aging which indicates the possibility of the progressive F2L accumulation in 3×Tg-AD mice with age. Increased expression of cathepsin D in hippocampus of AD patients was also reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hondius et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, it is possible that cleavage of Hebp1 by cathepsin D in neurons may additionally generate the soluble F2L peptide to recruit activated microglia and modulate inflammatory response during AD.</p><p>Overall, our results provide a quantitative proteome map of AD progression in the 3×Tg-AD transgenic mouse model and identify several novel protein candidates that could serve as putative presymptomatic markers of the disease. These data can serve as a starting point to allow for a more thorough investigation of these markers in relation to their roles in AD pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oddo et al., 2003b</xref>), and control B6;129 (129/sv C57bl6 WT) mice were used for the experiments. For preparation of primary neurons, Wistar rats originated from the local animal facility were used. All animals were maintained under 12L/12D cycle with food and water ad libitum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sample collection for mass spectrometry</title><p>Whole brains of male mice (both control and 3×Tg-AD) were collected at 2, 6, 12 and 18 months of age in four biological replicates. Half of the brain was immersion-fixed with 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde and used for the immunohistochemical analysis. The other half was homogenized by a glass-Teflon homogenizer (RW20-DZM, IKA) in 3 ml ice-cold homogenization buffer (containing protease/phosphatase inhibitors, Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA, 88669) at 900 rpm for nine strokes. Thereafter, the homogenate was centrifuged for 2 min at 3000 × <italic>g</italic>, 4°C in S100AT4 rotor (SORVALL) to remove cell debris. Next, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and additionally centrifuged for 12 min at 14500 × <italic>g</italic> in S100AT4 rotor at 4°C to obtain the soluble fraction of brain proteins (supernatant).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Mass spectrometry sample preparation and measurement</title><p>The protein concentration of the samples was measured by Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 40 µg of protein were used for proteomic analysis. Proteins were precipitated with four volumes of ice-cold acetone overnight at −20°C. The protein pellet was resuspended in 1% RapiGest (Waters, 186002123) and incubated in thermoshaker at 60<bold>°</bold>C for 15 min at 1050 rpm. The disulfide bonds were reduced by 10 mM dithiothreitol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA, 20290) (60<bold>°</bold>C for 45 min at 1050 rpm) and alkylated by 25 mM chloroacetamide (Sigma, Steinheim, Germany, 22790) (37<bold>°</bold>C for 30 min at 750 rpm). Proteins were then digested by trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA, V5113, 1:20, trypsin to protein ratio) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, for 16 hr. Digestion was stopped by addition of 1% formic acid (37<bold>°</bold>C for 1 hr with shaking at 750 rpm) and the peptide solution was cleared by centrifugation (for 30 min at 21800 × <italic>g</italic> at 4<bold>°</bold>C).

Peptides were loaded onto a trap column packed in-house (100 µm ID ×30 mm self-packed with Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ 1.9 μm, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany) and separated at a flow rate of 300 nl/min on an analytical column (75 µm ID ×300 mm self-packed with Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 μm, Dr. Maisch HPLC GmbH). Peptides were eluted from the column with 5–76% linear gradient of increasing buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.08% formic acid in water) and decreasing buffer A (0.1% FA in water) with an overall run-time of 90 min. Separated peptides were ionized by electrospray ionization source in a positive ion mode. Full-scan MS spectra were acquired in the range of 350–1550 m/z at a resolution of 60,000 units. The top speed method was selected for fragmentation in the collision cell with Higher-energy Collisional Dissociation with the normalized collision energy of 30% and isolation window of 1.2 m/z.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data processing and bioinformatics analysis</title><p>Acquired MS spectra were processed using the MaxQuant software package version 1.5.0.25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>).

MaxQuant search was configured as follows: the mass tolerance was set to 20 and 4.5 ppm for the first and the main peptide search, respectively; the multiplicity was set to one; Trypsin/P was fixed as protease and maximum of 2 missed cleavages were allowed; carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as fixed modification and methionine oxidation as well as N-terminal acetylation were specified as variable modifications; a false discovery rate of 1% was applied; the re-quantification and match between runs options (Match time window 0.7 min, Alignment time window 20 min) were enabled.</p><p>The Protein Groups output file from the MaxQuant was processed by ‘Perseus’, version 1.5.5.3 for downstream data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>). For each time point, proteins identified in at least two out of four biological replicates in both control and disease group were selected for further analysis. Reverse hits were removed. For Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the LFQ intensities (Label-Free Quantification) were log<sub>2</sub> transformed and averaged by group. PCA was performed in ‘Perseus’ with number of clusters set to five and Benjamini-Hochberg FDR cut-off of 0.05. For the downstream proteomics analysis, the LFQ intensities of proteins reported by MaxQuant were log<sub>10</sub> transformed. The AD/Control intensity ratio for each protein was calculated and log<sub>2</sub> transformed. Proteins with AD/Control ratios showing a statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>-value&lt;0.05; two-sample t-test) fold-change of more than 1.5 or less than 0.667 were selected for further analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–G</xref>).

In brief, for the preparation of cryosections, one half of the dissected whole brain was fixed in 4% PFA for 4 hr at 4°C and washed in PBS three times for 20 min each. Tissues were immersed in 15% sucrose in PBS (1 hr), followed by 30% sucrose in PBS (overnight) and finally in 50% tissue freezing medium (Tissue Tek, Leica) in 30% sucrose for 1 hr. Tissue was embedded in the freezing medium, frozen at −20°C and preserved at −80°C until use.</p><p>For paraffin sections, whole brains of 12-month-old mice were fixed in 4% PFA overnight, washed in PBS three times (20 min each) and subsequently immersed in 0.98% NaCl for 1 hr. The tissues were then dehydrated in a stepwise series of ethanol dilutions (50%, 70%, 90%, 95%, 100%), cleared in the ascending toluene/isopropanol dilution series and finally embedded in paraffin.</p><p>Immunostainings were performed on 10 µm thick cryo-sections. Sections were washed three times in PBS and blocked in 10% FCS and 0.5% Triton-X100 in PBS for 60 min at room temperature. Slides were incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4°C in blocking solution followed by three washes in PBS (10 min each) and incubation with secondary antibodies (1: 750) for 60 min at room temperature. Finally, sections were rinsed in PBS three times (10 min) and mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA, VEC-H-1500). Additional 8 µm thick paraffin sections were used for IBA1/Hebp1 co-staining. Prior to the staining, paraffin sections were hydrated through descending ethanol series and boiled for one minute in unmasking solution (1:100 in water, Vector Laboratories).</p><p>The following primary antibodies were used for immunostainings: rabbit Hebp1 (1:100, Invitrogen, PA5-30609), rat Ctip2 (1:100, Abcam, ab18465), mouse GFAP (1:500, Synaptic Systems, 173 011), mouse GFAP (1:250, Sigma, C9205), guinea pig IBA-1 (1:100, Synaptic Systems, 134 004) and guinea pig NeuN (1:200, Synaptic Systems, 266 004). Secondary antibodies against rabbit, mouse, rat or guinea pig were conjugated either with Alexa488 or Alexa594 dye and were acquired from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA.

Empty FUGW vector was used as a negative control for overexpression of EGFP. For production of lentiviral particles, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the FUGW-Hebp1/FUGW plasmid, and the helper plasmids psPax2 (a gift from Didier Trono, Addgene plasmid #12260) and pCMV-VSV-G (a gift from Bob Weinberg, Addgene, plasmid #8454) in a 2:1:1 ratio using Lipofectamine 2000. Medium was changed 6 hr after transfection to DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and 5 mM sodium butyrate. Culture supernatant was harvested 24 hr and lentiviruses concentrated by ultracentrifugation via Amicon Ultra-15 filters (Millipore, UFC910024). Concentrated lentiviruses were diluted to the final volume of 1 mL in DMEM/F12 medium, aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until use. Only lentivirus preparations resulting in transduction rate of at least 90% (assessed by EGFP overexpression) were used for experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Live imaging of mitochondria</title><p>Primary rat hippocampal neurons were infected with lentiviruses overexpressing Hebp1-EGFP one day after seeding and analyzed at DIV14. Briefly, cells were incubated with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Life Technologies, Rockford, IL, USA, M5712) in plating medium at final concentration of 10 nM for minimum of 30 min. Cells were then imaged in Tyrode’s solution (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, 130 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 48 mM glucose) using Zeiss Observer 1 laser scanning confocal microscope within 30 min period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Identification of Hebp1 binding partners</title><p>Proteins interacting with Hebp1 were identified using co-immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry in four independent biological experiments. Primary rat cortical neurons were infected with lentiviruses expressing Hebp1-EGFP or EGFP one day after seeding. Neurons were lysed at DIV14 with NP-40 lysis buffer. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. Hebp1-EGFP and EGFP were pulled down using GFP-trap according to manufacturer’s instructions. Beads were sequentially washed in lysis buffer containing descending concentrations of NP-40 (1%, 0.8%, 0.4%, 0.2%). Proteins were eluted by boiling the beads at 95°C for 10 min in 1 × NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer and separated on 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NP0342). Gels were stained with Coomassie solution overnight and destained in deionized water for two days. Each lane was cut into six equal pieces and in-gel protein digestion was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shevchenko et al., 1996</xref>). Peptides extracted from each gel piece were measured three times in independent technical repetitions.</p><p>The digested peptides were subjected to Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with an Ultimate 3000 RSLC system (Dionex, USA). Peptides were separated on a self-made capillary column (ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 µm, Dr. Maisch GmbH, 300 × 0.075 mm; C18 pre-column from Thermo Fisher (160454)) with a 5–42% linear gradient of increasing buffer B (80% ACN, 0.08% FA) and decreasing buffer A (0.1% FA in water) for an overall run time of 58 min at a constant flow rate of 300 nl/min. Separated peptides were ionized by electrospray ionization source in a positive ion mode. Full-scan MS spectra were acquired in the range of 350–1600 m/z at the resolution of 60,000 units. The top 30 most abundant precursors were selected for fragmentation in the collision cell with Higher-energy Collisional Dissociation with the normalized collision energy of 30% and isolation window of 1.6 m/z. Max quant search was performed with the same parameters used for brain proteome analysis.</p><p>Perseus software was used for downstream data analysis. The intensities of identified proteins were log<sub>2</sub> transformed and the missing values for identified proteins in each replicate were imputed with the width of 0.3 and downshift of 1.8 in the total matrix mode. Log<sub>2</sub> difference between Hebp1-EGFP and EGFP samples was calculated for each identified protein and was averaged between technical and biological replicates. Statistical significance of protein enrichment in each sample was determined by one-sample t-test (p&lt;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Generation of Hebp1 knockout neurons by CRISPR/Cas9 system</title><p>sgRNAs (<named-content content-type="sequence">5’-CCCAGCATGGTGACGCCGTG-3’</named-content> (KO1); <named-content content-type="sequence">5’-TGGCAGGTTCTAAGCACCGG-3’</named-content> (KO2); <named-content content-type="sequence">5’-CCGGTGCTTAGAACCTGCCCA-3’</named-content> (KO3)) targeting rat Hebp1 were designed using sgRNA Designer (Broad Institute). The pLenti-CRISPR-Hebp1-KO vectors were generated by inserting the sgRNAs into the LentiCRISPRv2 plasmid at the BsmBI site. The LentiCRISPRv2 plasmid is a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene, plasmid #52961). To obtain Hebp1 knockout neurons, cells were infected individually with lentiviruses generated from the respective pLenti-CRISPR-Hebp1-KO constructs targeting distinct rat sequences of Hebp1 (KO1, KO2 and KO3 sgRNAs) and subsequently tested for Hebp1 expression by immunoblotting. Control neurons were infected with lentiviruses generated from pLenti-CRISPR-Luc vector containing sgRNA targeting luciferase. Control, knockout and wild-type neurons were utilized for further experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cell viability and apoptosis assays</title><p>Neurons were seeded on black 96-well plates (Corning Costar, 3603) at a density of 7 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Cell toxicity was assessed using MultiTox-Glo reagent (Promega, G9270) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cytotoxicity was measured by activity of dead-cell protease (luminescent readout) and was normalized to cell viability measured by the activity of live-cell protease (fluorescent readout) to account for discrepancies in cell number between the wells. Final cytotoxicity values are presented as a fold change of corresponding vehicle control. Cells were treated with 10 µM hemin (Sigma, 51289), 25 µM <italic>tert</italic>-butyl-hydroperoxide (Sigma, 458139) or 1 µM staurosporine (Santa Cruz, sc-3510). Hemin was always freshly prepared in accordance with a protocol published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atamna et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Apoptosis was assessed by measurement of caspase 3/7 activity using CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green Detection Reagent (Sigma, C10723). Briefly, Caspase-3/7 Green Detection Reagent was added simultaneously to cells exposed to hemin alone, 10 µM Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers alone or hemin together with Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers. Cells were fixed and quantified 24 hr later. Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers (Abcam, ab120301) were freshly prepared according to a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ryan et al., 2013</xref>). Images were acquired from five non-overlapping fields of each well with 20 × objective, Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 Microscope equipped with a motorized stage (DAPI, GFP and Cy3 channel). Cells positive for Caspase-3/7 activity (GFP-positive) were quantified manually as a proportion of total number of cells (DAPI-positive). Each experiment was performed at least in three independent biological repetitions with three technical replicates for each condition.</p><p>Mitochondrial membrane potential was assayed with the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Assay kit (Cell Signaling, 13296) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Briefly, potentiometric fluorescent TMRE dye (final concentration 200 nM) was added to neurons twenty‐four hours after hemin treatment. Fluorescence was measured 30 min after with Tecan reader (Infinite 200 PRO series) plate reader using 550 nm and 615 nm excitation and emission filters, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Mitochondria isolation</title><p>Isolation of respective crude mitochondrial fractions from wild-type, Hebp1-deficient and control rat hippocampal neurons was followed using a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wieckowski et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, neurons were seeded at a density of 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells in T-25 flasks (Corning, C7046). After lentiviral exposure for 7 days, neurons were washed with PBS prior to trypsin treatment for 2 min. Following cell detachments, respective neurons were spun down and resulting cell pellets were resuspended in PBS for another centrifugation. Corresponding cell pellets were then dissolved in a buffer (225 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM EGTA and 30 mM Tris-HCl; pH, 7.4) and homogenized using a Teflon pestle (Sigma, Singapore, P7734) with 20 strokes. Respective homogenates obtained were spun down for supernatant collection. Further centrifugation of the supernatants at a higher speed gave rise to respective cytosolic (supernatant) and mitochondrial portions (pellet), which were lysed and subjected to protein analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Proteomic data were analyzed as described in the section ‘Data processing and bioinformatics analysis’.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael R Kreutz (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a nice study that is motivated to gain a better understanding of the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yagensky et al. have searched for potential presymptomatic markers by examining early brain proteome changes in an AD mouse model relative to age-matched controls. The authors identify heme-binding protein-1 (Hebp1) as a novel dysregulated protein, which is highly elevated in 3×Tg mice by 6 months of age at a time when synaptic plasticity defects are known to become apparent; Hebp1 is also found elevated in brains of patients with rapidly progressive forms of AD. Notably, Hebp1 knock-down greatly attenuates heme-induced cytotoxic cell death, suggesting that elevated levels of Hebp1 exacerbate heme-dependent cell death. Overall, the main strengths of the study are the identification of Hebp1 as a novel protein implicated in neurodegeneration in AD and determining a neuronal function for Hebp1 in mediating heme-induced cytotoxicity. While these findings are of general interest, there are some issues that warrant careful consideration. A compelling experimental support for the claim of Hebp1 as a presymptomatic marker for AD is lacking, and the causal relationship between elevated Hebp1 and neurodegeneration in AD remains to be established. Moreover, there are technical weaknesses in data presentation/description/statistical analysis in the manuscript as it stands.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In order to relate Hebp1 dysregulation to neurodegeneration phenotype of 3×Tg AD mouse model/AD patients the following points need to be addressed:</p><p>1) Test whether overexpression of Hebp1 in neurons increases heme-induced cytotoxicity.</p><p>2) Test whether knock-down of Hebp1 expression is neuroprotective against Aβ-induced cytotoxicity.</p><p>3) Determine if heme is elevated in 3×Tg AD mice. The proposed role for Hebp1 as a presymptomatic marker for AD is not necessarily consistent with its role in cell death that occurs at later stages of AD. A stronger evidence for dysregulation of Hebp1 at earlier stages needs to be shown (or otherwise do not refer to Hebp1 as a presymptomatic marker for AD):</p><p>4) Perform western blots of Hebp1 in control and 3×Tg-AD mice brains at 2 months of age using at least 3 animals per group, with the expectation of elevated Hebp1 in 3×Tg mice relative to controls.</p><p>5) Perform western blots for Hebp1 in brains from control and those suffering from mild cognitive impairment.</p><p>Additional technical issues that require careful consideration are as follows:</p><p>6) Figure 5. Panels A,B – There is no substantial enrichment in Hebp1 and relatively big contamination with tubulin. One cannot conclude a specific association with mitochondria based on this data. Panels C-H – High-resolution imaging and/or negative control should be included to demonstrate that the co-localization pattern of Hebp1-GFP and Mitotracker is not random. In panel E, where is the area shown at higher resolution taken from? There seems to be appreciable number of Hebp1-GFP puncta that are not associated with mitochondria. Additional markers for endosomes and the plasma membrane in the subcellular fractionation and/or images would be helpful.</p><p>7) The authors refer to a previous publication with patient information. However, it would be helpful to have this information in this manuscript. Can the authors provide data on APOE4 status? How were the individuals diagnosed with AD? Was AD confirmed pathologically? What was the postmortem interval for the brains?</p><p>8) Please provide the N's for each experiment. For example:</p><p>- In Figure 1—figure supplement 1, it is clear 4 individual brains were analyzed for pTau. It is also clear that 9 control, 8 slow progressing and 8 rapid progressing AD brain were analyzed for Hebp1 levels. But, beyond that, it is hard to tell what the N's are. Does replicate mean individual brains or 1 brain split into 4 samples?</p><p>- Figure 5 is missing the information about the number of replicates.</p><p>9) Appropriate statistical tests should be performed.</p><p>- For the proteomics data, why was a Student's test performed and not a 2 factor ANOVA with genotype and time as factors?</p><p>- In Figure 3, a Student's t test after an ANOVA is not appropriate; a Bonferroni correction is required to account for multiple comparisons.</p><p>- In Figure 3—figure supplement 2, why does the data for Hebp1 transcripts appear so bimodal – in both the controls and AD cases. How were the statistics performed? A Student's t test would not be appropriate here since the data does not appear to be normally distributed.</p><p>10) The relevant brain region used for the experiment needs to be described:</p><p>- Figure 1—figure supplement 1C – from which brain region the extracts have been prepared?</p><p>- Figure 4B – which cortical area?</p><p>11) Figure 4. For images of the hippocampus, zoomed out images should be shown and also at higher resolution. In panel C, it would be helpful to have higher magnification images to show Hebp 1 localization in neurons and not in glia.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Increased expression of heme-binding protein 1 early in Alzheimer's disease is linked to neurotoxicity&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Huda Zoghbi (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been greatly improved with additional experiments and careful editing. However, the following issue needs to be addressed before acceptance.</p><p>Figure 5. The claim for specific association of Hebp1 to mitochondria is still not compellingly supported by the imaging data shown. To compare the relative distributions of Hebp1-EGFP vs. soluble EGFP with respect to Mitotracker, panels E and F should present data for at least 7 microns, similarly to panel D, and all in the same scale. The text subsection “Hebp1 interacts with mitochondrial contact 240 site complex” should be toned down to reflect the data. The images show that Hebp1 &quot;can be&quot; associated to mitochondria, and whether a &quot;substantial proportion&quot; of Hebp1-EGFP is closely juxtaposed to Mitotracker remains to be justified. Is there a reason for not assessing the subcellular localization of endogenous Hebp1 using immunofluorescence labelling (as has been done for hippocampal sections)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47498.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In order to relate Hebp1 dysregulation to neurodegeneration phenotype of 3×Tg AD mouse model/AD patients the following points need to be addressed:</p><p>1) Test whether overexpression of Hebp1 in neurons increases heme-induced cytotoxicity.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we evaluated whether Hebp1 overexpression could increase heme-induced cytotoxicity in neurons. Briefly, DIV1 hippocampal neurons were infected with lentiviruses expressing either EGFP alone or Hebp1-EGFP. Seven days after transduction, the neurons were treated with 5 or 10 μM of hemin or vehicle only. Cell toxicity was assessed 24 hours after the treatment using the RealTime-Glo assay (Promega). The results shown below were obtained from 6 independent experiments.</p><p>The results indicate that more cytotoxicity was present in Hebp1-EGFP expressing neurons as compared to EGFP expressing neurons for each hemin concentrated used. However, significantly more cytotoxicity was observed when hemin concentrations were increased from 5 to 10 μM within each group. These results support the CRISPR-Cas9 data showing that Hebp1 expression is required for heme-mediated cytotoxicity while indicating that endogenous levels of Hebp1 are sufficient to mediate heme-induced cytotoxicity. The extent of cytotoxicity depends, instead, on the concentration of heme that the neurons are exposed to. This finding is highly significant given that vascular damage progressively worsens over the course of AD progression which, in turn, contribute to rising heme levels that will ultimately contribute to progressive neuronal loss (Ghiso et al., 2010). Nevertheless, we still do not completely understand why elevation of Hebp1 levels occurs at the early phase of the disease. We have included these results as supplemental data (Figure 7—figure supplement 1) and have modified the text accordingly to describe and discuss these results (subsection “Hebp1 facilitates heme-mediated cytotoxicity”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Test whether knock-down of Hebp1 expression is neuroprotective against Aβ-induced cytotoxicity.</p></disp-quote><p>We exposed control and Hebp1-KO hippocampal neurons to Aβ42 with or without co-exposure to hemin and evaluated cytotoxicity by quantifying the population of caspase 3<sup>+</sup>/7<sup>+</sup> cells. Exposure of wildtype and LUC neurons to Aβ42 triggers cytotoxicity in approximately 40% of the neurons. Co-exposure of neurons to heme and Aβ42 further elevated this to approximately 88%, indicative of an additive effect. Remarkably, Hebp1-KO neurons consistently demonstrated significantly lower cytotoxicity in all 3 treatments (heme;~9%, Aβ42;~7%, Aβ42+Heme;~23%). This demonstrates that knockdown of Hebp1 also protects against Aβ-induced cytotoxicity. Since Aβ42 also induces neuronal apoptosis, these results suggest that Hebp1 participates in shared pathways triggered by Aβ and heme that cause neuronal cell death. These new results have been inserted as Figure 9 in the revised manuscript. Additional text has also been inserted to describe and discuss these results (subsection “Hebp1 facilitates heme-mediated cytotoxicity”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Determine if heme is elevated in 3×Tg AD mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that determination of increased heme would be an important issue to address. However, detection of heme elevation during the early (asymptomatic) phase of AD in the brains of these animals, which would be pertinent to this study, is difficult. Such minute early aberrations are likely to be confined mostly within the local microenvironment and below the detection limit of most assays. Moreover, low levels of heme at this stage would probably be masked by contaminating heme leftover from microscopic quantities of residual red blood cells (RBCs) or from partial lysis of RBCs during tissue preparation. Although more refined methods for detecting and measuring heme have been reported, these techniques are not readily available to us and are unfortunately not possible to establish within the given time frame.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have highlighted that cerebral amyloid angiopathy contributes significantly to pathology in the 3×Tg-AD model starting from the early stage of the disorder (Li and Praticò, 2015). Furthermore, pathophysiological changes in brain vascular have also been reported in these animals by other independent studies, correlating with those seen in afflicted humans (Grammas et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2014). Hence, we reason that heme would also be elevated in these mice. We have modified the Discussion section to include the observations on vascular pathology in 3×Tg-AD mice.</p><p>We hope these modifications and considerations now better clarify the relationship between Hebp1 dysregulation and neurodegeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The proposed role for Hebp1 as a presymptomatic marker for AD is not necessarily consistent with its role in cell death that occurs at later stages of AD. A stronger evidence for dysregulation of Hebp1 at earlier stages needs to be shown (or otherwise do not refer to Hebp1 as a presymptomatic marker for AD):</p><p>4) Perform western blots of Hebp1 in control and 3×Tg-AD mice brains at 2 months of age using at least 3 animals per group, with the expectation of elevated Hebp1 in 3×Tg mice relative to controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting this and would like to note that these data were indeed included in previous manuscript as Figure 2K. Four biological replicates each from 2-month-old control and 3×Tg-AD mice were presented. We apologise for not indicating this clearly and have revised the figure legend to highlight this more prominently.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Perform western blots for Hebp1 in brains from control and those suffering from mild cognitive impairment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed this issue extensively with several collaborators including Dr Oliver Wirths (University Medical Center, Goettingen), an AD expert. While we agree with the reviewers that it will be insightful to look into Hebp1 levels in MCI patients, it is extremely difficult to obtain postmortem samples from these patients for technical reasons. The samples have to be obtained from patients already included in a neurodegenerative disorder study (for clinical documentation of MCI) that have expired due to non-cerebral pathological causes and this has to have happened close to the inclusion date. The chances for this to coincide are very slim and such patients were not available to us in this study.</p><p>Collectively, we hope that these modifications and responses (together with those listed earlier) have helped provide stronger evidence for dysregulation of Hebp1 at the earlier stages, and to better reconcile the observation of Hebp1 as an early AD marker with its role in causing progressive neuronal death in AD. Indeed, our hypothesis is that an early increase in Hebp1 could serve a neuroprotective function by, for example, eliminating small populations of damaged neurons. However, subsequent more massive activation of this mechanism (e.g. via progressive accumulation of excessive heme over a larger area at later stages of AD) would then contribute to the progressive neuronal loss during these later phases. Hence, early elevation of Hebp1 (and thus by definition a presymptomatic marker) would not be necessarily inconsistent with its role in contributing to cell death at later stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional technical issues that require careful consideration are as follows:</p><p>6) Figure 5.

Additional markers for endosomes and the plasma membrane in the subcellular fractionation and/or images would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting this and agree that there is indeed a noticeable amount of tubulin in Figure 5A and B. Nevertheless, we wish to draw the reviewers’ attention to the data presented in Figure 8A and B where mitochondrial isolation experiments were also performed, albeit using an improved procedure. Here, the substantial enrichment of Hebp1 in the mitochondrial (Mt) fraction versus the cytosol (S) fraction obtained from control untreated neurons can be readily observed with only minute quantities of cytosolic Hebp1 (e.g. Figure 8A left panel). Importantly, no tubulin contamination of the mitochondrial fraction was detected. Likewise, mitochondrial markers CytC and Cox4 were only detected in the mitochondrial fraction. In the revised manuscript we have updated Figure 5B (previously Figure 5A) with results obtained from the modified mitochondria isolation procedure to show that Hebp1 is indeed substantially enriched in mitochondrial fractions and that tubulin is not detectable in these preparations. We have also additionally probed for markers of the endosomal, lysosomal, synaptic and plasma membrane compartments (Rab5, Rab6, LAMP1, VAMP2 and Syntaxin 1) in our mitochondrial preparations using the improved procedure. We confirm that Hebp1 is present in the mitochondrial fraction and that the aforementioned markers from other cellular compartments could not be detected in this fraction. The immunoblot for these data is presented as Figure 5B in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We note that the subcellular fraction protocol employed in Figure 5A (previously Figure 5B) was optimized for the isolation of synaptic components which likely accounted for the higher contamination of tubulin in the crude mitochondrial fraction. Accordingly, we have revised the text to clarify this issue.</p><p>For the immunofluorescence experiments, we have now included an EGFP only negative control (Figure 5C top panel) and the corresponding line scan (Figure 5D) to show that association of Hebp1-EGFP with mitochondria is not random as the distribution of EGFP alone shows no correlation with Mitotracker. While we agree that Hebp1 can also be present in other organelles, we hope that these data have convincingly supported our conclusion that a notable fraction of Hebp1 is associated with mitochondria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors refer to a previous publication with patient information.

Immunohistochemistry was performed in selected brain areas using specific antibodies that include those directed against β-amyloid (Dako, clone 6F/3D, dilution 1: 400), phosphorylated tau (Thermo Scientific, clone AT8, dilution 1: 200), ubiquitin (Dako, polyclonal, dilution 1: 400), α-synuclein (Novocastra, clone KM51, dilution 1: 500), TDP43 (Abnova, clone 2E2-D3, dilution 1: 500) and prion protein (Millipore, clone 3F4, dilution 1: 300). The level of neuropathological changes caused by AD was classified as low, intermediate or high, according to the current National Institute of Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) guidelines. These guidelines include the assessment of the topographic distribution of β-amyloid deposits (A for amyloid, a scale of 1–3, 1: cortical and limbic, 2: 1 + basal ganglia, and 3: 1 + 2 + midbrain and cerebellum), a simplification of Braak’s staging system of neurofibrillary pathology (B for Braak, a scale of 1–3, 1: transentorhinal, 2: limbic, and 3: neocortical) and a semiquantitative assessment of neuritic plaques as suggested by the Consortium for Establishing a Registry for Alzheimer Disease (C for CERAD, a scale of 1–3, 1: sparse, 2: moderate, and 3: frequent).</p><p>In the revised version, we have included a summary of this information in the subsection “Post mortem human brain samples”, reproduced below:</p><p>“Briefly, patient clinical records were retrospectively assessed and classified by two neurologists.

We agree that two-factor ANOVA would be more appropriate, if conclusions on statistically significant differences in protein expression between mice of different ages and genotypes were to be assessed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figure 3, a Student's t test after an ANOVA is not appropriate; a Bonferroni correction is required to account for multiple comparisons.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you and the reviewers for highlighting this. We have reanalyzed data with one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test for individual pairs of samples and modified the figure accordingly. The differences remain statistically significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figure 3—figure supplement 2, why does the data for Hebp1 transcripts appear so bimodal – in both the controls and AD cases. How were the statistics performed? A Student's t test would not be appropriate here since the data does not appear to be normally distributed.</p></disp-quote><p>The source data for this figure was derived from 3 datasets prepared by Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center (HBTRC) that are publicly available on the GeneNetwork website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genenetwork.org">www.genenetwork.org</ext-link>). To better represent the data spread, we have now replotted the data using violin plots in the revised manuscript that show the datasets are not bimodal.</p><p>We have also confirmed that a normal distribution was indeed not observed for some of the data series. Following the reviewers’ recommendations, we have now reanalyzed the data with Mann-Whitney test and modified the figure and accompanying legend accordingly. The differences observed remain statistically significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The relevant brain region used for the experiment needs to be described:</p><p>- Figure 1—figure supplement 1C – from which brain region the extracts have been prepared?</p><p>- Figure 4B – which cortical area?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for omitting this information. In Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, the soluble fractions were obtained from one of the sagittal half of the harvested mouse whole brains. In Figure 4B, the top panels were imaged from the fronto-temporal cortex depicting primary motor and somatosensory areas.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 4. For images of the hippocampus, zoomed out images should be shown and also at higher resolution. In panel C, it would be helpful to have higher magnification images to show Hebp 1 localization in neurons and not in glia.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included zoomed out images of the hippocampus from 24-month-old control and 27-month-old 3×Tg-AD mice. We have also included higher magnification images supporting the expression of Hebp1 in neurons but not glial. These images have been included as supplemental data to Figure 4 (Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 2, respectively).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been greatly improved with additional experiments and careful editing. However, the following issue needs to be addressed before acceptance.</p><p>Figure 5. The claim for specific association of Hebp1 to mitochondria is still not compellingly supported by the imaging data shown. To compare the relative distributions of Hebp1-EGFP vs. soluble EGFP with respect to Mitotracker, panels E and F should present data for at least 7 microns, similarly to panel D, and all in the same scale.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the results of the analyses to include data for 7 microns presented in the same scale for Figure 5D, E and F as suggested by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The text in subsection “Hebp1 interacts with mitochondrial contact 240 site complex” should be toned down to reflect the data. The images show that Hebp1 &quot;can be&quot; associated to mitochondria, and whether a &quot;substantial proportion&quot; of Hebp1-EGFP is closely juxtaposed to Mitotracker remains to be justified.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have toned down the text of the respective section. It now reads as follows:</p><p>“We further demonstrated that the protein can be mitochondrially-associated by detecting the presence of Hebp1 from mitochondria isolated from cultured hippocampal neurons (Figure 5B). Supporting the biochemical data, we observed that a portion of EGFP-tagged Hebp1 expressed in rat primary neurons appears to be closely juxtaposed to mitochondria (visualized using Mitotracker) (Figure 5C and line scans in Figures 5E and 5F).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there a reason for not assessing the subcellular localization of endogenous Hebp1 using immunofluorescence labelling (as has been done for hippocampal sections)?</p></disp-quote><p>The anti-Hebp1 antibody did not work well for immunocytochemistry (no strong specific signals were detectable), unlike for immunohistochemical sections. We have tried various blocking conditions and antibody concentrations without success.</p></body></sub-article></article>
