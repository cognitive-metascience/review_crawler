The distinction between CLC-0/1/2 channels and CLC transporters seems undetectable by amino acid sequence. To understand why they are different functionally we determined the structure of the human CLC-1 channel. Its ‘glutamate gate’ residue, known to mediate proton transfer in CLC transporters, adopts a location in the structure that appears to preclude it from its transport function. Furthermore, smaller side chains produce a wider pore near the intracellular surface, potentially reducing a kinetic barrier for Cl<sup>−</sup> conduction. When the corresponding residues are mutated in a transporter, it is converted to a channel. Finally, Cl<sup>−</sup> at key sites in the pore appear to interact with reduced affinity compared to transporters. Thus, subtle differences in glutamate gate conformation, internal pore diameter and Cl<sup>−</sup> affinity distinguish CLC channels and transporters.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36629.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Channels and transporters are two classes of proteins that transport molecules and ions – collectively referred to as “substrates” – across cell membranes. Channels form a pore in the membrane and the substrates diffuse through passively. Transporters, on the other hand, actively pump substrates across a membrane, consuming energy in the process. Thus, channels and transporters work in distinct ways.</p><p>Channels and transporters most often have unrelated structures, but there are rare examples of both existing within the same family of structurally similar proteins. CLC proteins, for example, include both chloride ion channels and transporters that pump chloride ions in one direction by harnessing the energy from hydrogen ions flowing in the other direction.</p><p>It remains unclear why some CLC proteins work as channels while others are transporters, especially since the two seem indistinguishable on the basis of the order of their amino acids – the building blocks of all proteins. The conservation of the amino acid sequences implies they are structurally very similar. How then can different members perform such energetically distinct processes?</p><p>Park and MacKinnon now show that the answer to this question serves as a reminder of how subtle nature can be. Indeed, while the structure of a human CLC channel (called CLC-1) is indeed similar to those of CLC transporters, one amino acid adopts a unique shape that explains why the protein cannot act as a transporter. This specific amino acid, a glutamate, is central to the exchange of chloride and hydrogen ions in CLC transporters. Park and MacKinnon show that its conformation in the CLC-1 channel stops this exchange, while leaving the pore open for the passive transport of chloride ions. Also, two other amino acids along the ion diffusion pathway in the CLC channel are smaller than their counterparts in CLC transporters, and so allow chloride ions to diffuse through more quickly. Lastly, Park and MacKinnon also note that channels do not require a wide pore: instead ions can still flow rapidly through a narrow pore if the chemical environment inside permits it.</p><p>CLC proteins perform a number of important roles in humans, and mutations in CLC-encoding genes underlie numerous heritable diseases. It remains too early to know how this mechanistic study may or may not impact treatments, yet the findings will likely interest scientists working on ion conduction mechanisms and the evolution of molecular function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chloride channel</kwd><kwd>CLC</kwd><kwd>cryoelectron microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>61-1513</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Eunyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001312</institution-id><institution>Charles H.

But the two are thermodynamically contrasting: transporters require the input of external energy while channels are passive, meaning the substrate simply diffuses down its electrochemical gradient. Except in rare cases, transporters and channels correspond to separate, unrelated structural families. CLC proteins are one of the exceptions. Channel-forming CLCs are passive Cl<sup>−</sup> conductors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jentsch et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller and White, 1984</xref>), while transporter-forming CLCs exchange, with fixed stoichiometry, two Cl<sup>−</sup> ions and one proton (H<sup>+</sup>) in opposite directions (i.e., they are Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accardi and Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Picollo and Pusch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scheel et al., 2005</xref>). The external energy input in CLC transporters comes from the energetic coupling of the transported ions, Cl<sup>−</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>, such that the electrochemical gradient of one ion drives movement of the other. The puzzling aspect of this dual functionality within the CLC protein family is that at the level of amino acid sequence, the distinction between the channels and transporters is not apparent.</p><p>Conceptually, the distinction between channels and transporters in general has been explained in terms of gating models that invoke one or two primary gates: channels are described as pores with one gate and transporters as pores with two gates that are never permitted to open simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gadsby, 2009</xref>]). While it is true that channels and transporters are most often unrelated structurally, the gating model description implies that, in principle, similar structures could give rise to both, as one can imagine that a transporter could become a channel if one or both gates are compromised. CLC channels seem to fall under this category of channels that emerged from a family of transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Accardi and Picollo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lísal and Maduke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller, 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36629.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Passive and active transport explained by gating mechanisms.</title><p>One-gate (<bold>A</bold>) and two-gate (<bold>B</bold>) models explaining passive transport by a channel and active transport by a transporter (shown is an antiporter).

CLC transporter structures show a narrow Cl<sup>−</sup> transport pathway with three consecutive Cl<sup>−</sup>-binding sites, referred to as S<sub>ext</sub>, S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>int</sub>, for external (nearest the extracellular solution), central and internal (nearest the intracellular solution), respectively. Chloride is observed at these sites in various structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dutzler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dutzler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jayaram et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the transporters all contain a glutamate residue positioned such that its side chain carboxylate group can bind either at S<sub>ext</sub> or S<sub>cen</sub> – in competition with a Cl<sup>−</sup> ion – or reside in the extracellular solution. Thus, CLC transporters are like Cl<sup>−</sup> channels with a weird feature – a glutamate side chain that clogs its own pore. This led to the idea that glutamate might not only be a competitor for the Cl<sup>−</sup> binding sites as the structures suggest, but it might also transfer a proton from inside to out (or the reverse) when it moves between its S<sub>cen</sub> position to its extracellular position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2012</xref>). The transfer would naturally give rise to the 2:1 Cl<sup>−</sup>:H<sup>+</sup> exchange stoichiometry characteristic of CLC transporters because 2 Cl<sup>−</sup> ions must be displaced when the glutamate gate moves between the extracellular solution and S<sub>cen</sub>. This mechanism is consistent with the demonstrated conversion of a CLC transporter into a passive (but slow) Cl<sup>−</sup> channel upon mutation of the glutamate, as well as the demonstrated ability of small carboxylate-containing organic acids to compete with Cl<sup>−</sup> inside the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accardi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accardi and Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2012</xref>). But there was one important caveat to make this transporter mechanism work: there must exist a relatively high kinetic barrier to Cl<sup>−</sup> flow near the intracellular side of the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2010</xref>). This barrier would serve as the ‘second gate’ in the gating model conceptualization of transporters. So far, data for CLC transporters seem consistent with this mechanism: they have a channel-like pore, an external ‘glutamate gate’ that competes with Cl<sup>−</sup> binding and (presumably) transfers H<sup>+</sup> across the membrane, and structurally what appears to be a relatively high resistance (i.e., a large kinetic barrier) to Cl<sup>−</sup> flow near the intracellular aspect of the pore (i.e., the pore there is very narrow.)</p><p>Less is known about the chemistry and structure of CLC channels. Only one CLC channel structure has been determined, CLC-K from <italic>Bos taurus</italic> (referred to as bCLC-K or shortly CLC-K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2017</xref>). This is a special case, a rare type of CLC channel that can be distinguished from CLC transporters based on its amino acid sequence because it does not have a ‘glutamate gate’. That difference alone renders CLC-K inert to H<sup>+</sup> transfer. The structure of CLC-K also revealed a wider pore diameter on the intracellular side, consistent with a lowered kinetic barrier to Cl<sup>−</sup> flow. CLC-0/1/2 channels, by contrast, contain a ‘glutamate gate’ and are not distinguishable from CLC transporters by sequence. Thus, there must be an even more subtle distinction between these CLC channels and the transporters. Why does the glutamate gate in these channel CLCs not give rise to H<sup>+</sup> transfer coupled to Cl<sup>−</sup> transfer? Is a reduced kinetic barrier to Cl<sup>−</sup> flow near the intracellular side, suggested by the CLC-K structure, a common feature in CLC channels? To address these questions, we have determined the structure of CLC-1 from <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (referred to as hCLC-1 or CLC-1).</p><p>We are also interested in the CLC-1 channel because it plays an important role in membrane repolarization of skeletal muscle cells following muscular contraction, and its mutation in humans causes hereditary muscle disorders known as <italic>myotonia congenita</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">George et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koch et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lorenz et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Steinmeyer et al., 1991</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Determination of a human CLC-1 channel structure by cryo-EM</title><p>We purified the CLC-1 protein in mild detergent from cultured human cells and examined them by cryo-EM single particle analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>).

Both branches of the bifurcation are potentially hydrated because the radius is greater than that of water (1.4 Å) and the linings contain chemical groups with hydrogen bonding potential. A branch equivalent to CLC-1’s secondary pore in the CLC-K channel is sealed off by F222 and V226 (corresponding to F288 and V292 of CLC-1) due to a different αH helix position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

It is possible that during Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange cycles, the αH helix of transporters transiently undergoes a conformational change such that a water-accessible pore is formed similarly to the CLC-1 case, which might facilitate H<sup>+</sup> transfer.

The filter is formed at the central constriction of the Cl<sup>−</sup> pathway by αN, αF, and αD helices, all of which point their N-terminal ends towards the center where Cl<sup>−</sup>-binding sites are formed.

Based on previous studies on transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dutzler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dutzler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2010</xref>), Glu<sub>gate</sub>, located in the immediate vicinity of S<sub>ext</sub> and S<sub>cen</sub>, plays a key role in ion transport: when deprotonated its side-chain carboxylic moiety resides in either the S<sub>ext</sub> or S<sub>cen</sub> Cl<sup>−</sup> binding sites, preventing the binding of a Cl<sup>−</sup> ion therein. In the CLC-1 structure, the Glu<sub>gate</sub> side chain occupies neither S<sub>ext</sub> nor S<sub>cen</sub>, but instead it is oriented in a different direction. The difference in Glu<sub>gate</sub>’s conformation is mainly due to changes in its side-chain rotamer, whereas the polypeptide backbone arrangement in this region is similar among the structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The observed Glu<sub>gate</sub> conformation is also different than the outwardly-oriented (side chain projecting into the extracellular funnel) conformation that has been seen in the structure of an EcCLC Glu-to-Gln (E148Q) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which is hypothesized to mimic the protonated state of Glu<sub>gate</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dutzler et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>It is unclear whether the Glu<sub>gate</sub> in the CLC-1 structure (determined at pH 7.4) is protonated. The pKa of the Glu<sub>gate</sub> side chain might be shifted towards a more neutral pH as it is neighbored by multiple hydrophobic amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Isom et al., 2010</xref>). Yet, Glu<sub>gate</sub> at this position is more likely deprotonated because its side chain seems exposed to water molecules due to the presence of the second intracellular pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In CLC transporters, this conformation would be highly unfavorable because it would produce steric clashes with neighboring side chains (equivalent to V236, V265, and F279 of CLC-1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which are moved away in CLC-1 by a shift of the αG and αH helices. In other words, this conformation of Glu<sub>gate</sub> does not seem possible in CLC transporters studied so far.</p><p>The observed Glu<sub>gate</sub> conformation of CLC-1 was unexpected because it was never observed in other CLC protein structures, and yet it is consistent with an open CLC-1 channel, which is expected in the absence of an applied membrane potential.

Perhaps in the presence of an applied negative membrane potential the Glu<sub>gate</sub> side chain moves into either the S<sub>ext</sub> or S<sub>cen</sub> position, as seen in CLC transporters, and prevents Cl<sup>−</sup> conduction. This possibility would account for the observation that CLC-1 and related CLC-0 conduct Cl<sup>−</sup> ions at all membrane voltages when the Glu<sub>gate</sub> residue is mutated to Gln (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dutzler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fahlke et al., 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>‘Transporter-like’ αC-D loop</title><p>The previous CLC-K channel structure has suggested that a wider pore diameter between S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>int</sub> is crucial for its channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2017</xref>).

This barrier is due to a narrow pore width between S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>int</sub>, which is created in part by Ser<sub>C</sub> of the αC-D loop interposed between the two Cl<sup>−</sup> binding sites. In the CLC-K structure, the αC-D loop has a distinctly different conformation, where Ser<sub>C</sub> is flipped down and thus no longer interposed between the two Cl<sup>−</sup> binding sites. Consequently, the pore diameter is wider such that Cl<sup>−</sup> ions will more readily permeate. Given that CLC-1 is also a channel, we wondered whether the αC-D loop in CLC-1 would adopt a similar ‘flipped-down’ conformation.</p><p>While a different conformation of the αC-D loop is a key feature distinguishing CLC-K from transporters, a structural comparison shows that this is not the case for the CLC-1 channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Consequently, the Ser<sub>C</sub> side chain is positioned between S<sub>int</sub> and S<sub>cen</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Therefore, in the case of CLC-1 the αC-D loop itself does not provide an explanation for why CLC-1 functions as a Cl<sup>−</sup> channel (see below).

While the radius is significantly smaller than the Cl<sup>−</sup> radius (~1.7 Å), the flexibility of the M485 side chain must allow Cl<sup>−</sup> ions to pass through this region. Given the narrowness of this constriction, it is likely that M485 affects the Cl<sup>−</sup> throughput of the channel.

This suggests the absence of a large kinetic barrier in CLC-1, but for reasons other than the αC-D loop conformation. Compared to the CLC-K channel, CLC-1 has a slightly narrower (1.5 Å vs 1.7 Å in radius) opening between S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>int</sub> because of Ser<sub>C</sub>. This might create a kinetic barrier to some degree, but the pore is still significantly wider and more hydrophilic than the equivalent region in the EcCLC transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The difference originates mainly from two amino acids (T475 and G483) lining the constriction. In EcCLC, the equivalent positions are F348 and I356, which project their bulky, hydrophobic side chains towards the Cl<sup>−</sup> pathway between S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>int</sub>. Together with proximal placement of Ser<sub>C</sub> and Tyr<sub>C</sub>, this narrows the opening (1.0 Å in radius) in EcCLC. In the CmCLC transporter, the constriction at the kinetic barrier region is wider (1.6 Å in radius) than EcCLC because of smaller side chains at the equivalent positions (I421 and V429; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and a slight downward shift (1.5 Å) of Ser<sub>C</sub> with respect to the positions in EcCLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

In CLC-1, this shift contributes to pore widening in the cytosolic vestibule. At present it is unclear if this shift of Tyr<sub>C</sub> is static or part of dynamic movements in CLC-1 and if it is unique in CLC-1 or a similar movement exists in other CLC proteins. Previous biophysical studies have proposed a movement of Tyr<sub>C</sub> to explain alternating gate opening of the EcCLC Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jayaram et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khantwal et al., 2016</xref>).

Indeed, these two positions showed a distinctive differential pattern when comparing CLC channels and transporters, whereas other positions (i.e., H369, C481, L577, and I581 in CLC-1) did not. Generally, these two positions are filled with large, hydrophobic amino acids in transporters but are replaced by a small, polar amino acid in CLC channels. One notable outlier is position 417 of the CLC-K channels (Y425). However, the CLC-K channel structure shows that its phenyl side chain is skewed off the Cl<sup>−</sup> pathway, and thus does not seem to create a kinetic barrier in CLC-K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In fact, it forms the S<sub>cen</sub> Cl<sup>−</sup> binding site together with Tyr<sub>C</sub> and F519 through anion-quadrupole interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In summary, the observed amino acid pattern and structural information suggest that a lowered barrier in the S<sub>cen</sub>–S<sub>int</sub> region of the pore is a common feature of CLC channels, but CLC-1 and CLC-K channels achieve this somewhat differently. In the CLC-1 channel, small side chains in pore-lining residues lower the kinetic barrier, whereas in CLC-K mainly the reorientation of Ser<sub>C</sub> lowers it. The extent of the kinetic barrier should also be affected by the hydrophobic and electrostatic nature of the lining residues, not only the physical dimensions of the pore.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Working model and experimental validation</title><p>Combining the new structural information and previous data, we propose a working model that channel behavior in CLC proteins arises out of the following physical conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>): (1) Glu<sub>gate</sub> is either absent (i.e., in CLC-K) or allowed to reside in an ‘open’ configuration (i.e., CLC-1) for a sufficiently extended period of time (rather than occupying S<sub>ext</sub> or S<sub>cen</sub>); (2) a lowered kinetic barrier between S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>int</sub>; (3) reduced Cl<sup>−</sup>-binding affinity at S<sub>cen</sub> (or S<sub>ext</sub>, as suggested by apparent low occupancy in the CLC-K structure). A reduced kinetic barrier would be an important feature to achieve fast Cl<sup>−</sup> throughput. On the other hand, a sufficient kinetic barrier would be crucial in transporters to preclude undesired slippage of Cl<sup>−</sup> ions through the transiently open pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, reduction of Cl<sup>−</sup>-binding affinity at S<sub>cen</sub> and/or S<sub>ext</sub>, which is energetically related to the kinetic barrier, might also contribute to high Cl<sup>−</sup> throughput in channels. For example, relatively deep energy wells at S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>ext</sub>, as implied by the high occupancy of sites in the EcCLC transporter, would create a larger energy difference between the binding sites and the ‘transition states’, which effectively raises the energy barrier. In CLC-1 the relatively low binding site occupancy implies not very deep energy wells and thus a smaller energy difference between the binding sites and ‘transition states’.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36629.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Models for ion transport mechanisms of CLC transporters and channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) General architecture of CLC proteins.

The ideas outlined above predict that if the kinetic barrier in EcCLC is lowered it should behave more like a CLC channel (i.e., rapid Cl<sup>−</sup> permeation with decreased H<sup>+</sup> transport activity). Cl<sup>−</sup> permeation is expected to be further increased if the Glu<sub>gate</sub> is rendered persistently opened. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jayaram et al., 2008</xref>), opening of Glu<sub>gate</sub> alone by the Glu-to-Ala mutation (E148A) abolishes the H<sup>+</sup> transport activity, but it also reduced Cl<sup>−</sup> throughput by a factor of approximately 0.25. We reason that this is likely because the mutant still retains the kinetic barrier deterring Cl<sup>−</sup> ions from moving between S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>int</sub>. Thus, while removal of the Glu<sub>gate</sub> is sufficient to convert the transporter into a Cl<sup>−</sup> channel, a reduced kinetic barrier would be key to an increased Cl<sup>−</sup> throughput, an important feature of the native CLC channels.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36629.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Effects of Glu<sub>gate</sub> and kinetic barrier mutations on Cl<sup>−</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> transport activities of EcCLC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of the Cl<sup>−</sup> dump assay to measure the Cl<bold><sup>−</sup></bold> transport rate of EcCLC.

However, we note that Y445S is rather unphysiological as Tyr<sub>C</sub> is invariant among all CLC channels and transporters. Therefore, here we examined the effects of lowering the kinetic barrier in wild type EcCLC by mutating Ser<sub>C</sub> or neighboring pore-lining amino acids, guided by the CLC-1 and CLC-K structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Trimming the side chain of Ser<sub>C</sub> (S107G), with the intention of mimicking the flipped Ser<sub>C</sub> in the CLC-K channel, increased the Cl<sup>−</sup> transport rate by a factor of 2, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jayaram et al., 2008</xref>). At the same time, this mutation lowered H<sup>+</sup> coupling 3-fold, as one would expect due to the slippage of uncoupled Cl<sup>−</sup> ions. Next, since CLC-K has a polar amino acid (Thr) at one of its pore-lining residues (F348 of EcCLC), we further introduced a similar (F348A) mutation. This increased the Cl<sup>−</sup> throughput and almost abolished coupled H<sup>+</sup> transport. Finally, by adding a Glu<sub>gate</sub> mutation (E148A) to this double mutant the Cl<sup>−</sup> throughput was further increased. Compared to the E148A single mutant, the triple mutant (S107G/F348A/E148A) has a Cl<sup>−</sup> transport rate increased about 25-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Similar results were obtained when mutations mimicking the CLC-1 channel were introduced to EcCLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). While single mutations at the pore-lining amino acids (F348T or I356G) did not increase the Cl<sup>−</sup> transport rate, the double mutation (F348T/I356G) moderately increased the Cl<sup>−</sup> throughput (1.5-fold with respect to the wildtype). We note that this mutant displayed no measurable H<sup>+</sup> transport activity. When the double mutant was combined with the Glu<sub>gate</sub> mutation (E148A), which was used as a surrogate of the Glu<sub>gate</sub> conformation observed in the CLC-1 structure, the Cl<sup>−</sup> throughput dramatically increased (22-fold with respect to the single E148A mutant; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Single mutations (F348T or I356G) in the E148A background showed intermediate increases in Cl<sup>−</sup> throughput, suggesting that the effects of these mutations are somewhat additive.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The human CLC-1 channel exhibits interesting structural differences in the Cl<sup>−</sup> transport pathway and the gates, which can explain why this protein functions as a Cl<sup>−</sup> channel instead of a Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter. The outer gate of the channel remains open because the carboxylic side-chain Glu<sub>gate</sub> is located off to the side, away from the Cl<sup>−</sup> transport pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The inner kinetic barrier seems to be substantially lowered compared to transporters owing to a wider pore diameter near the cytosolic side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The pore widening is subtle, but distinctive enough to reveal a pattern separating channels and transporters at the protein sequence level (independent of the presence or absence of a Glu<sub>gate</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The position of the Glu<sub>gate</sub> residue in CLC-1 is unique among CLC structures so far observed. The new Glu<sub>gate</sub> position, where its carboxylic side chain is directed off to the side of the Cl<sup>−</sup> pathway, is enabled by a pocket that is large and hydrophilic (owing to its bifurcated pore structure) enough to accommodate Glu<sub>gate</sub>’s side chain. This pocket may also exist in other Glu<sub>gate</sub>-containing CLC channels (i.e., CLC-0 and CLC-2) but does not seem to exist in transporters because of a different arrangement of neighboring amino acids. It seems likely that this Glu<sub>gate</sub> position is key to understanding why CLC-1 exhibits a stable open (i.e., conducting) state. On the basis of mutagenesis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dutzler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fahlke et al., 1997</xref>), the Glu<sub>gate</sub> in CLC-0 and CLC-1 has been identified as a ‘voltage sensor’ because its removal abolishes voltage-dependent gating. From this observation, we would suggest that the position of Glu<sub>gate</sub> (i.e., whether it resides off to the side, not occluding the pore, or within the pore) depends on the transmembrane voltage and generally dictates gating each CLC-1 monomer’s pore (also referred to as a ‘protopore’).</p><p>An unresolved issue raised by the new Glu<sub>gate</sub> side chain conformation is this: if this conformation corresponds to the conducting state, how is it favored by low pH outside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rychkov et al., 1996</xref>)? One possibility is the Glu<sub>gate</sub> might be protonated in this conformation. Alternatively, low pH might stabilize a conformation of Glu<sub>gate</sub> outside the pore, as in the EcCLC E148Q mutant. This conformation would also remove Glu<sub>gate</sub> from the pore and permit conduction. Finally, the pH effect might be produced allosterically by protonation of an unidentified amino acid on the extracellular side. For example, both CLC-2 and CLC-K channels are inhibited by external pH &lt;6.5, but it has been shown that a His residue (H532 of CLC-2 and H497 of CLC-K), which is located ~20 Å away from the pore, is responsible for this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gradogna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Niemeyer et al., 2009</xref>). This issue remains unresolved for now.</p><p>Functional experiments using EcCLC provide support for our model that a low kinetic barrier in the cytosolic vestibule is necessary for high Cl<sup>−</sup> transport rates, which are general characteristics of native CLC channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and also see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jayaram et al., 2008</xref>)). The results indicate that a small increase in the pore diameter and a decrease in hydrophobicity of the pore lining can substantially lower the kinetic barrier. The structures, however, suggest that the extent might be somewhat less in the CLC-1 channel than in the CLC-K channel because of CLC-1’s Ser<sub>C </sub>‘transporter-like’ conformation. This is in fact consistent with the observation that CLC-1 has vestigial H<sup>+</sup> transport activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Picollo and Pusch, 2005</xref>) and a relatively slow Cl<sup>−</sup> throughput compared to that of CLC-K channels (1.2–1.8 pS versus 20–30 pS of CLC-K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">L'Hoste et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saviane et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scholl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Weinreich and Jentsch, 2001</xref>). What then causes the Ser<sub>C</sub> to adopt its flipped-down conformation in the CLC-K channel? In CLC-K, position 425 contains a bulky amino acid (Y425), in contrast to other CLC proteins. In the canonical conformation Ser<sub>C</sub> would sterically clash with Y425 (e.g., the center-to-center distance between the Ser<sub>C</sub>-Oγ and Y425-Cε atoms would become 2.3 Å). We speculate that this steric incompatibility imposed by the unique Y425 might lead to the flipped-down conformation of Ser<sub>C</sub> in the CLC-K channel.</p><p>The observed low Cl<sup>−</sup> occupancy at S<sub>cen</sub> in the CLC-1 structure has a striking resemblance to previous crystallographic observations on EcCLC, wherein S<sub>cen</sub> remained unoccupied when experiments were performed with Tyr<sub>C</sub> mutants lacking H<sup>+</sup> transport activity or with pseudohalides, which permeate without coupled H<sup>+</sup> transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Accardi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguitragool and Miller, 2006</xref>). It has been shown that in EcCLC, low Cl<sup>−</sup> occupancy correlates with low anion binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Picollo et al., 2009</xref>). This comparison suggests a reduced Cl<sup>−</sup> binding affinity at S<sub>cen</sub> in CLC-1, although further biophysical measurements will be necessary to confirm this. We speculate that this feature contributes to reduced H<sup>+</sup> transport and increased Cl<sup>−</sup> conduction. Possible causes underlying the altered Cl<sup>−</sup> affinity include the shifted position of Tyr<sub>C</sub> and subtle changes in positions and orientations of neighboring backbone nitrogen atoms coordinating the Cl<sup>−</sup> ion. For example, we note that CLC-0/1/2 channels have smaller, more flexible residues (Gly or Ala) at the G483 position, in contrast to Leu, Ile, or Val in CLC transporters.</p><p>CLC-1 is now the second structure of a channel-forming CLC, the first being CLC-K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2017</xref>). One of the major features giving rise to channel behavior is a more conductive pore. The structural differences giving rise to the higher Cl<sup>−</sup> conductivity are fairly subtle: the pore is slightly wider and the chemical properties a little different, accounting for what we propose to be a reduced kinetic barrier. We think there is a very important lesson here. Throughput rates in the range of 10<sup>6</sup> ions per second do not require a wide pore. We conclude that even if the pore in places is on average narrower than the ion, as long as the lining atoms are favorable to a conducting ion with respect to their electrostatic and chemical properties, and as long as they are sufficiently dynamic (<italic>i.e.</italic> they can move out of the way), then the ion can diffuse through. We offer as an example of this idea, the selectivity filter of K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). The atomic structures show us that in fact the pore’s radius between the K<sup>+</sup> binding sites is smaller than the radius of a K<sup>+</sup> ion. And yet some K<sup>+</sup> channels approach throughput rates of 10<sup>8</sup> per second. It is not surprising to now understand that the radius of the pore in CLC channels and transporters is not very different.</p><p>The structures of CLC-1 and CLC-K channels support the idea that CLC channels are ‘broken transporters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jayaram et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lísal and Maduke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller, 2006</xref>), where their channel function is built upon a transporter structure with modifications of the gates. The structures demonstrate that relatively small changes in the active site and ion transport pathway of a transporter gives rise to channel function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CLCN1</td><td valign="top">Synthetic</td><td valign="top">UniProt: P35523</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK293S GnTI<sup>-</sup></td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">ATCC: CRL-3022 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_A785">CVCL_A785</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Spodoptera</italic> <break/><italic>frugiperda</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Sf9</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">ATCC: CRL-1711 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0549">CVCL_0549</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pEG BacMam</td><td valign="top">doi: 10.1038/nprot.2014.173</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">RELION-2</td><td valign="top">doi: 10.1016/j.jsb.2012.09.006</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion/index.php?title=Main_Page">https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion/index.php?title=Main_Page</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MotionCor2</td><td valign="top">doi:10.1038/nmeth.4193</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://msg.ucsf.edu/em/software/motioncor2.html">http://msg.ucsf.edu/em/software/motioncor2.html</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">CTFFIND4</td><td valign="top">10.1016/j.jsb.2015.08.008</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://grigoriefflab.janelia.org/ctffind4">http://grigoriefflab.janelia.org/ctffind4</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Alightpart_lmbfgs</td><td valign="top">doi: 10.1016/j.jsb.2015.08.007</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/site/rubinsteingroup/direct-detector-align_lmbfgs">https://sites.google.com/site/rubinsteingroup/direct-detector-align_lmbfgs</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Rosetta</td><td valign="top">RosettaCommons</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015701">SCR_015701</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rosettacommons.org/software">https://www.rosettacommons.org/software</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Pymol</td><td valign="top">PyMOL Molecular Graphics <break/>System, Schrödinger, LLC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000305">SCR_000305</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org/">http://www.pymol.org/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">UCSF Chimera</td><td valign="top">UCSF Resource for <break/>Biocomputing, Visualization, <break/>and Bioinformatics</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004097">SCR_004097</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plato.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/">http://plato.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Human CLC-1 was expressed in HEK293 GnTI<sup>−</sup> cells (ATCC CRL-3022) by transduction using a modified baculovirus as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goehring et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2017</xref>).

Defocus values were estimated using CTFFIND4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>) on the summed micrographs produced by MotionCor2 (using the full dose). Particles were picked automatically by RELION2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kimanius et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheres, 2012</xref>), and obvious artifacts, such as ice contamination and carbon foil, were removed by manual inspection. Total 725,959 particles were extracted with a box size of 320 pixels and subjected to reference-free 2D classification (performed separately per dataset). Based on visual inspection of quality of 2D average classes, 411,260 particles were pooled. This particle set was then applied to the alignpart_lmbfgs program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rubinstein and Brubaker, 2015</xref>) to perform per-particle motion correction (particle polishing). The particle polishing step was done using motion-corrected (whole-frame-only) movie stacks, which were first produced by MotionCor2 and then 2x or 4x frame-binned by relion_image_handler (resulting in a total of 25 frames per movie and 3 e<sup>−</sup> per Å<sup>2</sup> per frame). Particles were extracted from 1 to 13 frames (total dose of 39 e<sup>−</sup> per Å<sup>2</sup>) and using alignparts_lmbfgs’s exposure filter. The ‘polished’ particles were subjected to another round of clean-up by RELION 2D classification (resulting in 350,750 particles). The initial model was generated by RELION auto-refine using particle images from the first dataset and a 50 Å lowpass-filtered model from the CLC-K channel density map (excluding antibody fragments; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2017</xref>)). All 350,750 polished particle images were subjected to auto-refine (RELION 2.1), using the updated initial model and a soft mask surrounding the protein and detergent micelle density. This refinement step produced a 3.8 Å map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This was then followed by a RELION 3D classification procedure skipping image alignment (sorting into five classes). Particles from two classes were combined (175,613 particles) by visual inspection in UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) and subjected to RELION auto-refine again. During the later iterations (upon entering the local search mode), the soft mask was updated to contain only the transmembrane or cytosolic domain (focused refinement). The resolution of the final TMD domain map (3.36 Å) was estimated by RELION based on gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of independently refined half maps (using the 0.143 cut-off criterion). The focused refinement of the cytosolic domain was performed by 2 iterations of local refinement using reference maps in which information at lower than 4.6 Å resolution were combined from the previous iteration’s two half maps. The nominal resolution of the final CTD map is 4.1 Å, but this is likely somewhat overestimated (the resolution before the focused refinement is 4.5 Å). Local resolution was estimated using RELION2’s postprocess program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Unless stated otherwise, the TMD map shown in figures is a combined map, which was sharpened (B-factor of −97.9 Å<sup>2</sup>) and lowpass-filtered at 3.36 Å by RELION’s automatic postprocess procedure using user-provided soft masks. The TMD map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref> was sharpened with a B-factor of −97.9 Å<sup>2</sup> and low-pass filtered at 3.1 Å. The CTD density map was low-pass filtered at 4.2 Å without B-factor sharpening.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Atomic model building</title><p>An initial model of the CLC-1’s TMD was generated by the SWISS-MODEL homology modelling webserver using the CLC-K model (PDB ID: 5TQQ) as a template. The output model was fit into the TMD density map using Chimera and rebuilt using Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>). Model refinement was done in real space using Rosetta 3.7 using a script developed for cryo-EM model refinements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The first round was performed with an asymmetric unit model, and the five best output models were selected based on Rosetta’s energy scores. A consensus model was generated by combining fragments from these models based on the fit to the density map. The subsequent two rounds of Rosetta refinement were done with two-fold symmetry imposed. To prevent overfitting, the weight between Rosetta energy scores and the fit to the experimental density map was adjusted, and test refinement was performed on one of two half maps. The output models were then compared to both half maps by calculating FSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). To this end, we used a weight of 25, which gave us a good fitting to the map and negligible overfitting. While the first two rounds of refinement were done using one of the two half maps, the last round was performed on the combined map to maximize the use of experimental data in refining the model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> for FSC between the final model and the combined map). The final model was selected among ~2000 Rosetta-generated models based on Rosetta’s total score (top 20%) and the fit of side chains to the map (visual inspection). No further modifications were made except for Cl<sup>−</sup> ions at S<sub>ext</sub> and S<sub>int</sub>, which were modelled in Coot (Coot’s real-space refinement was used) since Rosetta could not refine Cl<sup>−</sup> ions. Modelling of CTD was done similarly using Rosetta, but using a crystal structure of CLC-0 CBS domain as an initial model. A weight of 7 was used, and the refinement was limited to 4.5 Å resolution. As side chains were not visible in the CTD density map, we removed all side chain atoms from the final CTD model generated by Rosetta. The following segments were not modelled as they were invisible in the density maps: N–115, 251–262 (a cytosolic segment between αF and αG), 671–796 (a loop in CTD), and 877–988(C).

Dried lipids were suspended by sonication in buffer (RB-Cit) containing 25 mM sodium citrate (pH 4.6) and 300 mM KCl and then solubilized with 35 mM (3-((3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio)−1-propanesulfonate) (CHAPS; Anatrace) and additional sonication. Purified EcCLC protein was added to the lipid/CHAPS mixture in a protein-to-lipid ratio of 1:5000 (wt:wt). After 30 min incubation at 23°C, the mixture was dialyzed against RB-Cit buffer to remove CHAPS. The dialysis was carried out at 4–10°C for 48 h with three additional buffer changes. To reconstitute EcCLC proteins for fluorescence-based flux assays, the same procedure was used except that buffer containing 10 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) and 450 mM KCl instead of RB-Cit and a protein-to-lipid ratio of 1:500 (wt:wt) were used.

A frozen aliquot of vesicles was thawed and briefly sonicated in the bath sonicator (Branson). Vesicles were extruded through a 0.4 μm polycarbonate filter 19 times (Avanti Mini-Extruder). The extruded vesicles were desalted with a spin column packed with Sephadex G-50 resin (~2.5 mL bed volume) equilibrated with buffer (EB) containing 25 mM sodium citrate (pH 4.7), 250 mM K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and 1 mM NaCl. 100 μL of the desalted vesicles were then mixed with 900 μL EB in a chamber equipped with a magnetic stirrer and Cl<sup>−</sup>-selective electrode (Fisher Accumet). Changes in extravesicular Cl<sup>−</sup> concentration was monitored over time by the Cl<sup>−</sup>-selective electrode connected to a computer through a digitizer (DataQ). To calibrate the electrode, 0.1 mM NaCl was added before the vesicles were added. Flux was initiated by addition of 2 μg/mL valinomycin and 1 μg/mL carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) or 3 μg/mL valinomycin (for E148A mutants). At the end of assays, 30 mM octyl β-glucoside (Anatrace) was added to release all Cl<sup>−</sup> content from vesicles.

A frozen aliquot of vesicles was thawed and briefly sonicated in a bath sonicator. 3 μL of vesicles were mixed with 40 μL of assay buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 450 mM K-gluconate and 4 μM ACMA in a well of a 384-well fluorescence assay. After measuring initial AMCA fluorescence intensity (λ<sub>Ex</sub>=410 nm, λ<sub>Em</sub>=490 nm), Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> flux was initiated by addition of 1 μM valinomycin, followed by monitoring fluorescence over time (10 s intervals) using a plate reader (Tecan Infinite M1000) at 27°C. Note that there is a dead time for measurement between t = 80 s to t = 120 s due to handling of the plate during valinomycin addition. Valinomycin was added to the reactions at t = ~100 s. As a control, 0.9 μM carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) was added to the assay mixture at the end of the experiment to dissipate an accumulated H<sup>+</sup> gradient. To measure relative H<sup>+</sup> transport activity of each mutant, time required to fluorescence reaches 75% (or 85% in the case of S106G/F348A double mutant) of the initial fluorescence upon addition of valinomycin was calculated. This time value was then inversed and normalized with respect to a value obtained with wild-type EcCLC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data availability</title><p>Cryo-EM density maps of human CLC-1 have been deposited in the electron microscopy data bank under accession code EMD-7544 and 7545.

The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alessio Accardi (Reviewer #2); Christopher Miller (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Park and Mackinnon presents the first high-resolution (~3.4Å) structure of a human CLC channel, hCLC-1, solved by electron-cryomicroscopy. The overall architecture of the homodimeric protein is very similar to those of other solved CLC-family structures, and includes in each subunit a pore which is bifurcated on the cytosolic side and harbors three anion binding sites (S<sub>ext</sub>, S<sub>cen</sub>, S<sub>int</sub>). On the other hand, subtle differences in pore diameter and the side-chain chemistry of pore-lining residues helps to understand the very different functional properties of members of the channel and transporter subclass of the CLC family. The authors propose that channel-like behavior is due to (i) a reduced kinetic barrier for Cl<sup>-</sup> flux between S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>int</sub>, (ii) low-affinity anion binding in S<sub>cen</sub>, and (iii) a permissive (off-pore) position of the side-chain of the &quot;gating glutamate&quot; (Glu<sub>gate</sub>). These predictions are elegantly supported by functional analysis of a bacterial CLC transporter (EcCLC) mutated at various key positions. Overall, this is an excellent manuscript with no major concerns noted by the reviewers. Below are suggestions for three points that would benefit from a few more sentences of discussion, to help harmonize their mechanistic model with pre-existing data and literature.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Despite the off-pore position of Glu<sub>gate</sub>, the diameter of the external pore entrance is still too narrow to accommodate an ion. While this is not shocking, as all the CLC structures share this feature, it is still puzzling how such a pore can conduct ions at a rate of ~10<sup>6</sup> ions s<sup>-1</sup>. Along these lines, it would be helpful if the authors could discuss a bit more on Cl<sup>-</sup> throughput rates, and say something about the issue of electro-diffusive vs. uniporter-like Cl<sup>-</sup> flux.</p><p>2) CLC-1 is activated by extracellular pH. The current consensus open pore was Glu<sub>gate</sub> in the 'up' (E148Q-like structure of CLC-ec1) conformation. This explained well how CLC-1 could be activated by e.c. low pH, as Glu<sub>gate</sub> would be accessible to water and H<sup>+</sup> from the extracellular solution and stabilized in this state. If the sideways conformation of the Glu<sub>gate</sub> side chain seen in the new structure indeed reflects the open pore, then it is hard to envision how that side chain is protonated from the extracellular side, and how protonation would stabilize this state. Thus, it would be helpful if the authors could comment on the mechanism of CLC-1 activation by extracellular low pH.</p><p>3) The cartoon in Figure 7C suggests that the Glu<sub>gate</sub> side chain is itself the fast protopore gate. However, E-to-A mutations of Glu<sub>gate</sub> in Clc-0 (Dutzler et al., 2003), and evolutionary removal of Glu<sub>gate</sub> in Clc-K (L'Hoste et al., 2013, PMID: 23791703), result in channels in which the protopores are still seen to gate (open and close), albeit with high open probabilities. Wouldn't this suggest that the fast gate is not simply formed by the Glu<sub>gate</sub> side chain? Could the brief fluctuations of those channels reflect small movements of the pore lining residues that temporarily block permeation through the narrow channel pore?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36629.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Despite the off-pore position of Glu<sub>gate</sub>, the diameter of the external pore entrance is still too narrow to accommodate an ion.

In brief, we think scientists should change their expectations regarding pore diameter and throughput. Now with data to compare two CLC channel structures and multiple CLC transporter structures we can place data ahead of preconceived notion. We come to the same conclusion independently through the study of other ion channels. Take for example K<sup>+</sup> channels, in which the selectivity filter between ion binding sites is narrower than the diameter of a K<sup>+</sup> ion. In the added paragraph we explain that the chemical and electrostatic properties of atoms lining the pore and their dynamic properties (ability to move out of the way) will affect conductivity. This is in fact an old problem in biochemistry considered in other contexts such as diffusion of oxygen to the heme co-factor inside a protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) CLC-1 is activated by extracellular pH.

When Glu<sub>gate</sub> is mutated you do see some residual (much less frequent) gating/blocking events that are likely due to other changes in pore conformation or block (likely, because almost all ion channels exhibit such closing events). Therefore, no, these observations do not suggest to us that the fast gate is not formed by Glu<sub>gate</sub>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
