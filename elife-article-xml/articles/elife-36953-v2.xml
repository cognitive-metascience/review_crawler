receptors within tissues. However, how cytoneme formation is regulated remains unclear. Here, we show that Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) autocrine signaling controls the emergence of cytonemes, and that cytonemes subsequently control paracrine Wnt/β-catenin signal activation. Upon binding of the Wnt family member Wnt8a, the receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2 becomes activated. Ror2/PCP signaling leads to the induction of cytonemes, which mediate the transport of Wnt8a to neighboring cells. In the Wnt-receiving cells, Wnt8a on cytonemes triggers Wnt/β-catenin-dependent gene transcription and proliferation. We show that cytoneme-based Wnt transport operates in diverse processes, including zebrafish development, murine intestinal crypt and human cancer organoids, demonstrating that Wnt transport by cytonemes and its control via the Ror2 pathway is highly conserved in vertebrates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36953.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Communication helps the cells that make up tissues and organs to work together as a team. One way that cells share information with each other as tissues grow and develop is by exchanging signaling proteins. These interact with receptors on the surface of other cells; this causes the cell to change how it behaves.</p><p>The Wnt family of signaling proteins orchestrate organ development. Wnt proteins influence which types of cells develop, how fast they divide, and how and when they move. Relatively few cells, or small groups of cells, in developing tissues produce Wnt proteins, while larger groups nearby respond to the signals.</p><p>We do not fully understand how Wnt proteins travel between cells, but recent work revealed an unexpected mechanism – cells seem to hand-deliver their messages. Finger-like structures called cytonemes grow out of the cell membrane and carry Wnt proteins to their destination. If the cytonemes do not form properly the target cells do not behave correctly, which can lead to severe tissue malformation.</p><p>Mattes et al. have now investigated how cytonemes form using a combination of state-of-the-art genetic and high-resolution imaging techniques. In initial experiments involving zebrafish cells that were grown in the laboratory, Mattes et al. found that the Wnt proteins kick start their own transport; before they travel to their destination, they act on the cells that made them. A Wnt protein called Wnt8a activates the receptor Ror2 on the surface of the signal-producing cell. Ror2 then triggers signals inside the cell that begin the assembly of the cytonemes. The more Ror2 is activated, the more cytonemes the cell makes, and the more Wnt signals it can send out.</p><p>This mechanism operates in various tissues: Ror2 also controls the cytoneme transport process in living zebrafish embryos, the mouse intestine and human stomach tumors. This knowledge will help researchers to develop new ways to control Wnt signaling, which could help to produce new treatments for diseases ranging from cancers (for example in the stomach and bowel) to degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>signalling filopodia</kwd><kwd>cytonemes</kwd><kwd>patterning</kwd><kwd>Wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>protein trafficking</kwd><kwd>signalling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009318</institution-id><institution>Helmholtz Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Impuls- und Vernetzungsfond</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenbauer</surname><given-names>Jakob</given-names></name><name><surname>Schug</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK2039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nienhaus</surname><given-names>Gerd Ulrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000737</institution-id><institution>University of Exeter</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Living Systems Institute: start-up</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scholpp</surname><given-names>Steffen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Exploration</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scholpp</surname><given-names>Steffen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scho847-5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scholpp</surname><given-names>Steffen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009318</institution-id><institution>Helmholtz Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STN program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nienhaus</surname><given-names>Gerd Ulrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Wnt signaling regulates its effective signaling range by controlling Wnt ligand transport on signaling filopodia within vertebrate tissues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wnt signaling regulates development and tissue homeostasis in multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>), including processes such as cell fate specification, cell proliferation, morphogenesis, and maintenance of tissue integrity. Dysregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been causally linked to multiple diseases, with Wnt signaling being one of the most frequently dysregulated pathways in several cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anastas and Moon, 2013</xref>), including colorectal cancers, pancreatic cancer, and gastric cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chiurillo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Madan and Virshup, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The Wnt signaling network consists of several branches that can be classified according to the receptors involved and the specific signaling cascades that they activate. Two major branches of this network are the β-catenin-dependent pathway and the β-catenin-independent Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Niehrs, 2012</xref>). The β-catenin dependent pathway is triggered by the interaction of Wnt with Frizzled (Fzd) receptors and the co-receptor Lrp6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Logan and Nusse, 2004</xref>). Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates the expression of target genes such as <italic>axin2</italic> and <italic>lef1,</italic> as well as the expression of tissue-specific genes, and subsequently controls both cell proliferation and tissue patterning. In the β-catenin-independent Wnt/PCP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang and Mlodzik, 2015</xref>), Wnt proteins bind to Frizzled and to co-receptors such as the receptor-tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2) to regulate cytoskeleton organization by actin polymerization and cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grumolato et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oishi et al., 2003</xref>). To this end, the small GTPases Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42 are regulated to control the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, as well as cell motility and morphogenetic movements of cells in vertebrates. Although the PCP pathway and β-catenin signaling generally act in a mutually repressive fashion, by competing for similar hub proteins such as the effector protein Dishevelled (Dvl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">van Amerongen and Nusse, 2009</xref>), recent evidence suggests that PCP signaling can act — dependent on the context — either in opposition to, in concert with, or independently of β-catenin signaling.</p><p>The production and secretion of Wnt ligands requires lipid modification by the acyltransferase Porcupine (Porcn) followed by binding to Evi/Wls, which serves as a Wnt chaperone and facilitates its transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bartscherer and Boutros, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bänziger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). From there, lipophilic Wnt is transported through the neighboring tissue to exert its long-range signaling activity. Extracellular binding proteins have been suggested to increase the solubility of Wg/Wnt in the aqueous extracellular space and facilitate this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mii et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mulligan et al., 2012</xref>). Other studies, however, point to membrane-associated mechanisms of Wg/Wnt delivery, which do not compromise the signaling capability of Wg/Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McGough and Vincent, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Port and Basler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stanganello and Scholpp, 2016</xref>). These trafficking routes include Wg/Wnt protein distribution on the plasma membrane of dividing source cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farin et al., 2016</xref>) and actively migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Serralbo and Marcelle, 2014</xref>), or the dissemination of Wg/Wnt proteins on exovesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Panáková et al., 2005</xref>) (more specifically on exosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beckett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gross et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Korkut et al., 2009</xref>]). Wg/Wnt proteins and their receptors are also transported on cell protrusions in various tissues. Lipid-modified Wnt proteins were found at the cell membrane of signaling filopodia — so-called cytonemes — in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holzer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stanganello et al., 2015</xref>), whereas Fzd receptor proteins can be localized to filopodia in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang and Kornberg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sagar et al., 2015</xref>). In zebrafish, an analysis of cytonemes demonstrates that these are specialized filopodia, with stabilizing actin bundles at their cores, which serve as a main transport device for the β-catenin ligand Wnt8a during neural plate patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stanganello et al., 2015</xref>). Wnt8a is loaded on cytoneme tips and transferred to the neighboring cells by direct cell–cell contact. At the contact sites, Wnt8a cytonemes induce Lrp6/Fzd receptor clustering into the Lrp6 signalosome to activate β-catenin signaling. Although the lengths and numbers of cytonemes are crucial in determining the β-catenin signaling range during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stanganello et al., 2015</xref>), it is not yet clear what mechanism controls the formation of Wnt cytonemes in a tissue.</p><p>Here, we show that Wnt8a can activate both the PCP pathway by interaction with Ror2 and the β-catenin pathway by interaction with Lrp6. This dual function allows Wnt8a to control its own route of dissemination. In the source cells, Wnt8a binds and activates the Ror2 co-receptor followed by activation of the PCP pathway. Wnt8a-PCP influences convergent extension (CE) movement and activates the small GTPase Cdc42, which leads to the outgrowth of signaling filopodia. Wnt8a is loaded onto these cytonemes, and is transported through the tissue to bind to the β-catenin-specific co-receptor Lrp6 in the responding cells, examples being PAC2 fish fibroblasts and HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells, where it activates the β-catenin pathway in a paracrine fashion. Activation of the β-catenin pathway by Wnt cytonemes leads to target-gene induction, which in zebrafish, regulates neural plate patterning. Ror2-mediated Wnt cytonemes also regulate the proliferation of human gastric cancer cells. We also show that Wnt cytonemes induced by Ror2/PCP signaling are required for the maintenance of murine intestinal crypt organoids. We conclude that Ror2-regulated cytonemes are a critical transport route for Wnt proteins in vertebrates. The molecular mechanism for Wnt cytoneme formation illustrates the co-dependent interactions of the different branches of the Wnt signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tyrosine kinase receptor Ror2 regulates filopodia emergence in vitro</title><p>Cumulative evidence indicates that Wnt signal molecules are lipidated and remain associated with membranes during secretion, action and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>). Our previous work demonstrated that Wnt molecules can be distributed over distances of 100 µm through a tissue via cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stanganello et al., 2015</xref>). Manipulation of the length or number of Wnt cytonemes led to alterations in Wnt-mediated tissue patterning and malformations of the zebrafish embryo. Therefore, we hypothesized that the formation, emergence, and maintenance of cytonemes are tightly controlled. To identify potential cytoneme regulators, we performed a cell-culture-based genetic screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–J</xref>) by co-expressing Wnt8a-GFP and glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored, membrane-bound mCherry (memCherry) in PAC2 cells together with arrayed cDNA clones from a Medaka cDNA library consisting of 229 kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Souren et al., 2009</xref>).

To visualize these cytonemes, we generated cell clones at the embryonic margin expressing Wnt8a-GFP and memCherry. Wnt8a-GFP clusters were seen in the cell membrane and the cytoneme tips of germ ring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Statistically, more filopodia carrying Wnt8a-GFP clusters on their tips were detected upon Ror2 overexpression within cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Conversely, we found a significant reduction in the number of cytonemes in Ror2-deficient marginal cells. Wnt8a-GFP is still present at the plasma membranes of cells that have compromised Ror2 function, suggesting that intracellular routing of Wnt8a from the producing organelles to the cell membrane is independent of Ror2-dependent cytonemal transport. Filopodia without detectable Wnt8a seemed to be unaffected by Ror2 signaling in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This suggests a function of Ror2 in regulating a specific subset of filopodia, those carrying Wnt8a (the Wnt cytonemes), in the zebrafish embryo in vivo.</p><p>On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that Ror2 function in the Wnt source cells is crucial for Wnt dissemination via cytonemes. To test the consequences of altered Ror2 signaling quantitatively, we used a simulation of morphogen distribution via cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stanganello et al., 2015</xref>). The simulation takes into account ligand transport by cytonemes, ligand decay and the migration of epiblast cells using a Monte-Carlo-based direct event simulation approach. Employing cytonemes as the exclusive transport mechanism from the producing cell group to the target cell group, and assuming an unlimited source of the ligand, we found that cytonemes can distribute Wnt8a in a graded manner in the dynamically evolving target tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We tested two scenarios with varying cytoneme number, based on our in vivo measurements after alteration of Ror2 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We found that ligand concentration within the morphogenetic field depends on the appearance of the cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stanganello et al., 2015</xref>). We also found that increasing the number of cytonemes per cell (by the experimentally determined factor of 1.61) after expression of Ror2 and Wnt8a in the source cells leads to an enhanced ejection (187%) of the ligand into the target tissue when compared to that in the Wnt8a-producing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Consistently, by using the measured cytoneme parameters after blockage of Ror2 function (number scaled by 0.388), we found a decrease to 36% of the Wnt8a concentration compared to the WT situation and a smaller range of the morphogen gradient within the tissue. These data suggest that Ror2 signaling can specifically regulate the number of Wnt-positive cytonemes in vivo and thus represents a cytoneme-specific regulator. Furthermore, on the basis of the simulations, we predicted a strong decrease in the range of Wnt signal activation in the neighboring tissue when Ror2 function is compromised in the Wnt8a source cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Ror2 presents Wnt8a to the target cell to induce a ligand-receptor cluster</title><p>Next, we asked how Wnt8a and Ror2 interact to facilitate cytoneme-mediated transport. We used a high-resolution imaging approach in the developing zebrafish embryo that involved the overexpression of tagged constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The high-sensitivity of this image-based approach allowed us to reduce the expression levels of the tagged construct significantly, and morphological alterations of the embryonic phenotype were not observed at 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Using a time-lapse analysis, we observed the formation of Wnt8a-GFP-positive clusters, which transit in the plasma membrane of the secreting cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Then, Wnt8a co-localizes with Ror2 at the plasma membrane, suggesting Wnt8a-Ror2 cluster induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). These clusters initiate cytoneme formation and, consequently, they decorate the tip of the outgrowing cytoneme. The cytoneme contacts the target cell and Wnt8a-Ror2 forms a cluster at the receiving cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>). Within minutes, this cluster is endocytosed into the target cell. We wondered whether Wnt8a-Ror2 induces the Wnt signaling cascade in the target cell. Therefore, we analyzed Lrp6-signalosome formation at the plasma membrane of the target cell by induction of a Wnt8a-secreting cell clone and a Lrp6-expressing receiving cell clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We find that cytonemal Wnt8a-mCherry induces Lrp6-GFP cluster formation at the membrane of the target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). We hypothesized that the source cell presents Wnt8a by clustering the ligand on Ror2-positive cytonemes. Indeed, we observe a Lrp6-GFP cluster at the contact points of Ror2-positive cytonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Co-transfection of Wnt8a with dominant-negative Ror2<sup>3I</sup> resulted in a 34.6% decrease in reporter activation below the level seen in Wnt8a-transfected source cells. These findings support our simulations regarding the available Wnt8a concentration in the target tissue after alteration of Ror2-dependent cytoneme appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

Inhibition of Wnt signaling by the tankyrase inhibitor IWR1 abrogated the stimulatory effect of Ror2 expression, confirming that the Ror2 effect is due to increased Wnt signaling. We conclude that Wnt is moved on cytonemes between GC cells to stimulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling and proliferation of neighboring cells. Abrogation of this transport route has a consequence similar to that resulting from inhibition of Wnt signaling per se – it leads to reduced proliferation.</p><p>As the intestinal crypt requires a constant supply of Wnt signaling for tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beumer and Clevers, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuhnert et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pinto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sailaja et al., 2016</xref>), we asked whether Wnt cytonemes operate in the mouse intestinal crypt. In vivo, subepithelial myofibroblasts provide the major source of physiologically relevant Wnts, which maintain the crypt in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kabiri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Valenta et al., 2016</xref>). It has been further demonstrated that these PdgfRα-positive myofibroblasts regulate the intestinal stem-cell niche by Wnts and RSPO3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greicius et al., 2018</xref>). The intestinal myofibroblasts form a large number of filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The formation of filopodia is inhibited by siRNA-mediated knock-down of Ror2. We used an organoid formation assay to analyze the requirement of Wnt-signaling filopodia in the intestinal crypt. We used Wnt-deficient Porcn<sup>–/–</sup> crypt cells, co-cultivating them with Wnt3a-secreting L cells, to grow Wnt-deficient crypt organoids. Co-culture of WT myofibroblasts with Wnt-deficient crypt cells leads to induction and maintenance of crypt organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kabiri et al., 2014</xref>). These myofibroblasts extend filopodia to engulf crypt organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). When Ror2 was knocked down in the Wnt-producing myofibroblasts, we observed a substantial decrease in the number of organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). This suggests that the transport of Wnt signals on Ror2-dependent cytonemes from the myofibroblasts is crucial for the induction and maintenance of the intestinal crypt. We conclude that cytonemes are vital for Wnt protein dissemination in vertebrates and that their appearance is regulated by Ror2-mediated PCP signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cytonemes transport signaling molecules</title><p>Cytonemes are actin-based filopodia that transport an array of signaling molecules and their receptors, facilitating juxtacrine signaling.

A continuous adjustment of the number, length, rate of formation, direction, and retraction of cytonemes is crucial to regulate the exchange of signaling proteins within a tissue. However, how cytoneme formation is controlled remains unclear. Cytonemes change in response to signaling protein levels in the source cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sato and Kornberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stanganello et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that cytoneme formation is linked to signal production. A signaling pathway that influences cytoneme emergence is the Wnt signaling network. We have found that cytoneme initiation is linked to Wnt8a production. Wnt8a activates the PCP signaling pathway in ligand-producing cells and, in turn, PCP induces cytonemes, which can be loaded with Wnt protein. Data from <italic>Drosophila</italic> show that cytonemes require the PCP components Prickle and Vangl, which are essential for Fgf- and Dpp-positive cytonemes in the air sac primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang and Kornberg, 2016</xref>). Prickle/Vangl modulate heparin proteoglycan content in the extracellular matrix to allow cytoneme outgrowth. By contrast, we found that Wnt8a activates the PCP pathway via interaction with the Ror2 receptor to initiate cytoneme formation. Our in vivo analysis suggests that activation of Ror2 in the zebrafish embryonic margin is necessary and sufficient for the formation of Wnt cytonemes, as other filopodia remain unperturbed. We conclude that Ror2 is a specific cytoneme regulator.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Ror2 in filopodia formation</title><p>Ror2 is a member of the family of orphan receptor tyrosine kinases, possessing an extracellular Fzd-like CRD, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain, and a proline-rich domain (PRD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yoda et al., 2003</xref>). Ror2 plays crucial roles in developmental morphogenesis in vertebrates. Ror2-deficient mice exhibit skeletal, genital, and cardiovascular abnormalities caused by disrupted CE movements during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oishi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Takeuchi et al., 2000</xref>).

Irrespective of stimulation by Wnt proteins, ectopic expression of Ror2 can induce filopodia formation by actin polymerization via coupling of the Ror2-PRD to the actin-binding protein Filamin A. Our in vitro data show that Ror2 induces filopodia formation in PAC2 fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and gastric cancer cells. Moreover, we show that Ror2 is crucial for Wnt cytoneme formation in vivo, and it is known to contribute to cytoskeleton remodeling and JNK activation in migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oishi et al., 2003</xref>). We have previously shown that Wnt cytonemes require Cdc42 function to stabilize the intracytonemal actin skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stanganello et al., 2015</xref>).

Although there is in vitro evidence that multiple Wnts can associate with the CRD domain of Ror2, only a few Wnts have been demonstrated to elicit Ror2 activation in vivo. For example, Wnt1 and Wnt3a bind to the CRD domain of Ror2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Billiard et al., 2005</xref>) but neither altered receptor activity as assessed by levels of Ror2 autophosphorylation. <italic>Xenopus</italic> Wnt8 binds to the ectodomain of Ror2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hikasa et al., 2002</xref>) but it is not known whether XWnt8 induces Ror2 signaling. In zebrafish, evidence suggests that Wnt11 is a potential binding and signaling partner for Ror2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bai et al., 2014</xref>). Wnt11 activates Ror2 to modulate CE during zebrafish gastrulation. We have observed that Wnt8a co-localizes with Ror2 in cytonemes. Although tagged constructs have been examined at very low concentration, this does not necessarily imply correct subcellular localization. However, our results are in line with studies on endogenous Wnt8a localization on cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stanganello et al., 2015</xref>) and with studies on Ror2 localization on filopodia in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paganoni and Ferreira, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Laird et al., 2011</xref>) and in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nishita et al., 2006</xref>; Brinkmann et al., 2016). We have further observed that Wnt8a binds and activates Ror2 signaling in vitro and in vivo. It is possible that other β-catenin-independent Wnts, such as Wnt5a and Wnt11, might induce Ror2 cytonemes to regulate β-catenin Wnt ligand trafficking and thus β-catenin signaling. Wnt5A and Wnt11 are known to regulate the dorso-ventral patterning of the neural tube and somites in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andre et al., 2015</xref>). However, the observed patterning defect and AP axis shortening in Wnt5A/Wnt11 double-knockout mice was explained by migration alteration of the axial mesoderm.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Interaction of the Wnt signaling branches</title><p>Binding of Wnt proteins to their cognate Frizzled receptors activates several distinct signaling pathways, including the canonical Lrp6/β-catenin-dependent and the non-canonical Ror2/β-catenin-independent PCP pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Niehrs, 2012</xref>). According to the conventional classification, Wnt1, Wnt3a, and Wnt8a belong to the β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling proteins, whereas Wnt5a and Wnt11 are representatives of the β-catenin-independent Wnt signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kikuchi et al., 2011</xref>). Activation of the Ror2/PCP signaling branch is assumed to repress the β-catenin signaling branch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Niehrs, 2012</xref>). Both Wnt signaling branches use the same hub proteins as intracellular effectors, which may lead to competition and mutual repression. For example, Wnt5a, which preferentially activates PCP signaling, competes with Wnt3a for Fzd2 and thus inhibits the β-catenin-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sato et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, Ror2 is thought to act by sequestering β-catenin Wnt ligands, a function that is independent of its intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Green et al., 2007</xref>). In tissue culture, intracellular Ror2 signaling represses β-catenin signaling via its tyrosine kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mikels et al., 2006</xref>) and its interaction with Dvl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Witte et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, intracellular binding partners such as Tak1 interact with the C-terminal region of Ror2 to further inhibit Wnt/β-Catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Winkel et al., 2008</xref>). However, recent work reported that Ror2 signaling is able to enhance β-catenin-mediated signaling and proliferation in several tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rasmussen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Roarty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yan and Lin, 2008</xref>). These apparently contradictory results could be explained by cross-regulation of Ror2 and the β-catenin signaling being influenced by tissue heterogeneity. This might occur, for example, during tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Roarty et al., 2017</xref>) when depending on the repertoire of Wnt signaling components present, Ror2-expressing tumor cells regulate the spatial distribution, duration, and amplitude of Wnt/β-catenin signaling within a tumor. Our data provide a mechanistic explanation for this effect. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of Ror2 activation within the Wnt source cells, we hypothesize that the Ror2/PCP signaling pathway is activated in an autocrine fashion on the basis of our observations of the behavior of individual cells in cell culture and in the embryo. We further provide evidence that Ror2/PCP-dependent signaling is crucial for cytoneme emergence in Wnt source cells. Then, cytonemes transmit Wnt ligands to neighboring cells to activate juxtacrine β-catenin signaling. We demonstrate the importance of separating Wnt-producing from Wnt-receiving cells by showing that Ror2-mediated Wnt transport is required for controlling cell proliferation in AGS gastric cells. AGS cells express Wnt ligands such as Wnt1, display a high endogenous β-catenin level, and show enhanced proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The anti-cancer drug salinomycin inhibits β-catenin signaling by inducing degradation of the Wnt co-receptor Lrp6, resulting in reduced proliferation.

However, gastric tumors display a high degree of tissue heterogeneity and we find that Ror2 can also enhance β-catenin signaling and consequently cell proliferation. Our experimental approach is fundamentally different to that of the former analysis: Wnt-producing cells and Wnt-receiving cells are treated separately. We find that Ror2 activation in the Wnt-producing cells increases proliferation in the Wnt-receiving cells. This hypothesis is supported by recent findings showing that Wnt-Ror2-positive mesenchymal cells promote gastric cancer cell proliferation if co-cultivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Takiguchi et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Cytonemes are a general carrier for Wnt protein dissemination</title><p>Here, we describe Ror2/PCP-induced cytonemes as transport carrier for Wnt8a in zebrafish. In cell culture experiments, we use PAC2 fibroblasts and HEK293T cells to provide further evidence for the importance of Ror2-dependent cytonemes in Wnt trafficking. In addition, we show that human gastric cancer cells AGS, which primarily express the Wnt ligand Wnt1, process paracrine Wnt signaling via cytonemes, which are influenced by Ror2 signaling. Finally, we use murine intestinal stroma cells, which express Wnt2b to maintain the Wnt gradient operating in the intestinal crypt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aoki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kabiri et al., 2014</xref>).

In summary, we show that autocrine PCP pathway activation via Ror2 induces Wnt cytonemes in the Wnt source cell to transmit Wnt to the neighboring cell to activate paracrine Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We propose cytonemes as an general mechanism for the mobilization of Wnt ligands in tissue homeostasis as well as in development in vertebrates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>The following plasmids were used: pCS2 + zfWnt8aORF1 (Addgene 17048), pCS2 + zfWnt8aORF1-GFP, pCS2 + zfWnt8aORF1-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stanganello et al., 2015</xref>), pCS2 + xWnt5 a-GFP, pCS2 + zfWnt5 b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wallkamm et al., 2014</xref>), xRor2-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feike et al., 2010</xref>), xRor2<sup>3I</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Casella et al., 1981</xref>), mRor2-dCRD-GFP, pCS2 +Fz7 a-CFP, pcDNA3-EGFP-Cdc42T17N (Addgene 12976), 7xTRE Super TOPFlash-NLS-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moro et al., 2012</xref>), pmKate2-f-mem (Evrogen), GPI-anchored mCherry in pCS2+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Scholpp et al., 2009</xref>), IRSp53<sup>4K</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Casella et al., 1981</xref>).

(2015</xref>). The modelling of the tissue is split up into two subproblems (1) the correct modelling of the dynamically forming tissue and (2) the morphogen transport through that tissue. The tissue dynamics are modelled by a two-dimensional non-periodic plane of discrete cells. The simulated area is 1,000 µm by 1,000 µm in size and each cell occupies a circle of 8 µm radius. Possible cell positions are precomputed and kept fixed during the course of the simulation. Cells can change positions by moving along those precomputed positions. In every simulation step (Δt = 1 s), it is possible for each individual cell to perform actions with predetermined probabilities, which are directly derived from experimental measurements.</p><p>Possible actions are: (i) signaling from the producing tissue, (ii) cell insertion by division or intercalation of the receiving tissue, (iii) cell migration — directed or non-directed nearest neighbor swapping of the receiving tissue, and (iv) morphogen decay in the receiving tissue. Two different cell types are distinguished. The marginal, Wnt active cells produce morphogen and are able to deposit morphogen via cytonemes into cells of the receiving tissue. Once a signaling event is accepted for a marginal cell, an angle is randomly chosen from the respective distribution determined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stanganello et al. (2015</xref>). The length is randomly chosen from a Gaussian distribution with the peak value l<sub>filo</sub>. A virtual filopodium is formed with those values originating from the marginal cell. If the tip of the filopodium ends up in the vicinity of the surface of a receiving cell (±2 µm) the Wnt content of that cell is increased, otherwise the filopodium is deleted.</p><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Probabilities used in the simulation</title><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Signaling probability (p<sub>filo</sub>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">WT</td><td valign="top"><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>30</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula></p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ror2</td><td valign="top"><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mn>1.61</mml:mn><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>30</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.0537</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula></p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ror2<sup>3I</sup></td><td valign="top"><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mn>0.338</mml:mn><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>30</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.0113</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula></p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Tissue expansion during neural plate patterning is driven by the intercalation of cell layers during the thinning out of the cell sheet as well as during cell division. As we are only modelling one cell layer, both of these processes can be incorporated into a single action, namely cell insertions. If a cell insertion event is accepted in a receiving cell, a path to the nearest empty grid spot is obtained and all cells are subsequently moved along that path. The emerging empty grid spot is then filled with a randomly chosen cell with the same distance ±6 µm from the marginal cells. To include the highly dynamic intermingling of the cells during that process, an additional action — cell migration — is added. This action allows for a cell to swap places with a randomly chosen nearest neighbor cell. Morphogen decay inside the receiving tissue is implemented by an action that decreases the Wnt content of the cell once accepted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Luciferase reporter assay in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos</title><p>For the ATF2 luciferase reporter assay, four-cellstage <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos were injected into animal ventral blastomeres along with the 100 pg ATF2-luciferase reporter plasmid and 10 pg TK-Renilla-luciferase reporter plasmid. The reporter plasmids were injected alone or together with 500 pg of the respective synthetic mRNAs. Luciferase reporter assays were carried out using triplicates of five-gastrula-stage (st.12) embryos lysed to measure luciferase activity using the dual luciferase system (Promega).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Image acquisition</title><p>For confocal analysis, live embryos were embedded in 0.7% low melting agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 1x Ringer’s solution. Images of cells and embryos were obtained with a Leica TCS SP5 X or SP8X confocal laser-scanning microscope using 20x or 63x dip-in objective or, for the kinase library screen, a Leica DMI600SD with 20x objective. Image processing was performed with Imaris 9.1 software (Bitplane AG, Switzerland). Filopodia and cytoneme measurements from confocal z-stacks of living embryos was performed via the semi-automated filopodia analysis software described before. Cell culture quantifications were carried out using Fiji software. Roundness of notochordal embryo cells was determined by calculating the width to length ratio of each cell in Fiji.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All experiments were carried out at least in biological triplicates if not indicated otherwise. Significance was calculated by Student’s t-test and asterisks are used to indicate p values. One-way ANOVA was used to analyse groups of experimental data. All groups are random samples from the same population. Variances are similar across treatments and residuals are normally distributed. P values, F values and degrees of freedom (df) are indicated. Box plots: centre lines show the medians; box limits indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles as determined by R software; whiskers extend 1.5 times the interquartile range from the 25th and 75th percentiles, outliers are represented by dots.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project was funded by the Living Systems Institute, the University of Exeter and the Boehringer Ingelheim Foundation (awards to SS).

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cytonemes bridge Wnt autocrine and paracrine signaling systems&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Ajay B. Chitnis (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviews are very positive and agree that the findings are interesting and should make an important contribution to the field. There are some issues for the authors to consider in a revised version. Most are related to presentation and statistical analysis; the major issue is that because the imaging experiments are based on over expression, it is essential that the authors demonstrate that the measurements, observations and interpretations are not skewed by the over expression. One way would be to analyze fusion proteins expressed at physiological levels using endogenous regulatory sequences. If this cannot be accomplished in a several month time frame, perhaps it would be possible to assess localization of protein distribution at low expression levels under conditions of limited RNA abundance.</p><p>Specific requests (many of which do not require additional experiments):</p><p>1) The evidence for clustering of Wnt8a and Ror2 could be stronger. The authors do recognize the risk of non-specific clustering due to overexpression, and so test a CRD-deleted version of Ror2, which seems to result in less clustering. Nevertheless, the example plots in Figure 2B show only partial regions of single cells, and so it is difficult to assess the correlation or lack thereof across construct types. A more compelling demonstration would show these same sorts of data for multiple cells with appropriate statistical analyses to assess changes in correlation strength, and reporting for sample sizes. The lsFCS analysis would seem to also benefit from a comparison of CRD-deleted Ror2 to native Ror2.</p><p>2) The presentation of Wnt8a transport and Lrp6 clustering in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 is confusing. Delineation of the target cell from brightfield comparison does not seem to match evident cell boundaries –.…is this a consequence of a different focal plane? The statement that of clusters &quot;dissolve&quot; in the membrane of the extending cell is unclear (&quot;enter,&quot; &quot;transit&quot;?). Additionally the authors describe the formation of Lrp6-GFP clusters but it is not clear if clustering dynamics have been observed or only fully formed clusters. Finally, to better demonstrate that Wnt8 is actually endocytosed it would seem useful to display orthogonal views to illustrate the presence of reporter within the target cell.</p><p>3) Statistical analyses need to be improved. Besides the issue raised in #1 above, the authors should throughout provide test statistics with degrees of freedom (and thus indication of sample size) in addition to P values. Presentations of significant differences for means should also include overall ANOVA with corrections for multiple comparisons. Since experimental treatments seem to be sometimes compared to controls and sometimes to one another, it would be preferable to simply indicate means that are not significantly different from one another in post hoc analyses (e.g., using letter codes). It is also unclear whether data obtained meet the assumptions of the statistics used. For example, in the second paragraph of the subsection “Ror2 dependent cytonemes in cancer cells and intestinal organoids”, it states that IRSp53-4K/Ror2 cells are significantly reduced in proliferation compared to Ror2 cells. Yet a major difference illustrated in the plot would seem to be a change in variance, which would likely require a transformation for analyzing appropriately, and it is not clear from the plot what the significance level of this comparison might be. Similarly in the first paragraph of the subsection “Ror2 induces Wnt-cytonemes during zebrafish neural patterning”, it notes that significant differences in filopodia numbers and lengths were observed across stages, yet Figure 4B does not clearly illustrate stage differences in lengths, only numbers. Finally, it is not clear why the authors present individual data points in 7G but only histograms or box plots elsewhere.</p><p>4) The ways in which authors distinguish cytonemes from other filopodia are not clear. The data presented in Figure 4F to argue that are Ror2 regulates a specific class of Wnt8a+ cytonemes also need clarification. For instance, are the number of Wnt8+ and Wnt8- cytonemes (filopodia?) being compared within cells, or totals across cells? Given the alternative &quot;states&quot; of cytonemes, comparisons involving chi-square analyses would seem more appropriate. Likewise the example cells illustrated in Figure 4E seem to be especially extreme cases, and so perhaps not representative of the overall dataset.</p><p>5) The simulation results in Figure 4G are potentially interesting as a follow up to the prior work. However, the authors need to more clearly indicate how the changes in numbers of cytonemes used in the simulations correspond to those obtained empirically: are they over the same order of magnitude? There also should be more explanation as to whether the simulations account for variation in lengths of individual cytonemes, and changes in the frequencies of cytonemes across stages as observed in Figure 4B. Finally, the simulations would be more powerful were it possible to assign specific times (e.g., hpf) or distances (μM), rather than relative values only.</p><p>6) The authors have several useful reagents for manipulating cytonemes. But there is always a concern about off-target effects of dominant negative constructs, and the potential that other pathways could be involved. With regard to Ror2 in particular, it would be useful to know whether the Ror2 morpholino used for analyses of PCP signaling, causes a loss of cytonemes similar to that of the dominant negative. Likewise, are cell behaviors unrelated to cytoneme extension and signaling unchanged in cells manipulated for Ror2 function, IRSp53, etc.? Indeed the evidence that cytoneme formation is strictly dependent n PCP signaling is somewhat circumstantial in the sense that defects in convergent extension are consistent with PCP defects, and Ror2 is known to function in PCP signaling; the authors might therefore be more circumspect about potential roles for other pathways or other ways in which Ror2 might function.</p><p>7) The authors describe a computational model that supports their experimental observation. While this adds to strength of the paper, I felt not enough detail about this model was provided for me to evaluate it.</p><p>8) Figure 2 presents data to demonstrate the specificity of interaction between Wnt8a-GFP and its receptor, Ror2-mcherry. With the data in Figure 2A/B, they attempt to show that these proteins interact, based on the colocalization of these proteins at the cell surface. Although they show an example of a correlative intensity tracing (Figure 2B), it is unfortunately not evident for this to be the case in the raw data shown in Figure 2A/middle panel: the fluorescence intensity of Ror2-mCherry appears uniform along the plasma membrane particularly at the sites showing the Wnt8-GFP spots. I think it is important to show not only more examples, but also to present a serious statistical analysis of how often and to what extent they detect colocalization.</p><p>Figure 2C/E shows an example of IsFCS analysis. This example is consistent with molecular association in regions of colocalization based on similar cross correlation and auto-correlation profiles and longer lag times, hence slower diffusion. As indicated above, I think it is important to show more examples, and clearly describe the number of events that where analyzed and clarify whether it is always the case that colocalization equates to complex formation.</p><p>Not clear from this analysis, is the possible influence that expression level might have on the outcomes and determinations. I think this is important particularly since it is likely that the tagged proteins are expressed at a significantly higher level than endogenous. The authors should also indicate the sensitivity of their microscopes, so that one can estimate the number of proteins that engaged as complexes.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cytonemes bridge Wnt autocrine and paracrine signaling systems&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>Thank you for attending to issues that were previously raised, but we are not convinced that the revised manuscript addresses all of the substantive concerns. I would think that the following issues could be addressed without undue further effort or delay.</p><p>1) The robustness of colocalization analyses remain unclear given the apparently limited sampling. Although Pearson coefficients, as well as a different look up table, are helpful, they do not really address the issue of sampling adequacy. With conclusions based apparently on one cell per treatment it is difficult to know how representative these observations might be. Is it possible to expand the analysis to multiple/more cells?</p><p>2) Although sample sizes and overall P values have been added in places, the authors still do not report test statistics (e.g., F values) or their associated degrees of freedom, which are also important for evaluating the robustness of their inferences. Similarly they have not addressed whether their data meet the assumptions of ANOVA or t-tests, specifically that variances are similar across treatments and residuals are normally distributed.</p><p>3) The issue of whether or not fluorescent proteins are properly localized remains somewhat murky. The authors have provided additional data to show that concentrations used did not result in overt morphological defects. Yet apparently normal morphology does not necessarily imply correct subcellular localization. The analyses would have inspired more confidence if localization had been examined at very low concentrations of injected construct, or across a range of concentrations. Minimally, clear statements of caveats associated with these analyses would seem important.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36953.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviews are very positive and agree that the findings are interesting and should make an important contribution to the field.

Furthermore, we added a Ror2-specific knock-down approach, which confirmed our results (Figure 3, 4).</p><p>To investigate the localisation of Ror2 during cytoneme initiation we used a tagged version of Ror2, Ror2-mCherry. To rule out over expression artefacts caused by the tagged constructs, we expressed Ror2-mCherry at a sub-functional level. To better illustrate this approach, we added a titration experiment for the various concentrations investigating the phenotypic alterations after overexpression (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). Based on this analysis, we chose an mRNA concentration for Ror2-mCherry of 25ng/µl for all following experiments. We added the amendments to the text (subsection “Cluster formation of Wnt8a and Ror2 is dependent on the CRD domain”) and the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific requests (many of which do not require additional experiments):</p><p>1) The evidence for clustering of Wnt8a and Ror2 could be stronger.

Therefore, we would rather tackle the experimental suggestions in an alternative way: To improve our data set, we provided an extended analysis of co-localization with the CRD deleted Ror2 (Figure 2B, Figure 2—figure supplement 1G). We added a Pearson colocalization analysis to demonstrate the significant alterations in co-localization between the individual constructs. We further improved description in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The presentation of Wnt8a transport and Lrp6 clustering in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 is confusing.

Furthermore, we added the description about the experimental settings (e.g. focal plane) and added orthogonal views if possible.

Therefore, we added ANOVA tests to the following Figures: 2E, 3D, 4B, D, 6D, 7C, D, F, G. We also included the individual p values into the figure legends.

Therefore, we analysed the formation of cytonemes in Ror2 deficient cells after Morpholino-based knock-down. The observed phenotype supports our findings from the studies with the DN-Ror2. We added quantifications of filopodia and Wnt8a-GFP cytoneme with Ror2 MO to Figure 4E and F (In split bar diagrams, see our second response comment 4).
