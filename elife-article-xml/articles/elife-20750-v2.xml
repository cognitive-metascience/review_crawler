We found that the RNA- binding protein Sam68 (Khdrbs1) is strongly expressed in neurogenic areas of the neocortex and supports the self-renewing potential of mouse NPCs. Knockout of <italic>Khdrbs1</italic> constricted the pool of proliferating NPCs by accelerating their cell cycle exit and differentiation into post-mitotic neurons. Sam68 function was linked to regulation of <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> pre-mRNA 3'-end processing. Binding of Sam68 to an intronic polyadenylation site prevents its recognition and premature transcript termination, favoring expression of a functional enzyme. The lower ALDH1A3 expression and activity in <italic>Khdrbs1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> NPCs results in reduced glycolysis and clonogenicity, thus depleting the embryonic NPC pool and limiting cortical expansion. Our study identifies Sam68 as a key regulator of NPC self-renewal and establishes a novel link between modulation of ALDH1A3 expression and maintenance of high glycolytic metabolism in the developing cortex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20750.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20750.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20750.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons develop from cells called neural progenitors. These cells can either divide to produce more progenitor cells or develop into specific types of neurons. These two activities – known as self-renewal and differentiation – must be balanced to produce the right number of specialized neurons, without depleting the pool of progenitor cells. The self-renewal and differentiation of progenitor cells is balanced by essentially regulating which genes are active, or expressed, within the cells.</p><p>In the first step of gene expression, the genetic instructions are copied to form a molecule of pre-messenger RNA (or pre-mRNA for short). Each pre-mRNA molecule is then processed to produce a final product that can be translated into protein. Importantly, two copies of the same pre-mRNA may sometimes be processed in different ways, which allows multiple proteins to be produced from a single gene.</p><p>RNA-binding proteins control pre-mRNA processing. The expression of one such protein, called Sam68, oscillates during the development of the nervous system, such that its expression peaks when there is intense production of new neurons and then declines. However, it was not known whether Sam68 actually helps neurons to develop.</p><p>La Rosa et al. have now analysed the role of Sam68 in the developing brain of mice. The experiments confirmed that Sam68 is highly expressed in neural progenitor cells and showed that its levels dictate the cell’s fate: high expression encourages a cell to self-renew, while low expression triggers it to develop into a specialized neuron.</p><p>Further investigation revealed that Sam68 works by promoting the expression of a metabolic enzyme called Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1A3 or ALDH1A3. This enzyme promotes the release of energy from molecules of glucose via a process known as anaerobic glycolysis. La Rosa et al. found that cells that lack Sam68 make a truncated version of the pre-mRNA encoding ALDH1A3. This truncated pre-mRNA encodes a shortened version of the enzyme that is inactive. Further experiments confirmed that Sam68 normally prevents this from happening by binding to the pre-mRNA and processing it to produce the full-length, working version of the ALDH1A3 enzyme. Also, La Rosa et al. found that progenitor cells need working ALDH1A3 to keep them dividing, and to stop them from developing into specialized neurons too soon.</p><p>Finally, because the processing of pre-RNA plays a major role in brain development, problems with this process often lead to intellectual disabilities and neurodegenerative diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The next step following on from these new findings will be to investigate whether defects in Sam68 contribute to such conditions and, if so, to look for ways to counteract these defects.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20750.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20750.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Sam68</kwd><kwd>pre-mRNA processing</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>ALDH1A3</kwd><kwd>neural progenitor cells</kwd><kwd>glycolytic metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Telethon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GGP14095</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sette</surname><given-names>Claudio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Associazione Italiana Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG14581</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sette</surname><given-names>Claudio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005202</institution-id><institution>Muscular Dystrophy Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sette</surname><given-names>Claudio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Telethon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GGP 12189</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sette</surname><given-names>Claudio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The RNA binding protein Sam68 links a key metabolic route to the neural stem cell fate in the developing mouse brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurogenesis is the process that leads to a regionalized brain from an embryonic neuroepithelium. In the mouse developing brain, most neurons are generated between the 10th day of embryonal life (E10) and birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martynoga et al., 2012</xref>), even though adult neurogenesis persists in restricted areas near the lateral ventricles, the ventricular (VZ) and subventricular (SVZ) zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bjornsson et al., 2015</xref>), and in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Urbán and Guillemot, 2014</xref>). Neurogenesis is fueled by specialized stem cells that are collectively named Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells (NPCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johansson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taverna et al., 2014</xref>). As embryonic neurogenesis starts, neuroepithelial cells at first, and radial glia cells (RGCs) later, divide symmetrically in the VZ, to generate cells retaining self-renewal capacity, or asymetrically to give rise to intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) or differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paridaen and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taverna et al., 2014</xref>). IPCs divide away from the VZ, one or more times, before they generate post-mitotic neurons, which localize in the basal compartment of the developing cortex (cortical layer). These divisions of neural precursors need to be tightly modulated, as proper regulation of neurogenesis is of paramount importance to achieve the right number of neurons and the correct expansion and stratification of the cortex during development. In particular, fine-tuned control of NPC fate is required to balance self-renewing divisions with asymmetric divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taverna et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernández et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, dysregulation of neurogenesis can result in developmental disorders linked to neurological pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun and Hevner, 2014</xref>). Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms that control neurogenesis may pave the path to novel approaches to these diseases.</p><p>Multiple mechanisms, including regulation of metabolic routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shyh-Chang et al., 2013</xref>) and of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paridaen and Huttner, 2014</xref>), cooperate to create an interconnected network that balances NPC self-renewal and differentiation in the correct time and space during cortical expansion. Mounting evidence documents that modulation of RNA metabolism, and particularly of alternative splicing, plays a key role in neurogenesis and during formation of neuronal circuits, as highlighted by the global changes in the splicing signature that accompany the transition from NPCs to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zheng and Black, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raj and Blencowe, 2015</xref>). Splicing is operated by the spliceosome, a large ribonucleoprotein machinery that mediates sequentially ordered reactions to excise introns and ligate exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>). Through regulated assortment of multiple exons and introns during pre-mRNA processing, alternative splicing allows the production of many splice variants from most genes, thus greatly amplifying the coding potential and plasticity of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>). Notably, brain is among the tissues displaying the largest extent of alternative splicing, which likely contributes to the complexity of neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raj and Blencowe, 2015</xref>). In support of this notion, several splicing factors have been shown to play key roles during neurogenesis and/or specific brain functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raj and Blencowe, 2015</xref>). For instance, a temporal switch in the expression of two homologous polypyrimidine-tract-binding proteins, PTBP1 and PTBP2, governs splicing of a large set of neural-specific exons in genes involved in neuronal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>). Knockout of the <italic>Ptbp2</italic> gene caused premature neurogenesis and depletion of the NPC pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>), proving the crucial role played by this splicing factor in the developing brain. Similarly, the neural-specific serine-arginine (SR)-related protein of 100 kDa (nSR100) regulates a network of exons in genes involved in neuronal functions and knockout of this gene in mice leads to widespread neurodevelopmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calarco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Quesnel-Vallières et al., 2015</xref>). Another splicing factor involved in neuronal functions is Sam68, encoded by the <italic>Khdrbs1</italic> gene, which is highly expressed in brain and testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paronetto et al., 2009</xref>), and it was shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sellier et al., 2010</xref>) and spinal muscular atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pedrotti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pagliarini et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, Sam68 modulates splicing of the neurexin one gene (<italic>Nrxn1</italic>) in response to neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iijima et al., 2011</xref>) and its ablation caused altered synaptic plasticity and motor coordination defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lukong and Richard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iijima et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have investigated the role of Sam68 during the development of the central nervous system. Sam68 is strongly expressed during cortical expansion (E10.5–15.5), whereas its levels decline after birth. We found that Sam68 regulates the switch between self-renewal and differentiation of mouse NPCs both in vivo and in vitro. Splicing-sensitive microarrays identified a subset of genes and exons whose expression is dependent on Sam68 in NPCs. In particular, Sam68 prevents usage of a cryptic polyadenylation signal (PAS) in intron 7 of the Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1A3 (<italic>Aldh1a3</italic>) gene, thus promoting the expression of a functional enzyme. We also found that ALDH1A3 enhances anaerobic glycolytic metabolism in NPCs and that enforcing its activity rescued the self-renewal defect of Sam68 knockout (<italic>Khdrbs1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) NPCs. Conversely, <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> knockdown in wild-type cells mimicked the phenotype of Sam68 knockout NPCs, by reducing glycolytic activity and promoting neuronal differentiation. Thus, our work unveils a key role of Sam68 in neurogenesis through regulation of <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> pre-mRNA processing, which results in the modulation of glycolytic metabolism and NPC fate during cortical development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sam68 is highly expressed in neurogenic cells of the developing cortex</title><p>Sam68 is a KH-domain RNA-binding protein involved in several steps of RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bielli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frisone et al., 2015</xref>). Developmental analysis of the mouse cortex showed that Sam68 mRNA and protein levels peak between E13.5 and E15.5, whereas its expression slowly declines thereafter and is minimal from 9 days post-partum (9dpp) until adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The peak of Sam68 expression corresponds to stages of intense neurogenesis in the developing cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paridaen and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taverna et al., 2014</xref>) and parallels that of the NPC marker SOX2, which is also high between E10.5 and E15.5 and sharply decreases in post-natal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, Sam68 is strongly expressed in neurogenic periventricular regions of E13.5 brain, like SOX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Sam68 and SOX2 co-localized in most cells of the VZ and SVZ of E13.5 cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and their expression was even more restricted to these cortical zones at 1dpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results suggested that Sam68 expression is high in NPCs and declines upon differentiation. To test this hypothesis, NPCs were isolated from E13.5 cortex and cultured in vitro under proliferating or differentiating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertram et al., 2012</xref>). Sam68, like SOX2, was abundant in proliferating NPC (0d) and steadily decreased when cells were induced to differentiate (1d-6d in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Conversely, expression of the neuronal marker TUBB3 (βIII-tubulin) was barely detectable in proliferating NPCs and augmented upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>).

To this end, proliferating cells were labeled by injecting BrdU in pregnant females at 13.5 days post-coitum (dpc) 2 hr before embryo (E13.5) collection.

RGCs express the transcription factor PAX6 and divide in the VZ and SVZ (apical layers). IPCs express the transcription factor TBR2, are derived from RGCs and divide one or more times away from the VZ before they generate post-mitotic neurons, which localize in the basal compartment of the cortex (cortical layer) and express the transcription factor TBR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Englund et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, these three markers are expressed in sequentially ordered manner from the apical (PAX6) to the basal (TBR1) layer of the E13.5 neuroepithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Strikingly, total (PAX6<sup>+</sup> cells) and proliferating RGCs (PAX6<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells) and IPCs (TBR2<sup>+</sup> and TBR2<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells) were markedly reduced in the knockout cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), whereas differentiated neurons (TBR1<sup>+</sup> cells) were almost doubled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

To directly test this hypothesis, we injected pregnant females at 12.5dpc with BrdU and collected the embryos 48 hr later (E14.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Co-staining with the Ki67 proliferation marker revealed that the fraction of NPCs that exited the cell cycle (Ki67<sup>-</sup>/BrdU<sup>+</sup>/ BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells) in the E12.5-E14.5 time-frame was significantly increased in <italic>Khdrbs1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, in wild-type embryos, ~30% of post-mitotic neurons were also labeled with BrdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that only a subset of NPCs underwent terminal differentiation within 48 hr. By contrast, this process was strongly enhanced in knockout embryos, with more than 80% of TBR1-positive cells that were labeled with BrdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Splicing-sensitive exon arrays identified 254 annotated genes regulated at the expression levels and 117 exons in 87 genes regulated at the splicing level in knockout NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Sam68 generally acted as a repressor of expression and the majority of targets were upregulated in knockout NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). By contrast, Sam68 functioned as splicing enhancer for target exons, with little overlap between genes regulated at expression and splicing level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Exon cassette was the predominant splicing event regulated by Sam68 in NPCs, followed by alternative last exon selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Notably, gene ontology analysis highlighted significant enrichment of functional categories related to neuron and oligodendrocyte properties (cluster 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>), thus supporting the pro-differentiation effect of Sam68 depletion in NPCs. For instance, genes encoding neuronal proteins like FXYD, a transmembrane modulator of the Na, K-ATPase enzyme linked to RETT syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2007</xref>), and DDC, the DOPA decarboxilase that catalyzes dopamine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertoldi, 2014</xref>), were upregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Thus, we further investigated the functional relevance of splicing-regulated genes to identify targets that could cause the phenotype of knockout NPCs. Among the 87 genes identified in the array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4-source data file 2</xref>), we focused on <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> for its potential relevance in NPCs. Indeed, ALDH1A3 was shown to support self-renewal and clonogenic potential of cancer stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duan et al., 2016</xref>), including glioma stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mao et al., 2013</xref>), which can differentiate into neurons and glial cells like NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lathia et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The 5' region of the <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> transcript (exons 1–7) was upregulated in <italic>Khdrbs1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> NPCs, whereas the 3' region (exons 8–13) was downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Closer inspection of the array results highlighted the potential upregulation of a cryptic alternative last exon (ALE) residing in the proximal part of intron 7, suggesting the existence of an alternative PAS in this intron and premature termination of the transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To verify this hypothesis, we performed 3'-RACE experiments using an oligo-dT anchor as reverse primer and forward primers located in the 5' region of intron 7 (primer 1) and at the exon-intron junction (primer 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Both primers amplified a distinct band from <italic>Khdrbs1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> NPCs RNA, whereas only faint bands of various sizes were detected in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Sequencing of the 3'-RACE products amplified in knockout NPCs revealed usage of an alternative PAS in intron 7 that is followed by two potential cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). To confirm this result, and to rule out accumulation of intron 7-containing pre-mRNA, we performed RT-PCR analyses using a forward primer in exon 6 and reverse primers located either upstream (primers 1 and 2) or downstream (primer 3) of the alternative PAS and cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). A spliced transcript containing intron 7 sequences could be amplified only with the primers situated upstream of the alternative PAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We hypothesized that Sam68 can bind the cryptic PAS in intron 7 in wild-type NPCs, thus preventing its recognition and blocking premature termination of the pre-mRNA.

However, we did not detect a band corresponding to the truncated protein (ALDH1A3△) originating from the ALE in intron 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Blocking the proteasome by incubation with MG132 did not lead to ALDH1A3△ accumulation, whereas interference with autophagy using chloroquine caused a mild accumulation of a protein product slightly smaller than the recombinant ALDH1A3△ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, ALDH1A3△ appears to be either very unstable or not expressed in NPCs. Nevertheless, to verify if such truncated protein could be functional, we evaluated its enzymatic activity. Full-length ALDH1A3 overexpressed in HEK293 exhibited enzymatic activity, as measured by reduction of NADPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindahl et al., 1982</xref>), whereas the ALDH1A3△ protein was completely inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In most cases, its role was shown to require direct binding to select mRNAs and regulation of their splicing or translation. Notably, <italic>Khdrbs1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice also displayed high perinatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richard et al., 2005</xref>), but the biological processes and the genes regulated by Sam68 during embryonic development are completely unknown. Our studies have now unveiled an unpredicted function of Sam68 as key regulator of the balance between stem and differentiated cells in the developing cortex. Ablation of this function in vivo caused anticipated NPC differentiation into post-mitotic neurons and limited the expansion of the neocortex. These findings highlight a novel Sam68-dependent pathway required for stem cell fate during brain development.</p><p>Sam68 is strongly expressed in NPCs during stages of intense neurogenesis and cortical expansion (E13.5–E15.5). These processes rely on the dual ability of RGCs to divide symmetrically and amplify their number, or asymmetrically to produce IPCs and post-mitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paridaen and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taverna et al., 2014</xref>). Knockout of Sam68 function significantly decreased proliferating NPCs (both PAX6-positive RGCs and TBR2-positive IPCs) at E13.5, while leading to a sharp increase in TBR1-positive post-mitotic neurons. Birth-dating experiments indicated that <italic>Khdrbs1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> NPCs were prone to exit the cell cycle and differentiate into neurons. The consequence of this premature NPC loss was a reduced expansion of the cortex at E17.5, indicating that Sam68 is strictly required for the correct development of the mouse brain. Of note, the same loss of NPC stemness features could be recapitulated in vitro. First, Sam68 was strongly expressed in self-renewing E13.5 NPCs and its expression declined upon their differentiation. Second, <italic>Khdrbs1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> NPCs were deficient in proliferation and clonogenicity while displaying enhanced tendency to differentiate. These observations indicate that Sam68 is required to maintain the proper balance between NPC self-renewal and differentiation and suggest that this protein supports stem-like properties in embryonic NPCs.</p><p>Analysis of splicing-sensitive microarrays identified a relatively small subset of genes that are modulated by Sam68 in NPCs. These genes were selectively enriched in functional categories typical of neurons and glial cells and the majority of them were upregulated in <italic>Khdrbs1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> NPCs, in line with the role of Sam68 in the promotion of stem-like features. Among these targets, we focused on ALDH1A3, a metabolic enzyme that was identified as marker of cancer stem cells. Since ALDH1A3 supports the clonogenic and tumorigenic potential of cancer stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mao et al., 2013</xref>), we hypothesized that it might also promote stemness in NPCs and that Sam68 exerted its effects through modulation of ALDH1A3 expression. Indeed, <italic>Khdrbs1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> NPCs displayed lower ALDH enzymatic activity and ALDH1A3 protein expression. Furthermore, by performing knockdown and gain-of-function studies, we demonstrated that regulation of ALDH1A3 expression accounts for many of the phenotypes of <italic>Khdrbs1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> NPCs. Thus, our results link the physiological defect of knockout embryos to regulation of a specific target that promotes NPC self-renewal. Although it is generally accepted that pre-mRNA processing is a key regulatory step in brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raj and Blencowe, 2015</xref>), few studies so far have directly linked these processes. Knockout of <italic>Ptbp2</italic> was shown to alter the dynamics of embryonic neurogenesis and splicing of several genes, but the specific target gene(s) of PTBP2 that are responsible for defective neurogenesis were not identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>). Likewise, the <italic>Pnky</italic> long noncoding RNA is required to expand the IPC population and it functions by interacting with PTBP1 and by regulating the expression and splicing of several neuronal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ramos et al., 2015</xref>), but the specific targets involved in its neurogenic function are unknown. Our study extends beyond these correlations and establishes a direct link between Sam68 and ALDH1A3 functions in the maintenance of NPC self-renewal capacity during neurogenesis.</p><p>ALE selection is a prominent and unexpected pattern of regulation by Sam68 in NPCs. Mechanistically, we found that Sam68 directly binds to <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> pre-mRNA in proximity of a cryptic PAS located in the 5' portion of intron 7. Ablation of Sam68 unmasked this intronic PAS, causing alternative polyadenylation and premature termination of the <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> transcript. Notably, the same regulation of <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> alternative 3'-end processing occurred also in wild-type NPCs undergoing differentiation, concomitantly with the decline in expression of endogenous Sam68 and with acquisition of neuronal features. Thus, our results indicate that high levels of Sam68 are required to maintain <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> expression and activity by suppressing premature termination of transcription of its pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This function of Sam68 resembles that of the U1 snRNP, which prevents global recognition of a large number of cryptic intronic PASs, thus insuring proper transcription termination of pre-mRNAs in the last exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berg et al., 2012</xref>). However, Sam68 appears to play a much more restricted role than U1 snRNP, by controlling 3'-end processing of only a limited subset of transcripts. It will be interesting to investigate whether or not Sam68 functionally interacts with U1snRNP in this regulation and why its expression affects the alternative 3'-end processing of only few transcripts. Nevertheless, the studies shown here unveil a previously unappreciated role of Sam68 in alternative polyadenylation with physiological relevance for NPC differentiation.</p><p>ALDH1A3 was shown to support clonogenicity and tumorigenicity of glioma stem cells by enhancing the glycolytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mao et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, very recent studies demonstrated that anaerobic glycolysis is required for NPC self-renewal in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lange et al., 2016</xref>). We observed that lactate production through the glycolytic pathway was strongly reduced in <italic>Khdrbs1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> NPCs. This phenotype could be recapitulated by <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> knockdown or ALDH pharmacological inhibition in wild-type NPCs, or by promoting NPC differentiation in culture. Furthermore, the clonogenic potential of both wild-type and knockout NPCs was tightly linked to the extent of glycolysis, as modulation of this metabolic pathway by up- or down-regulating ALDH1A3 activity paralleled their self-renewal potential. By linking ALDH1A3 activity to anaerobic glycolysis in NPCs, we identify a novel metabolic route required for maintenance of stemness in neural precursors that is strictly under the control of Sam68. Our work suggests that during neurogenesis, high levels of Sam68 expression are required for the correct processing of <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> pre-mRNA, thus insuring high ALDH1A3 activity and fueling of the glycolytic pathway. Conversely, a decline in Sam68 expression leads to reduced expression and activity of ALDH1A3 and inhibits the glycolytic pathway, priming NPCs to enter the differentiation program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Importantly, the impaired balance between self-renewal and differentiation in <italic>Khdrbs1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice results in depletion of the NPC pool and reduced expansion of the neocortex. Since altered neurogenesis and cortical development are associated to severe neuronal disorders like epilepsy, schizophrenia and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun and Hevner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernández et al., 2016</xref>), our findings suggest that fine-tuned regulation of Sam68 expression represents a safeguard mechanism during brain development.</p><p>In conclusion, our study identifies Sam68 as a novel regulator of neurogenesis and highlights an unprecedented link between Sam68, ALDH1A3 and the glycolytic pathway that supports maintenance of the NPC pool in the embryonic cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Animal experiments were performed according to protocol number 809_2015PR, following the Institutional guidelines of the Fondazione Santa Lucia and the approval of the Ethical Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Immunofluorescence analysis of neocortex development</title><p>E12.5, E13.5 and E17.5 pregnant mice were treated with 90 mg/kg BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, Stéphane Richard (Reviewer #1) and Emanuele Buratti (Reviewer #2), and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>La Rosa et al. characterize the role of the KH-type RNA binding protein Sam68 in embryonic neurogenesis. They show that the ablation of Sam68depletes the neural stem cell pool, as it promotes their cell cycle exit and subsequent differentiation into neurons (and also oligodendrocytes in vitro). Interestingly, they observe a significant increase in TBR1<sup>+</sup> neurons in <italic>Sam68</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. La Rosa et al., identify many alternative spliced events using alternative splice sensitive exon arrays and focus their attention on ALDH1A3. They show that Sam68 binds a cryptic intronic poly (A) signal and prevents its usage. The loss of Sam68 uses this cryptic signal and generates a truncated non-functional ALDH1A3 enzyme. They argue that the phenotype of the NSCs is due mainly to the loss of ALDH1A3 activity, as restoring its activity rescues the diameter of the Sam68-deficient neurospheres and their clonogenicity. Furthermore, depletion of wild type NPCs with siALDH1A3 also leads to an increase in neuronal differentiation as assessed by the TUBB3 marker. Finally, the authors demonstrate that high ALDH1A3 expression and activity are required for the high glycolytic metabolism necessary for maintaining the stem cell pool of the developing cortex. Thus La Rosa et al. convincingly show that it is mainly the lack of ALDH1A3 in a Sam68-dependent manner that contributes to the early cell cycle exit to promote neural differentiation of certain neurons.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>: the authors should show immunofluorescence staining for E13.5 cortex from <italic>Sam68</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice to see whether Sam68 depletion affects the overall number of <italic>Sox2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells at the peak of neurogenesis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>: Could be improved and quantified with real-time PCR.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>: the authors demonstrate that cortical expansion is reduced in <italic>Sam68</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to wild type mice.

Is the increase in transcript level specific to the ALDH1A3Δ isoform? Could the authors provide an explanation for this discrepancy?</italic> </p><p>Yes, as the reviewers point out, this apparent discrepancy is due to the fact that the 5’ region of ALDH1A3 (corresponding to expression of the ALDH1A3△ variant) appears up-regulated in the exon array whereas the 3’ region, necessary for the full length ALDH1A3 protein expression, is down-regulated. This is better illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and its supplement, where we show by conventional and qPCR the validation of the array data. Thus, the increase in ALDH1A3 expression shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> corresponds to the ALDH1A3Δ isoform (for validation we used primers in exons 6-7 as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To rule out whether there is no accumulation of intron 7 containing pre-mRNA, the authors should perform Northern blot analysis.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that a negative result is not conclusive. Thus, instead of performing a Northern blot, we designed a different experiment to discriminate between pre-mRNA and mature mRNA: <italic>Sam68</italic><sup>-/-</sup> NPCs were incubated with DRB for 2 and 6 hours to block RNA transcription. Under these conditions, pre-mRNAs, which are transient intermediates, rapidly decay, whereas mature transcripts should be more stable. Indeed, we observed that transcripts containing exon 3-intron 3 and intron 8-exon 8 sequences were present at time 0 and rapidly disappeared upon incubation with DRB, indicative of pre-mRNA amplification. By contrast, the amplicon corresponding to exon 7-intron 7 sequences (i.e. ALDH1A3△ transcript) was stable up to 6 hours of incubation. Notably, in this experiment all amplicons were of the same size, ruling out a possible bias related PCR efficiency. These results (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) confirm by another means the presence of an alternative mRNA originating from premature termination of the ALDH1A3 transcript in <italic>Sam68</italic><sup>-/-</sup> NPCs.</p><p><italic>6) Using CLIP analysis, the authors showed that Sam68 binds this intron 7 region. It is not clear, however, why Sam68 was not observed to bind the dPAS in exon 13 of the ALDH1A3 gene. Does it have a sequence that significantly differs from AAUAAA or AUUAAA?</italic> </p><p>The canonical polyA site in exon 13 contains the most common polyA site sequence: AAUAAA. So, in theory it does not show a sequence bias for SAM68 recognition. One potential bias is the position of the polyA site: internal intron versus last exon. We performed a high-throughput analysis of Sam68-regulated splicing events in male germ cells and found that many intronic polyA sites are regulated by Sam68. It is possible that Sam68 function requires additional splicing proteins that associate with it but are more enriched within the gene body than at the cleavage site. We are currently investigating this possibility at mechanistic level, but do not have conclusive data yet to be added to this study.</p><p><italic>7) The authors found that ALDH1A3 protein expression was decreased. The authors showed that the truncated form was not expressed but upon ectopic expression, this isoform appeared to be enzymatically inactive. It would be interesting to know whether this truncated isoform is actually never translated or degraded immediately due to low stability. Have the authors tried to treat the Sam68<sup>-/-</sup> cells with autophagy or proteasome inhibitors to see if this truncated isoform cab be actually visualized in western blots?</italic> </p><p>We have now performed the requested experiment. MG132 did not lead to any accumulation of a truncated ALDH1A3 protein. Chloroquine caused a very mild accumulation of a protein product detected by the antibody, but slightly smaller than what expected by the apparent molecular weight of the recombinant ALDH1A3△. Positive controls were included to show their accumulation upon treatment: p53 for inhibition of proteosomal degradation and LC3 for inhibition of the autophagic flux. Thus, even if expressed at very low levels, ALDH1A3△ appears very unstable and eliminated through autophagy. Nevertheless, we tested its possible functional contribution to ALDH activity and NPC stemness (see point 8).</p><p><italic>8) Finally, the authors show that overexpression of GFP-ALDH1A3 can rescue the growth and clonogenic defects in Sam68<sup>-/-</sup> cells. These experiments are convincing but should also be repeated by GFP-ALDH1A3 truncated isoform may not under any circumstance rescue the Sam68<sup>-/-</sup> cells.</italic> </p><p>We have now tested the possibility that ALDH1A3△ contributes to ALDH activity and neurogenic potential of NPCs. First, enzymatically active ALDH1A3 is known to form a tetramer, and homodimerization domains are found also in the N-terminus of the protein present in ALDH1A3△. Consistently, we found that ALDH1A3△ forms a complex with full length ALDH1A3 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells. However, its co-expression with full length ALDH1A3 partially reduced ALDH activity in a dose-dependent manner (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). This experiment suggests that, if expressed, ALDH1A3△ could behave as dominant-negative and interfere with the enzymatic activity of the full length protein. In line with this possibility, we also show that forced expression of ALDH1A3△ in NPCs completely blocks their proliferation and interferes with formation of the neurospheres, even though the cells remain alive in the time-frame of the experiment, as they are still visible and express GFP 3-5 days after transfection. This result is now shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
