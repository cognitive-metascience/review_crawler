JF-NP-26 is an inactive photocaged derivative of the metabotropic glutamate type 5 (mGlu<sub>5</sub>) receptor negative allosteric modulator raseglurant. Violet light illumination of JF-NP-26 induces a photochemical reaction prompting the active-drug’s release, which effectively controls mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptor activity both in ectopic expressing systems and in striatal primary neurons. Systemic administration in mice followed by local light-emitting diode (LED)-based illumination, either of the thalamus or the peripheral tissues, induced JF-NP-26-mediated light-dependent analgesia both in neuropathic and in acute/tonic inflammatory pain models. These data offer the first example of optical control of analgesia <italic>in vivo</italic> using a photocaged mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptor negative allosteric modulator. This approach shows potential for precisely targeting, in time and space, endogenous receptors, which may allow a better management of difficult-to-treat disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

Accordingly, selective negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of mGlu<sub>1</sub> or mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptors, and agonists or positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of mGlu<sub>2</sub> or mGlu<sub>4</sub> receptors have consistently been shown to display analgesic activity in experimental animal models of chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montana and Gereau, 2011</xref>). In particular, mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptor NAMs (i.e. raseglurant) are under development for the treatment of neuropathic pain and migraine; however, their systemic use may be limited by mechanism-related adverse effects, such as hepatotoxicity, cognitive impairment and psychotomimetic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedmann et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gravius et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Homayoun et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kinney et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The use of light in optogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tye and Deisseroth, 2012</xref>) and photopharmacology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kramer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lerch et al., 2016</xref>) to control activity of living neurons is a ground-breaking approach that is reaching a high impact in experimental neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyden, 2015</xref>) and drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Song and Knöpfel, 2016</xref>). Photopharmacology is based on the use of photoactive drugs that can trigger biological responses upon light irradiation at appropriate wavelengths. Accordingly, temporal and spatial remote control of drug activity is possible with a highly precise regulation of its in vivo effects. Differently from optogenetics, the application of photoregulated ligands and optical techniques allows the modulation of native proteins without genetic manipulation, thus facilitating translation into therapeutics with protocols similar to those employed in conventional drug discovery and clinical practice. The potential application of this strategy to pain treatment is highlighted by the evidence that a photoisomerizable molecule entering nociceptive neurons through the TrpV1 ion channel causes analgesia by inhibiting voltage-gate ion channels in response to illumnation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mourot et al., 2012</xref>). We developed alloswitch-1, a selective photoswitchable mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptor NAM, which allowed the optical control of endogenous receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pittolo et al., 2014</xref>), in an attempt to achieve a light-dependent control of mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptors within the pain neuraxis. However, alloswitch-1 and related photoswitchable compounds show mGlu<sub>5</sub> NAM activity in its natural <italic>trans</italic> configuration in the dark, thereby causing light-independent analgesic effects in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gómez-Santacana et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we aimed to synthesize an inactive mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptor NAM, which is converted into an effective analgesic drug upon illumination. An effective strategy to achieve this would consist of developing inactive photosensitive mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptor-based drugs, which may thereafter be activated by light administration (photo-uncaging) exclusively in brain regions critically involved in the control of pain. This approach may allow the release of the active drug in an anatomically restricted fashion and with regulated dosing. The photodelivery of biologically active molecules has been usually addressed using either direct compound photolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ellis-Davies, 2007</xref>) or light-triggered release from nanosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fomina et al., 2012</xref>), although uncaging in vivo has been seldom used in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crowe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takano et al., 2006</xref>).

Accordingly, we implanted optical fibers in the brain to allow precise light delivery into the ventrobasal thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Importantly, we used a LED lamp illumination system, not requiring the use of laser sources to achieve the photorelease of the active compound, and assessed mechanical pain thresholds by means of von Frey filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, a single injection of raseglurant (10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly increased pain thresholds in CCI mice regardless of light irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; data with raseglurant after irradiation are not shown). In contrast, systemic injection of JF-NP-26 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly (p&lt;0.01) increased pain thresholds in CCI mice only after thalamic irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of this proof of principle success, we took advantage of a different mice model of pain to further investigate the analgesic activity of light-delivered JF-NP-26 either in the periphery or in ventrobasal thalamus. The formalin test, which allows an objective analysis of pain based on nocifensive behavior, displays a first phase of pain (5 min after formalin injection in the hind paw), which models acute inflammatory pain, and a second phase (20–30 min after formalin injection), which models chronic inflammatory pain and reflects the development of central sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mogil, 2009</xref>). Formalin injection into the mouse hind paw induced an innate licking behavior that was significantly reduced by systemic administration of raseglurant (10 mg/kg, i.p., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, middle panel), thus demonstrating an antinociceptive efficacy both in phase I (70 ± 3%, p&lt;0.001) and phase II (97 ± 1%, p&lt;0.001) of the formalin test. We then directly irradiated the ipsilateral hind paw with external 405 nm light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) following the experimental regimen shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (upper panel). Noteworthy, while JF-NP-26 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was unable to promote antinociception in dark conditions (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), it elicited antinociception following direct hind paw irradiation both at phase I (54 ± 5%, p&lt;0.001) and phase II (34 ± 5%, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, middle panel; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>), demonstrating that JF-NP-26 was able to be peripherally photoactivated. Interestingly, under the same experimental conditions when the contralateral hind paw was irradiated no antinociceptive effect was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, middle panel, column C), thus demonstrating that a non-site specific peripheral photoconversion of JF-NP-26 does not yield systemic raseglurant-mediated analgesia. On the other hand, we also evaluated the effects of JF-NP-26 by delivering light into the ventrobasal thalamus. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (lower panel), implantation of the illumination system by itself did not affect nocifensive responses in the formalin test and did not alter the analgesic activity of raseglurant, as expected. While JF-NP-26 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was inactive under basal conditions, it was able to cause substantial analgesia both in phase I (45 ± 9%, p&lt;0.01) and phase II (90 ± 4%, p&lt;0.001) of the formalin test in response to thalamic irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lower panel). Importantly, under the same experimental conditions when the striatum was irradiated no antinociceptive effect was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lower panel, column S), indicating that a CNS region of the pain neuraxis must be specifically irradiated to obtain pain control by JF-NP-26. Significantlly, uncaging of JF-NP-26 in the thalamus produced a stronger analgesic effect in phase II of the formalin test, which reflects mechanisms of central sensitization. Finally, the thalamic irradiation effects of JF-NP-26 were obtained after intraperitoneal administration, demonstrating its effective brain penetration in mice. Overall, upon local and thalamic photoactivation, JF-NP-26 demonstrated analgesic effects in two different models of pain, thus raising the interesting possibility that localized light targeting of peripheral and thalamic mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptors represent a valuable strategy for the treatment of pain diseases.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23545.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Peripheral and central light-dependent JF-NP-26-mediated antinociception in mice.</title><p>In the upper panel a scheme of the irradiation regime at 405 nm light (violet rectangles) and liking recordings (green rectangles - Phase I and Phase II) in the formalin animal model of pain is shown.

For instance, systemic administration of MPEP, a mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptor NAM, reduced reference memory in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christoffersen et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, we aimed to explore whether systemic administration and local photoactivation of JF-NP-26 circumvented raseglurant-associated adverse effects. To this end, we assessed the impact of raseglurant and JF-NP-26 in mouse working/reference memory by using the novel object recognition test. As expected, naive mice injected with vehicle spent significantly more time in exploring the novel object than the familiar object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, raseglurant impaired novel object recognition at the dose of 20 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), although it was inactive at 10 mg/kg (not shown). Optic fiber implanted mice treated with vehicle or JF-NP-26 (10 or 20 mg/kg) and irradiated bilaterally at the ventrobasal thalamus (see above) showed a normal performance in the novel object recognition test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrated that neither the systemic administration nor the thalamic photoactivation of JF-NP-26 cause memory impairment in mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We report a new pharmacological approach based on analgesic ligands endowed with light-dependent activity. This strategy allows the photocontrol of mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptors at different stations of the pain neuraxis.</p><p>To our knowledge, JF-NP-26 is the first caged mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptor NAM that has been shown to induce light-dependent analgesia in models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain in freely behaving animals. The ability to resolve analgesia with a fine resolution in time and space confers to our experimental approach a high significance for further development of new caged drugs acting at different levels of the pain neuraxis.</p><p>Raseglurant is a mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptor NAM that has been shown to possess efficacy on the treatment of migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keywood and Wakefield, 2008</xref>). However, its clinical development was discontinued because of liver toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marin and Goadsby, 2010</xref>). Accordingly, we synthesized a caged compound (JF-NP-26) that upon illumination would release raseglurant only in the areas of interest, thus avoiding potential systemic undesired effects associated to mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptor functioning (i.e. memory impairment). Of note, uncaging of JF-NP-26 was designed to be elicited with light pulses in the visible spectrum (405 nm). This property differentiates JF-NP-26 from the majority of caged compounds that require UV light for activation. This is highly advantageous for translational research because light within the visible spectrum has a good tissue penetration and causes less tissue damage with respect to UV light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Regan and Parrish, 1993</xref>). Remarkably our LED-based illumination allowed the effective transdermal uncaging of JF-NP-26 at the mouse hind paw, just where many noxious stimuli are detected and transduced by peripheral nociceptors. In fact, mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptors are expressed in peripheral nociceptors, where they contribute to mechanisms of nociceptive sensitization by enhancing the activity of TRPV1 channels through a complex mechanism mediated by inositol phospholipid hydrolysis, prostaglandin formation, and protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhave et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neugebauer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, raseglurant released from JF-NP-26 in response to light irradiation in the hind paw may interact with mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptors present in peripheral nociceptors, thereby causing analgesia in the formalin test. In line with this, intraplantar JF-NP-26 uncaging showed higher antinociceptive efficacy in the first phase of the formalin test, which reflects the activation of peripheral nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hunskaar and Hole, 1987</xref>).</p><p>One of the major findings of the present work consists of the local photoactivation of JF-NP-26 to give the active compound after its systemic (i.p.) administration. Accordingly, mice were systemically injected with JF-NP-26, and fast antinociceptive effects were produced by light irradiation in the ventrobasal thalamus, the main relay station of the ascending pain pathway modulating the sensory, cognitive, and emotional components of pain. Light-mediated delivery of raseglurant in the thalamus showed a greater antinociceptive efficacy during the second phase of the formalin test, which reflects the development of central sensitization to inflammatory pain. Hence, our data suggested that mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptors located at two different stations of the pain neuraxis (i.e., peripheral nociceptors and ventrobasal thalamic nuclei) might be contributing differentially to acute inflammatory pain and mechanisms of central sensitization Importantly, JF-NP-26 also showed fast analgesic activity in the CCI model of neuropathic pain in response to thalamic irradiation. Neuropathic pain is characterized by a robust and long-lasting nociceptive sensitization that reflects a maladaptive process of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basbaum et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptors participate on the expression of this pathological form of synaptic plasticity at different levels of the pain neuraxis, from the spinal cord to the regions of the pain matrix including the amygdala and cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neugebauer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li and Neugebauer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu and Gereau, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). Our data indicate that thalamic mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptors are critical for the expression of nociceptive sensitization and can be specifically targeted by analgesic drugs in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Overall, our research provided valuable information regarding the contribution of mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptors to the processing of nociceptive transmission at specific anatomic loci within the pain neuraxis (e.g., central vs. peripheral) as well as its participation in the modulation of both acute inflammatory and chronic neuropathic pain.</p><p>In conclusion, systemic administration of inactive drugs that are activated by light on demand may provide a powerful strategy to reach a rapid control of pain limiting the development of dose- and mechanism-related adverse effects that are typically encountered with conventional analgesic drugs. Our positive results constitute a proof of principle that mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptor NAM uncaging may be a suitable therapeutic approach for the local control of pain, which could be applied in general to conditions of severe pain that are difficult to treat, and, in particular, to conditions of fast-onset severe pain that requires a rapid and highly localized treatment. However, the transition from pre- to clinical settings still has to solve a number of practical problems, including assessment of photoactive compound stability and toxicity, as well as the development of implantable and remotely controlled LEDs covering the photochemical needs to release the active compounds with light.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Synthesis of drugs</title><p>All the chemicals and solvents were provided from commercial suppliers and used without purification, except the anhydrous solvents, which were treated previously through a system of solvent purification (<italic>PureSolv</italic>), degasified with inert gases and dried over alumina or molecular sieve (dimethyl formamide).

In brief, mice (n = 5–6) were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) with vehicle, raseglurant or JF-NP-26 20 min before a diluted formalin solution (20 µL of 2.5% formalin/0.92% formaldehyde, Sigma-Aldrich) was intraplantarly (i.pl.) injected in the mid-plantar surface of the right hind paw of the mouse. The formalin-induced nociceptive behaviour in dark and light conditions was quantified as the time spent licking or biting the injected paw during the 30 min after the injection of formalin. The initial acute phase (0–5 min; phase I), reflecting the acute peripheral pain, was followed by a relatively short quiescent period, which was then followed by a prolonged response (15–30 min; phase II) which is related to the development of central nociceptive sensitization. For the peripheral JF-NP-026 uncaging the hind paw was directly irradiated with a LED-based fiberoptic system (Doric Lenses Inc.) at 405 nm light (or dark) for 5 min before the recording of each phase. For the central nervous system uncaging both thalamic nuclei were irradiated through the brain implanted optic fibers (Doric Lenses Inc.) with 405 nm light (or dark) for 5 min before the recording of each phase.

In brief, the sciatic nerve CCI induction was carried out under isoflurane anesthesia (5% for induction and 2% for maintenance), using a modified version of a previously described method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett and Xie, 1988</xref>). The biceps femoris and the gluteus superficialis were separated by blunt dissection, and the right sciatic nerve was exposed. CCI was produced by tying one ligature (6–0 silk, Ethicon, LLC, San Lorenzo, PR, USA) around the sciatic nerve. The ligature was tied loosely around the nerve, until it elicited a brief twitch in the respective hind limb, which prevented over-tightening of the ligation, taking care to preserve epineural circulation. The incision was cleaned and the skin was closed with 2–3 ligatures of 5–0 dermalon. After performing the ligature of the sciatic nerve, during the same anesthesia session, mice were implanted with optic fibers (see above). After surgery, mice returned to their home cages and checked routinely for 72 hr.</p><p>Mechanical allodynia was assessed 7, 14 and 21 days after surgery by measuring the hind paw withdrawal response to von Frey filament stimulation. Mice were placed in a dark box (20 x 20 × 40 cm) with a wire grid bottom through which the von Frey filaments (North Coast Medical, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA), bending force range from 0.008 to 3.5 g, were applied by using a modified version of the up-down paradigm previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chaplan et al., 1994</xref>). Briefly, lack of response to a filament indicated the next higher filament in the following stimulation, whereas a positive response indicated the next lower filament. Each filament was applied and pressed perpendicularly to the plantar surface of the hind paw until it bent for five times with a 3 min interval. The filament that evoked at least three paw withdrawals was assigned as the pain threshold in grams. Mice were treated either with raseglurant (10 mg/kg, i.p. in 6% DMSO, 6% Tween 80 in saline) orJF-NP-26, (10 mg/kg, i.p. in 6% DMSO, 6% Tween 80 in saline). Both thalamic nucleus were irradiated (or dark) through the brain implanted optic fibers (Doric Lenses Inc.) with 405 nm light (or dark) for 5 min, 20 min after drug administration. The light was administered at 2000 mA intensity and 500 Hz frequency and the mechanical thresholds were quantified before and after light irradiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Novel object recognition test</title><p>To evaluate reference memory, we performed the novel object recognition test as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christoffersen et al., 2008</xref>) with minor modifications. In brief, mice were divided into six subgroups: vehicle-injected mice, raseglurant (10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.)-injected mice, vehicle-injected mice implanted with optic fibers and JF-NP-26 (10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.)-injected mice implanted with optic fibers. All mice were injected 20 min before the training session. On the first three days, all mice were handled for 3 min once daily and 24 hr later they were habituated for 20 min to the empty arena. On day 5, mice underwent a 5 min training period. Afterwards, mice return to their home cages for 5 min, and were subsequently subjected to a 5 min retention test. The 405 nm light was administered at 2000 mA intensity and 500 Hz frequency in vehicle and JF-NP-26-injected mice 5 min immediately before the training session. Two identical objects were used as familiar objects during the training trial and the third object was used as novel object during the 5 min retention session. As an index of recognition memory, the time spent exploring the familiar and novel object was measured during the retention session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistics</title><p>The number of samples (n) in each experimental condition is indicated in figure legends.

The authors demonstrate photoconversion of JN to raseglurant, and the analgesic efficacy of the compound, conditionally on photoconversion to raseglurant, in both central (thalamic) and peripheral (hindpaw) modes. The compound presents a potentially very useful tool for the field. Overall – this is a very interesting and potentially important report. The manuscript would be greatly strengthened by the inclusion of some key additional experiments and controls, as detailed below:</p><p>1) Raseglurant is a systemically active mGlu5 NAM. The author demonstrates clearly photoconversion of JN-NP-26 to raseglurant, and that photoconversion of systemically applied JN-NP-26 with light applied to the thalamus or hindpaw leads to analgesia. What is not clear, is whether the effects of the converted JN-NP-26 are due to actions locally. That is – it is possible that the local photoconversion in the thalamus or hindpaw leads to systemically effective doses of raseglurant, and thus, does not indicate that they have achieved the &quot;precise targeting in time and space&quot; that they seek. Additional controls are necessary. What happens if the photostimulation is applied not to the hindpaw, but to (for example) the contralateral hindpaw, or back skin? In the brain – what happens if the light is applied not to the thalamus, but for example to a region of the brain not thought to be involved in pain – (who knows… cerebellum? Olfactory bulb?). This is critical for the interpretation of the data.</p><p>2) Related – the authors have the stated goal of providing mGlu5 blockade-mediated analgesia without the undesired side effects seen with systemic administration of some mGlu5 NAMs. However – they never actually show that these side effects are absent with the JN-NP-26 photo conversion.</p><p>3) Further related – the stated reason for discontinuation of raseglurant is liver tox – however, it is unlikely that liver toxicity is mGlu5 mechanism-based. Thus, it is entirely possible that JN-NP-26 may have the same issues with liver toxicity. This has not been tested here, and should be. A comparison of raseglurant to JN-NP-26 on liver tox screens.</p><p>4) There is no mention in the manuscript (unless I missed it) as to whether the experiments were performed blind to treatment. This is a necessity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this work, Font et al. characterize a photocaged derivative of raseglurant, a negative allosteric modulator the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). The compound, JF-NP-26, can be uncaged by illuminating with 405 nm light, both in vitro and in vivo, to reveal raseglurant with spatial and temporal precision, allowing local modulation of mGluR5 receptors. The authors show that JF-NP-26 can be intraperitoneally injected and readily diffuses throughout the mouse before local irradiation at either the paw or in the brain uncages the raseglurant. In two separate in vivo mouse models for pain, hind paw formalin injection and chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve, significant differences in antinociceptive effect were observed between irradiated and unirradiated JF-NP-26. This is a solid paper that moves the field forward, however, I don't think it passes the significance test as currently written.</p><p>1) The Abstract claims this report to be the first example of optical control of analgesia in vivo, but that is not the case, see Mourot, A..… Kramer, R.H. &quot;Rapid optical control of nociception with an ion channel photoswitch&quot; Nat. Methods 2012.</p><p>2) I am also baffled by the omission of discussion and citation of some of the authors own work in the field. Two of their recent papers (Pittolo, S..… Gorostiza, P. &quot;An allosteric modulator to control endogenous G protein-coupled receptors with light &quot; Nat. Chembio. 2014. And Rovira, X.… LLebaria, A. &quot; OptoGluNAM4.1, a Photoswitchable Allosteric Antagonist for Real-Time Control of mGlu4 Receptor Activity&quot; Cell Chem. Bio. 2016) report photoswitchable mGluR4 and mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators. The authors need to make a convincing case for why they are using the single use photocage compound JF-NP-26 instead one of their reversibly activatable compounds.</p><p>3) My last major concern is with the penultimate paragraph in the Discussion, for example (&quot;Our data indicate that thalamic mGlu5 receptors are critical for the expression of nociceptive sensitization and can be specifically targeted by analgesic drugs in the treatment of neuropathic pain&quot;). Is it not possible/likely, that on the timescale of the formalin experiments (15 min diffusion followed by 5 min irradiation and diffusion) that uncaged raseglurant, whether originating in the foot or brain, will diffuse through the mouse at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, making it difficult to assess the impact of local uncaging?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23545.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>The demonstration of effective modulation of behavior with this photocaged compound in mice is exciting pending the inclusion of appropriate controls.

Indeed, we found referee’s comments very appropriate and useful. Thus, we followed their indications in order to improve the quality of our work and consequently, a large amount of new experiments (mostly controls) have been done to this purpose. As stated, we performed some important controls which validate our results and help us to properly discuss within a general context. Also, we discussed our (and others) previous literature important to this topic. Overall, we thank the referees for their constructive comments which indeed forced us to improve the manuscript’s quality.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1: […] 1) Raseglurant is a systemically active mGlu5 NAM. The author demonstrates clearly photoconversion of JN-NP-26 to raseglurant, and that photoconversion of systemically applied JN-NP-26 with light applied to the thalamus or hindpaw leads to analgesia. What is not clear, is whether the effects of the converted JN-NP-26 are due to actions locally. That is – it is possible that the local photoconversion in the thalamus or hindpaw leads to systemically effective doses of raseglurant, and thus, does not indicate that they have achieved the &quot;precise targeting in time and space&quot; that they seek. Additional controls are necessary. What happens if the photostimulation is applied not to the hindpaw, but to (for example) the contralateral hindpaw, or back skin? In the brain – what happens if the light is applied not to the thalamus, but for example to a region of the brain not thought to be involved in pain – (who knows… cerebellum? Olfactory bulb?). This is critical for the interpretation of the data.</italic> </p><p>The referee raised an important question here which indeed is critical for the interpretation of the results. Accordingly, we performed the additional controls suggested by the referee. First, in the formalin animal model of pain we photostimulate the contralateral hind paw to determine whether the local photoconversion of raseglurant in the periphery leads to a systemic analgesic effect. Importantly, we did not observe any systemic antinociceptive effect upon contralateral hind paw irradiation These important controls are now included in the new version of the manuscript (i.e. “Interestingly, under the same experimental conditions when the contralateral hind paw was irradiated no antinociceptive effect was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, middle panel, column C), thus demonstrating that the local and peripheral photoconversion of JF-NP-26 do not yield systemic raseglurant-mediated analgesia.”).</p><p>Second, we also performed another additional control consisting on the irradiation of the striatum. To this end, we implanted optic fibers bilaterally in the striatum and performed similar formalin experiments. Interestingly, the photorelease of raseglurant in the striatum do not promote any antinociceptive effect, thus validating both our light-mediated spatiotemporal manipulation of central mGlu5 receptors and the role of these receptors at the pain neuraxis. Indeed, these results are included and discussed in the new version of the manuscript (i.e. “Importantly, under the same experimental conditions when the striatum was irradiated no antinociceptive effect was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lower panel, column S), thus demonstrating that the striatal photoconversion of JF-NP-26 do not preclude pain transmission.”).</p><p><italic>2) Related – the authors have the stated goal of providing mGlu5 blockade-mediated analgesia without the undesired side effects seen with systemic administration of some mGlu5 NAMs. However – they never actually show that these side effects are absent with the JN-NP-26 photo conversion.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the referee that in our original manuscript we didn’t provide any evidence supporting the absence of raseglurant-related adverse effect in the JN-NP-26 treatment. In an attempt to address this important issue, we performed a new set experiments evaluating the impact of the systemic administration and in vivo photoactivation of JF-NP-26 in memory. The results are incorporated and discussed as follows: “On the other hand, it has been reported that mGlu5 receptor NAMs may produce behavioural undesirable side effects. […] Overall, these results demonstrated that neither the systemic administration nor the thalamic photoactivation of JF-NP-26 cause memory impairment in mice.”</p><p><italic>3) Further related – the stated reason for discontinuation of raseglurant is liver tox – however, it is unlikely that liver toxicity is mGlu5 mechanism-based. Thus, it is entirely possible that JN-NP-26 may have the same issues with liver toxicity. This has not been tested here, and should be. A comparison of raseglurant to JN-NP-26 on liver tox screens.</italic> </p><p>As the referee highlighted, the main reason for raseglurant discontinuation was hepatotoxicity. Thus, despite good clinical efficacy, tolerability and safety, the long-term administration of raseglurant in migraine patients resulted in a disappointing high incidence of hepatic transaminase abnormalities, thus halting any further development of this compound. Apparently, this hepatic effect of raseglurant has been shown to be related to its metabolism and not to the mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptor-mediated function (Addex data on file). Indeed, the hepatotoxicity was reported in humans and not in preclinical animal models of pain. Thus, to properly discuss this contention in our manuscript we assessed the raseglurant and JF-NP-26 liver toxicity in mice. The results are incorporated and discussed as follows: “Raseglurant has been shown to possess effectiveness on migraine treatment [Mogil, 2009]. […] Thus, these results demonstrated that raseglurant and JF-NP-26 treatments used in our pain animal models were safe as no liver toxicity was observed.”</p><p><italic>4) There is no mention in the manuscript (unless I missed it) as to whether the experiments were performed blind to treatment. This is a necessity.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for forgetting this important issue. Indeed, it is a routine in our laboratory to perform animal experimentation blind to treatment. Thus, in the new version of the manuscript we clearly stated this matter (i.e. “All animal experimentation was carried out by a researcher blind to drug treatments.”)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>In this work, Font et al. characterize a photocaged derivative of raseglurant, a negative allosteric modulator the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5).

Thus, we amended the text accordingly in order to be more precise (i.e. “Hence, we revealed the first example of optical control of analgesia in vivo using a photocaged mGlu5 receptor negative allosteric modulator”).</p><p><italic>2) I am also baffled by the omission of discussion and citation of some of the authors own work in the field. Two of their recent papers (Pittolo, S..… Gorostiza, P. &quot;An allosteric modulator to control endogenous G protein-coupled receptors with light &quot; Nat. Chembio. 2014. And Rovira, X.… LLebaria, A. &quot; OptoGluNAM4.1, a Photoswitchable Allosteric Antagonist for Real-Time Control of mGlu4 Receptor Activity&quot; Cell Chem. Bio. 2016) report photoswitchable mGluR4 and mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators. The authors need to make a convincing case for why they are using the single use photocage compound JF-NP-26 instead one of their reversibly activatable compounds.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the referee that the rationale of using a photocaged mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptor NAM instead of the existing photoswitchable compound should be clearly stated early in the manuscript. Thus, in the Introduction we cite and discuss our own work regarding mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptor NAM photoswitchable compounds as well as we provide a proper reasoning for using photocaged compounds (i.e. “The optical control of analgesia has been previously reported using an ion-channel photoswitch [Mourot et al., 2012]. […] Therefore, we aimed to synthesize an inactive mGlu5 receptor NAM which yields an effective analgesic drug upon illumination. An effective strategy….”).</p><p><italic>3) My last major concern is with the penultimate paragraph in the Discussion, for example (&quot;Our data indicate that thalamic mGlu5 receptors are critical for the expression of nociceptive sensitization and can be specifically targeted by analgesic drugs in the treatment of neuropathic pain&quot;). Is it not possible/likely, that on the timescale of the formalin experiments (15 min diffusion followed by 5 min irradiation and diffusion) that uncaged raseglurant, whether originating in the foot or brain, will diffuse through the mouse at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, making it difficult to assess the impact of local uncaging?</italic> </p><p>The referee raised an important question here, namely the possibility that the photorelease of raseglurant either in the hind paw or in the thalamus could act systemically. We carefully addressed this issue by performing some important controls:</p><p>i) In the formalin animal model of pain we photostimulate the contralateral hind paw to determine whether the local photoconversion of raseglurant in the periphery leads to a systemic analgesic effect. Importantly, we did not observe any systemic antinociceptive effect upon contralateral hind paw irradiation.</p><p>ii) We also performed another additional control consisting of the irradiation of the striatum. To this end, we implanted optic fibers bilaterally in the striatum and performed similar formalin experiments. Interestingly, the photorelease of raseglurant in the striatum do not promote any antinociceptive effect, thus validating both our light-mediated spatiotemporal manipulation of central mGlu<sub>5</sub> receptors and the role of these receptors at the pain neuraxis.</p><p>Indeed, these important controls are now included in the new version of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
