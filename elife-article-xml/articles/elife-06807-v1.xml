aggregates or through phase separation into a liquid RNA/protein phase. Which model describes RNP granules in living cells is still unclear. In this study, we analyze P bodies in budding yeast and find that they have liquid-like properties. Surprisingly, yeast stress granules adopt a different material state, which is reminiscent of solid protein aggregates and controlled by protein disaggregases. By using an assay to ectopically nucleate RNP granules, we further establish that RNP granule formation does not depend on amyloid-like aggregation but rather involves many promiscuous interactions. Finally, we show that stress granules have different properties in mammalian cells, where they show liquid-like behavior. Thus, we propose that the material state of RNP granules is flexible and that the solid state of yeast stress granules is an adaptation to extreme environments, made possible by the presence of a powerful disaggregation machine.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06807.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06807.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06807.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes consist of long stretches of DNA that code for proteins. The DNA is first ‘transcribed’ to produce an RNA molecule, which is then translated into a protein. In most cells, RNA molecules are present within a structure called ribonucleoprotein (RNP for short) granules. These contain the protein machinery needed to transport, store, and break down RNAs.</p><p>P bodies and stress granules are two types of RNP granules found in all cells, from yeast to human. P bodies are present at all times, whereas stress granules assemble when a cell experiences stressful conditions, such as a lack of nutrients or high temperatures. Once the stress has been overcome, the stress granules are disassembled.</p><p>The precise details of how RNP granules assemble in cells remain poorly understood. One theory suggests that RNP granules form through a physical process called ‘phase separation’ in which RNA molecules and proteins above a certain critical concentration condense to form a liquid droplet. Other research has suggested that RNP granules arise when so-called prion-like proteins spontaneously clump together and start aggregating to form fibers. These granules would behave more like solids than liquids.</p><p>Kroschwald et al. have now analyzed how P bodies and stress granules form in yeast and human cells using a chemical compound that can distinguish between liquid-like and solid-like structures. The results revealed that P bodies and stress granules behave very differently in yeast cells. While P bodies are indeed liquid droplets, stress granules are more solid in nature and act like protein aggregates. So why is there a difference between the two? It is known from previous work that when cells are stressed, many proteins misfold and start aggregating. Kroschwald et al. found that the formation of stress granules coincides with the formation of aggregates, suggesting that stress granules themselves are a type of aggregate. Furthermore, stress granule formation does not seem to involve prion-like fibers, but rather prion-like proteins can easily interact with other proteins in a promiscuous way, thus promoting the seeding of stress granules and their growth.</p><p>Kroschwald et al. next studied human cells and observed that in these cells, both P bodies and stress granules were liquid droplets. These results together suggest that the physical properties and method of assembling P bodies and stress granules can vary from one organism to another. Future work will investigate whether the ability to form solid rather than liquid stress granules provides extra protection to yeast cells when they are stressed. It also remains to be tested whether and how stress granules convert into the pathological RNP aggregates that are often seen in neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06807.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06807.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>phase separation</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd><kwd>prion-like protein</kwd><kwd>P body</kwd><kwd>stress granule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kroschwald</surname><given-names>Sonja</given-names></name><name><surname>Maharana</surname><given-names>Shovamayee</given-names></name><name><surname>Mateju</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Malinovska</surname><given-names>Liliana</given-names></name><name><surname>Nüske</surname><given-names>Elisabeth</given-names></name><name><surname>Poser</surname><given-names>Ina</given-names></name><name><surname>Richter</surname><given-names>Doris</given-names></name><name><surname>Alberti</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maharana</surname><given-names>Shovamayee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Technische Universität Dresden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dresden International Graduate School for Biomedicine and Bioengineering</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kroschwald</surname><given-names>Sonja</given-names></name><name><surname>Mateju</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Malinovska</surname><given-names>Liliana</given-names></name><name><surname>Nüske</surname><given-names>Elisabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A comparison in yeast and human cells reveals a remarkable variability in the properties of RNP granules and highlights a key role for protein disaggregation machines in regulating RNP granule assembly.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The organization of the intracellular space into compartments is fundamental to life; it allows cells to perform complex biochemical reactions in a confined and controlled manner. In addition to membrane-delimited organelles, such as the Golgi apparatus or the endoplasmic reticulum, the cytoplasm contains compartments that are not surrounded by membranes. These non-membrane-bound compartments are frequently linked to gene expression pathways and often contain substantial amounts of RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hyman and Brangwynne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brangwynne, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). Examples in the nucleus include chromatin domains, the nucleolus, and Cajal bodies; examples in the cytoplasm are P bodies, stress granules, and germ granules. Although their functions are not always clear, it is assumed that they facilitate or suppress specific biochemical reactions.</p><p>Recent studies proposed that P granules<italic>—</italic>RNA-protein (RNP) granules in germ cells of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans—</italic>form by liquid–liquid demixing or phase separation from the cytoplasm, so that two phases, a liquid droplet phase and the cytoplasm coexist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Such demixed phases of proteins and RNAs may turn out to be a unifying principle of subcellular organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brangwynne, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, recent findings show that liquid phase separation is not limited to P granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brangwynne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Feric and Brangwynne, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hubstenberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wippich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Banjade and Rosen, 2014</xref>). Importantly, defined mixtures of RNAs and proteins can also phase separate in a cell-free system, driven by multivalent interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that many cellular components may have an intrinsic ability to phase separate and assemble into structures with liquid-like properties.</p><p>Despite recent evidence for a liquid-like state, others have argued that RNP granules have more solid material characteristics, similar to protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gilks et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vessey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Decker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Si et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Decker and Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ramaswami et al., 2013</xref>). This seems particularly likely for P bodies and stress granules, which are stress-inducible RNP granules containing non-translating RNAs and protein factors involved in translation repression or mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Anderson and Kedersha, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Decker and Parker, 2012</xref>). P bodies and stress granules form as a response to acute stress conditions, when a cell has to make arrangements to divert valuable resources to cellular survival, and their formation coincides with the formation of protein aggregates, which result from stress-induced protein misfolding.</p><p>Proteins contained in P bodies or stress granules are characteristically composed of two types of domains: RNA-binding domains (RBDs) and domains of low sequence complexity; the latter are also referred to as prion-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gilks et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Decker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reijns et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">King et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Malinovska et al., 2013</xref>). This term is derived from the fact that they have a characteristic amino acid composition (mostly polar amino acids such as serine, glycine, asparagine, glutamine and tyrosine), which resembles that of yeast prions. Prion domains (PDs) and prion-like domains (PLDs) have little structure under normal conditions. However, they can undergo spontaneous conversions into an aggregated state, which is characterized by a cross-β structure and referred to as amyloid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alberti et al., 2009</xref>). Once formed, the amyloid state can act as a template for the incorporation of further proteins, but it can also be reversed through energy-expending protein disaggregation machines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doyle et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Despite some recent progress, RNP granule assembly remains a poorly understood molecular process. In particular, it is not known how RBDs and PLDs cooperate to promote RNP granule formation in living cells. Recent cell-free reconstitution experiments seem to confirm that PLDs in RNP granule components can assemble into amyloid-like fibers and undergo sol–gel or liquid–solid phase transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">2014</xref>). However, PLDs can also cause protein-misfolding diseases, which are typically accompanied by solid RNP aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ramaswami et al., 2013</xref>). These pathological RNP aggregates are similar to those observed in cell-free reconstitution experiments, raising important questions about the relationship of physiological and pathological RNP granules in living cells. More insight into this topic is also desirable in light of the fact that two different models have been proposed to explain RNP granule assembly, which make very different predictions about the material state of RNP granules (liquid vs solid) and their mode of assembly (phase separation vs aggregation).</p><p>In this study, we analyze P bodies and stress granules in budding yeast and mammalian cells. To our surprise, we find a high degree of versatility in RNP granule assembly. We show that physiological RNP granules can have different material properties and behave as liquid-like droplets or solid protein aggregates. We further establish a key role for RNA in RNP granule assembly and demonstrate that PLDs in RNA-binding proteins promote RNP granule formation in a manner that does not involve amyloid-like aggregation. Instead, these domains undergo promiscuous interactions, with other PLDs or with misfolded proteins. We further reveal a central role for ATP-driven disaggregases in maintaining the identity and integrity of RNP granules and propose that the presence of the Hsp104 disaggregase in yeast has enabled the evolution of a unique pathway for RNP granule formation, which resembles a typical protein aggregation reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PLDs can form two types of assemblies, only one of which is amyloid-like</title><p>To analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of stress-inducible RNP granules, we first focused on the role of prion-like proteins. These proteins have been implicated in RNP granule assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gilks et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vessey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Decker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reijns et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Si et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kato et al., 2012</xref>), but they are also key determinants of protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alberti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">King et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Malinovska et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, Decker and colleagues demonstrated in 2007 that the C-terminal domain of the protein Lsm4 is required for P-body formation in yeast. This domain is aggregation-prone and compositionally similar to yeast prion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alberti et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with this, the PD of the yeast prion Rnq1 could functionally replace the PLD of Lsm4, thus restoring P-body formation in certain genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Decker et al., 2007</xref>). However, it remained undetermined whether the PD of Rnq1 adopted an amyloid-like conformation during P-body assembly or whether other properties of this domain were required.</p><p>To get insight into this question, we analyzed the PD of Rnq1 in yeast cells. First, we studied its subcellular localization in yeast carrying the background prion [<italic>PIN+</italic>], a factor that promotes the conversion of the Rnq1 protein and other yeast prion proteins into an amyloid state. In these cells, GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged Rnq1PD assembled into punctate structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine whether Rnq1PD could also aggregate in the absence of a co-inducing prion, we expressed it in a [<italic>pin−</italic>] background. The resulting cells also displayed a punctate fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, the pattern of aggregation was different, because not all the signal was concentrated in foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Next, we analyzed these cells by semi-denaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE); this method can separate SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) -soluble from SDS-insoluble fractions, SDS insolubility being a hallmark of amyloid polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alberti et al., 2010</xref>). Using this technique, we found that Rnq1PD formed SDS-resistant polymers in [<italic>PIN+</italic>] cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The Rnq1PD structures in [<italic>PIN+</italic>] cells could also be stained with the amyloid-specific dye Thioflavin T (ThT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, Rnq1PD expressed in [<italic>pin−</italic>] cells did not form SDS-resistant aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and it could not be stained with ThT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, we conclude that Rnq1PD can form two types of assemblies in yeast cells: amyloid-like aggregates and non-amyloid assemblies.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06807.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Prion-like domains can access two distinct aggregated states, only one of which is amyloid-like.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescence microscopy of yeast cells expressing sfGFP-tagged Rnq1PD in [<italic>PIN+</italic>] and [<italic>pin−</italic>] cells.

However, the PLD of Lsm4 has not only been implicated in RNP granule formation, it also assembles into an amyloid-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alberti et al., 2009</xref>). Because the induction of an amyloid state is a concentration-dependent nucleation process, the conformational conversion of prion-like proteins into amyloid can be induced in [<italic>PIN+</italic>] yeast cells by raising their concentration. Thus, by expressing additional Lsm4 from a plasmid in the [<italic>PIN+</italic>] background, we could genetically drive endogenous Lsm4 into an amyloid state. In this state, endogenous Lsm4 formed one to a few fluorescent puncta in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, upper panel). Lsm4 was also present in puncta in uninduced cells, but they were smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left lower panel). Previous studies identified these puncta as P bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Decker et al., 2007</xref>). Because P-body formation is strongly enhanced by stress, we next analyzed the localization of Lsm4 after glucose depletion. Now, Lsm4 was present in a few large puncta per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, right lower panel), and this stress-induced localization pattern was reminiscent of the pattern formed by Lsm4 in the amyloid conformation. We further observed that other P-body components such as Edc3 and Dcp2 co-localized with amyloid-like Lsm4 structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

In contrast, SDS-resistant polymers were readily detected, when Lsm4 was genetically driven into an amyloid conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We then prepared lysates from stressed cells in mild detergent (in the absence of SDS) and subjected them to size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Lsm4 in the amyloid state formed very large complexes, whereas Lsm4 complexes in stressed cells were much smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). As a next step, we investigated the dynamic behavior of Lsm4 in P bodies. To do this, we tagged Lsm4 with the fluorophore Dendra2. The resulting yeast strain was stressed by removal of glucose, and P body-localized Lsm4-Dendra2 was photo-converted from green to red. The recovery of the green fluorescence in the P bodies was then followed over time. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, the turnover of Lsm4 in P bodies was rapid and in the same range as previously reported for mammalian P-body components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Andrei et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kedersha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aizer et al., 2008</xref>).

To investigate whether these proteins undergo amyloid-like conformational conversions, we initially focused on one stress granule protein: Nrp1. Nrp1 is a prototypical stress granule protein in that it contains a RNA-binding domain (RRM - RNA recognition motif) and a PLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buchan et al., 2008</xref>). However, Nrp1 can also be converted into an amyloid-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alberti et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, it is one of the proteins capable of binding to b-isox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>), a chemical that specifically binds to low-complexity domains, which have the ability to undergo amyloid-like conformational conversions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kato et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether amyloid-like aggregation of Nrp1 is involved in stress granule assembly, we first converted endogenous Nrp1 into an amyloid state, using a genetic approach (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details). In the resulting cells, Nrp1 localized to one or a few bright cytoplasmic foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, top panel). The same localization pattern was observed in stressed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lower panel). Both structures co-localized with other stress granule proteins such as Pab1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which is consistent with the possibility that genetically induced amyloid-like Nrp1 structures are genuine stress granules. Thus, we next investigated whether stress triggers an amyloid-like conversion in Nrp1 using SDD-AGE. However, Nrp1 did not become SDS-resistant in response to stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Nrp1 complexes also had a very different molecular size in stressed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, we found that the turnover rate of amyloid-like Nrp1 was much slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). As a next step, we investigated four additional stress granule proteins with PLDs using SDD-AGE. However, none of these proteins formed amyloid-like structures in stressed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Furthermore, stress-induced Nrp1 assemblies were ThT negative, whereas genetically induced Nrp1 assemblies were stainable with ThT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, we conclude that stress granules are more solid-like but like P bodies do not transition into amyloid-like states upon stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Yeast stress granules resemble amorphous protein aggregates</title><p>Why do stress granules adopt a different material state than P bodies? A previous study showed that in heat-stressed cells, the formation of stress granules coincides with the formation of protein aggregates, which result from stress-induced protein misfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cherkasov et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that stress granules might be functional aggregates that behave in a similar manner as aggregates formed by misfolded proteins. To investigate this, we compared the aggregation behavior of stress granule components and misfolded proteins by time-lapse microscopy. For this purpose, we used yeast strains co-expressing GFP-tagged stress granule proteins (Pbp1 or Nrp1) and mCherry-tagged misfolding-prone proteins (a mutant variant of luciferase or a thermo-labile variant of Ubc9, Ubc9ts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gupta et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, in cells that were exposed to a robust heat shock of 46°C, stress granule proteins co-localized with luciferase or Ubc9ts in punctate structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Co-localization was also observed between Nrp1 and several chaperones, such as Hsp42, Ssa1, and Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Importantly, cells that had dissolved their stress granules re-entered into the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media7 media8 media9">Videos 7–9</xref>), although they still contained aggregated misfolded proteins. This suggests that the presence of misfolded proteins does not prevent re-entry into the cell cycle and that resumption of growth may be coupled to stress granule dissolution. It also implies that stress granule components are less aggregation-prone than the misfolding-prone model proteins used in our study. To investigate this possibility, we repeated the heat shock experiment at 42°C. Indeed, under mild heat-shock conditions only luciferase and Ubc9ts formed visible aggregates, whereas the stress granule component Nrp1 remained diffusely localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Three different proteins promote the disaggregation of protein aggregates in yeast: Hsp104 and two members of the Hsp110 family, called Sse1 and Sse2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Glover and Lindquist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shorter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duennwald et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rampelt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doyle et al., 2013</xref>).

Investigation of a seeding function requires experimental control over the aggregated state of a protein in the context of a living cell. To achieve this, we developed a method based on a self-assembling protein fragment, derived from a viral capsid protein (μNS).

In this study, bait proteins were genetically fused to the μNS fragment, which resulted in the presentation of the bait protein on the particle surface. Using this approach, we generated particles that carried either mutated luciferase or Ubc9ts on the surface. We found that both types of particles were recognized by chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that the misfolded proteins are accessible on the particle surface. Using these particles, we next tested whether misfolded Ubc9ts or luciferase could recruit stress granule components. Under normal growth conditions (25˚C), the two stress granule proteins Pab1 or Pub1 were not enriched on the particle surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, upper panels). However, during a robust heat shock Pub1 and Pab1 accumulated on μNS particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, lower panels). Naked particles on the other hand did not recruit Pab1 or Pub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating that stress granule assembly was specifically triggered by the misfolded proteins. Furthermore, interaction of Pub1 or Pab1 with luciferase was only observed under robust heat shock and not under glucose depletion conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). Thus, we conclude that misfolded proteins can nucleate the formation of stress granules under severe heat stress conditions, but not under mild stress conditions or during normal growth.</p><p>How do stress granule proteins interact with misfolded proteins? To address this question, we focused on the stress granule protein Nrp1. Nrp1 has an intrinsically disordered PLD, which can undergo amyloid-like conformational conversions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alberti et al., 2009</xref>) and shows specific binding to b-isox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>). We speculated that the structural flexibility of the PLD could promote the interaction of Nrp1 with misfolded proteins. To test this hypothesis, we mildly overexpressed Nrp1-mCherry in cells carrying luciferase-coated μNS particles. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, Nrp1 weakly interacted with the particles, even in the absence of stress. Importantly, when we subsequently applied a robust heat shock, a large amount of Nrp1 accumulated on the surface of the particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This suggests that the interaction between Nrp1 and misfolded proteins is sufficient to ectopically induce stress granule formation. Next, we tested a variant of Nrp1 lacking the PLD. Remarkably, this variant was unable to recognize the luciferase-coated particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In contrast, the isolated PLD showed robust binding to luciferase particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), demonstrating that the PLD is sufficient for the interaction with misfolded proteins. Thus, PLDs can promiscuously interact with misfolded proteins, and such promiscuous interactions can nucleate the formation of stress granules, in particular under conditions of robust heat stress.</p><p>Why do misfolded proteins only nucleate stress granules under robust heat-shock conditions? We reasoned that under mild stress conditions the activity of the cellular chaperone machinery is sufficient to prevent promiscuous interactions between misfolded proteins and stress granule components. Indeed, when Hsp104 was inhibited, a mild heat shock was sufficient to induce the co-aggregation of endogenous Nrp1 and misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>A mild stress stimulus can protect cells from subsequent severe stress, a phenomenon known as preconditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Parsell and Lindquist, 1993</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that preconditioning could prevent the co-aggregation of stress granule components and misfolded proteins. We preconditioned yeast cells by increasing the temperatures incrementally from 25°C to 46°C. Under these conditions, Pab1 and Pub1 did not co-aggregate with misfolded proteins but formed assemblies in distinct areas of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7</xref>). This shows that molecular chaperones constantly work to prevent promiscuous interactions with misfolded proteins and that misfolded proteins only act as scaffolds for stress granules when the capacity of the protein quality control machinery is overrun. It also suggests that preconditioned cells are protected from promiscuous interactions with misfolded proteins, presumably because of the up-regulation of chaperones.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Stress granule assembly is redundant and adaptable</title><p>Our findings suggest that an interaction with misfolded proteins is not required for stress granule formation. To investigate how stress granules form independently of misfolded proteins, we again focused on Nrp1. We first tested which domains of Nrp1 are required for recruitment to stress granules. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, the RBD alone was sufficient for localization to stress granules, whereas the PLD was not. This is consistent with many other studies, which reported that PLDs are dispensable for RNP granule localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reijns et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cai and Futcher, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grousl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kruger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bley et al., 2014</xref>). One potential explanation for the observed dispensability of PLDs is that they mediate interactions that are redundant and weak and thus only manifest when these domains are present at high local concentrations. To test this possibility, we used our particle assay to concentrate stress granule proteins in living cells, thus, creating a molecular environment similar to that in RNP granules. First, we generated particles that carried full-length Nrp1 on the surface. After having confirmed that Nrp1-μNS particles are not recognized by chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s8">Figure 6—figure supplement 8</xref>), we tested whether Nrp1 could ectopically nucleate the formation of stress granules. Indeed, particle-bound Nrp1 was able to recruit additional Nrp1 molecules from the cytosol, and upon heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, bottom panel) and glucose depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s9">Figure 6—figure supplement 9</xref>, bottom panel) stress granules formed on Nrp1 particles. As a next step, we tested which domains of Nrp1 are required for this behavior. We generated two deletion mutants comprising either the RBD or the PLD. We first confirmed that these truncation mutants were not misfolded when presented on the particle surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s10">Figure 6—figure supplement 10</xref>). Using these particles, we found that both the PLD and the RBD were able to recruit full-length Nrp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>) and promoted the formation of stress granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s11">Figure 6—figure supplement 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s12">Figure 6—figure supplement 12</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that stress granule assembly is highly redundant and that nucleation can proceed in multiple ways, through PLDs or RBDs. Our data further suggest that PLDs work synergistically with RBDs and only function when present at a high local concentration, as during RNP granule assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Maintenance of yeast P-body integrity requires Hsp104</title><p>Our findings so far show that P bodies are liquid-like droplets, in contrast to stress granules, which behave as true aggregates. Because of this distinction, we predicted that P bodies do not co-aggregate with misfolded proteins. Indeed, we found that P bodies showed only marginal co-localization with misfolded proteins in cells exposed to robust heat stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Co-localization with chaperones, such as Hsp42, Ssa1 and Hsp104, was also limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). We next tested whether P-body formation and dissolution is affected by protein disaggregases. Under normal or mild stress conditions, Hsp104 deficiency did not affect P-body formation. However, upon robust heat stress (46°C), the P-body protein Edc3 assembled into irregular aggregate-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), which persisted for extended times (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media12">Video 12</xref>). These aggregate-like structures co-localized with the stress granule marker Pub1 and misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), suggesting that Edc3 is mistargeted to stress granules in the absence of Hsp104.

To investigate the properties of P bodies and stress granules in mammalian cells, we generated stable HeLa cell lines expressing GFP-tagged G3PB2 or DCP1a as markers for stress granules or P bodies, respectively, using BAC TransgeneOmics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Poser et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We tested mammalian stress granules and P bodies for three characteristics that define a liquid-like compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>): first, a liquid compartment should be roughly spherical due to surface tension. Second, the components within the compartment should undergo rapid internal rearrangement and third, two liquid droplets should fuse and relax into one droplet. Indeed, the stress granules and P bodies in our cell lines had a characteristic circular shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), as expected for a liquid-droplet state. We also noticed that stress granules, in particular in the early stage of stress exposure, merged and formed larger structures over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media14">Video 14</xref>), as did P bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media15">Video 15</xref>). In both cases, the structures rapidly relaxed into more spherical structures, in agreement with a liquid-like state. Next, we applied a technique known as ‘half-bleach’ to test for internal mobility within the compartment. In this method, roughly half a structure is bleached, and the distribution of the fluorescence within the photo-manipulated structure is then determined over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>). The analysis of such a half-bleach event showed that G3BP2 was redistributed rapidly within stress granules from the unbleached to the bleached area (because of the small size we cannot perform a similar experiment for P bodies) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). To further investigate the material properties of these RNP granules, we treated HeLa cells harboring P bodies and stress granules with hexanediol. Hexanediol triggered the disintegration of both types of compartments, whereas a control amyloid structure, Q103-GFP, was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Thus, we conclude that P bodies and stress granules have liquid-like properties in mammalian cells: they turn over rapidly, are spherical, and when they fuse they relax into one spherical assembly.

We further show that the formation of yeast stress granules does not involve amyloid-like conformational conversions. Rather, yeast stress granules resemble amorphous protein aggregates. Assembly of these aggregates depends on interactions with RNAs, and PLDs in RNA-binding proteins contribute to granule formation, by promiscuously interacting with other PLDs or with misfolded proteins. Finally, we show that stress granules have very different properties in mammalian cells, where they have liquid-like characteristics and do not behave as aggregates. In summary, these findings show that RNP granule formation is highly flexible, and that under conditions of acute stress, disaggregating machines play a key role in maintaining the identity and integrity of RNP granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06807.056</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustrating the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of stress-inducible RNP granules.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RNA-protein (RNP) granule formation as a two-step assembly process.

This is particularly important for single-celled organisms such as yeast because they are directly exposed to environmental fluctuations. How can a cell respond rapidly and efficiently to stress, while at the same time solving the task of adjusting the activities of numerous proteins and RNAs? An increasing number of studies suggest that this can be achieved by building compartments. Such compartments are condensed phases of proteins and RNAs, which exchange components with the surrounding cytoplasm or nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hyman and Brangwynne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hyman and Simons, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Feric and Brangwynne, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hubstenberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). Two types of compartments can be distinguished: compartments for localized biochemistry in which specific chemical reactions occur; and compartments for storage, where macromolecules adopt an inactive, yet re-activatable state. The prediction would be that these two types of compartments have different properties.</p><p>Indeed, a large body of work shows that P bodies are active compartments, involved in processing and degrading mRNAs; stress granules on the other hand do not perform biochemical reactions, but store proteins and RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Anderson and Kedersha, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Decker and Parker, 2012</xref>). P bodies are therefore expected to have different properties than stress granules. A P body should allow for the continuous entry and exit of RNAs and proteins, and the components within a P body should be able to rearrange. A liquid phase meets these demands. Stress granules on the other hand do not need to be liquid-like. Their function is to inactivate proteins and RNAs by removing them from the cytoplasm. Thus, a solid-like state is fully compatible with the function of stress granules. Our findings indeed reveal a remarkable distinction between yeast P-bodies and stress granules. Previous studies have also pointed to differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buchan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Decker and Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mitchell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shah et al., 2013</xref>). Based on these findings, we propose that yeast P-bodies are liquid-like droplets that form by demixing from the cytoplasm, whereas yeast stress granules form through a liquid–solid phase transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We hypothesize that these findings are specific to yeast and do not apply to mammalian cells. Indeed, studies suggest that mammalian cells have developed other ways of controlling stress granule assembly, primarily through posttranslational modifications of stress granule proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Anderson and Kedersha, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buchan and Parker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kedersha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wippich et al., 2013</xref>). Future studies will provide further insight into the distinct molecular mechanisms underlying stress granule formation in yeast and mammalian cells.</p><p>We used the small organic alcohol 1,6-hexanediol to differentiate between liquid-like and solid-like cellular structures. Hexanediol disperses liquid germ granules in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Updike et al., 2011</xref>) and impairs transport across the nuclear pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ribbeck and Gorlich, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Patel et al., 2007</xref>), two processes that depend on weak interactions between sticky intrinsically disordered domains. We do not yet understand how hexanediol perturbs RNP granules. However, it should be noted that hexanediol is widely used as an additive in protein crystallization studies. Protein crystallization is typically approached in an empirical manner, and its success often depends on the formation of a liquid protein phase by phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Galkin and Vekilov, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dumetz et al., 2008</xref>). It is believed that additives such as hexanediol inhibit or promote the formation of this liquid phase, or otherwise modify its physicochemical properties, and by doing so favor the formation of a crystal. Thus, we speculate that hexanediol perturbs the weak interactions in liquid-like assemblies, leaving stronger interactions that are characteristic of more solid-like structures intact. This suggests that hexanediol could be a useful tool to probe the material properties of cellular structures.</p><p>Our observations support the conclusion that yeast stress granules are solid protein aggregates. First, hexanediol disperses P bodies but not stress granules. Second, yeast stress granule components are co-deposited with misfolded proteins. Finally, yeast stress granules are substrates for chaperones and disaggregases. A previous study suggested that stress granule components assemble around misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cherkasov et al., 2013</xref>). However, this hypothesis could not be tested directly because it requires control over the nucleation step of protein aggregation. Using an assay to ectopically form protein aggregates, we show that misfolded proteins can indeed nucleate stress granules, in particular when the stress intensity is high and when the overall disaggregation activity is low. However, although yeast stress granules resemble aggregates, they showed no properties of amyloids: they could not be stained with ThT, and we found no evidence that stress granule proteins convert into structures with amyloid-like properties. This suggests that stress granule proteins do not assemble into amyloid-like aggregates under physiological conditions, but rather form amorphous aggregates.</p><p>We do not yet know which interactions make yeast stress granules more solid-like. However, we speculate that stress granule proteins carry aggregation-prone domains, which act as stress sensors, as previously also proposed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cherkasov et al., 2013</xref>). Upon stress, these domains could expose interaction sites that promote assembly into amorphous aggregates. We propose that assembly through these sensor domains is largely specific, as this would provide better control over the assembly process and could facilitate dissolution in the recovery phase. In fact, a similar type of assembly has been observed in starved yeast, where several metabolic enzymes form higher order assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Noree et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Petrovska et al., 2014</xref>). These enzymes polymerize upon energy depletion, and when yeast cells are replenished with nutrients, they disassemble within minutes. How enzyme assembly can be specific in the crowded environment of a cell is still unclear, but it probably involves interactions via protein surfaces that are sterically and electrostatically compatible. Thus, we propose that yeast stress granules are functional aggregates, which assemble through a controlled process that is driven by a range of specific and promiscuous interactions between proteins and RNAs.</p><p>Previous studies proposed an important role for prion-like low-complexity domains in RNP granule assembly. This was based on the observation that these domains can undergo conformational conversions into amyloid-like fibers in a cell-free system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). Assembly into these structures was accompanied by the formation of hydrogels, and these hydrogels could reversibly interact with other prion-like proteins in a homotypic or heterotypic manner. Accordingly, a model for RNP granule assembly was proposed that put a strong emphasis on the ability of PLDs to assemble into amyloid-like protein scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). The problem with this model, however, is that hydrogels only rearrange over long timescales, and thus can hardly provide the dynamic properties that are characteristic of RNP granules in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Malinovska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bley et al., 2014</xref>). To account for this, it was suggested that these amyloid-like fibers are dynamic in vivo, due to regulation by posttranslational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>). However, evidence for dynamic fibers in living cells is still lacking.</p><p>We used self-assembling particles to locally concentrate prion-like proteins in living cells, creating a molecular environment that resembles that in RNP granules. Using this assay, we find that prion-like proteins promote RNP granule formation, but independently of amyloid-like conversions. Thus, above a certain critical concentration, PLDs can promote a phase transition of RNA-binding proteins into RNP granules. Based on these findings, we favor the following two-step model of RNP granule formation: First, RNA-binding proteins bind to RNAs through multivalent interactions via RBDs, forming complexes of RNA and protein; these RNP complexes may already reach a relatively large size. In the second step, these RNP complexes condense into RNP granules driven by promiscuous interactions between PLDs and further associations between RNAs and RBDs. In this model, the PLDs primarily assist the final coalescence step, thus, promoting the condensation of RNPs into large compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In agreement with this, recent findings indicate that PLDs are not essential for RNP granule formation per se but rather promote the fusion of RNP granules and their enlargement into bigger RNP compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shiina and Nakayama, 2014</xref>). However, the function of PLDs may also depend on their specific local environment: In P bodies, the collective properties of PLDs may be important for maintaining a dynamic, liquid-like state, whereas in solid assemblies such as stress granules, PLDs may act as molecular glue to connect RNA-binding proteins with other RNA-binding proteins or misfolded proteins. Thus, PLDs may function as adaptable interaction domains, which do not undergo conversions into structurally well-defined amyloid-like states, but mediate promiscuous interactions with many binding partners in their local environment. Such behavior would be highly favorable, because it allows a high degree of flexibility during compartment formation.</p><p>We found that in heavily stressed yeast cells, the continuous action of protein disaggregases is required to keep P bodies in a liquid-like state. Interference with protein disaggregation caused the mislocalization of P-body components to stress granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>), suggesting that P-body proteins and potentially many other proteins can enter into a stress granule state, but are normally prevented from doing so through molecular chaperones such as Hsp104. This implies that the molecular composition of stress granules is also a function of the cellular disaggregation activity and that yeast cells try to keep a fraction of the cytoplasm in a dynamic liquid-like state, presumably to maintain their viability.</p><p>We found that the two Hsp110 disaggregases Sse1 and Sse2 make a significant contribution to the cellular disaggregation activity, but that Hsp104 adopts an essential function, without which yeast cells cannot dissolve stress granules. In contrast to yeast, mammalian cells do not express a Hsp104 homolog in the cytosol. Therefore, we speculate that the ability of yeast to enter into a solid stress granule state has co-evolved with Hsp104, providing a potential explanation for why yeast and mammalian stress granules have different material properties. In contrast to mammalian organisms, sedentary yeast cells cannot escape from harsh environments. We conjecture that for yeast, formation of solid stress granules is an effective way of preserving the pre-stress state of the cytosol and that a selected set of yeast proteins and RNAs has been modified by evolution to aggregate upon stress. Consistent with this, a recent study showed that the yeast proteome has a higher overall aggregation propensity than the human proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Albu et al., 2014</xref>). When the stress subsides, Hsp104 reactivates the proteins and RNAs preserved in solid stress granules, thus promoting re-entry into the cell cycle. We note that this situation is reminiscent of dormancy, as for example in spores or seeds, where an entire organism enters into a resting state by solidifying its macromolecular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parry et al., 2014</xref>). Future work will show whether controlled entry into a solid phase can provide general protection to a cell in stressful environments.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning procedures</title><p>Cloning procedures were performed as described previously using the Gateway system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alberti et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2009</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor), Jeffery Kelly (Reviewing editor), and two reviewers, one of whom, Aaron Gitler, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Non membrane-delimited subcellular compartments play critical cellular functions essential for life. Two such subcellular compartments are processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules (SGs), which are composed of RNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Many of the protein constituents of SGs and P-bodies contain domains resembling yeast prions (called prion-like domains). Are SGs and P-bodies merely protein aggregates or do they represent structures with other physical and chemical properties? The manuscript by Kroschwald et al. addresses the physicochemical nature of RNP bodies and uses genetic, chemical, and microscopic imaging approaches. The paper focuses on P bodies and stress granules in budding yeast, and mammalian tissue culture cells are also briefly considered. The authors convincingly show that there are different types of bodies that form in yeast: dynamic liquid-like structures that are SDS soluble and which can also be dissolved in vivo by the application of the aliphatic alcohol hexanediol, and more static, amyloid-like structures that are SDS insoluble and hexanediol resistant. Disaggregases, in particularly <italic>hsp104</italic>, were capable of re-dissolving heat or glucose-starvation induced granules, suggesting that the assembly of these kinds of structures may be dynamically regulated. The authors also utilize a somewhat novel genetically encoded particle assembled from a viral capsid protein to test the ability of different proteins to recruit P body and stress granule components. The following suggestions are offered for improving the manuscript:</p><p>1) The authors cleverly use hexanediol to disrupt P-bodies but not SGs. But they had to use two different strains to visualize P-bodies and SGs. This experiment would be more compelling if the authors could use a system that simultaneously labels P-bodies and SGs in the same cell and show that under the same conditions, hexanediol eliminates P-bodies but not SGs. For example, Buchan and colleagues recently used a yeast strain harboring Pab1-GFP and Edc3-mCherry as SG and P-body markers.</p><p>2) The amyloid-like state and P-body state Lsm4:Edc3 colocalizations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> look somewhat different. Perfect co-localization for the amyloid-state ones vs. somewhat offset localization for the P-body ones. Is this observation reproducible? Can the authors speculate on the significance of this?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors show that Nrp1 prion domain is necessary and sufficient to nucleate SGs. But are the Nrp1PLD foci really SGs? Do other SG markers also form and co-localize? The authors cleverly use the genetically encoded micro-particle to present the Nrp1 prion domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), which seems to nucleate the formation of SGs, using Nrp1-mCherry as a marker. Is this homo-typic interaction (full-length Nrp1 w/ prion domain of Nrp1) required for the subsequent recruitment of other SG proteins? In other words, could the authors repeat this experiment, but in an Nrp1∆ background and without using the Nrp1-mCherry marker. Would the Nrp1 prion domain still be sufficient to recruit other SG proteins via heterotypic prion domain associations? These experiments could be useful in supporting the hypothesis that SGs in yeast are formed by promiscuous interactions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06807.060</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors cleverly use hexanediol to disrupt P-bodies but not SGs.

In living cells, however, some structures diffuse very rapidly. To image P bodies and other structures, we acquired z stacks of yeast cells. This required that we take multiple images of the same cell in different planes, often in two different channels (GFP and mCherry). Although we imaged the GFP and mCherry signals of each plane in quick sequential order, a movement of the P body during the acquisition often led to somewhat offset localization of the two signals. Thus, this does not reflect a true lack of colocalization, but is due to a technical problem. The same offset was not observed for amyloid-like assemblies, because they are usually larger and thus diffuse much more slowly.</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>, the authors show that Nrp1 prion domain is necessary and sufficient to nucleate SGs.

Is this homo-typic interaction (full-length Nrp1 w/ prion domain of Nrp1) required for the subsequent recruitment of other SG proteins? In other words, could the authors repeat this experiment, but in an Nrp1∆ background and without using the Nrp1-mCherry marker. Would the Nrp1 prion domain still be sufficient to recruit other SG proteins via heterotypic prion domain associations? These experiments could be useful in supporting the hypothesis that SGs in yeast are formed by promiscuous interactions</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. To demonstrate that SGs can be nucleated through promiscuous heterotypic interactions, we repeated the experiment with plasmid-expressed fusions between µNS and Nrp1, Nrp1PLD or Nrp1∆PLD in a ∆<italic>nrp1</italic> background using Pub1-mCherry as SG marker, as suggested by the reviewers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s12">Figure 6–figure supplement 12</xref> shows that both the PLD and the RRM (∆PLD) domain of Nrp1 can nucleate Pub1-positive SGs under conditions of stress. No colocalization was observed under normal growth conditions. This shows that full-length Nrp1 is not required for SG formation and that heterotypic interactions are sufficient to nucleate SGs under stress conditions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
