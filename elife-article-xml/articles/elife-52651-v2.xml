increases the risk for psychopathologies associated with amygdala-prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuits. While sex differences in vulnerability have been identified with a clear need for individualized intervention strategies, the neurobiological substrates of ELA-attributable differences remain unknown due to a paucity of translational investigations taking both development and sex into account. Male and female rats exposed to maternal separation ELA were analyzed with anterograde tracing from basolateral amygdala (BLA) to PFC to identify sex-specific innervation trajectories through juvenility (PD28) and adolescence (PD38;PD48). Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) was assessed longitudinally (PD28;PD48) in a separate cohort. All measures were related to anxiety-like behavior. ELA-exposed rats showed precocial maturation of BLA-PFC innervation, with females affected earlier than males. ELA also disrupted maturation of female rsFC, with enduring relationships between rsFC and anxiety-like behavior. This study is the first providing both anatomical and functional evidence for sex- and experience-dependent corticolimbic development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Having a traumatic childhood increases the risk a person will develop anxiety disorders later in life.

In the experiments, one group of rats was repeatedly separated from their mothers and littermates (an early life trauma), while a second group was not. Honeycutt et al. examined the connections between the BLA and PFC in the two groups at three different time periods during their development: the juvenile stage, early adolescence, and late adolescence.</p><p>The experiments showed stronger connections between the BLA and PFC begin to appear earlier in juvenile traumatized female rats. But these changes did not appear in their male counterparts until adolescence. Lastly, the rats that developed these strengthened BLA-PFC connections also behaved more anxiously later in life. This may mean that the ideal timing for interventions may be different for males and females. More work is needed to see if these results translate to humans and then to find the best times and methods to help people who experienced childhood trauma.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>innervation</kwd><kwd>basolateral amygdala</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>adolescence</kwd><kwd>maternal separation</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01MH107556-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brenhouse</surname><given-names>Heather C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Early life adversity led to hyper-innervation from the basolateral amygdala to the prefrontal cortex earlier in females than males and disrupted maturation of functional connectivity, which predicted anxiety-like outcomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Exposure to early life adversity (ELA) increases vulnerability to various psychiatric disorders across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Smyke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McEwen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maccari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Callaghan and Tottenham, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hane and Fox, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Krugers et al., 2017</xref>). Males and females appear to be affected differently by ELA, with females more prone to developing disorders including anxiety and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hammen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis and Pfaff, 2014</xref>). Importantly, these sequelae often emerge later in childhood or adolescence, providing an opportunistic window for intervention before psychopathology takes hold. Thus, development of effective intervention strategies requires biological and developmental targets specific to individuals based on factors including sex and timing of stress exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lupien et al., 2009</xref>). Evidence suggests that ELA in humans leads to life-long changes in connectivity and/or functionality of limbic and cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">VanTieghem and Tottenham, 2018</xref>), with consequential deficits in emotion regulation and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tyrka et al., 2013</xref>). Both human and animal studies highlight the importance of corticolimbic circuitry in affective behavior regulation, its disruption in mental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Herringa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bangasser and Valentino, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Killgore et al., 2014</xref>), and alterations directly related to ELA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kaiser et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, Tottenham and colleagues illustrated that normative developmental changes in task-based functional connectivity (FC) between amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are accelerated after ELA with associated changes in anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gee et al., 2013a</xref>) and are particularly evident in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dickie and Armony, 2008</xref>). Indeed, children institutionalized during the first two years of life in orphanages display <italic>precocial</italic> development of amygdala-mPFC FC, though the anatomical substrates for this accelerated connectivity remain unknown.</p><p>In rats, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) sends inputs to the mPFC and modulates anxiety-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Felix-Ortiz et al., 2016</xref>), recall of emotionally salient information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McGaugh, 2004</xref>), decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">St Onge et al., 2012</xref>), and goal-directed behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schoenbaum et al., 2000</xref>). Notably, two subpopulations of BLA neurons project to different regions of the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Senn et al., 2014</xref>): projections to the dorsal (prelimbic; PL) region of the mPFC are active during threat-associated fear learning and expression, whereas projections from the BLA to the ventral (infralimbic; IL) region of the mPFC are active upon extinction of fear, or learning about safety signals. In typically developing male rats, BLA innervation of mPFC increases through adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>), likely contributing to healthy maturation of threat and safety appraisal. Notably, BLA-mPFC axonal innervation has not yet been evaluated in females, nor has any study examined the effects of ELA on BLA-derived innervation of PL or IL.</p><p>Evidence in both the human and rodent literature supports the role of amygdala-PFC circuitry in the regulation of anxiety-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Likhtik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arruda-Carvalho and Clem, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fragale et al., 2016</xref>). However, the neurobiological mechanisms are ill-defined and therefore require investment in translational animal research to pinpoint neural contributions to affective pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shackman and Wager, 2019</xref>). Emerging evidence in rodents suggests that perturbations of this circuit – particularly following various models of ELA – may be implicated in maladaptive maintenance of anxiety-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chocyk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maccari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Krugers et al., 2017</xref>). ELA via chronic stress has been shown to increase BLA-derived glutamatergic release within the PFC, a finding that can be recapitulated via BLA-PFC stimulation in typical mice and is associated with increased anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lowery-Gionta et al., 2018</xref>). This is in line with reports of altered excitatory:inhibitory balance within the BLA-PFC circuit that is associated with changes in affective behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arruda-Carvalho and Clem, 2014</xref>). For example, excitatory latencies of PFC neurons to amygdalar stimulation in adult rats were significantly longer in animals with a history of ELA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ishikawa et al., 2015</xref>). It is likely that ELA-induced changes in plasticity lead to increased BLA-derived excitatory signaling into the PFC, with insufficient reciprocal PFC-driven anxiolytic signals returning to the BLA. However, there is presently insufficient evidence to determine the neuroanatomical time-course of this developing circuit, and a lack of evidence evaluating its modulation by additional factors (i.e. sex, development).</p><p>Clinical evidence points to striking sex differences in the clinical time-course and symptomology of ELA effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wainwright and Surtees, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Martin et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, several studies in animals over the past two decades have revealed sex-specific effects of ELA on anxiety-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tractenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonapersona et al., 2019b</xref>) and adolescent or adult corticolimbic measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Salzberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Holland et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Farrell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blaze and Roth, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonapersona et al., 2019a</xref>), however little is known about the interaction of sex and ELA on corticolimbic development. Notably, typically developing females display earlier maturation of the PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lenroot et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lenroot and Giedd, 2010</xref>). Identifying how ELA affects these sex-dependent trajectories is crucial to understanding sex differences in vulnerability and to developing individually targeted intervention strategies. Therefore, we used anterograde tracing to examine ELA effects on BLA-PFC innervation over development in male and female rats. We hypothesized that if heightened anxiety-like behaviors following ELA are associated with increased BLA-derived PFC innervation, then rats exposed to ELA via repeated isolation from dam and littermates will display anxiety-like behavior and increased BLA-PFC innervation that will be more robust in females.</p><p>While task-based FC illustrates coordinated responsivity to anxiety-provoking stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gee et al., 2013a</xref>), resting-state FC (rsFC) is excellent for probing the functional integrity of the amygdala-PFC circuit independent of task demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Thomason et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Thomason et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alarcón et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gabard-Durnam et al., 2016</xref>). ELA effects on corticolimbic rsFC in humans are inconsistent, likely because of reliance on autobiographical questionnaires, different ages of measurement, and different ELA criteria. In rats, maternal separation results in early emergence of both adult-like fear learning based in fronto-amygdala circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Callaghan and Richardson, 2011</xref>) and early amygdala structural maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ono et al., 2008</xref>). rsFC has recently been utilized in rats to characterize ELA (via limited bedding) induced changes in BLA-PFC connectivity in preweanling males, revealing an association between decreased rsFC and adult fear behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guadagno et al., 2018</xref>). Early or blunted maturation of corticolimbic connectivity likely has deleterious consequences because a sufficient degree of PFC immaturity during juvenility is critical for learning anxiolytic cues (safety signals) in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we provide a back-translation to examine whether ELA-exposed rats display accelerated maturation of amygdala-PFC connectivity to parallel humans with a history of adversity, with increased BLA-PFC innervation as a potential anatomical substrate driving sex-specific developmental effects. This multi-level approach aims to elucidate the neurobiological underpinnings of ELA-attributable vulnerability through the use of mechanistic neural tracing paired with a translational imaging investigation: an approach which enhances our ability to develop a cross-species understanding of ELA-associated pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fox and Shackman, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study 1: Neuroanatomy and axonal innervation</title><p>In order to chart the trajectory of innervation from the BLA to the PFC, the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was injected into the BLA of ELA-exposed and control (CON) males and females at PD21, PD31, or PD41.

The data reveal newly uncovered aberrations to PFC innervation that can be interpreted in the context of atypical behavior and FC that has been observed in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gee et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Philip et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Thomason et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Teicher et al., 2016</xref>) and in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>). These findings are the first description of sex-specific developmental trajectories following ELA, using a juxtaposition of rsFC as assessed in humans with an anatomically discrete measurement of monosynaptic innervation. We observed sex- and age-dependent effects on BLA innervation in PL and IL regions of the PFC following ELA in a rat model of caregiver deprivation. It is important to note here, especially given the current need for more transparency in reporting of ELA paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kentner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brenhouse and Bath, 2019</xref>) that pregnant dams were shipped to our facility, therefore all animals in our study underwent shipping stress during gestation. It is thus possible that effects of maternal separation reported here are a consequence of both prenatal and postnatal stress, which is common amongst human instances of early life stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pedersen et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings suggest that females may be particularly vulnerable to neuroanatomical consequences of early adversity, with innervation effects seen earlier in females compared to a later effect observed in males. This is in line with human studies describing sex-dependent effects of early adversity where female participants appear to exhibit more severe adolescent and later-life consequences, especially with regard to affective disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Humphreys et al., 2015</xref>). Rodent studies investigating potential sex differences have also largely revealed female-specific increases in adolescent anxiety-like behavior following ELA (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Salberg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Manzano-Nieves et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Viola et al., 2019</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonapersona et al. (2019b)</xref> for further examination), though some studies have failed to show any anxiety-like effects in adolescence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doherty et al., 2017</xref>). Little, however, has been known to date regarding biological substrates for sex-specific consequences on anxiety-like behaviors.</p><p>Our data indicate that BLA-IL innervation increases through adolescence in a bilaminar manner across development, with more dramatic increases following ELA in both males and females. Importantly, these main effects of age support previous work in male rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>) and now characterize a similar trajectory in female rats. Interestingly, increased innervation to the IL in PD28 females and PD38 males occurred in IL2, whereas previous work has shown that in wild-type adult mice, the BLA preferentially targets amygdala-projecting neurons in IL5 over IL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheriyan et al., 2016</xref>). Since IL2 projection neurons do also project back to the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gabbott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Little and Carter, 2013</xref>), it is possible that atypical hyper-innervation after maternal separation aberrantly targets layer 2, which may drive the altered maturation of BLA-IL functional connectivity we observed in the present work.</p><p>While IL innervation showed a developmental increase through adolescence, PL innervation appeared to reach adult-like levels in both sexes earlier than was previously captured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Van Eden and Uylings, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouwmeester et al., 2002</xref>). Following ELA, however, our data indicate that aberrant effects on innervation were apparent at PD28 in females, but not until PD38 in males; this finding was observed across both the PL and IL. However, while ELA conferred a similar age-dependent influx of BLA axonal innervation in both regions, the long-term neuroanatomical alterations were different depending on the region examined. In IL there was evidence of precocial maturation, such that ELA induced BLA-IL innervation that was comparable to more mature (PD48) patterns in female juveniles (PD28) and male early adolescents (PD38). Interestingly, in PL we saw a transient effect of ELA that was age- and sex-dependent. Indeed, within the PL we observed that both male and female rats showed an unexpected transient spike in innervation that appeared to resolve at the following developmental timepoint. It is possible that reversal of the innervation seen at earlier time points may be due to pruning mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Koss et al., 2014</xref>) that typically occur in adolescence, and these mechanisms may serve to mediate excess innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rakic et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Spear, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Riccomagno and Kolodkin, 2015</xref>). Prior work has shown a peak in BLA-PL connectivity, specifically at PD30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pattwell et al., 2016</xref>), that may contribute to the present findings of transient ELA-exacerbated hyper-innervation. However, this does not explain why innervation to the PL spiked at PD28, was reduced to CON levels at PD38, and then spiked again by PD48 in female ELA. It is possible that the temporary (one week) isolation following surgery may have acted as a secondary stressor acting in conjunction with pubertal changes to produce a resurgence of this ELA-specific phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen and Teicher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tzanoulinou and Sandi, 2016</xref>). Relatedly, surgery itself during peripubertal development compared to other time periods may have differentially interacted with ELA.</p><p>Importantly, the ages at which ELA-exposed females and males first displayed increased BLA-IL innervation (PD28 and PD38, respectively) were the ages at which higher innervation correlated with higher anxiety-like behavior (less time spent in open arms of the EPM). Since monosynaptic input from the BLA to the medial PFC drives aversion to anxiogenic stimuli as measured in the EPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Felix-Ortiz et al., 2016</xref>), these data suggest that hypertrophic effects of ELA at the BLA-IL circuit lead to heightened anxiety-like behavior in ELA-exposed animals. However, we were surprised that group-wise comparisons only showed higher anxiety-like behaviors in ELA females at PD38, but not at PD28 when innervation was increased (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Group comparisons also failed to reveal higher anxiety-like behaviors in ELA-exposed males at any age. Our group and others have previously observed increased anxiety-like behaviors in male and female rats following ELA (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Holland et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ganguly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jin et al., 2018</xref>), therefore further work will reveal whether more sensitive assays can more reliably demonstrate anxiety-like behavior in ELA-exposed rats. Here we demonstrate that, regardless of mean differences, ELA experience can forge a relationship between heightened innervation and anxiety-like behavior at distinct developmental time-points that could suggest mechanistic ties between early hypertrophy of inputs and behavior.</p><p>Transient effects of ELA on innervation and behavior are notable because adolescent perturbations have been shown to have lasting consequences on later life function. Multiple lines of evidence from both clinical and animal studies suggest that physiological or experiential anomalies during critical periods of development can program the central nervous system for susceptibility or resilience to future environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nederhof and Schmidt, 2012</xref>). One example is seen in an animal model utilizing prenatal treatment with the mitotoxin MAM, which produces adolescent-specific corticolimbic and mesolimbic dysfunctions that drive a hyperresponsivity to stress with anxiety-like and psychosis-like behavior. If conversion to the dysfunctional phenotype in adolescence is prevented by relieving stress in adolescence, MAM-treated animals will still be more susceptible to affective dysfunction in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gomes et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, ELA reportedly leads to adolescent alterations in PFC NMDA receptor subunit composition that regulate anxiety-like behaviors in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ganguly et al., 2015</xref>); future work will reveal whether increased glutamatergic input from the BLA drives these receptor changes in the PFC. Since the PFC can serve reciprocally as a modulator of BLA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rosenkranz and Grace, 2002</xref>), it is therefore possible that transient innervation changes lead to long-term receptor alterations and subsequent changes to the efficiency of BLA-PFC functional connectivity. Indeed, we observed an effect of rearing in female anxiety-like behavior and functional connectivity after the age when innervation to the PL and IL2 was increased (PD28). Together, the early increases in innervation after ELA reported here may perturb normal critical period maturation, leading to late-onset effects on functional connectivity and affective dysregulation.</p><p>While the current work did not directly address the causal relationship between innervation and rsFC, results from the rsFC analyses in females supported the idea that early maturation of BLA-IL innervation disrupts later functional relationships between these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tottenham and Galván, 2016</xref>). Specifically, we report here that females exposed to ELA displayed dampened maturation of BLA-IL rsFC compared to female CON; while no effects of rearing were apparent at PD28, ELA female rats failed to display the increase in BLA-IL rsFC by PD48 that was observed in female CON. This is in line with previous work showing reduced BLA-mPFC connectivity following a limited bedding model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guadagno et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, increased [more mature] rsFC BLA-IL connectivity in female ELA at PD28 correlated with decreased anxiety-like behavior at that age, as well as 20 days later. This suggests that more mature connectivity in female juveniles may confer enduring behavioral resilience, which is consistent with previous reports that dampened connectivity is associated with increased anxiety in adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nooner et al., 2013</xref>). While ELA exposure in males appeared to result in lower juvenile (PD28) rsFC between the BLA and the PL, no effects on the magnitude of change between PD28-PD48 were noted, therefore altered maturation per se was not observed in males. Interestingly, ELA affected male BLA-PL rsFC at an age that preceded any ELA-attributable increase in innervation, suggesting that the reciprocal connectivity between the two regions was altered without the influence of aberrant amygdalofugal innervation.</p><p>ELA experience resulted in dampened maturation of BLA-IL rsFC in females, in contrast to the precocial maturation we observed in axonal innervation of the IL from the BLA, as well as the accelerated maturation of task-based FC reported following childhood maltreatment in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gee et al., 2013a</xref>). While BLA-mPFC rsFC in humans has been observed to increase towards more positive connectivity through adolescent development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gabard-Durnam et al., 2014</xref>), task-based FC during fearful face presentations declines from positive connectivity to a negative connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gee et al., 2013b</xref>). This task-based FC was further found to reach mature (more negative) levels in previously institutionalized children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gee et al., 2013a</xref>). In contrast, girls who express higher basal cortisol levels at 4.5 years display lower rsFC between the ventromedial PFC and the amygdala at 18 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burghy et al., 2012</xref>), corroborating our current findings in PD48 females (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). rsFC reflects an intrinsic alternate resonance between different brain areas connected at large scale, in contrast to the more isolated activation of the corresponding brain areas during a task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rasero et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it appears that early hyperinnervation to the PFC may alter the stability of the functional BLA-PFC network as it develops, leading to increased anxiety when innervation arises and disrupted maturation of rsFC; though how these effects in rats relate to task-based FC is currently unknown. It is also possible that early maturation of BLA-PFC projections may overwhelm the slow-maturing reciprocal projections to the BLA that dampen anxiety-related circuit activity in mature brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arruda-Carvalho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Selleck et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The present findings support previous work indicating the distinct functional relationship between the BLA and PL and IL regions of mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calhoon and Tye, 2015</xref>), with PL connectivity related to anxiogenic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Felix-Ortiz et al., 2016</xref>) and IL connectivity promoting anxiolytic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maroun et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, these findings are in line with the idea that altered neuroanatomy and functionality of PL and IL, along with BLA, likely have reciprocal effects on one another, further contributing to the exacerbation of ELA-induced anxiety-like phenotypes in adolescence and early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Likhtik and Paz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zimmermann et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, maternal separation in rats was found to disrupt normative development of both anatomical (axonal innervation) and functional (rsFC) connectivity within a circuit regulating emotional processing, with sex-specific effects and evidence of resilience in individuals with precocial maturation of rsFC. Future work will investigate the physiological consequences of increased innervation that underlies rsFC and behavioral effects, as well as the potential impact of puberty on increased innervation, since females also reportedly display accelerated puberty initiation following ELA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grassi-Oliveira et al., 2016</xref>). The present findings have implications for intervention based on experience, age, and sex – three functionally interactive factors that uniquely define risk in every individual.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>For Studies 1 (BLA-mPFC innervation) and 2 (rsFC), timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) arrived at gestational day 15. Rats were housed under standard laboratory conditions in a 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights on at 0700 hr) temperature- and humidity-controlled vivarium with access to food and water ad libitum. Following birth (postnatal day [PD]0), litters were randomly assigned as either: CON, and left undisturbed with the exception of cage-changing twice/week and weighing (PD9, 11, 15, 20); or ELA via maternal and peer separation, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Farrell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ganguly et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grassi-Oliveira et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wieck et al., 2013</xref>) and below. In preliminary power analyses, we achieved with group sizes of 7–9 subjects effect sizes of η2 = 0.08–0.27 and power of 1-β=0.80–0.98 for piloted anterograde tracing data, and effect sizes of η2 = ~ 0.12 and power of ~1-β=0.80 with group sizes of 22 subjects in behavior studies, therefore we aimed for <italic>n</italic> = 10 for all studies involving innervation, allowing behavioral studies to include animals that did not reach criteria for inclusion in innervation analyses in Study 1. Group sizes were chosen for Study two based on preliminary studies showing that BOLD data from 7 to 8 rats/group yielded Cohen’s D values of 1.2–2.5. On PD1 litters were culled to 10 (+ /- 2) pups, maintaining equal ratio of male and female whenever possible, with one rat per litter assigned to each experimental group (i.e. age and sex) to avoid litter effects. Pups were assigned pseudo-randomly to experimental groups, where an investigator not involved in the study assigned a number to each pup in a litter, and a separate investigator assigned one number from each sex to an experimental group. All measurements were conducted by experimenters blinded to experimental condition through coding of microscopic slides, video recordings of behavior, and rsFC files. Throughout all experiments, outliers were identified when subjects were visibly agitated or otherwise behaving atypically outside of experimentation and were excluded from all analyses.</p><p>ELA pups were separated from dams and littermates in individual cups with home cage pine shavings in a circulating water bath (37°C) from PD2-PD10. At PD11-20, when body temperature is self-regulated, pups were individually separated into cages. Pups were separated for 4 hr each day (0900 h-1300h) during which time pups were deprived of maternal and littermate tactile stimulation and nursing, but not from maternal odor. ELA dams remained in their home cages but were deprived of their entire litters during separations. Pups were weaned at PD21 into same-sex mixed-litter pairs and left undisturbed until surgery/behavioral assessment for Study 1 (either PD21/28, 31/38, or 41/48; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Separate cohorts were used for Study 2 – with treatment identical to Study 1 – and left undisturbed until behavioral assessment and rsFC (PD28, PD48), with subjects imaged at both ages.

For maximal uptake without excess bolus, 200 nL (0.2μ l) of BDA was injected into the BLA using a mounted 32-gauge Neuros syringe (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV) attached to a microinfusion pump (11 Elite Nanomite; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA).</p><p>Rats were first anesthetized with Isoflurane in an induction chamber before beginning surgical procedures. Surgical site was shaved, and the animal was secured via ear bars with top incisors positioned over a bite bar within a nose cone to provide continuous Isoflurane anesthetic during surgery. A subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg body weight) was administered as a postoperative analgesic. Once sufficiently anesthetized, measured via lack of pedal reflex, a skin incision was made along the midline of the skull to visualize Bregma and Lambda. Dorsal-ventral (DV) coordinates for Bregma and Lambda were taken to ensure that the skull was level, and Bregma was used as a landmark to navigate to the position above the BLA, where a small hole was drilled into the right hemisphere of the skull, and the needle was slowly lowered into the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). DV depth was calculated from dura surface to account for individual differences in skull thickness. Once needle was lowered to the target, BDA was slowly infused at a rate of 40 nL/min over the course of 5 min and left in place for an additional 5 min to allow for diffusion of BDA solution before being slowly retracted. The incision was sutured, and rats were returned to individual cages and allowed 5–6 days for recovery before behavioral testing, with all brain tissue collected one-week post-surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Behavioral assessment: Elevated Plus Maze</title><p>Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) performance was evaluated 6–7 days post-surgery in all animals.

of early-life stress (ELS) on the development of the emotional brain in rats. Consistent with this team's earlier work and with brain imaging studies in humans exposed to ELS, the authors demonstrate that ELS accelerates the maturation of connectivity between the basolateral amygdala and prefrontal cortex, and this was particularly so among females. Imaging measures of functional connectivity were influenced by ELS in females at both ages, but only transiently among males. We were enthusiastic about this paper, in part, because makes an important step toward developing integrative cross-species models of stress-related psychopathology. This kind of work is just what the field needs to build bridges between the human and animal literature. The experiments appear to be technically sound, and the revised manuscript is thorough, clearly written, well-organized, has appropriate statistics, and makes appropriate conclusions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Too much, too young? Altered corticolimbic connectivity reveals sex-specific outcomes in a rat model of early adversity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Alexander Shackman as the Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Cate Pena (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors used a combination of anterograde axonal tracing and resting state functional connectivity to determine whether early life stress (ELS; maternal deprivation) altered trajectories of BLA-medial PFC (PL/IL) circuit development in male and female rats. Consistent with the lab's earlier work examining PFC interneuron maturation, and with regional connectivity findings from ELS-exposed humans, the authors find ELS accelerates maturation of BLA-PFC in females at an earlier time point than males. ELS also accelerated BLA-PFC maturation among males, albeit at a later age. Resting state connectivity was altered by ELS in females at both ages, but only transiently among males.</p><p>The reviewers and I were enthusiastic about the manuscript, which makes an important step toward developing integrative cross-species models of stress-related psychopathology:</p><p>• It is a nice series of experiments that take on the challenge of actually testing a long held belief about early life stress, i.e. accelerates development.</p><p>• What I really like about this manuscript is the use of a human focused technique that has been one basis for the idea of stress-induced precocial brain development (rsFMRI) and the authors paired this with experiments showing accelerated development in some more specific neural measures indicative of developmental maturity.</p><p>• Another strength of this manuscript is the use of fMRI paired with a more refined technique – this is just what the field needs to build bridges between the human and animal literature.</p><p>• This work is an important extension of several earlier findings across species using novel approaches, and includes female rats (absent in much previous work).</p><p>• Overall, the manuscript is thorough, well-organized, has appropriate statistics, and makes appropriate conclusions.</p><p>• I reviewed an earlier version of this manuscript elsewhere. The figures and clarity of the current version are much improved. The authors addressed my concerns in the Discussion and should be commended for prudence with language and interpretation.</p><p>• The experiments are technically sound, the rationale for the study is clear, and the results are appropriately analyzed.</p><p>• These studies were performed with care and expertise.</p><p>Major concerns and suggestions:</p><p>Nevertheless, our enthusiasm was somewhat tempered by several key limitations of the report. Major concerns included: weakness of the behavioral data, and important inconsistencies between the behavioral and neural data.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>• Figure 3. I do not see an anxiety effect for ELS – there is one data point that is significant taken from 3 measures in the EM over 3 ages – the significant point is at PD38 female ELS is lower than controls for time spent in open arm. Looking at the data, it seems this is due to one outlier in the control group with a very high score – all other data points are in the same general range. I understand the statistics presented in the manuscript show significant effects but, something seems off.</p><p>• Barring stronger behavioral data, the correlations between defensive behaviors (behavior) and brain measures-a major focus of the manuscript-seem unjustified.</p><p>• It seems like there is a small behavioral effect at one age but only one sex at that age. Visual inspection (female, control on PD38) raises the possibility the effect would disappear if one control data point was removed – leaving no effect at any age for any sex. Without the behavioral effect, most of the analysis in the manuscript needs to be deleted (i.e. correlations between neural measures and behavior).</p><p>Inconsistencies Across Measures:</p><p>• This (BLA-PL) came across as the strongest hypothesis from the start. ELS would be expected to increase anxiety over the lifetime and alteration of the BLA-PL would be the most straightforward mechanism to achieve this. By far, the ELS on BLA innervation of the PL were the clearest finding. ELS females showed earlier innervation (on P28) that receded on P38 but reemerged on P48. Males showed the exact inverse pattern, with ELS males showing greater innervation only on P38. These results set up a clear prediction for behavior in the elevated plus maze. Females should show greater anxiety on P28 and P48, but not P38; males should show the inverse pattern. This did not happen, there was no effect of ELS on male EPM behavior. In females, there was a main effect of ELS, but oddly, this was greatest on P38 – the developmental window during which BLA-PL connectivity did not differ. To me, this indicates that effect of ELS on innervation and behavior are not prominent. Further, when the relationship between connectivity and behavior were examined, a correlation and sex difference only emerge on P38. This was driven by a lack of relationship in females (which showed an effect of early life stress on that day) but a positive relationship in males (which showed no effect of early life stress on that day).</p><p>• fMRI study. Again, there was no relationship between BLA-PL connectivity and behavior in the EPM. Thus, the pathway most clearly affected by ELS in a sex-specific manner does not appear to contribute to anxiety behavior. Relationships were found for BLA-IL innervation and behavior, however the case for a sex-specific effect of ELS on BLA-IL innervation was much weaker. No three-way interaction was observed, making it questionable to split up males and females for separate analyses. Any likely BLA-IL innervation effects were layer-specific and observed in males, yet control and ELS males did not differ in the elevated plus maze.</p><p>• The effects of ELS on BLA-PFC innervation/connectivity seem to have little or nothing to do with the effects of ELS on anxiety behavior.

Major concerns included: weakness of the behavioral data, and important inconsistencies between the behavioral and neural data.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>• Figure 3. I do not see an anxiety effect for ELS – there is one data point that is significant taken from 3 measures in the EM over 3 ages – the significant point is at PD38 female ELS is lower than controls for time spent in open arm. Looking at the data, it seems this is due to one outlier in the control group with a very high score – all other data points are in the same general range. I understand the statistics presented in the manuscript show significant effects but, something seems off.</p><p>• It seems like there is a small behavioral effect at one age but only one sex at that age. Visual inspection (female, control on PD38) raises the possibility the effect would disappear if one control data point was removed – leaving no effect at any age for any sex.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the major strength of this article is the juxtaposition of altered anatomical innervation with a translational measure of altered functional connectivity in rats exposed to early life adversity, and we believe that a behavioral correlate provides useful additional information about the translatability and functional significance of these findings. With regards to the concern that one data point was driving the effect of maternal separation on female P38 time in open arms, we re-ran our 3-way analysis with that point removed and the effects held up (significant sex x rearing interaction <italic>p</italic> = 0.039; main effect of rearing <italic>p</italic> = 0.006; 2-way ANOVA main effect of rearing in females <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.0001). It is possible that the cluster of ELS data points on top of each other toward the low end of the scale make it difficult to perceive the real group difference. We did not remove that one control data point pointed out by the reviewers from our presented analyses, since it did not meet criterion as an outlier using the grubbs test. However, we still agree that our behavioral data, due to a current dearth of highly robust measures of anxiety-like behavior in rodents, has less value than the innervation and connectivity measures, which are robust. Available measures often only pick up “extreme” instances of anxiety when this – often subtle – affective state can be overtly measured in behavioral output (i.e. Steimer, 2011), and the output (particularly in models of chronic stress) can be vastly variable (D'Aquila et al., 1994; Lezak et al., 2017). However, we do believe the behavioral data is still worthy of inclusion, and of correlation with our neural measures. Specifically, there is value in the ability to view our data in the context of other animal studies of anxiety (using the EPM) following maternal separation, given the fact that this is the first study to our knowledge measuring this behavior over development in both males and females. As part of other suggestions raised, our revised manuscript now includes a more in-depth discussion (Discussion section) of the evidence driving the reasoning behind measuring anxiety-like behavior as a correlate of BLA→PFC innervation, regardless of whether or not the data perfectly map to what would be expected. Finally, we believe it is important to show these data in order to most transparently display the true effect size (in the context of all studies) of maternal separation on EPM behavior.</p><p>We apologize for the omission of EPM analyses in the functional connectivity cohort and thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Our intent was simply to not be redundant, especially since the cohort used for functional connectivity was a good deal smaller than that used for the first experiment. However, we understand that it is important to analyze these data similarly, and now include a mixed 3-way ANOVA for EPM in these animals. It is important to note that functional connectivity animals were only scanned and run on the EPM at P28 and again (in a longitudinal design) at P48—not at P38—and again no maternal separation effects were found at those ages. As described below, we believe that showing correlations of functional connectivity with this behavior, even at ages when no group differences were found, is informative for illustrating relationships between inter-individual variability in two potentially related measures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Barring stronger behavioral data, the correlations between defensive behaviors (behavior) and brain measures-a major focus of the manuscript-seem unjustified.</p><p>Without the behavioral effect, most of the analysis in the manuscript needs to be deleted (i.e. correlations between neural measures and behavior).</p></disp-quote><p>We submit that correlation of behavioral data with innervation measures is important regardless of strong group differences, since we did not necessarily think that there would be vast differences in anxiety-like behavior, and in fact, previous work from our lab and others often suggest small effects of ELS on behavior, which are usually quite variable. Therefore, we sought to correlate behavior with neuroanatomical and function outcomes to determine the gradient of behavioral impairment (measured via anxiety-like behavior) alongside a physiological gradient of ELS-impairment. Here, our correlation/regression analyses show compelling evidence that – despite not always showing significant group-based changes in overt behaviors – we can actually show a relationship (and in some instances – such as change in rsFC across development – even show predictive value of rsFC on behavioral output). We believe that the inclusion of these correlations – particularly where there are no overt effects in behavior due to individual variability – allow for the translational investigation of individual patterns of both neural and behavioral measures in a manner that is comparable to that seen in the human literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Inconsistencies Across Measures:</p><p>• This (BLA-PL) came across as the strongest hypothesis from the start. ELS would be expected to increase anxiety over the lifetime and alteration of the BLA-PL would be the most straightforward mechanism to achieve this. By far, the ELS on BLA innervation of the PL were the clearest finding. ELS females showed earlier innervation (on P28) that receded on P38 but reemerged on P48. Males showed the exact inverse pattern, with ELS males showing greater innervation only on P38. These results set up a clear prediction for behavior in the elevated plus maze. Females should show greater anxiety on P28 and P48, but not P38; males should show the inverse pattern. This did not happen, there was no effect of ELS on male EPM behavior. In females, there was a main effect of ELS, but oddly, this was greatest on P38 – the developmental window during which BLA-PL connectivity did not differ. To me, this indicates that effect of ELS on innervation and behavior are not prominent. Further, when the relationship between connectivity and behavior were examined, a correlation and sex difference only emerge on P38. This was driven by a lack of relationship in females (which showed an effect of early life stress on that day) but a positive relationship in males (which showed no effect of early life stress on that day).</p><p>• fMRI study. Again, there was no relationship between BLA-PL connectivity and behavior in the EPM. Thus, the pathway most clearly affected by ELS in a sex-specific manner does not appear to contribute to anxiety behavior. Relationships were found for BLA-IL innervation and behavior, however the case for a sex-specific effect of ELS on BLA-IL innervation was much weaker. No three-way interaction was observed, making it questionable to split up males and females for separate analyses. Any likely BLA-IL innervation effects were layer-specific and observed in males, yet control and ELS males did not differ in the elevated plus maze.</p><p>• The effects of ELS on BLA-PFC innervation/connectivity seem to have little or nothing to do with the effects of ELS on anxiety behavior. On one level this is not surprising, ELS must be affecting many brain regions and networks. However, these results seem to indicate that BLA to PFC projections are not critical pathways within this network.</p><p>• For females, the authors only report a main effect of ELS. ELS females spent less time in the open arms on all developmental days. Changes in BLA-PFC connectivity do not appear to drive this effect because they show a completely different developmental pattern. If anything, innervation effects are weakest on P38, yet anxiety behavior is most different on P38 (although this could change depending on how the authors address the outlying data point noted above).</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above, the behavioral data on P38 does indeed hold up even without the visual outlier, so the effect of maternal separation at that age is real. That said, we appreciate the complexity that derives from correlations between innervation and behavior at PD28 in females and PD48 in males. As the reviewers point out, the correlations in females are consistent with the age at which innervation is most different in maternally separated females, but not at the age when anxiety-like behavior is most strongly affected by rearing (PD38). We agree that these findings would be easier to interpret if both innervation and anxiety were affected by maternal separation at the same age and were correlated at that same age. However, our data in females appear to suggest that, 1) anxiety-like behavior that has been previously found to be regulated by BLA-PFC communication (now discussed at greater lengths in the Introduction) appears later than heightened innervation, which could be interpreted as a consequence of early innervation; and 2) prior to group-wide effects on anxiety-like behavior, increased BLA-IL innervation in maternally separated juveniles correlates with increased anxiety-like behavior in individual subjects. In males, effects on both innervation and anxiety were weaker than in females (which is consistent with data in humans), yet again, a correlation between anxiety-like behavior and BLA→IL innervation was seen at the same age when innervation was heightened in males. The revised manuscript includes a brief discussion more specifically highlighting these interpretations, which we believe adds to the transparency and strength of the revised manuscript.</p><p>We also appreciate the observations offered by the reviewer that effects of maternal separation on BLA→IL innervation was seen more clearly at the layer-specific level. We observed that females had hyper-innervation of IL2 at PD28, while males had hyper-innervation of IL2 at PD38. The revised manuscript now includes a brief discussion about the findings that in wild-type mice, projections from the BLA to IL neurons that reciprocally project back to the BLA preferably terminate in L5 over L2 (Cheriyan et al., 2016), while both L2 and L5 IL neurons do both project to the BLA (Little and Carter, 2013; Gabbott et al., 2005). This suggests that atypical hyper-innervation after maternal separation aberrantly targets layer 2, which could have implications for emotional regulation.</p><p>Similar to correlations with innervation in the IL, there were significant correlations in females between anxiety-like behavior and resting-state functional connectivity in the IL, where maternal separation had an effect on both BOLD correlations at PD48 and on the PD28-PD48 change in functional connectivity in females. Together, the BLA-IL circuit does appear to be significantly impacted by maternal separation and, given the reciprocal connections between IL2 and the BLA, it is likely that hyperinnervation to IL2 drives aberrant maturation of BLA-IL functional connectivity. This is described more clearly in the revised discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given these concerns, we have some specific suggestions for enhancing the report:</p><p>• The authors need to address whether the one positive behavioral mean difference reflects a single case.

While many studies using ELS report effects in both the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, very few have directly investigated their communication or connectivity following ELS in rodents, and there have been no work looking at how this might be impacted over development in males and females. The revised Introduction now more thoroughly highlights the animal literature that served as the scientific premise for the current study (now using the terminology early life adversity [ELA] instead of ELS, as per reviewer comments), as well as the fundamental significance of reverse translation, with use of the suggested citations. In the Discussion, we now also refer to the specific strength of this study as pairing fMRI with a more refined technique, which we believe highlights the impact of our work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
