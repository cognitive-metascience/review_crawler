In aquatic environments, many prey use chemical cues released by predators, which initiate predator avoidance. A prominent example of behavioral predator-avoidance constitutes diel vertical migration (DVM) in the freshwater microcrustacean <italic>Daphnia</italic> spp., which is induced by chemical cues (kairomones) released by planktivorous fish. In a bioassay-guided approach using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identified the kairomone from fish incubation water as 5α-cyprinol sulfate inducing DVM in <italic>Daphnia</italic> at picomolar concentrations. The role of 5α-cyprinol sulfate in lipid digestion in fish explains why from an evolutionary perspective fish has not stopped releasing 5α-cyprinol sulfate despite the disadvantages for the releaser. The identification of the DVM-inducing kairomone enables investigating its spatial and temporal distribution and the underlying molecular mechanism of its perception. Furthermore, it allows to test if fish-mediated inducible defenses in other aquatic invertebrates are triggered by the same compound.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kairomone</kwd><kwd>diel vertical migration</kwd><kwd>zooplankton</kwd><kwd><italic>Daphnia magna</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Rutilus rutilus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Daphnia</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A fish-derived bile salt was shown to act as interspecific infochemical, inducing the widespread predator avoidance behavior diel vertical migration at picomolar concentrations in freshwater zooplankton of the genus <italic>Daphnia</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Predation is recognized as an important selective force which has been shown to drive the shape of trophic cascades and numerous aspects of ecosystem ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gliwicz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lima, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Werner and Peacor, 2003</xref>). Such effects of predators are caused by predation (direct consumptive effect; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Preisser et al., 2005</xref>) or by effects on plastic behavioral, physiological or morphological traits of prey seeking to avoid predation (indirect, non-consumptive effect, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heithaus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lima, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moll et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Werner and Peacor, 2003</xref>). The concept has been introduced that prey species must effectively balance consuming their resources against becoming resources for their predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sih, 1980</xref>) in order to maximize their own fitness. It has become clear that non-consumptive predator effects strongly affect prey distribution, demography and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heithaus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lima, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Werner and Peacor, 2003</xref>) and the strength of top-down and bottom-up control in communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ford et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, non-consumptive predator effects are mediated by shifts in plastic traits of prey, and in aquatic food webs such non-consumptive effects exceed direct consumptive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Preisser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Turner et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Such adaptive shifts in prey traits require an accurate assessment of the predation risk, which may be accomplished by physical contact, vision or by chemical cues. Chemical cues are superior cues in turbid or dark environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kats and Dill, 1998</xref>) or in cases in which the escape capability upon attack is low in prey, for example due to low escape velocity. In line with this, the induction of defenses by chemical cues from predators is widespread in aquatic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjærke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brönmark and Hansson, 2012</xref>), and recently progress has been made by identification of chemical cues involved in aquatic predator-prey chemical communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poulin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Selander et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weiss et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>One classical example of behavioral predator avoidance is diel vertical migration (DVM) in the freshwater microcrustacean <italic>Daphnia,</italic> which play a key role in lakes and ponds, as they are major consumers of planktonic primary producers and important prey for higher trophic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miner et al., 2012</xref>). DVM is a widespread predator avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hays, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Williamson et al., 2011</xref>), in which the exposure to UV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rhode et al., 2001</xref>) and the risk of predation by visually oriented predators, such as fish, is reduced by daytime residence in the dark, deep layer of the water column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hays, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stich and Lampert, 1981</xref>). At night, zooplankton emerges from the depth into the upper water layer to minimize demographic costs associated with residence in the cold, food-depleted deep-water refuge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Loose and Dawidowicz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stich and Lampert, 1981</xref>). Hence, DVM of <italic>Daphnia</italic> negatively affects the foraging success of planktivorous fish. This behavioral anti-predator defense affects the control of planktonic primary producers by zooplankton in the open water and thus impacts many other ecosystem-wide processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haupt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reichwaldt and Stibor, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In lakes and ponds, DVM in zooplankton is triggered by changes in light intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Effertz and von Elert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ringelberg, 1999</xref>) and by chemical cues released by predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dodson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lampert, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neill, 1990</xref>). Such chemical cues are termed kairomones, if they mediate a transfer of information among species that imparts a benefit to the receiving organism while not being beneficial for the producer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pohnert et al., 2007</xref>). The finding that the amplitude of DVM increases with fish density indicates that kairomones provide a reliable indicator for the risk of <italic>Daphnia</italic> of being preyed upon by fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van Gool and Ringelberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">von Elert and Pohnert, 2000</xref>). Thus, fish - <italic>Daphnia</italic> interactions are to a large degree determined by indirect, non-consumptive effects of fish that are mediated by kairomones inducing predator avoidance by DVM.</p><p>Lakes and ponds are the best available freshwater source providing ecosystem services like domestic, industrial and recreational usage of water bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rudman et al., 2017</xref>). Global warming and ongoing nutrient input are predicted to deteriorate water quality and negatively affect ecosystem services of lakes and ponds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huisman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rudman et al., 2017</xref>), which increases the need for succesful lake management. One tool frequently used in lake management is food chain manipulation, which aims at manipulating the interaction of <italic>Daphnia</italic> and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeppesen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peretyatko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Søndergaard et al., 2017</xref>). However, at the molecular level this interaction is not fully understood unless the chemical nature of the fish kairomone is disclosed. Earlier we have shown that the release of the DVM-inducing kairomone does not depend on prior feeding of fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loose et al., 1993</xref>). The kairomone can be extracted from fish incubation water by lipophilic solid phase extraction, and we have characterized it as a low molecular weight compound carrying a hydroxyl group and a negative charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loose et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">von Elert and Pohnert, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">von Elert and Loose, 1996</xref>). However, the exact chemical identity of the fish kairomone remained unknown. Here, we use the microcrustean <italic>Daphnia</italic>, which has become a model organism for the induction of DVM in response to fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lampert, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miner et al., 2012</xref>), to identify the yet unknown kairomone.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In order to ensure identification of the major infochemical, we used a bioassay-guided approach.

We followed the activity in such an extract of fish incubation water (EFI) of roach (<italic>Rutilus rutilus</italic>, Cyprinidae) through separation by HPLC and by investigating fractions that cover the whole chromatogram.

As 20 µl of EFI are derived from 1 L of fish incubation water, this volume was dissolved per liter to obtain biologically active water in the bioassay. The actual concentration of α-CPS in biologically active water was 1.03 ± 0.08 nM (mean ± SD, n = 3) and that of TCDCA was 0.14 ± 0.01 nM (mean ± SD, n = 3). Hence the concentration of α-CPS was 7.5-fold higher than that of TCDCA. This concentration of α-CPS in biologically active water clearly exceeded the threshold concentration for biological activity of 100 pM, whereas TCDCA was present in concentrations that were more than five orders of magnitude below the activity threshold concentration of 20 µM. We therefore conclude that α-CPS is the only tested bile salt that is relevant for the induction of DVM in <italic>Daphnia</italic> in response to fish.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We identified an infochemical that <italic>Daphnia</italic> uses to perceive the risk of being preyed upon by planktivorous fish. We show that the induction of DVM in <italic>Daphnia</italic> is dependent on a particular bile compound from fish, that is 5α-cyprinol sulfate (α-CPS), which is active already at a concentration of 100 pM. The identification of α-CPS is the result of a bioassay-guided approach in which we have targeted the main activity throughout all purification steps. Hence, α-CPS constitutes the major activity in fish incubation water. Although another bile compound (TCDCA) was found in the active fraction obtained by HPLC, only α-CPS was present in sufficiently high concentrations to be biologically active. This is due to two factors: (i) <italic>Daphnia</italic> is five orders of magnitude more sensitive to α-CPS than to TCDCA and (ii) the concentration of α-CPS in extracted fish incubation water is approximately sevenfold higher than that of TCDCA. This substantially higher concentration of α-CPS is well in accordance with the findings that α-CPS constitutes the major bile salt in cyprinid bile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofmann et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Concerning the discussion of the estimated threshold concentration of α-CPS for DVM induction one methodological detail has to be considered. α-CPS present in EFI was quantified as equivalents of cholesteryl sulfate, since there has not been enough material of α-CPS to conduct an absolute gravimetric quantification. The quantification of α-CPS by means of a calibration curve of cholesteryl sulfate can however be considered quite accurate since both molecules propably result in comparable detector responses of the ESI-MS for the following reasons: i) both α-CPS and cholesteryl sulfate carry a sulfate group and, without prior ionization, are already negatively charged when reaching the ESI source. Different ionizabilities of both analytes can thus be excluded as source of inaccuracy. ii) The <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> ratios of α-CPS and cholesteryl sulfate are so close to each other (<italic>m</italic>/z = 465.3039 vs. <italic>m</italic>/z = 531.2992), that tuning of the mass spectrometer’s ion optics will not differently affect the detectability of either compound. iii) Just like the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> ratios, the molecular masses of the molecules are comparable as well, so that differences with respect to spray formation in the ESI source are probably of minor importance. In conclusion, it is reasonable to assume that quantification of α-CPS as equivalents of cholesteryl sulfate results in minor inaccuracies only.</p><p>α-CPS matches perfectly the previously published chemical characteristics for the DVM-inducing fish kairomone of roach (<italic>Rutilus rutilus</italic>) and other cyprinid fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loose et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">von Elert and Loose, 1996</xref>). Its molecular mass is close to 500 Dalton, it contains hydroxyl and no amino groups, has a strong negative charge and, as predicted, α-CPS is free of olefinic bonds. The anionic character and the hydroxyl groups make α-CPS a good infochemical in water, as they render the molecule water soluble so that it can well diffuse after release by the predator.</p><p>α-CPS, a sulfated bile alcohol, belongs to the bile salts, which are metabolites of cholesterol in vertebrates with the primary function to emulsify dietary fats and to facilitate their intestinal absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maldonado-Valderrama et al., 2011</xref>). Although bile salts are an essential component of the enterohepatic circulation, fish excrete bile salts via the intestine, the gills and the urinary tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchinger et al., 2014</xref>). Excreted fish bile salts are often highly water soluble due to conjugation with a sulfate (in case of bile alcohols), or with taurine (in case of bile acids). Furthermore, bile salts are generally stable as they must be resistant to digestion within an organism, which makes conjugated bile salts ideal infochemicals. Corroborating results for other bile salts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>), we here demonstrate the release of α-CPS by starved fish. Hence, the induction of DVM by fish does not require successful hunting of fish. The fact that bile salts are essential in fish metabolism explains why, from an evolutionary perspective, fish have not stopped to release bile salts despite its disadvantage for the emitter organism.</p><p>The DVM-inducing kairomone that we report here is to our knowledge the first identification of an aquatic kairomone that mediates predator-prey interactions between zooplankton and fish. The other few cases in zooplankton, for which chemical cues have been identified, are interactions of herbivorous zooplankton with its phytoplankton prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Selander et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uchida et al., 2008</xref>) and with an invertebrate predator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weiss et al., 2018</xref>): Copepods were shown to release copepodamides, a class of taurine containing polar lipids, which leads to an increased toxicity in their dinoflagellate prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Selander et al., 2015</xref>); <italic>Daphnia</italic> have been reported to release an alkylsulfate into the water that induces the formation of protective colonies in the green alga <italic>Acutodesmus obliquus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uchida et al., 2008</xref>), and larvae of <italic>Chaoborus</italic> sp. release fatty acids bound to a particular amino acid, which lead to changes in morphology in <italic>Daphnia pulex</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weiss et al., 2018</xref>). Among benthic animals a predatory crab has been shown to release two pyridin-metabolites that induce defensive behavior in a prey crab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poulin et al., 2018</xref>). The sterane core of α-CPS renders it partly lipophilic, and causes together with the sulfate group the overall amphipathic nature of α-CPS. Sulfate or sulfonium groups are present in several of the compounds known in chemical communication of zooplankton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Selander et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uchida et al., 2008</xref>) and as well in the sex pheromone of lamprey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>We accomplished the identification of α-CPS as the DVM-inducing kairomone using incubation water from <italic>Rutilus rutilus</italic> (Cyprinidae). The family of Cyprinidae is with more than 2000 species the largest family of fishes, and dominates freshwater habitats around the world with the exception of South America and Australia, and a considerable number of species is found in brackish water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hastings et al., 2015</xref>). In line with the high diversity of cyprinid fish, incubation water of many cyprinid species has been demonstrated to induce DVM in <italic>Daphnia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lass and Spaak, 2003</xref>), and we have shown that the chemical characteristics of the kairomone are identical among different cyprinid species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">von Elert and Loose, 1996</xref>) which matches the finding that α-CPS is the dominant bile salt in the Cypriniformes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hagey et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We further demonstrate that the induction of DVM by TCDCA, a representative for taurine-conjugated C<sub>24</sub> bile acids, required substantially higher concentrations (≥20 µM, which equals ≥10 mg dissolved organic carbon/L) than induction by α-CPS. The observation that free bile acids occur in fish feces suggests a low degree of bacterial deconjugation of conjugated bile acids by gut bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Philipp, 2011</xref>). However, such bacterial deconjugation of TCDCA would not release DVM-inducing activity, as the resulting free C<sub>24</sub> bile acid CDCA was even less active than TCDCA. Neither this finding nor the fact that α-CPS, a fish metabolite that has not been microbially modified, constitutes the major kairomone in fish incubation water support the earlier suggestion that bacteria are involved in the production of the kairomone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ringelberg and Van Gool, 1998</xref>).</p><p>As well non-cyprinid fish species like perch, stickleback (Perciformes) and pike (Esociformes) induce DVM in <italic>Daphnia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">von Elert and Pohnert, 2000</xref>), and the chemical characteristics of kairomones from pike and stickleback match those of cyprinids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">von Elert and Pohnert, 2000</xref>), which suggests that the kairomones of non-cyprinid and cyprinid species are similar and perhaps identical. However, a general pattern that emerges from a comprehensive analysis of bile salt patterns in fish indicates that α-CPS is confined to Cypriniformes and absent in the fish orders Perciformes, Esociformes and Salmoniformes. Yet, we here demonstrate the presence of α-CPS in bile of rainbow trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>), a representative of Salmoniformes. Still, this finding is in accordance with the general bile salt pattern in fish, as this pattern considers only bile salt types present at 5% or greater of the bile salt pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hagey et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the authors argue, that the production of bile alcohols such as α-cyprinol (a C<sub>27</sub> bile alcohol) and their conjugation to sulfate is regarded as an evolutionarily ancient bile salt profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hagey et al., 2010</xref>). All evolutionarily more recent bile salt patterns of fish seem to have evolved from the putatively ancestral pattern of C<sub>27</sub> bile alcohol production by subsequent enzymatic modifications of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hagey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofmann et al., 2010</xref>). In line with this bile of many ray-finned fish species still contains traces of the biosynthetic precursor C<sub>27</sub> bile alcohol though their bile is dominated by conjugated C<sub>24</sub> bile acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hagey et al., 2010</xref>). We deduce that even in fish orders with a more recent bile acid pattern, α-CPS may be present in traces (i.e. &lt;5%) as we have demonstrated for salmon, although this remains to be demonstrated for example for stickleback and Perciformes.</p><p>Our findings thus suggest that <italic>Daphnia</italic> evolution has selected for a high sensitivity to the evolutionarily oldest bile product of fish, that is α-CPS, and that this has proven to be an evolutionarily stable strategy as evolutionarily more recent fish bile patterns still contain traces of α-CPS. Thus, by sensing a single bile compound only, <italic>Daphnia</italic> are able to perceive the presence of fish across very different orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hagey et al., 2010</xref>). Future research will have to prove that 5α-CPS or other, hithertounidentified compounds, serve as the DVM-inducing kairomone as well in non-cyprinid fish orders.</p><p>The identification of α-CPS as the DVM-inducing kairomone in <italic>Daphnia</italic> allows for the assessment of its in situ concentration in space and time and thus to understand trait-variation in <italic>Daphnia</italic> and within-lake variations of DVM-amplitudes. The finding that a bile salt from fish serves as an infochemical might stimulate testing for a role of these compounds in the marine environment, where similar patterns of DVM of zooplankton are common. Still, although cessation of DVM in marine copepods in the absence of fish has been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bollens and Frost, 1991</xref>), its induction in the presence of fish could not be demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bollens and Frost, 1991</xref>). Similarly, a potential role of bile salts from fish in other anti-fish defenses in freshwater invertebrates remains to be tested, for example in changes in <italic>Daphnia</italic> life-history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stibor, 1992</xref>) or morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tollrian, 1994</xref>), in the reduced pigmentation of copepods in the presence of fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hansson, 2000</xref>) or in mediating effects of fish on the oviposition site of female <italic>Chaoborus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berendonk, 1999</xref>).

The mean daytime residential depth of the animals on the third or fourth day of incubation were taken as the measure of activity (for further details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loose et al., 1993</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data on daytime residential depth of <italic>Daphnia</italic> were analyzed for treatment effects by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD posthoc test, if data met the assumption of homoscedasticity (Levene's test). Differences between treatments were considered to be significant at p&lt;0.05. Data from independent experiments were pooled if daytime depth for control and for EFI did not differ. Statistical analyses were computed by using the software R version 3.3.3 (R Core Team 2017) and the packages agricolae version 1.2–8 (2017) and car (2011).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Kairomone extraction</title><p>The enrichment of fish incubation water was carried out for incubation water of <italic>Rutilus rutilus</italic>. Six pre-starved (24 hr) individuals (body size 10–20 cm) were incubated in 16 L of tap water at 18°C for 24 hr. The water was removed and filtered &lt;0.65 μm. The kairomone was enriched from the water by C<sub>18</sub> solid-phase extraction (SPE) (Mega Bond Elut, C<sub>18</sub>-bonded silica, mass: 75 g, Agilent Technologies) as according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">von Elert and Loose (1996)</xref>. Briefly, 4 liters of the incubation water were adjusted to 1% methanol and passed through the cartridge. After a washing step with 1% methanol, the cartridge was eluted with 200 mL of methanol, and this eluate was evaporated to dryness and re-dissolved in methanol to yield 80 µL of extracted fish incubation water (EFI). It has been shown earlier that controls for C<sub>18</sub>-SPE do not affect the daytime position of <italic>D. magna</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">von Elert and Loose, 1996</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Extraction of fish bile and purification of 5α-cyprinol sulfate</title><p>Gall bladder of <italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic> (rainbow trout) was homogenized in methanol with a pestle and then centrifuged. After quantification of the α-CPS content in the particle-free supernatant by LC-MS, aliquots were used in the bioassay that resulted in 0.4 and 4 nM α-CPS. These concentrations were close to the α-CPS concentration in active EFI (1 nM). Carp bile was extracted from the gall bladder, and bile salts were extracted with modifications as according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denton et al. (1974)</xref>. 0.5 mL of bile were extracted by adding 10 mL of a hot 95:5 (v/v) mixture of ethanol and methanol and subsequent vortexing. After cooling, the supernatant was separated by centrifugation and diluted with ultrapure water to an alcoholic concentration of 10% and then subjected to a C<sub>18</sub> solid-phase cartridge (Bond Elut, C<sub>18</sub>, Agilent Technologies). The activated solid phase was preconditioned with 10% methanol, and the processed bile sample (corresponding to 0.5 mL of bile) was passed through the cartridge. After washing (10% methanol), the cartridge was eluted with methanol. The eluate was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 1.5 mL methanol (extracted carp bile) corresponding to a 1:3 dilution of the raw bile. α-CPS was purified from this extract by HPLC fractionation as according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hahn et al. (2018)</xref>. While 20% of the solvent leaving the LC column was transferred to the ESI-MS, the remaining 80% were at the same time collected by a fraction collector. In this way a fraction which contained α-CPS only was obtained. To eliminate co-eluting taurine-conjugated bile acids, the extracted carp bile was digested by choloylglycine hydrolase prior to chromatography. The collected fraction containing purified α-CPS was subjected to solid-phase extraction to remove the mobile HPLC phase. The identity of the isolated α-CPS was confirmed by NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hahn et al., 2018</xref>), and its purity was demonstrated by liquid chromatography coupled to ESI-MS. LC-MS was performed as presented below in ‘Identification of bile salts’ using a reversed-phase (12.5 × 2 mm Nucleosil C18, 100–3, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fractionation of extracted fish incubation water</title><p>EFI was separated into six fractions by HPLC using the mobile phases water (A) and a mixture of acetonitrile (VWR, Radnor, Pennsylvania) and methanol (VWR, Radnor, Pennsylvania) (13:6, v/v) (B). Both solvents were made up to 0.015% (v/v) formic acid (Honeywell, Morristown, USA) and 10 mM ammonium acetate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The following solvent gradient was applied to a 250 mm x 4 mm column (Nucleosil 100–5 C<sub>18</sub>, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min with the column oven set to 30°C: 0 min: 35% B, 1.5 min: 35% B, 2.1 min: 40% B, 9 min: 45% B, 9.6 min: 55% B, 16.5 min: 65% B, 19.5 min: 100% B, 25.5 min: 100% B, 25.8 min: 35% B, 33 min: 35% B. 80% of the HPLC-derived eluate were collected by a fraction collector, while 20% were analyzed by MS. Chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry were conducted using an ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system (Thermo Fisher) with an Accela 1250 psi pump coupled with an ExactiveOrbitrap mass spectrometer (MS). Analytes were ionized by ESI in the negative mode. Ions within a mass range from <italic>m</italic>/z 120 to 1500, were detected at a frequency of one scan per second. The flow rate of the sheath and the aux gas nitrogen were set to 35 and 5 arbitrary units of the device. Spray voltage: 4.3 kV, capillary voltage −60 V, tube lens voltage −200 V, skimmer voltage −20 V, capillary temperature 325°C. The ExactiveOrbitrap mass spectrometer was calibrated once a day with the Pierce LTQ ESI negative calibration mixture. The instruments were controlled using the Xcalibur software (Thermo Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantification of bile salts</title><p>Bile salts were quantified by HPLC coupled to MS as described above (Fractionation of EFI). Taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) was quantified by the standard addition method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>), while the concentrations of α-CPS were derived from a calibration curve using the purchasable cholesteryl sulfate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>), whose molecular structure suggests a similar detectability by ESI-MS. The detected MS signals of all analytes were normalized to the detected signal of glycocholic acid, which was added to the samples as standards prior to the LC-MS analysis to account for variability of the mass spectrometer's sensitivity. All analytes were measured in the matrix of EFI in triplicates to compensate for its effects on MS measurements. The reference compounds sodium taurochenodeoxycholate (CAS:6009-98-9), sodium cholesteryl sulfate (CAS:2864-50-8), chenodeoxycholic acid (CAS: 474-25-9) and glycocholic acid hydrate (CAS:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/search?term=1192657-83-2&amp;interface=CAS%20No.&amp;N=0&amp;mode=partialmax&amp;lang=de&amp;region=DE&amp;focus=product">1192657-83-2</ext-link>) were of &gt;95% purity and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

For the identification of CPS, additional MS/MS analyses were performed. Chromatography was performed on an UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher). Analytes were separated on a reversed-phase column (BEH C<sub>8</sub>, 100mmx2.1mm, Acquity), with the column oven adjusted to 60°C. The mobile phase consisted of two solvents: (A) ultrapure water and (B) a mixture of acetonitrile and 2-propanol (both VWR, Radnor, Pennsylvania) (7/3, v/v). Both solvents contained ammonium acetate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) at a concentration of 10 mM added in form of a 1 M stock solution (1%, v/v) and acetic acid (VWR, Radnor, Pennsylvania) at a concentration of 1% (v/v). For chromatography, the following gradient was applied: 0 min: 40% B, 1 min: 40% B, 8 min: 75% B, 9 min: 100% B, 12.1 min: 40% B, 14 min: 40% B, 16 min: 40% B. Mass analysis was conducted on a Q Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher) equipped with an ESI source. Negative ionization was achieved by application of 2.5 kV. Sheath, auxiliary and sweep gas flow rates were adjusted to 50, 13 and 3 arbitrary units of the device. The capillary temperature was set to 263°C and the auxiliary gas heater temperature to 425°C. For the MS/MS measurements, negatively charged ions of the exact <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> of CPS (531.2997 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>) were selectively fragmented applying collision energy of 50 eV. The evaluation of the chromatograms was performed using the Xcalibur software (Thermo Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Database research</title><p>For the identification of the most likely candidates of the chemical identity of the kairomone, we used the software MassWorks (Cerno Bioscience) to extrapolate from the measured exact masses and isotope patterns in the active HPLC fraction of EFI to sum formulas of the unknown molecules.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A bile salt from fish induces diel vertical migration in zooplankton&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Georg Pohnert as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The concept of a compound that has to be released by fish due to their metabolic activity and that signals their presence to few millimeter sized <italic>Daphnia</italic> who make avoidance reactions is intriguing. The manuscript describes therefore a breakthrough in aquatic kairomone research and clearly demonstrates the activity of a fish bile salt to induce diel vertical migration in Daphnia. It answers a long-standing question and opens up new perspectives in kairomone research. The knowledge about the active principle will further open up new perspectives in environmental and ecological research.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agreed that the manuscript describes an important progress in the field and a solid piece of chemical ecology. However, several concerns about the presentation of the work were raised.</p><p>As can be seen in the detailed comments below all reviewers recommend a substantial focus of the discussion on core-results of the paper. Further, two reviewers recommend that the quantification of the kairomone should be better documented.</p><p>The title could be more precise; the compound that was elucidated could be mentioned – especially since a specific activity was observed.</p><p>The manuscript is already in itself convincing, but the discussion about anthropogenic infodisruption (Abstract and Discussion) seems to be farfetched. The specificity of the response and the discussion about amounts of potential info disruptors required to triggers a response makes it a quite speculative discussion. The core result is very strong; there is no need to extend it into speculation. I would suggest deleting the part of the Discussion paragraphs five and seven. Also, reviewer 2 states clearly &quot;The infodisruption part is a bit overstated. If TCDCA from anthropogenic sources is really released with sewage in such high concentrations, it might induce DVM in the vicinity of the inflow. However usually it will be diluted and probably most lakes where sewage is flowing in contain fish anyhow. Thus, the proposed ‘far-reaching implications for ecosystem functioning and conservation management’ are not obvious.&quot;</p><p>Further in many places the authors discuss DVM in general, leading to the impression that 5α-CPS is, or might be, responsible for DVM worldwide. This is most probably not true. There is no indication that DVM in marine environments is chemically induced at all. Bollens and Frost tested chemical cues from fish in enclosures and did not find an induction of DVM. While it is widely accepted that DVM is an anti-predator strategy, behavioral plasticity has not been shown in the marine environment. Furthermore, there are no cyprinids in most marine environments. To emphasize my point, this does not mean that DVM in the marine environment is not induced by 5α-CPS – it simply needs to be shown.</p><p>The authors suggest that 5α-CPS is the only relevant fish kairomone and their results indeed indicate that also rainbow trout produce this kairomone. However, Hagey et al., 2010, presented a number of orders which do not produce 5α-CPS, including Perciformes and Esociformes, but also Salmoniformes. Perciformes and Esociformes have been used to induce depth selection behavior, e.g., Ringelberg and van Gool, 1998, and the authors induced with <italic>Esox lucius</italic> in an earlier study. Thus, there seems to be some deviating results which require some discussion. It might simply indicate that some clarification is necessary, or it might call for future studies. The authors discuss effects on the marine carbon pump and suggest that 5α-CPS is the responsible cue. This is overstating.</p><p>Quantification is certainly the weakest point of the study: First normalization to cholesteryl sulfate and CPS would require a response factor of both analytes or better a calibration curve. The sentence “As 20 µL […]” suggests that the concentration of DPS was determined by bioassays not be analytical methods? Given the experimental I thought quantification with normalization to cholesterol sulfate was done. Also, reviewer 2 states: “It is necessary to present the concentrations clearer. E.g., the size of the fish should be mention as the release of the kairomone might be correlated to fish size. How large where the fish for gall bladder extraction? How much bile has been extracted in Rainbow trout?”</p><p>The reviewers also discussed the validity of the term bioassay guided fractionation: The approach used is known as &quot;bioassay-guided fractionation&quot;, by which compounds purified from fish exudates were tested for escape-inducing behavior, resulting in the eventual identification of a single molecule responsible for the observed effect on prey. The manuscript is largely focused on the process of identifying this molecule via a combination of chemical and behavioral experiments. The molecule, 5α-cyprinol sulfate, is a known product of the digestive systems of fish – a logical candidate for a cue that prey might use to sense their predators and respond defensively. Given the fact that the authors just published a paper on this compound and its NMR data makes us wonder if we are not rather dealing with a targeted study confirming the activity of a logical candidate. This would twist the whole presentation but maybe leave a better feeling after reading. The current manuscript represents one such study. The fact that the molecule the authors identified was previously known (albeit present and active at low nanomolar concentrations), makes the chemistry of the study a little less exciting, but the biological implications are still important.</p><p>Reviewer 3 is quite critical in this point: The paper is solid and clear, but it lacks the kind of general appeal that expected for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In particular, the Introduction is quite basic, written in a way that is unlikely to draw in strangers to chemical ecology. The Discussion is similarly restricted to similar systems (fish and plankton). The description of the impacts of predation, chemical cues, and predator escape strategies would need broadening and enriching to be appropriate for this kind of general journal. The chemistry-oriented results are not particularly accessible to a general biology readership. As currently presented, the work is more appropriate for a more specialized journal like J. Chem. Ecol. or one committed to publishing works about freshwater ecology such as Limnology and Oceanography. The section of the Discussion related to movement of zooplankton (and thus effects on their own prey, phytoplankton) and resulting impacts on nutrient cycling would be of particular interest to a limnological and oceanographic audience. After a discussion among the reviewers the study was considered to be important and appealing to warrant further consideration of a revised version of the manuscript but the concerns of reviewer 3 should be kept in mind during revision and re-drafting of the Introduction and Discussion.</p><p>Introduction section / Discussion paragraph two: The statement “virtually nothing is known about the chemical nature […]&quot; might have been true 10 years ago, however there is substantial progress in the field and while only few compounds have been fully investigated (these should be cited) several studies address the compound classes, functional modes of action etc. involved. This part of the Introduction should be expanded. This is a common notion among the reviewers &quot;The authors suggest that virtually no aquatic kairomone has been identified, ignoring the recent publication of the <italic>Chaoborus</italic> kairomone – another relevant kairomone for <italic>Daphnia</italic> with some similarities (Weiss et al., 2018).&quot;</p><p>Results second paragraph: The calculation is incorrect. The value 532.29993 would suggest that H has a mass of 1. It is however 1.007 will lead to a calculated mass of 532.30693.</p><p>Results second paragraph: Why is a data base search required to determine the sum formula from a high res mass? The software of the instrument can simply calculate this.</p><p>In the same paragraph: The step from the high res mass to the structure is not clear. Is the entire process only based on this one MS?</p><p>Figure 3: Are there explanations for the peaks at 2.04 and 2.38?</p><p>Figure 4: The structures are the major result of the paper – they could be plotted bigger. The stereocenter on the C/D ring carbon of CPS should be indicated. Is there any information about the stereochemistry in the side chain?</p><p>Results paragraph five: The negative ionization ESI MS in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 can by no means be seen as a proof of purity. In fact, negative ionization only picks up a fraction of compounds in a mixture and in addition, the MS is not clearly indicating a pure compound. Show at least chromatograms in positive and negative ionization mode if no NMR data are available.</p><p>Discussion paragraph six and onwards: The Discussion loses focus. Results from freshwater systems (this paper) are mixed with marine/oceanographic facts and become very speculative. The paper should focus more. Constructing e.g. a story about ocean acidification from the results is not justified.</p><p>Also: Salmon louse responses to CPS have to be proven, deduction from an uncharacterized receptor sequence to a DVM response are not warranted. Basically, a speculation is built on a speculation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic> </p><p>Some studies are ignored that proved that UV-radiation is also inducing DVM in Daphnia, showing that it is additionally a strategy leading to avoidance of harmful irradiation (see. Rhode et al., 2001 or Leech and Williamson (2001, L and O).</p><p>Ringelberg and van Gool, 1998, suggest that bacteria are responsible at a certain step of the kairomone production as addition of an antibiotic prevented depth selection behavior. This might be addressed in the Discussion.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>I suggest changing the title to indicate that currently 5α-CPS has been shown to induce DVM in <italic>Daphnia magna</italic> and most likely in all daphnids. There is no indication that other genera respond to this kairomone.</p><p>&quot;A bile salt from fish induces diel vertical migration in <italic>Daphnia</italic>&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44791.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agreed that the manuscript describes an important progress in the field and a solid piece of chemical ecology.

We are no more referring to DVM on a global scale, but confine the introduction to DVM in Daphnia. In the Introduction we are now stating: “One classical example of behavioural predator avoidance is diel vertical migration (DVM) in the freshwater microcrustacean Daphnia, which play a key role in lakes and ponds, as they are major consumers of planktonic primary producers and important prey for higher trophic levels. DVM is a widespread predator avoidance behavior […]”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors suggest that 5α-CPS is the only relevant fish kairomone and their results indeed indicate that also rainbow trout produce this kairomone.

In short, we argue (i) that the general phylogenetic pattern did not consider bile acids with &lt;5% abundance, (ii) that we have shown that salmon has traces of a-CPS though it should not have according to the general phylogenetic pattern, which (iii) renders it possible that a-CPS serves as DVM-inducing kairomone as well in non-cyprinid fish oders, which (iv) remains to be confirmed by future research (Discussion paragraph eight).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Quantification is certainly the weakest point of the study: First normalization to cholesteryl sulfate and CPS would require a response factor of both analytes or better a calibration curve. The sentence “As 20 µL […]” suggests that the concentration of DPS was determined by bioassays not be analytical methods? Given the experimental I thought quantification with normalization to cholesterol sulfate was done.</p></disp-quote><p>α-CPS was enriched from fish incubation water by solid-phase extraction. The extract (EFI) corresponded (concerning the volume) to 50,000 times concentrated fish incubation water (density: 3 fish in 8 L water). Thus dissolving 20µL of this 50,000 times concentrated fish incubation water extract in 1 L corresponded to 1 L of the original non-processed incubation water (ignoring losses during extraction) (subsection “Statistics”). The concentration of α-CPS in the extract (EFI) and (thereby also in the artificially produced fish incubation water: EFI + aged and filtered tap water) have not been determined by bioassay. Instead, α-CPS in EFI was determined analytically by LC-MS using a calibration curve for cholesteryl sulfate in the background/matrix of EFI to exclude effects of ion suppression that might be caused by the complex matrix of EFI. We now point out that we only quantified α-CPS as equivalents of cholesteryl sulfate:</p><p>“[…] the concentrations of α-CPS were derived from a calibration curve using the purchasable cholesteryl sulfate (Figure 4—figure supplement 6), whose molecular structure suggests a similar detectability by ESI-MS.”</p><p>We further discuss the accuracy of this approach:</p><p>“Concerning the discussion of the estimated threshold concentration of α-CPS for DVM induction one methodological detail has to be considered. α-CPS present in EFI was quantified as equivalents of cholesteryl sulfate, since there has not been enough material of α-CPS to conduct an absolute gravimetric quantification. The quantification of α-CPS by means of a calibration curve of cholesteryl sulfate can however be considered quite accurate since both molecules probably result in comparable detector responses of the ESI-MS for the following reasons: i) both α-CPS and cholesteryl sulfate carry a sulfate group and, without prior ionisation, are already negatively charged when reaching the ESI source. Different ionizabilities of both analytes can thus be excluded as source of inaccuracy. ii) The m/z ratios of α-CPS and cholesteryl sulfate are so close to each other (m/z=465.3039 vs. m/z=531.2992), that tuning of the mass spectrometer’s ion optics will not differently affect the detectability of either compound. iii) Just like the m/z ratios, the molecular masses of the molecules are comparable as well, so that differences with respect to spray formation in the ESI source are probably of minor importance. In conclusion it is reasonable to assume that quantification of α-CPS as equivalents of cholesteryl sulfate results in minor inaccuracies only.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, reviewer 2 states: It is necessary to present the concentrations clearer. E.g., the size of the fish should be mention as the release of the kairomone might be correlated to fish size. How large where the fish for gall bladder extraction? How much bile has been extracted in Rainbow trout?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the point that size of fish might be related to release of the kairomone and have now included this information in Material and Methods “body size 10– 20 cm”. We do have information about the size of the fish used for gall bladder extraction (2 mL of bile from a trout of 1 kg weight). Please note, that not all bile extracted from a single fish but instead only aliquots of this were used. We therefore felt that neither information on body mass nor on extracted bile volume would make sense and have therefore not included this information. However, if the reviewers require it, we are of course willing to include the above give information on weight and total bile extracted from an individual fish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers also discussed the validity of the term bioassay guided fractionation: The approach used is known as &quot;bioassay-guided fractionation&quot;, by which compounds purified from fish exudates were tested for escape-inducing behavior, resulting in the eventual identification of a single molecule responsible for the observed effect on prey. The manuscript is largely focused on the process of identifying this molecule via a combination of chemical and behavioral experiments. The molecule, 5α -cyprinol sulfate, is a known product of the digestive systems of fish – a logical candidate for a cue that prey might use to sense their predators and respond defensively.

Below we give a detailed chronology of our approach hoping to convince the reviewers that we have performed a full bioassay-guided approach; it has by no means been a targeted-approach!

Since 5α-CPS is not commercially available, we asked Dr. Hagey who kindly provided reference material, which actually was material that he had obtained from his predecessor, Dr. Haslewood, and which was without any information concerning its purity or even its structural elucidation. We received too little material for NMR of this putative reference compound. Although this material from Dr. Hagey showed identical HR-mass and retention time with our compound (see Figure 3B,C in the manuscript) we still wanted to be sure about its chemical identity. Therefore, we isolated new material form carp bile and confirmed its structure by NMR. At that time, we decided to publish this structural elucidation as a separate paper, since it was a confirmation of an already known structure. Then, when being sure, that m/z=531.2941 represents 5α-CPS, we screened for further bile salts in fractions “Pre”, “8” and “9” and discovered that additional bile salts were present.</p><p>From there on we optimized our chromatography for the analysis of bile compounds, then using a different solvent system. This new mobile phase allowed for much more focused biological activity and much better resolution of bile compounds than with water-MeOH as mobile phases. It is these results that we now present in the manuscript. We would like to emphasize that at all stages of the research (as well in the part depicted in the paper) all fractions were always subjected to bioassays and the major activity was always considered/investigated further. We strongly regard this as a bioassay-guided approach, and, in line with this, we claim to have identified the major DVM-inducing compound. At no stage this approach has been a targeted approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3 is quite critical in this point: The paper is solid and clear, but it lacks the kind of general appeal that expected for publication in eLife. In particular, the Introduction is quite basic, written in a way that is unlikely to draw in strangers to chemical ecology. The Discussion is similarly restricted to similar systems (fish and plankton). The description of the impacts of predation, chemical cues, and predator escape strategies would need broadening and enriching to be appropriate for this kind of general journal. The chemistry-oriented results are not particularly accessible to a general biology readership. As currently presented, the work is more appropriate for a more specialized journal like J. Chem. Ecol. or one committed to publishing works about freshwater ecology such as Limnology and Oceanography. The section of the Discussion related to movement of zooplankton (and thus effects on their own prey, phytoplankton) and resulting impacts on nutrient cycling would be of particular interest to a limnological and oceanographic audience. After a discussion among the reviewers the study was considered to be important and appealing to warrant further consideration of a revised version of the manuscript but the concerns of reviewer 3 should be kept in mind during revision and re-drafting of the Introduction and Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this remark and have thoroughly incorporated the issues raised. However, we admit, that it is not entirely clear what is meant by ‘lacks the kind of general appeal that is expected for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>’. Lakes and ponds are the best available freshwater source on the Earth's surface. Lakes are valued as water sources and for fishing, water transport, recreation, and tourism and, due to their outstanding importance, issues of management of lakes and ponds are of pivotal importance. One tool for lake management is food chain manipulation, which aims at manipulating the interaction of <italic>Daphnia</italic> and fish. Our paper provides a fundamentally new understanding of the interaction of <italic>Daphnia</italic> and fish, which is key to the functioning and ecosystem services of lakes and ponds, and we therefore would like to emphasize that we regard our findings as highly appealing for more general journals as <italic>eLife</italic>. In response to concerns raised we have provided two new first paragraphs in the Introduction, in which we introduce the general importance of predation, the distinction of direct and indirect effects of predators and the importance of chemical signalling in predator-prey interactions. We hope that this will more appropriate to draw in general biologists into an issue of chemical communication. We have further condensed statements about the chemistry of known kairomones in aquatic chemical communication from formerly three different paragraphs to a single paragraph starting with “The DVM-inducing kairomone that we report here is to […]”. We have further removed all aspects of nutrient recycling from the Discussion in order to be more focused on the main contribution of this manuscript. And we have now included an introductory definition for kairomone: “Such chemical cues are termed kairomones, if they mediate a transfer of information among species that impart a benefit to the receiving organism while not being beneficial for the producer”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction section / Discussion paragraph two: The statement “virtually nothing is known about the chemical nature […]&quot; might have been true 10 years ago, however there is substantial progress in the field and while only few compounds have been fully investigated (these should be cited) several studies address the compound classes, functional modes of action etc. involved. This part of the Introduction should be expanded. This is a common notion among the reviewers &quot;The authors suggest that virtually no aquatic kairomone has been identified, ignoring the recent publication of the Chaoborus kairomone – another relevant kairomone for Daphnia with some similarities (Weiss et al., 2018).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge this point. First, we would like to add that Weiss et al., 2018 had already been mentioned in the letter to the editor, but unfortunately not been included in the manuscript. We apologize for this. In response to this issue we have now included the few chemically identified kairomones in aquatic plankton and briefly discuss their chemical features. We are now stating in the Introduction “[…] recently progress has been made by identification of infochemicals involved in predator-prey chemical communication (Selander et al., 2015 Weiss et al., 2018, Poulin et al., 2018)”</p><p>In the Discussion we are now referring to the few identified compounds in more detail (the papers of Selander et al., 2015, Weiss et al., 2018, Poulin et al., 2018 and Uchida et al., 2008) and discuss chemical similarities starting with “The other few cases in zooplankton, for which chemical cues have been identified […]”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results second paragraph: The calculation is incorrect.

The predicted sum formula for [M-H]- was C27H48O8S.
