Here, we elucidate the mechanism by which basal (p)ppGpp inhibits the purine salvage enzyme HPRT by sharing a conserved motif with its substrate PRPP. Intriguingly, HPRT regulation by (p)ppGpp varies across organisms and correlates with HPRT oligomeric forms. (p)ppGpp-sensitive HPRT exists as a PRPP-bound dimer or an apo- and (p)ppGpp-bound tetramer, where a dimer-dimer interface triggers allosteric structural rearrangements to enhance (p)ppGpp inhibition. Loss of this oligomeric interface results in weakened (p)ppGpp regulation. Our results reveal an evolutionary principle whereby protein oligomerization allows evolutionary change to accumulate away from a conserved binding pocket to allosterically alter specificity of ligand interaction. This principle also explains how another (p)ppGpp target GMK is variably regulated across species. Since most ligands bind near protein interfaces, we propose that this principle extends to many other protein–ligand interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>(p)ppGpp</kwd><kwd>allosteric regulation</kwd><kwd>enzyme oligomerization</kwd><kwd>signaling ligand</kwd><kwd>protein evolution</kwd><kwd>bacterial homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM127088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jue D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Faculty Scholar</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jue D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRFP DGE-1256259</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Brent W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM084003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jue D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The signaling ligand (p)ppGpp regulates the enzyme HPRT across species by binding to a novel class of conserved motif, yet its specificity is allosterically altered through evolution of enzyme oligomerization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulation by signaling ligands is a universal mechanism for adaptation and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chubukov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Traut, 2008</xref>).

A key signaling ligand in bacteria is the nucleotide (p)ppGpp. (p)ppGpp directly binds and regulates diverse protein targets at positions ranging from protein active sites to protein–protein interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corrigan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gourse et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sherlock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). However, how these diverse themes evolve across bacterial species have not been systematically elucidated. In addition, while most of the (p)ppGpp regulation is studied for high (p)ppGpp concentrations upon stress and starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cashel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gourse et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2015a</xref>), (p)ppGpp at basal levels also has important protective roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaca et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gaca et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kriel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Potrykus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Puszynska and O'Shea, 2017</xref>). However, molecular targets and mechanisms of basal (p)ppGpp regulation have not been delineated.</p><p>Here, we examined the specificity of (p)ppGpp binding by characterizing (p)ppGpp regulation of the enzyme hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), one of the earliest identified targets of (p)ppGpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hochstadt-Ozer and Cashel, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kriel et al., 2012</xref>). Using biochemical, structural and evolutionary analyses of HPRT homologs across diverse bacterial phyla, we identify a conserved (p)ppGpp binding motif and identified a HPRT dimer–dimer interaction that allosterically positions a flexible loop to promote strong (p)ppGpp binding. The bacterial HPRT homologs lacking this dimer–dimer interaction are largely refractory to (p)ppGpp regulation. We propose that changes in protein oligomerization enable evolution of regulation by (p)ppGpp, despite evolutionary constraint imposed on the direct (p)ppGpp-binding site. We examined this principle using another (p)ppGpp target GMK and discuss its broad implications in evolutionary diversification of signaling ligand specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Regulation of HPRT activity by basal levels of (p)ppGpp is important for GTP homeostasis</title><p>HPRT is a purine salvage enzyme that converts purine bases and PRPP to GMP and IMP, which are precursors of the essential nucleotide GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, upper panel).

with well-established quantitative methods such as isothermal titration calorimetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using this method, we found that most HPRTs bind pppGpp with K<sub>d</sub> values ranging from ≈0.1 to ≈10 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Closer inspection revealed an additional quantitative difference in regulatory potency among these HPRTs. HPRTs from human microbiota commensals, including all species from Bacteroidetes along with the Firmicutes <italic>Eubacterium</italic> spp. and <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> spp., manifested the tightest interactions with pppGpp (K<sub>d</sub> ≈ 0.1–1 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This suggests a relationship between the intestinal environment and regulation of this purine salvage enzyme by (p)ppGpp, which may serve to buffer the intracellular environment against fluctuating extracellular purine concentrations. Beyond microbiota, HPRTs from soil-dwelling bacteria (e.g. <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>, <italic>B. subtilis</italic>) and pathogens (e.g. <italic>Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli</italic>), occupying the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, were also inhibited by (p)ppGpp with K<sub>d</sub> values below 10 μM.</p><p>Interestingly, a few HPRTs were only weakly inhibited by 25 μM (p)ppGpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). These weakly regulated HPRTs all clustered in β- and γ-Proteobacteria (e.g. <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>), with the exception of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To test whether the HPRTs weakly inhibited at basal levels of (p)ppGpp (25 μM) can be inhibited by higher levels of (p)ppGpp, we examined select HPRT homologs at a range of pppGpp concentrations and at physiological substrate concentrations (1 mM PRPP and 50 μM guanine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Most bacterial HPRTs (e.g. <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>) were sensitive to basal pppGpp. However, several bacterial HPRTs that were weakly inhibited by 25 μM pppGpp (e.g. <italic>C. burnetii</italic>, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>) are also almost refractory to high concentration of pppGpp. In fact, they are less inhibited by pppGpp than eukaryotic HPRTs from human and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, for which (p)ppGpp is not a physiological regulatory ligand. Therefore, we can broadly classify bacterial HPRTs by their sensitivity to (p)ppGpp: those that are sensitive to basal (p)ppGpp and a few that are resistant to basal (p)ppGpp, although may still be mildly sensitive to induced (p)ppGpp.</p><p>In addition to differences between HPRT homologs, we also noticed a strong, species-dependent difference between pppGpp and ppGpp inhibition. All HPRTs in Bacteroidetes were potently inhibited by pppGpp but only weakly by ppGpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). In contrast, nearly all other HPRTs displayed stronger inhibition by ppGpp than pppGpp. It is noted that <italic>Bacteroides spp</italic>., whose HPRTs are more sensitive to pppGpp than ppGpp, contain a GppA homolog, and they make mostly ppGpp in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glass et al., 1979</xref>). On the other hand, Firmicutes, whose HPRTs are more sensitive to ppGpp than pppGpp, lack GppA homologs and produce predominantly pppGpp. Therefore, although pppGpp and ppGpp are often regarded as similar, they can have marked differences for certain cellular targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>(p)ppGpp binds the conserved active site of HPRT and closely mimics substrate binding</title><p>To examine the molecular determinants underlying (p)ppGpp regulation of HPRT, we turned to Hpt-1 from the pathogenic bacterium <italic>B. anthracis</italic>, which pppGpp competitively inhibits similarly to <italic>B. subtilis</italic> HPRT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These crystals formed in drops containing pppGpp, but there was insufficient density to completely model the 5′ γ-phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). With LC-MS/MS, we verified that the pppGpp was not contaminated with ppGpp. Although it is possible that the γ-phosphate was hydrolyzed during crystallization, the presence of waters and unassigned density around the 5′ phosphates allow for the possibility that the γ-phosphate is present but dynamic.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47534.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>(p)ppGpp binds the HPRT active site and shares an almost identical binding pocket with substrates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>B. anthracis</italic> Hpt-1 crystallized with ppGpp. Five loops (I, II, III, III′, IV) form the HPRT active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinha and Smith, 2001</xref>). ppGpp and Mg<sup>2+</sup> shown with omit electron density contoured at 2σ. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> shows that pppGpp competitively inhibits Hpt-1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> shows omit electron density for the two ppGpp molecules crystallized in the asymmetric unit.

The purine ring of ppGpp overlaps with the purine base substrate, and the two phosphate arms of ppGpp and PRPP both spread across the active site between loop I and loop III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Generally speaking, in ppGpp–protein interactions, the phosphates of ppGpp are either elongated or compacted in a ring-like conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Steinchen and Bange, 2016</xref>). With the phosphates of ppGpp spread across the binding pocket, the HPRT-ppGpp interaction represents an elongated conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>The (p)ppGpp-binding site in HPRT manifests a novel (p)ppGpp–protein interaction. The 5′ phosphates and ribose of ppGpp interact with loop III (EDIIDSGLT), a well-characterized PRPP binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinha and Smith, 2001</xref>), through side chain interactions with Glu99 and Asp100 and backbone amide interactions with Asp103 – Thr107 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>). The 3′ phosphates of ppGpp are coordinated by backbone amides of loop I, the side chain of Arg165, and the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>). The guanine ring of ppGpp is surrounded by a hydrophobic cleft formed by Ile101, Phe152, and Leu158, and Lys131 hydrogen bonds the guanine’s exocyclic oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>). We validated the (p)ppGpp-binding residues by mutation analyses which showed that altering residues with side chain interactions with (p)ppGpp greatly weakened pppGpp binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In sum, this binding pocket illustrates the first example of a (p)ppGpp binding motif that shares the PRPP-binding motif. Since many proteins bind PRPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hove-Jensen et al., 2017</xref>), this (p)ppGpp motif may represent a new class of (p)ppGpp targets.</p><p>A frequency logo of the binding pocket from 99 bacterial HPRTs shows that most (p)ppGpp-interacting residues are highly conserved across bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8</xref>), and nearly all binding residues are also conserved in the eukaryotic HPRTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8</xref>). The strong conservation across species is not surprising given the close overlap between (p)ppGpp and substrates in the HPRT structures. Since all residues involved in binding ppGpp are also involved in binding substrates, altering the site to affect inhibitor binding would also impact enzyme activity.</p><p>The nearly identical recognition of (p)ppGpp and substrates, along with the conservation of the active site, raised the following question: how can some HPRTs be strongly inhibited by basal levels of (p)ppGpp and other HPRTs be almost refractory to (p)ppGpp control despite sharing a conserved binding pocket?</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>(p)ppGpp prevents PRPP-induced dissociation of HPRT dimer-of-dimers</title><p>We noticed a significant difference between the ppGpp- and substrates-bound tertiary structures in the conformation of a flexible loop. This loop, also called loop II, is common to all HPRTs and covers the active site during catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shi et al., 1999</xref>). In the HPRT-ppGpp complex, one side of loop II faces the active site while the other side is a critical part of the interface between two HPRT dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We applied PISA analysis (‘Protein interfaces, surfaces, and assemblies’ service at European Bioinformatics Institute) to predict that this dimer-dimer interaction results in a tetrameric HPRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</xref>). In the substrates-bound state, loop II is instead shifted ≈4 Å toward the active site from its position in the dimer-dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Loop II also pulls its flanking dimer interface components β3 and α3 toward the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). While crystal contacts likely prevent loop II from completely moving over the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), PISA analysis predicts that these changes abolish the dimer-dimer interaction.

Ancestral protein reconstruction suggests that the last common ancestor (Anc1) is more similar to the (p)ppGpp-sensitive GMKs (Anc3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Altogether, this suggests that the protein-protein interface of GMK has also evolved to affect (p)ppGpp binding.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>(p)ppGpp is a stress-induced signaling molecule in bacteria that is also critical for cellular fitness and homeostasis even at basal levels. However, (p)ppGpp targets and their evolution in different bacteria remain poorly understood. Here, we have described a mechanism explaining how basal levels of (p)ppGpp potently regulate the activity of the housekeeping enzyme HPRT through a novel binding site that may represent a new class of (p)ppGpp effectors. Intriguingly, this site overlaps completely with the active site and is conserved among bacteria, yet differential regulation by (p)ppGpp can be achieved through variation of an allosteric component: the interaction between dimeric subunits of the HPRT tetramer. This interaction tethers a flexible loop at the interface and away from the active site, allowing the binding pocket to accomodate (p)ppGpp. Lack of the dimer–dimer interaction causes HPRT to occlude (p)ppGpp and favor substrate binding. This dimer–dimer interaction is due to an interface motif that appears to have co-evolved with (p)ppGpp binding in the majority of bacterial HPRTs sensitive to (p)ppGpp, whereas dimeric HPRTs without the motif are resistant to (p)ppGpp. We conclude that evolution of the dimer-dimer interface in tetrameric HPRTs has potentiated (p)ppGpp binding to enable basal (p)ppGpp modulation of metabolism, thus increasing bacterial fitness in fluctuating environments.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A novel, high-affinity (p)ppGpp binding motif that shares the PRPP motif</title><p>Our HPRT-ppGpp structure revealed a binding motif distinct from known (p)ppGpp-protein interactions.

For many other targets, (p)ppGpp binds at a GTP binding site, leading to overlapping (p)ppGpp and GTP binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kihira et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pausch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rymer et al., 2012</xref>). In the case of HPRT, however, the (p)ppGpp binding site is not at an interface between two proteins, nor is it a GTP binding site. Instead, it shares a well-characterized motif associated with PRPP binding (EDIIDSGLT in <italic>B. anthracis</italic> Hpt-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinha and Smith, 2001</xref>). Other PRPP-binding proteins, including UPRT and APRT, have been shown to bind (p)ppGpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), and it is likely that (p)ppGpp also binds to their PRPP motif. Identification of this motif may provide a new class of (p)ppGpp-binding proteins, allowing us to predict additional targets.</p><p>(p)ppGpp interacts with proteins in two main conformations: elongated, with the phosphate arms extended away from one another in a T shape, and ring-like, with the phosphate arms near one another in a Y shape. The compact, ring-like conformation has been associated with higher affinity interactions than the elongated conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Steinchen and Bange, 2016</xref>). However, in the HPRT–ppGpp interaction, ppGpp takes an elongated conformation, but exhibits strikingly tight affinities as high as K<sub>d</sub> ≈ 0.1 μM for some species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This high affinity may be due to extensive backbone amide interactions with both phosphate arms as well as (p)ppGpp’s close mimicry of substrate binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). It is likely that higher affinity interactions with the elongated (p)ppGpp conformation will become more common as additional targets are characterized.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>HPRT tetramerization enables basal (p)ppGpp inhibition</title><p>Our data show that the dimer–dimer interface of HPRT potentiates (p)ppGpp regulation by allosterically promoting a conformation conducive to ligand binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). HPRT’s tetramerization harnesses the flexible loop II to open the binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) for (p)ppGpp to bind with high affinity. Loop II’s influence on (p)ppGpp binding may be the reason that it has evolved to be part of the interface of bacterial HPRTs, whereas in eukaryotic (e.g. human) HPRTs, which likely do not interact with (p)ppGpp in nature, loop II is on the outside of the oligomer facing solvent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eng et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our model can also explain the evolutionary significance of bacterial HPRTs functioning as dimers without dissociating to monomers. Strength of protein–protein interactions has been correlated with increased buried surface area at the interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nooren and Thornton, 2003</xref>). In a hypothetical monomer–monomer interaction, the smaller loop II interface may be too weak and too transient to keep loop II away from the active site. In the interaction between two homodimers, the loop II interface is duplicated, which increases the surface area and provides anchor points to hold loop II at the interface and away from the (p)ppGpp binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>HPRT tetramerization also affects a key component of basal (p)ppGpp’s ability to regulate HPRT: its competition with PRPP. Most bacterial HPRTs have a K<sub>m</sub> for PRPP in the range of 50–200 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guddat et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). Tetrameric HPRTs that bind (p)ppGpp with high affinity also tend to have higher K<sub>m</sub> values for PRPP, suggesting that they are optimized for (p)ppGpp binding rather than PRPP binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). By forcing HPRT into a dimeric state independent of ligands, either through natural evolution in the case of the HPRT homologs or through mutating the dimer–dimer interface sequence, HPRT becomes both refractory to (p)ppGpp binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and also preferably binds PRPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>).

In contrast, (p)ppGpp’s interaction with <italic>B. subtilis</italic> HPRT is far stronger (K<sub>i</sub> = 1.7 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), potentially allowing (p)ppGpp to modulate its activity at basal levels throughout growth. Our data suggest that the dimer-dimer interaction is a mechanism that strengthens (p)ppGpp binding affinity, but also favors the inhibitor over the substrate PRPP. Physiological PRPP levels in bacteria are roughly 0.1–1 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berlin and Stadtman, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jensen, 1983</xref>). At 1 mM PRPP, the high end of physiological levels, (p)ppGpp at a basal level (25 μM) can still strongly inhibit tetrameric HPRT activity but not the constitutive dimeric homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus tetramerization allows basal (p)ppGpp to regulate HPRT and thus constantly regulate purine nucleotide synthesis via the salvage pathway.</p><p>The basal regulation of HPRT may be important for fitness in environmental niche.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigated the inhibition of HPRT, a key enzyme for the salvage of purine nucleotides, by the bacterial alarmone (p)ppGpp. They purified recombinant HPRT homologs from a broad spectrum of organisms for in vitro analysis, and revealed a significant variation of their affinities to (p)ppGpp. They then performed in-depth studies of pppGpp-sensitive HPRT homologs from Bacillus species using a combination of structural, biophysical and biochemical techniques. Surprisingly, although the binding site of pppGpp almost completely overlaps with that of HPRT substrates, substrate binding leads to the dissociation of HPRT tetramer, which exists in apo- or pppGpp-bound states, into dimers. By comparing sequences, structures, and oligomerization properties of HPRT homologs sensitive or refractory to (p)ppGpp inhibition, the authors concluded that tetramerization of HPRT triggers structural rearrangements to enhance (p)ppGpp binding, and that a dimer-dimer interface supporting tetramerization is the defining feature of (p)ppGpp sensitivity among HPRT homologs. They call this interplay between oligomeric state and ligand affinity &quot;oligomeric allostery&quot;. Using ancestral protein reconstruction, the authors also suggested that the emergence of the dimer-dimer interface is likely coupled to the evolution of (p)ppGpp sensitivity.</p><p>Although there was enthusiasm for the work, the reviewers collectively raised a number of concerns, some about the work itself and some about the interpretation or presentation of the data. Some of these concerns should be straightforward to address experimentally. Others may be more involved, particularly points 4-5 and the broader issue of whether this mechanism is relevant in vivo given the physiological concentrations of the molecules in question. If the authors feel that all of the issues could be addressed, the reviewers would welcome a revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors cited others' work and their own ITC data and claimed that HPRT is not an allosteric enzyme. In fact, apo-HPRT is likely a tetramer at the working concentration for ITC (45 μM) so that the experiment is not expected to reveal cooperativity. Conversely, it is possible that apo-HPRT falls apart into dimers when diluted to ~100 nM for biochemical assays so that the cooperativity for pRpp was not observed. Nonetheless, if pRpp binding dissociates HPRT tetramers into dimers, ITC of HPRT with pRpp should reveal cooperativity, and the [pRpp]-Vi relationship should deviate from the Michaelis-Menten model when HPRT concentration is sufficient to maintain a tetrameric configuration in the apo-form. The authors should present these data as important supporting evidence for their oligomeric allostery model.</p><p>2) Throughout the second half of the manuscript, the authors emphasize the significance of tetramerization on tight (p)ppGpp binding, but touched very little on the other side of the allostery, namely, how tetrameric vs dimeric HPRT affects the enzyme activity? For instance, is HPRT made constitutively tetrameric (e.g., crosslinked with disulfides) less active? And can the phylogenetic studies be used not to break a tetrameric HPRT (as is already done) but to make a normally dimeric HPRT tetrameric and thus subject to ppGpp-based regulation?</p><p>3) Subsection “(p)ppGpp regulation of HPRT is conserved across bacteria and beyond”: &quot;these results suggest significant inhibition of HPRT under physiological, basal levels of (p)ppGpp&quot; Provided that inhibition by (p)ppGpp is competitive with respect to pRpp, the magnitude of inhibition also depends on the physiological level and Km for pRpp. In other words, it's difficult to say in vivo what the effect of ppGpp will be (especially at low concentrations) unless one also knows the concentration of pRpp and the enzyme's Km for pRpp. Can these values be measured? If not, it may significantly impact what can be concluded about the level of inhibition by ppGpp in vivo.</p><p>4) In the end, it's not clear how important the ppGpp-driven stabilization of a tetramer is for inhibition. In the chimera experiment in Figure 4, the authors disrupt tetramerization and the affinity for ppGpp decreases 20-fold. But is this chimera no longer inhibited by ppGpp or does it just take higher levels? As the authors point out, ppGpp levels can get into the mM regime, so how much does a change in affinity from 1 to 20 μm matter in vivo? Related to this, the authors only examine enzyme inhibition in Figure 1 at one concentration: 25 uM. Maybe some of the enzymes, like the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> enzyme used in creating the chimera in Figure 4, are more fully inhibited at even slightly higher concentrations. We wouldn't expect the authors to examine enzyme inhibition in detail for every organism's HPRT, every mutant, and the chimera in Figure 4, but in a few select cases (especially the chimera and a couple of the orthologs) it seems essential to do so.</p><p>5) What are the in vivo consequences of not forming a tetramer in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, with respect to GTP homeostasis?</p><p>6) Ancestral reconstruction</p><p>The ancestral reconstruction method used was not correct and needs to be redone. This is a critical problem, as they authors do not establish that the branching pattern of their phylogeny is correct for the deepest nodes (Anc 1-7). If the branching pattern was different, these ancestors simply would not have existed. As a result, it is not clear whether the ancestor was a dimer that became a tetramer (as they claim) or was instead a tetramer that became a dimer.</p><p>The solution to these issues would be to do the reconstruction using established methods (see below) using a much larger set of sequences than the 141 chosen. It may be that their conclusions are robust to a better reconstruction, but they must establish this before publication.</p><p>A) None of the nodes they reconstructed (Anc 1-7) have bootstrap values above 90. They do not report the support values for these nodes, but I suspect that the support for these nodes is very low (see D below). Even though the posterior probabilities on the reconstruction of ancestral amino acids are high for the sites they identify as important, the authors have not convinced me that these nodes actually existed historically. Maybe the lineage lacking the dimer-dimer motif evolved later, representing a loss of ancestral tetramerization. This possibility cannot be distinguished from the hypothesis they present on the basis of their tree.</p><p>B) They constructed their tree using the WAG+G+I substitution model, but then reconstructed their ancestors using the JTT model. This mismatch is not correct and likely changed their reconstructed ancestral amino acid states. This should be re-done using consistent models.</p><p>C) They never justified the substitution models they chose (usually done using something like ProtTest or a manual AIC calculation). This should be done.</p><p>D) If the branch length unit shown on their tree (Figure 5A) is substitutions per site (as it usually is), their placement of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> protein is highly suspect. By eye, that branch accumulated ~1.5 subs/site, indicating it likely aligned very poorly. All one can see from the tree is that the bootstrap value for this placement is &lt;90 – but likely it is much lower. There are several strategies they could/should employ to get around this. First, build a much larger alignment that includes multiple representative sequences from the outgroup clade. This should better resolve the phylogeny. Second, report support values on all nodes-particularly the nodes that they use for reconstruction studies. If the support for these nodes remains low, strong claims about the order of branching and order of evolution of dimerization and tetramerization cannot be made.</p><p>E) They show a branch length label of &quot;0.2&quot; on their tree (Figure 5A), but do not define it in the legend. This should be done.</p><p>F) They did not describe what method they used for the reconstruction. They cite Jones, 1992, but this is the JTT substitution model, not the reconstruction method. Presumably they are using a marginal probability reconstruction (e.g. Yang, 1995). This should be stated.</p><p>G) To ensure reproducibility, the authors should publish their alignment in the supplement.</p><p>7) &quot;Oligomeric Allostery&quot;</p><p>The authors spend significant time in the discussion arguing that their work reveals a new phenomenon they call &quot;oligomeric allostery.&quot; It does not seem it was ever defined precisely in the text; however, as we understood it, it is a change in oligomeric state that controls ligand specificity. They point out in numerous places that they think is a new and important observation (Discussion section).</p><p>We do not think it is new. The authors note that there are many instances in which ligand binding controls oligomeric state (e.g. subsection “Protein oligomerization allosterically alters ligand specificity”). But, from the perspective of linkage thermodynamics, this is equivalent to saying ligand binding controls oligomeric state. The earliest thinking regarding allostery and cooperativity was informed by studies of oligomeric states (Perutz, MWC, etc.).</p><p>In our view, this framing hurts the manuscript, but not the underlying study. We think they could recast the work without relying on this dubious premise. The authors would be better served to argue that ligand binding and oligomeric states are often tightly linked to one another. They could then describe their work as a cool way that this interplay enables evolutionary change (in their case, by allowing mutations to accumulate away from a conserved binding pocket to promote a change in specificity).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Evolution of (p)ppGpp-HPRT regulation through diversification of an allosteric oligomeric interaction&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers were generally satisfied with your responses to the initial set of concerns raised. There are, however, a couple of remaining issues that you should address in a revision.</p><p>1) The first is that the reviewers were not entirely convinced by the proposed mechanism. If we understood it correctly, you are still proposing a cooperative mechanism but have no data supporting cooperativity. This came out most directly in the revision cover letter, where you suggest that cooperativity would not arise if (1) a single (p)ppGpp is sufficient to lock the tetramer in place and (2) four PRPP molecules are necessary to cause dissociation into a dimer. But this did not make sense to the reviewers – one of them even pieced together a set of linkage equations compatible with your verbal model and explored them on a computer and could not find any parameters that did not display cooperativity in PRPP. Your revision should clarify your proposed mechanism and whether cooperativity is a key feature and if so, what results support that interpretation.</p><p>2) It was difficult to assess your revisions as you did not always state whether the individual points had given rise to textual changes or not. Some were obvious, but others less so. In your next revision, please address the following:</p><p>a) How is the oligomeric state of each structure assessed? While it is clear that the PRPP + 9- deazaguanine bound form is dimeric from the packing in the supplied PDB file, the tetramer observed in the other two structures could in theory be a result of crystal packing. Usually, a tool like PISA is used to assess the validity of proposed multimers in crystal structures, but the authors make no reference to this. Please confirm that PISA agrees with the conclusions about oligomeric state.</p><p>Thank you for including the PISA analysis in the response to reviewers, this is quite clear. I also notice that you now mention PISA in the Materials and methods section. However, I believe it will be of value to the readers to have this information also at the relevant place in the Results section, i.e. whenever you conclude on oligomeric state, I suggest you say that this is supported by PISA analysis.</p><p>b) Subsection “(p)ppGpp binds the conserved active site of HPRT and closely mimics substrate binding”. Have the authors considered that the pppGpp preparation could contain a ppGpp contamination that crystallised with the protein? Would it be possible to check for this?</p><p>Could the authors please indicate whether this has resulted in any changes to the manuscript?</p><p>c) Subsection “(p)ppGpp prevents PRPP-induced dissociation of HPRT dimer-of-dimers” and Figure 3. What is the reason for excluding 9-deazaguanine during gel filtration and cross- linking? The comparison to the crystal structure would be more direct if both substrates were present. Is it possible that the oligomeric state of the protein only in the presence of PRPP is different?</p><p>Could the authors please indicate whether this has resulted in any changes to the manuscript? In this case I would suggest that you include this additional experiment as supplementary data in case other readers wonder.</p><p>d) Subsection “Dimer-dimer interaction allosterically positions loop II for potentiated (p)ppGpp binding”. Can the authors exclude that the structural variations observed in loop II to some extent are induced by crystal contacts?</p><p>Did this give rise to textual changes?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47534.056</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors cited others' work and their own ITC data and claimed that HPRT is not an allosteric enzyme.

To address this question, we conducted ITC between PRPP and HPRT (~45 μM). The isotherm fit a single site binding model without observed cooperativity for PRPP binding (with a K<sub>d</sub> ~ 7 μM, new data added as Figure 4 —figure supplement 5). Because we have already observed with dynamic light scattering at 175 μM of HPRT that PRPP still induces tetramer to dimer formation (Table 3), we expect at the 45 μM concentration used for ITC, PRPP would also induce tetramer to dimer transition. Thus, at high HPRT concentrations sufficient to maintain a tetrameric configuration in the apo form, we have not observed cooperativity for PRPP binding despite its ability to induce the tetramer to dimer transition. We assume that the [PRPP]-Vi relationship will not deviate from the Michaelis-Menten model at HPRT concentrations sufficient to maintain a tetrameric configuration in the apo-form.</p><p>We propose that the lack of cooperativity is best explained by PRPP having to associate with all four binding sites before it induces the tetramer to dimer transition. This would also explain why (p)ppGpp binding can lock the HPRT as a tetramer despite addition of high concentrations of PRPP – one (p)ppGpp binding may be sufficient to prevent dimeric HPRT formation.</p><p>Finally, we reasoned that our original ‘oligomeric allostery’ model where the enzyme is not allosteric is confusing. To remove this confusion, we have removed (as suggested by reviewers in comment 6) the term ‘oligomeric allostery’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Throughout the second half of the manuscript, the authors emphasize the significance of tetramerization on tight (p)ppGpp binding, but touched very little on the other side of the allostery, namely, how tetrameric vs dimeric HPRT affects the enzyme activity?</p></disp-quote><p>We found that naturally occurring dimeric HPRT homologs have similar activity compared to the tetrameric <italic>B. anthracis</italic> Hpt-1 and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> HPRT (Table 4). Between the naturally occurring homologs, the biggest difference as far as we can perceive, is their ability to be regulated by (p)ppGpp.</p><p>In addition, we found that the majority of the dimeric homologs also tend to have lower K<sub>m</sub> values for PRPP. This suggests that the evolution of the oligomer is not just affecting the affinity for (p)ppGpp but also for PRPP, and the dimer favors PRPP binding but the tetramer favors (p)ppGpp binding, which should also play a role in their reduced inhibition by (p)ppGpp. This point has been elaborated in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For instance, is HPRT made constitutively tetrameric (e.g., crosslinked with disulfides) less active? And can the phylogenetic studies be used not to break a tetrameric HPRT (as is already done) but to make a normally dimeric HPRT tetrameric and thus subject to ppGpp-based regulation?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment, we constructed a presumably constitutively tetrameric HPRT with a Y117C variant. This variant had significantly lower activity than WT (~6% of the Vmax). Also, while this variant bound pppGpp as well as the WT HPRT, it was nearly resistant to high concentrations of competing PRPP. This suggests that PRPP is unable to bind and dissociate a locked tetramer. These data are now shown as Figure 4—figure supplement 4.</p><p>We have also attempted to make a normally dimeric HPRT a tetramer. We replaced interface residues of the dimeric <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> HPRT with corresponding residues from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> HPRT. However, this variant was insoluble, perhaps due to improper folding. Despite the strength of the phylogenetic analyses, the HPRT homologs are too sequence diverse to pinpoint all compensatory changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “(p)ppGpp regulation of HPRT is conserved across bacteria and beyond”: &quot;these results suggest significant inhibition of HPRT under physiological, basal levels of (p)ppGpp&quot; Provided that inhibition by (p)ppGpp is competitive with respect to pRpp, the magnitude of inhibition also depends on the physiological level and Km for pRpp. In other words, it's difficult to say in vivo what the effect of ppGpp will be (especially at low concentrations) unless one also knows the concentration of pRpp and the enzyme's Km for pRpp. Can these values be measured? If not, it may significantly impact what can be concluded about the level of inhibition by ppGpp in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer to remind us to clarify this point. The regulation by basal level is highly relevant in vivo.</p><p>1) Physiological PRPP levels in bacteria are roughly 0.1 – 1 mM (Bennett et al., (2009); Jensen, (1983)). In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, the PRPP level is also in this range (0.2 – 1 mM) (Berlin and Stadtman, (1966)). All inhibition assays were performed with 1 mM PRPP, the high end of PRPP concentration. At this concentration, (p)ppGpp at lower concentrations (25 μM) can still strongly inhibit HPRT activity (Figure 2E). On the other hand, for the constitutive dimeric homologs, at 1 mM PRPP, (p)ppGpp can no longer inhibit HPRT (Figure 2E). We now add this information in the Discussion section.</p><p>2) We measured K<sub>m</sub> for PRPP for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> HPRT and <italic>B. anthracis</italic> Hpt-1 (166 μm and 112 uM, data shown in Table 4). Most bacterial HPRTs have a K<sub>m</sub> for PRPP in the range of 50 – 200 μM (Guddat et al., (2003); Zhang et al., (2016)). On the other hand, K<sub>d</sub> values for pppGpp typically range from 0.1-10 μM. Both of these parameters are within the physiological range of PRPP and (p)ppGpp.</p><p>3) We performed enzymatic assays showing that (p)ppGpp is a competitive inhibitor of HPRT with its substrate PRPP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the end, it's not clear how important the ppGpp-driven stabilization of a tetramer is for inhibition. In the chimera experiment in Figure 4, the authors disrupt tetramerization and the affinity for ppGpp decreases 20-fold. But is this chimera no longer inhibited by ppGpp or does it just take higher levels? As the authors point out, ppGpp levels can get into the mM regime, so how much does a change in affinity from 1 to 20 μm matter in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point that we are now able to clarify during revision. Here, it important to point out that regulation by (p)ppGpp is both important at basal level and at the induced level (e.g. 20-fold higher). In fact, basal level of (p)ppGpp has been shown to be very important for physiology, however, most of the (p)ppGpp biochemistry only showed that induced levels of (p)ppGpp regulate its enzymatic targets (i.e. upon starvation or other stress). The key to HPRT regulation is basal level (p)ppGpp. Our previous experiment (Kriel et al., 2012) showed that basal levels of (p)ppGpp are important for GTP homeostasis in vivo, protecting cells by inhibiting the purine salvage pathway at a basal (p)ppGpp concentration that is in strong contrast to the induced sub-millimolar or millimolar concentrations. In the context studied in Kriel et al., guanine is added as a source of purine in cells supplemented with both glucose and amino acids. In wild type cells grown with guanine, (p)ppGpp remained at its basal level (estimated to be only ~30 μM), yet this level of (p)ppGpp prevents excess GTP production through purine salvage and maintains homeostasis. Therefore, our analysis is highly relevant at least in the case of <italic>Bacillus</italic> species.</p><p>To translate the importance of a change in affinity from 1 to 20 μM, at a physiological concentration of PRPP (1 mM, assuming PRPP K<sub>m</sub> = 0.1 mM), a K<sub>i</sub> of 1 μM for pppGpp will result in ~75% inhibition at 30 μM pppGpp. On the other hand, a K<sub>i</sub> of 20 μM will result in ~12% inhibition at 30 μM pppGpp. Even upon (p)ppGpp inducing to 0.5 mM, a K<sub>i</sub> of 20 μM will result in ~70% inhibition of HPRT activity. Thus, lowering the affinity for pppGpp by 20-fold would mean that it is no longer an effective competitor of PRPP, especially at basal (p)ppGpp, and would likely keep the enzyme active.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, the authors only examine enzyme inhibition in Figure 1 at one concentration: 25 uM. Maybe some of the enzymes, like the L. pneumophila enzyme used in creating the chimera in Figure 4, are more fully inhibited at even slightly higher concentrations. We wouldn't expect the authors to examine enzyme inhibition in detail for every organism's HPRT, every mutant, and the chimera in Figure 4, but in a few select cases (especially the chimera and a couple of the orthologs) it seems essential to do so.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version, IC<sub>50</sub> curves of multiple orthologs, including <italic>C. burnetii</italic>, are shown in Figure 2E. For <italic>C. burnetii</italic>, IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 μM, much stronger than the 10 μM IC<sub>50</sub> for <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) What are the in vivo consequences of not forming a tetramer in B. subtilis, with respect to GTP homeostasis?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed several experiments to examine the in vivo consequences of weakening the affinity of HPRT for (p)ppGpp with respect to GTP homeostasis. We first attempted to introduce the (p)ppGpp-refractory <italic>C. burnetii hprT</italic> into <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (Δ<italic>hprT</italic> + <italic>amyE</italic>∷<italic>cbuhprT</italic> that expresses <italic>C. burnetii</italic> HPRT from an IPTG inducible promoter). However, the homolog has a weak expression in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> making it unable to utilize guanine efficiently (shown by a lack of growth rate increase upon guanine addition). We next constructed a codon-optimized <italic>C. burnetii hprT</italic>, but this allele is unable to transform into <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, presumably because of an unidentified toxicity.</p><p>Eventually, we found a way to demonstrate the physiological importance of basal (p)ppGpp regulation of guanine salvage by introducing a <italic>E. coli</italic> guanine salvage enzyme XGPRT into <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. We biochemically characterized this enzyme to show that its ability to catalyze PRPP and guanine conversion to GMP is inhibited by (p)ppGpp at IC<sub>50</sub> of 45 μM. In other words, this enzyme is inhibited by induced, but not basal level of (p)ppGpp (Figure 1B). When we introduced this construct into an <italic>ecgmk</italic> background (a background where <italic>B. subtilis</italic> GMK which is strongly inhibited by (p)ppGpp is replaced by <italic>E. coli</italic> GMK that is resistant to (p)ppGpp), we are able to observe a much higher concentration of GTP (4-fold higher) upon addition of guanosine (Figure 1C). Therefore, we are able to verify in vivo consequences of an HPRT that is inhibited only by induced (p)ppGpp, with respect to GTP homeostasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Ancestral reconstruction</p><p>The ancestral reconstruction method used was not correct and needs to be redone. This is a critical problem, as they authors do not establish that the branching pattern of their phylogeny is correct for the deepest nodes (Anc 1-7). If the branching pattern was different, these ancestors simply would not have existed. As a result, it is not clear whether the ancestor was a dimer that became a tetramer (as they claim) or was instead a tetramer that became a dimer.</p><p>The solution to these issues would be to do the reconstruction using established methods (see below) using a much larger set of sequences than the 141 chosen. It may be that their conclusions are robust to a better reconstruction, but they must establish this before publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful to the reviewers for their helpful criticism of the phylogenetic methods. We re-performed the phylogenetic analysis with an expanded 430 HPRT sequences with the specific issues raised below in mind. With the new analysis, we still obtain a phylogenetic tree that branches into two broad lineages: one sensitive to basal (p)ppGpp and one insensitive to basal (p)ppGpp. The ancestor to the (p)ppGpp-sensitive clade has a relatively low bootstrap value (55-60), indicating low confidence in this ancestor, as pointed out in issue A below. The key is that the residues we had previously identified as being important within each branch are still found to be important with the new analysis – one branch contains residues associated with dimeric HPRTs and the other does not. The Anc1 does not have residues associated with dimeric HPRTs, and it likely contains the Lys81 associated with the (p)ppGpp-regulated clade, suggesting that it is a tetramer.</p><p>The lower confidence in these branches inspired us to analyze another enzyme differentially regulated by (p)ppGpp: GMK, which has a much higher sequence identity across organisms than HPRT. Even with fewer sequences, this resulted in a more robust tree that also differentiates (p)ppGpp-sensitive and insensitive GMKs into two broad clades and suggests that the ancestral GMK was also regulated by (p)ppGpp.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A) None of the nodes they reconstructed (Anc 1-7) have bootstrap values above 90. They do not report the support values for these nodes, but I suspect that the support for these nodes is very low (see D below). Even though the posterior probabilities on the reconstruction of ancestral amino acids are high for the sites they identify as important, the authors have not convinced me that these nodes actually existed historically. Maybe the lineage lacking the dimer-dimer motif evolved later, representing a loss of ancestral tetramerization. This possibility cannot be distinguished from the hypothesis they present on the basis of their tree.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good point and is addressed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) They constructed their tree using the WAG+G+I substitution model, but then reconstructed their ancestors using the JTT model. This mismatch is not correct and likely changed their reconstructed ancestral amino acid states. This should be re-done using consistent models.</p></disp-quote><p>We used ProtTest to identify the best substitution model with the lowest AIC score as LG+G+I. Ancestral reconstruction was performed with the same model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) They never justified the substitution models they chose (usually done using something like ProtTest or a manual AIC calculation). This should be done.</p></disp-quote><p>See (B) above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D) If the branch length unit shown on their tree (Figure 5A) is substitutions per site (as it usually is), their placement of the S. cerevisiae protein is highly suspect. By eye, that branch accumulated ~1.5 subs/site, indicating it likely aligned very poorly. All one can see from the tree is that the bootstrap value for this placement is &lt;90 – but likely it is much lower. There are several strategies they could/should employ to get around this. First, build a much larger alignment that includes multiple representative sequences from the outgroup clade. This should better resolve the phylogeny. Second, report support values on all nodes-particularly the nodes that they use for reconstruction studies. If the support for these nodes remains low, strong claims about the order of branching and order of evolution of dimerization and tetramerization cannot be made.</p></disp-quote><p>This branch length unit is the substitutions per site. We included more sequences, particularly in the outgroup clade, to get a better alignment. All bootstrap values are now reported, especially for the ancestral states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>E) They show a branch length label of &quot;0.2&quot; on their tree (Figure 5A), but do not define it in the legend. This should be done.</p></disp-quote><p>The branch length label has been defined in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>F) They did not describe what method they used for the reconstruction. They cite Jones, 1992, but this is the JTT substitution model, not the reconstruction method. Presumably they are using a marginal probability reconstruction (e.g. Yang, 1995). This should be stated.</p></disp-quote><p>Correct, the reconstruction method was according to Yang, 1995. This has been cited in the Results section and described in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>G) To ensure reproducibility, the authors should publish their alignment in the supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>The alignments have been included as Source Data files (Figure 6—source data 1 and Figure 7—source data 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) &quot;Oligomeric Allostery&quot;</p><p>The authors spend significant time in the discussion arguing that their work reveals a new phenomenon they call &quot;oligomeric allostery.&quot; It does not seem it was ever defined precisely in the text; however, as we understood it, it is a change in oligomeric state that controls ligand specificity. They point out in numerous places that they think is a new and important observation (Discussion section).</p><p>We do not think it is new. The authors note that there are many instances in which ligand binding controls oligomeric state (e.g. subsection “Protein oligomerization allosterically alters ligand specificity”). But, from the perspective of linkage thermodynamics, this is equivalent to saying ligand binding controls oligomeric state. The earliest thinking regarding allostery and cooperativity was informed by studies of oligomeric states (Perutz, MWC, etc.).</p><p>In our view, this framing hurts the manuscript, but not the underlying study. We think they could recast the work without relying on this dubious premise. The authors would be better served to argue that ligand binding and oligomeric states are often tightly linked to one another. They could then describe their work as a cool way that this interplay enables evolutionary change (in their case, by allowing mutations to accumulate away from a conserved binding pocket to promote a change in specificity).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their feedback on this point and for the proposed reinterpretation. We have altered our model and modified the text at multiple points to incorporate these ideas.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers were generally satisfied with your responses to the initial set of concerns raised. There are, however, a couple of remaining issues that you should address in a revision.</p><p>1) The first is that the reviewers were not entirely convinced by the proposed mechanism. If we understood it correctly, you are still proposing a cooperative mechanism but have no data supporting cooperativity. This came out most directly in the revision cover letter, where you suggest that cooperativity would not arise if (1) a single (p)ppGpp is sufficient to lock the tetramer in place and (2) four PRPP molecules are necessary to cause dissociation into a dimer. But this did not make sense to the reviewers – one of them even pieced together a set of linkage equations compatible with your verbal model and explored them on a computer and could not find any parameters that did not display cooperativity in PRPP. Your revision should clarify your proposed mechanism and whether cooperativity is a key feature and if so, what results support that interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the opportunity to clarify this point. We do not think that cooperativity is a key feature of our model. We can confidently say that variation in the dimer-dimer interface influences the selectivity for substrate versus inhibitor. The potential cooperativity of PRPP binding (or lack thereof) does not change our findings that the dimer prefers PRPP over (p)ppGpp and the tetramer prefers (p)ppGpp over PRPP.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out that cooperativity would still arise if single (p)ppGpp is sufficient to lock the tetramer in place or four PRPP molecules are necessary to cause dissociation into a dimer. We agree that cooperativity is likely detectable under certain conditions. However, in the conditions we tested, within physiological ranges of (p)ppGpp and PRPP, we did not detect cooperativity. Our literature search of this extensively characterized enzyme did not find observation of cooperativity of native HPRT. On the other hand, kinetic cooperativity between PRPP and HPRT has been reported in mutant human HPRTs (Lightfoot et al., 1994; Balendiran et al., 1999). Thus, observing this cooperativity requires altering the native enzyme.</p><p>In light of these investigations, we revised the argument about the physiological relevance of cooperativity in the main text. We feel that the rest of the manuscript would be clear and impactful without the argument of cooperativity related to PRPP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It was difficult to assess your revisions as you did not always state whether the individual points had given rise to textual changes or not. Some were obvious, but others less so. In your next revision, please address the following:</p><p>a) How is the oligomeric state of each structure assessed? While it is clear that the PRPP + 9- deazaguanine bound form is dimeric from the packing in the supplied PDB file, the tetramer observed in the other two structures could in theory be a result of crystal packing. Usually, a tool like PISA is used to assess the validity of proposed multimers in crystal structures, but the authors make no reference to this. Please confirm that PISA agrees with the conclusions about oligomeric state.</p><p>Thank you for including the PISA analysis in the response to reviewers, this is quite clear. I also notice that you now mention PISA in the Materials and methods section. However, I believe it will be of value to the readers to have this information also at the relevant place in the Results section, i.e. whenever you conclude on oligomeric state, I suggest you say that this is supported by PISA analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks!

Have the authors considered that the pppGpp preparation could contain a ppGpp contamination that crystallised with the protein? Would it be possible to check for this?</p><p>Could the authors please indicate whether this has resulted in any changes to the manuscript?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this observation in subsection “(p)ppGpp binds the conserved active site of HPRT and closely mimics substrate binding”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Subsection “(p)ppGpp prevents PRPP-induced dissociation of HPRT dimer-of-dimers” and Figure 3. What is the reason for excluding 9-deazaguanine during gel filtration and cross- linking? The comparison to the crystal structure would be more direct if both substrates were present. Is it possible that the oligomeric state of the protein only in the presence of PRPP is different?</p><p>Could the authors please indicate whether this has resulted in any changes to the manuscript?
