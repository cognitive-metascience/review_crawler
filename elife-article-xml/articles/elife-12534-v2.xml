Replacement of the canonical TFIID-TBP complex with TRF3/TBP2 was reported to be required for activation of muscle-gene expression. The lack of a developmental phenotype in TBP2 null mice prompted further analysis to determine whether TBP2 deficiency can compromise adult myogenesis. We show here that TBP2 null mice have an intact regeneration potential upon injury and that TBP2 is not expressed in established C2C12 muscle cell or in primary mouse MuSCs. While TFIID subunits and TBP are downregulated during myoblast differentiation, reduced amounts of these proteins form a complex that is detectable on promoters of muscle genes and is essential for their expression. This evidence demonstrates that TBP2 does not replace TBP during muscle differentiation, as previously proposed, with limiting amounts of TFIID-TBP being required to promote muscle-specific gene expression.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12534.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12534.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12534.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The muscles that allow animal’s to move are built predominantly of cells called myofibers. Like other specialized cell types, these myofibers develop via a regulated set of events called differentiation. In adults, this phenomenon occurs when muscles regenerate after an injury, and new myofibers differentiate from so-called satellite cells that already reside within the muscles.</p><p>Differentiation is regulated at the genetic level, and the development of myofibers relies on the activation of muscle-specific genes. A gene’s expression is typically controlled via a nearby regulatory region of DNA called a promoter that can be recognized by various molecular machines made from protein complexes. In most adult tissues, such regulatory machineries contain a complex called TFIID.</p><p>Previously it was reported that the TFIID complex was eliminated from cells during muscle differentiation, and that an alternative protein complex called TBP2/TAF3 recognizes and regulates the promoters of muscle-specific genes. However, Malecova et al. have now discovered that TFIID is actually present, albeit at reduced amounts, in differentiated muscles and that it drives the activation of muscle-specific genes during differentiation. Further experiments also showed that the TBP2 protein is not required for differentiation of muscle cells or for the regeneration of injured muscles, and is actually absent in muscle cells.</p><p>Further studies are now needed to explore how the TFIID-containing complex works with other regulatory protein complexes that are known to help make muscle-specific genes accessible to TFIID. It will also be important to study the relationship between the down-regulation of TFIID components and the activation of muscle-specific genes that typically occurs in mature myofbers. Together these efforts will allow the various aspects of gene regulation to be integrated, which will help provide a more complete understanding of the process of muscle differentiation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12534.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12534.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

protein coding genes is part of the assembly of the Pre-Initiation Complex (PIC) that is typically nucleated by TFIID-mediated recognition of core promoter sequences. The TFIID complex is composed of TATA-box binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roeder, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tora, 2002</xref>). Moreover, several TBP-related factors (TRFs) have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar and Veenstra, 2011</xref>), expanding the repertoire and versatility of the basal transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Müller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodrich and Tjian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Müller et al., 2007</xref>). While a number of events contribute to promote PIC assembly, including sequence-specific transcriptional activators, chromatin remodeling complexes and histone modifications, recent work has proposed that changes in the identity of PIC components is a key determinant of cell type-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deato and Tjian, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In particular, it was recently suggested that during skeletal muscle differentiation, canonical TFIID is replaced by a complex consisting of TBP2 (also termed TRF3 = TBP-related factor 3; gene name Tbpl2 = TATA box binding protein like 2) and TAF3, which is required for activation of muscle genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deato and Tjian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deato et al., 2008</xref>). Further work has revealed that the alternative core factor TAF3, which is known to recognize histone H3K4me3 - a histone modification associated with active promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vermeulen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Ingen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lauberth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stijf-Bultsma et al., 2015</xref>) - mediates interactions between MyoD, permissive chromatin and PICs at promoters of muscle-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yao et al., 2011</xref>). This finding suggested that the widely established paradigm of a universal and prevalent use of TFIID as a promoter-recognizing complex in a variety of somatic cells might undergo drastic change during development. Nevertheless this hypothesis has been challenged by the observation that TBP2 null (TBP2_KO = TBP2 knock out) mice do not display any skeletal muscle phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gazdag et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that TBP2 is dispensable for developmental myogenesis (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.europhenome.org/databrowser/viewer.jsp?set=true&amp;m=true&amp;x=Both%20Split&amp;ln=Tbp2&amp;project=All&amp;zygosity=All&amp;m=true&amp;l=10386">http://www.europhenome.org/databrowser/viewer.jsp?set=true&amp;m=true&amp;x=Both Split&amp;ln=Tbp2&amp;project=All&amp;zygosity=All&amp;m=true&amp;l=10386</ext-link>). However, Gazdag et al. did not explore the integrity of the regeneration potential of skeletal muscles in TBP2 null mice during adult life, and thus have not ruled out the possibility that TBP2 can specifically promote the expression of muscle genes in muscle stem (satellite) cells (MuSCs) - the direct effectors of post-natal and adult skeletal myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang and Rudnicki, 2014</xref>).</p><p>MuSCs are usually found beneath the basal lamina of unperturbed muscles in a dormant state (quiescence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mauro, 1961</xref>), but are rapidly activated upon damage to give rise to new, differentiated myofibers through extensive epigenetic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dilworth and Blais, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sartorelli and Juan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moresi et al., 2015</xref>). Two key molecular events that invariably coincide with MuSC activation and commitment toward myogenic differentiation are (i) the expression of skeletal muscle transcription master regulator MyoD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zammit et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tapscott, 1988</xref>) and (ii) the activation of the p38 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones et al., 2005</xref>). These pathways cooperate to promote SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling and to increase levels of the active chromatin mark H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>) at promoters of muscle genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Simone, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rampalli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Forcales et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, studies from the Rando group have revealed that in activated MuSCs the large majority of muscle gene promoters show enrichment in H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Collectively, the data described above suggest that the H3K4me3 chromatin mark can mediate TAF3 recruitment to MyoD-target genes in activated MuSCs. Since TAF3 has been proposed as a mediator of TBP2 recruitment to muscle gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yao et al., 2011</xref>), these data provide the rationale for investigating whether TBP2 deficiency can impair post-natal and adult skeletal myogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TBP2 ablation does not affect MuSC differentiation and muscle regeneration after muscle injury</title><p>To investigate the role of TBP2 in postnatal and adult skeletal myogenesis in vivo we assessed the muscle regeneration potential of TBP2 null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gazdag et al., 2009</xref>) in response to injury. Notexin-mediated muscle injury triggers extensive muscle damage and stimulates adult muscle regeneration and post-natal myogenesis in vivo, during which damaged muscle is replaced by newly formed myofibers arising from activated MuSCs. Histological assessment of regenerating muscles showed a complete recovery of the muscle architecture, with abundant presence of centrally nucleated fibers in both wild type (WT) and TBP2 null muscles at 12 days post injury - a time point when muscle regeneration is near completion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both WT and TBP2 null mice contain similar numbers of Pax7 positive MuSCs in a sub-laminar position within unperturbed muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> upper panel, 1C). This result indicates that there are no defects in MuSC ontogenesis in the absence of <italic>Tbpl2</italic> expression. Importantly, we detected comparable numbers of MuSCs in muscles of WT and TBP2 null mice 12 days after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> lower panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1C</xref>), indicating an intact capacity of adult MuSCs to proliferate, self-renew and differentiate during ongoing muscle regeneration in the absence of TBP2. Finally, we used Fluorescence Assisted Cell Sorting (FACS) to isolate MuSCs from skeletal muscles of WT and TBP2 null mice before and 12 days after notexin-mediated injury, and analyzed their intrinsic myogenic potential ex vivo Cultures of MuSCs from all conditions yielded a comparable number of Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC)-positive multinucleated myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>), demonstrating that MuSCs from TBP2 null muscles have the identical myogenic potential of MuSCs from WT mice as they can readily differentiate into myotubes with equal capacity upon exposure to differentiation conditions in vitro.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12534.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Regenerative potential and differentiation of MuSCs are intact in the absence of TBP2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cross-sections of unperturbed (left panel) and notexin injured (right panel) muscles were histologicaly assessed by Hematoxilin/Eosin (H&amp;E) staining to evaluate the muscle architecture 12 days post notexin-mediated injury of the muscle.

We found that TBP2 is not expressed in myotubes derived from either C2C12 myoblasts, nor from primary mouse MuSCs. Consistently, TBP2-deficient mice displayed an intact regeneration potential, and MuSCs isolated from TBP2-deficient muscles differentiated into myotubes with the same efficiency as wild type MuSCs. This evidence firmly supports the conclusion that TBP2 does not replace TBP during muscle differentiation, as previously proposed by Deato et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deato and Tjian, 2007</xref>).</p><p>We have observed downregulation of TFIID subunits at both the RNA and protein levels in differentiated myotubes, compared to proliferating myoblasts, as has previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deato and Tjian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, a mechanism for ubiquitination-mediated downregulation of TBP protein in skeletal myotubes was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the plausible scenario in skeletal muscle specific transcription is that limited TFIID helps to restrict the assembly of the transcription competent PIC at a selected subset of muscle specific genes.</p><p>Our findings that TBP/TFIID is functional in muscle progenitors and their differentiated progeny are in agreement with earlier studies showing that TBP was able to bind the MyoD promoter in a TATA-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leibham et al., 1994</xref>). It has been also shown that MyoD efficiently stimulated TFIID-dependent basal transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heller and Bengal, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dilworth, 2004</xref>). Moreover, an endogenous interaction between MyoD and TBP in both myoblasts and myotubes was demonstrated, and in myotubes, MyoD and components of PIC TBP and TFIIB were found to be recruited to the proximal promoter of the <italic>alpha-sarcoglycan</italic> muscle gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Delgado-Olguín et al., 2006</xref>). The relevance of TBP-mediated activation of MyoD target genes has been recently emphasized by the finding that large polyglutamine (PolyQ) repeats in TBP causes muscle degeneration, by reducing the expression of muscle-specific genes, due to a decreased association of TBP with MyoD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). This finding reiterates the importance of clarifying the identity of the proteins that compose the core promoter basal machinery required for muscle gene transcription in differentiating muscles, further extending the related implications to the pathogenesis of human muscular disorders.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12534.010</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Squences of the primers used in this study.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12534.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12534.010</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Mouse primers for RT-PCR</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gapdh-for</td><td>GCTCACTGGCATGGCCTTCCG</td></tr><tr><td>Gapdh-rev</td><td>GTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC</td></tr><tr><td>Myog-for</td><td>GAGACATCCCCCTATTTCTACCA</td></tr><tr><td>Myog-rev</td><td>GCTCAGTCCGCTCATAGCC</td></tr><tr><td>Acta1-for</td><td>AOCGTTTCCGTTGCCCOOAG</td></tr><tr><td>Acta1-rev</td><td>GGAGAGAGAGCGCGAACGCA</td></tr><tr><td>Ttn-for</td><td>GACACCACAAGGTGCAAAGTC</td></tr><tr><td>Ttn-rev</td><td>CCCACTOTTCTTGACCGTATCT</td></tr><tr><td>Pdlim3-for</td><td>TGGGGGCATAGACTTCAATCA</td></tr><tr><td>Pdlim3-rev</td><td>CTCCGTACCAAAGCCATCAATAG</td></tr><tr><td>Mylpf-for</td><td>TTCAAGGAGGCGTTCACTQTA</td></tr><tr><td>Mylpf-rev</td><td>TAOCGTCOAGTTCCTCATTCT</td></tr><tr><td>Mybph-for</td><td>CAGCCACTAAGCCTGAACCTC</td></tr><tr><td>Mybph-rev</td><td>TCCAACACATAGCCTTGAAGC</td></tr><tr><td>Cyclin D1-for</td><td>ACTTCCTCTCCAAAATGCCAG</td></tr><tr><td>Cyclin D1-rev</td><td>GTOGGTTGOAAATGAACTTCAC</td></tr><tr><td>Ckm-for</td><td>AQTCCTACACQQTCTTCAAGO</td></tr><tr><td>Ckm-rev</td><td>AGGAAGTGGTCATCAATQAGC</td></tr><tr><td>Tbpl2-for</td><td>ATACCTGGACCTCTTCCTGOAT</td></tr><tr><td>Tbpl2-rev</td><td>CCACCAAGATGTGGATGAAAC</td></tr><tr><td>Tbp-for</td><td>CCAAGCGATTTGCTGCAGTCATCA</td></tr><tr><td>Tbp-rev</td><td>ACTTAGCTGGGAAGGCCAACTTCT</td></tr><tr><td>Taf1-for</td><td>ACAGGAACAGATGCAGACCTTCGT</td></tr><tr><td>Taf1-rev</td><td>AATCTCCTCCTCAGGCACACCAAA</td></tr><tr><td>Taf2-for</td><td>GGCCTTGGAAAAATTCCCCAC</td></tr><tr><td>Taf2-rev</td><td>GAAGCACGCTGACATCCTGA</td></tr><tr><td>Taf3-for</td><td>GACATTGATGCTGCGAAAGTGCGA</td></tr><tr><td>Taf3-rev</td><td>TCCCGCTTGCT7CTTTCTCGATCT</td></tr><tr><td>Taf4-for</td><td>AGTTCACACGGCAAAGAATCACGC</td></tr><tr><td>Taf4-rev</td><td>AACGCCGGCTCATCCTGTTACTTA</td></tr><tr><td>Taf5-for</td><td>TTTC6GACGAGTAAATTCGTTCT</td></tr><tr><td>Taf5-rev</td><td>CTCCTGCACGATGTTCCAGAT</td></tr><tr><td>Taf6-for</td><td>AAACTCAGCAATACTGTGTTGCC</td></tr><tr><td>Taf6-rev</td><td>TTCTGTCGTTTCCCCATGTGC</td></tr><tr><td>Taf8-for</td><td>CCGGGAAGTAAGCAATCCACT</td></tr><tr><td>Taf8-rev</td><td>GCTTTCTCGGCACTCTCAAATC</td></tr><tr><td>Tar9-for</td><td>TGCCGAAAGATGCACAGATGA</td></tr><tr><td>Taf9-rev</td><td>TGTTGTCACATATCOGAAGGC</td></tr><tr><td>Taf10-for</td><td>GAGGGOGCAATQTCTAACGG</td></tr><tr><td>Taf10-rev</td><td>TGTGTAATCCTCCAACTGCATC</td></tr><tr><td>Taf12-for</td><td>GGACAGQTQQTCGTCTCAG</td></tr><tr><td>Tat12-rev</td><td>TCATCAOCOATCTOTAGCAGC</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><bold>Mouse primers for ChIP</bold></td></tr><tr><td>Myoq TSS-for</td><td>GCTCAGGTTTCTGTGGCGTT</td></tr><tr><td>Myog TSS-rev</td><td>CCAAC TGCTGGGTGCC AT</td></tr><tr><td>Acta1 T5S-for</td><td>GTGCCCGACACCCAAATA</td></tr><tr><td>Acta1 TSS-rev</td><td>AGGGTAGGAAGTGAGGCTT</td></tr><tr><td>Ttn TSS-for</td><td>CCTTCCTAACAGAGCCAATCAC</td></tr><tr><td>Ttn TSS-rev</td><td>TGTTTCCTATGCAATCCCTACAC</td></tr><tr><td>Pdlim3 TSS-for</td><td>CACTCGCAGCAGGQATAAAT</td></tr><tr><td>Pdlim3 TSS-rev</td><td>GAACCGGACAACCTACTTAGC</td></tr><tr><td>Mylpf TSS-for</td><td>CTCCAAGCAGATTCTCTTGCTTT</td></tr><tr><td>Mylpf TSS-rev</td><td>GGTAGOGC TAT CC T OAOCTAAT</td></tr><tr><td>Mybph TSS-for</td><td>GCCTGCCTTTATAAGCATQAAC</td></tr><tr><td>Mybph TSS-rev</td><td>GTOTCAAGCTGOAGTOTTTAAG</td></tr><tr><td>Gapdh TSS-for</td><td>AGQGCTGCAGTCCGTATTTA</td></tr><tr><td>Gapdh TSS-rev</td><td>AGOAGGGGAAATGAGAOAGG</td></tr><tr><td>Sox2 TSS-for</td><td>GATTGGCCGCCGQAAAC</td></tr><tr><td>Sox2 TSS-rev</td><td>CTCTTCTCTOCCTTOACAACTC</td></tr><tr><td>Igh enhancer-for</td><td>AACCACAGCTACAAGTTTACC</td></tr><tr><td>Igh enhancer-rev</td><td>AACCAGAAÇACCTGCAGCAGC</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and muscle injury</title><p>All protocols were approved by the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute Animal Care and Use Committee.

We also ask that you analyze additional control mRNAs to achieve a set of at least 3 reference genes for the qRT-PCR analyses. We all felt that adding MS analysis of the TFIID complex in TBP immunoprecipitates would greatly strengthen the paper and increase its impact on the field; although we do not insist on it. Finally, it is important that you increase the rigor of statistical analyses of your results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Previous work from the Tjian group suggested that, during skeletal muscle differentiation, canonical TFIID is replaced by a complex consisting of TBP-like factor TBP2 and TAF3, which is required for activation of muscle genes. This hypothesis has been challenged by the observation that TBP2_KO mice do not display any skeletal muscle phenotype, indicating that TBP2 is dispensable for developmental myogenesis. However, it remained possible that TBP2 was needed for the regeneration potential of skeletal muscles and the expression of muscle genes in muscle stem (satellite) cells (MuSCs). The results here are at odds with the latter possibility in revealing no defect in adult muscle regeneration or the differentiation potential of MuSCs ex vivo for TBP2 knock-out animals. The authors go on to provide evidence that TBP2 is not even expressed during differentiation of skeletal myoblasts into myotubes, although it could be detected in murine overies, while TBP and TAFs that comprise convential TFIID are readily detected. TBP2 expression can be observed in myotubes transfected with TBP2, but it has no effect on expression of muscle genes. They further demonstrate that down-regulation of TBP by siRNA impairs differentiation into large multinucleated myotubes and impaired activation of skeletal muscle specific genes. Thus, TBP2 is dispensable while TBP is required for differentiation from myoblasts to myotubes. In agreement with previous findings, they do observe a downregulation TBP and at least certain TFIID TAFs on differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes, but the residual proteins appear to assemble into TFIID, based on coIP and co-sedimentation analyses, and they are found by ChIP at the promoters of muscle genes in myotubes, but not myoblasts, at levels comparable to those seen at constitutively expressed genes and in parallel with the increased occupancies of Pol II CTD-phosphorylated on Ser5 in myotubes. These findings provide strong evidence that TBP and TAFs that comprise conventional TFIID, rather than the TBP2/TAF3 complex, mediates the induction of muscle genes by MyoD on differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes.

The authors refer to a publication by Deato and colleagues (Deato et al., 2008), which concluded that differentiation from myoblasts to myotubes involves the replacement of the canonical TFIID by a novel complex composed of TBP2 and TAF3. This finding has been questioned by the lack of skeletal or muscular deficits in the TBP2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (Gazdag et al., 2009). Malecova and collaborators extend the characterization of skeletal myogenesis in TBP2<sup>-/-</sup> mice demonstrating how TBP2 ablation does not affect muscle regeneration after injury. The authors document absence of TBP2 expression in both mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 and muscle stem cells (MuSCs). In addition, they show that reduced TBP expression impairs myoblast differentiation and expression of muscle-specific genes. Using both C2C12 and primary muscle stem cells they confirmed that TBP and the TFIID complex become expressed to lower levels during myogenic differentiation. ChIP assays reveal a direct involvement of TBP in the pre-initiation complex assembly at MyoD-regulated genes.</p><p>The data presented by Malecova and colleagues contradicts the previously proposed mechanisms by Deato et al. for muscle differentiation, which were obtained in the C2C12 cell model in a clear and convincing sequence of experiments. In addition, the present study extends to primary cells and to the TBP2 deletion mice. The manuscript is well written and the results of this study are discussed in a fair and balanced manner in light of the published literature on this subject. I believe that this work represents an important addition and clarification of the role of basal transcription factors in muscle differentiation.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the authors show the regenerative and differentiation potential of MuSCs in the TBP2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. To better show the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the authors should include a cross-section of notexin-injured muscles at an early time point (e.g. day 3). With this comparison, the authors can demostrate the difference between complete fiber breakdown observed at day 3 and the regeneration occurred at day 12.</p><p>2) The full sets of qRT-PCR have been quantified using GAPDH only as reference gene. The usage of more than one single reference is not sufficient. Many metabolic genes are altered upon myogenic differentiation. Therefore, additional reference genes should be used to come to a set of at least 3 reference genes, for example by inclusding HPRT1, HMBS, SDHA, PPIA, YWHAZ and/or B2M.</p><p>3) The authors detect the presence of the TFIID complex in myoblasts and myotubes with immunoblotting for TBP and a limited set of TBP-associated factors. Subsequently, they evaluate the integrity of the TFIID complex using a glycerol size fractionation. It would be better to investigate the TFIID complex by sensitive mass spectrometry of TBP immunoprecipitates to determine the precise composition of TFIID in myotubes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors present experiments designed to test whether TBP or TBP2 is required for muscle cell gene expression. The motivation for the experiments rests on previous conflicting studies. First, Deato et al. (2007, 2008) suggested that TBP2 is required for muscle cell gene expression, replacing TBP/TFIID with an alternative complex. However, Gazdag (2009) constructed a TBP2 homozygous null mouse and showed that it was viable, that TBP2 expression was only detectable in ovaries, that skeletal muscle in the TBP2<sup>-/-</sup> mice was indistinguishable from that of control animals, and that the expression of myogenic factors was unaffected in the TBP2<sup>-/-</sup> null mouse.</p><p>In the current work, the authors examine the issue in greater detail, testing whether TBP2 might be required in muscle stem cells, an aspect of muscle cell function untested by Gazdag (2009). Their work presents convincing data that TBP2 is not required for expression of muscle genes in these cells, that TBP2 is not detectable in these cells, and that TBP/TFIID is present and necessary for muscle gene expression. Thus, their work agrees with and extends the previous analysis of Gazdag (2009). The experiments are solid and the conclusions are reasonable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12534.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>As you will see from the edited reviews shown below, two of the reviewers had issues with the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> on muscle regeneration following injury and it is important that you present cross-sections early after injury to document that the starting amount of injury was similar for the WT and TBP2_KO muscles.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers pointed to an issue that deserves an important premise. Healthy, unperturbed skeletal muscles are composed of myofibers whose nuclei are typically located at the periphery. Intramuscular injection of myotoxins, such as notexin, is widely used to induce regeneration (1, 2, 3, 4) and is typically ensued by an early phase of muscle degeneration characterized by myofibers necrosis, followed by inflammatory infiltration and activation of satellite cells. These events occur during the first 3-4 days post injury 3 and prevent an accurate measurement of the cross-sectional area (CSA) of myofibers, as the injured muscle area contains high amount of cellular infiltrate, with the large majority of myofibers being destroyed and/or deformed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1A</xref>, 3 days post injury). As such, CSA cannot be evaluated during the initial stage of regeneration. Starting from day 5 or 6 after injury, activated satellite cells begin to fuse into new myfibers and/or fuse with the pre-existing damaged myofibers (3). This regeneration process is typically completed around day 10 post myotoxin injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1A</xref>), resulting in the restoration of the original muscle architecture. Well-established hallmarks of regenerating muscle at this stage are: i) the presence of newly regenerating myofibers with a smaller CSA and ii) central nucleation3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1A</xref>, 10 days post injury). Thus, in our experiments we have considered these two hallmarks to show that WT and TBP2_KO muscles were undergoing comparable regeneration, reflecting similar extent of injury. Indeed, we reasoned that failure to regenerate or weaker regeneration process would invariably lead to absence or reduction in number of centrally nucleated fibers by day 12 post-injury. On the other hand, failure to complete the regeneration process can be detected by the persistence of the inflammatory infiltrate at day 12 post-injury.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12534.011</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Injury decreases the CSA in regenerating myofibers to the same extend in WT and TBP2KO.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Muscle histology: Hematoxilin &amp; Eosin staining of WT muscle crosssections at different time point of regeneration.

This data support our conclusion that upon an initial injury, the regeneration ability of TBP2-deficient muscles is comparable to that of WT muscles.</p><p>While we provide these additional figures to the reviewers (and readers that will have access to these comments), we do not believe that they would add any further insight to the manuscript, and therefore we did not include them in the revised version of our work. However, we are happy to include them if the reviewers/editors deem it necessary.</p><p><italic>We also ask that you analyze additional control mRNAs to achieve a set of at least 3 reference genes for the qRT-PCR analyses.</italic> </p><p>We indeed appreciate this comment from the reviewers. In an attempt to make our RNA analysis more rigorous, we have set out to normalize the RT-PCR data to the geometric average of 3 reference genes (5). We have designed primers for genes suggested by reviewer #2: <italic>Sdha, Hprt, Ywhaz, Ppia, Hmbs,</italic> as well as two additional ribosomal genes <italic>Rpl10</italic> and <italic>Rpl0</italic>. Primers for genes Sdha and Hmbs failed our quality control, therefore we excluded them from the analysis. Importantly, as common practice, we have reverse transcribed equal amounts of RNA into cDNA for myoblasts and myotubes. When comparing the expression of six housekeeping genes (<italic>Gapdh, Hprt, Ywhaz, Ppia, Rpl10</italic> and <italic>Rpl0</italic>), we have unfortunately noticed that majority of them are down-regulated in myotubes compared to myoblasts. We have plotted the raw Ct values for each analyzed sample to illustrate the differential expression of the analyzed potential reference genes during muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref>, high Ct value = low expression). The most stable gene that is in our hands not differentially expressed during muscle differentiation, considering an equal total RNA amount, is <italic>Gapdh</italic>. For that reason we could not take into account any of the additional tested housekeeping genes for the data normalization purpose, and thus we could not use the normalization methods including geometric average of several reference genes (5), as we initially intended. Nonetheless this comparison with a panel of analyzed housekeeping genes that are down-regulated during muscle cells differentiation reinforced our initial conclusion that <italic>Gapdh</italic> is the most reliable reference gene for normalization of RNA expression.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12534.012</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of expression levels of six houskeeping genes during myoblasts to myotubes differentiation.</title><p>RNA was isolated from biological triplicates of C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes as described in themanuscript (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

While we acknowledge that the relationship between composition of the TFIID complex and SWI/SNF complex in myoblasts and myotubes builds directly on the discovery presented in this manuscript, we also note that it is part of an independent project that will need a substantial amount of work and that is clearly behind the timeframe of publication of the current manuscript.

We agree that it is easier to appreciate the downregulation of most of the TFIID subunits (except TAF2) on the protein level with the immunoblot quantification analysis. However, we have also noted that the antibodies against TBP, TAF2, TAF6, TAF10, MHC and Cyclin D1 do not react accordingly to the two-fold difference in amount of nuclear extract proteins on the immunoblot, since the quantified signals showed more than two-fold decrease in samples that were half amount of proteins. Therefore we believe that it would be incorrect and misleading to make any further quantitative conclusions about the extent of downregulation of the TFIID subunits on the protein level based on the immunoblot quantification.
