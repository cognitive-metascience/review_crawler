Instead, they regulate the expression of genes by preventing protein-encoding messenger RNAs from being translated into protein. MicroRNAs are expressed throughout the body, including the heart, where the most abundant microRNA is called <italic>miR-1</italic>. This is encoded by two nearly identical genes: <italic>miR-1-1</italic> and <italic>miR-1-2</italic>.</p><p>Mice that lack the <italic>miR-1-2</italic> gene have various heart abnormalities, but generally survive because they still produce some <italic>miR-1</italic> from their remaining <italic>miR-1-1</italic> gene. Now, Heidersbach et al. have generated the first mice that specifically lack both <italic>miR-1</italic> genes, and shown that these animals die before weaning.</p><p>When viewed under the electron microscope, heart muscle from <italic>miR-1</italic> double knockout mice lacks the characteristic ‘striped’, or striated, appearance of normal heart muscle. Additionally, <italic>miR-1</italic> double knockout hearts have some gene expression characteristics more similar to the smooth muscle found in the gut and in the walls of blood vessels. Smooth muscle differs from striated muscle in that it lacks sarcomeres: these are bands of fibrous proteins, such as myosin, that are essential for muscle contraction.</p><p>In normal mice, an enzyme called MLCK contributes to the formation and function of sarcomeres by adding phosphate groups to myosin molecules. By contrast, in smooth muscle an enzyme called Telokin promotes phosphate group removal, and thus affects the function of sarcomeres. Heidersbach et al. showed that <italic>miR-1</italic> interacts directly with <italic>Telokin</italic> mRNA to prevent its expression in the heart, and simultaneously represses a protein called Myocardin, which directly activates transcription of <italic>Telokin</italic>. However, when <italic>miR-1</italic> is absent, as in the <italic>miR-1</italic> double knockout mice, <italic>Telokin</italic> is expressed in heart muscle, along with many other genes characteristic of smooth muscle.</p><p>As well as improving our understanding of the development and functioning of the heart, these findings should shed new light on the role of microRNAs in maintaining the patterns of gene expression that characterize unique cell fates.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01323.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01323.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>microRNA-1</kwd><kwd>cardiac</kwd><kwd>sarcomere</kwd><kwd>Telokin</kwd><kwd>Myocardin</kwd><kwd>smooth muscle gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heidersbach</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 HL100406, U01 HL098179, R01 HL057181, P01 HL089707</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Srivastava</surname><given-names>Deepak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ang</surname><given-names>Yen-Sin</given-names></name><name><surname>Ivey</surname><given-names>Kathryn N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ivey</surname><given-names>Kathryn N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Srivastava</surname><given-names>Deepak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>William Younger Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Srivastava</surname><given-names>Deepak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LK Whittier Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Srivastava</surname><given-names>Deepak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Roddenberry Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Srivastava</surname><given-names>Deepak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>microRNA-1 plays an essential role in the development and functioning of the heart by ensuring that genes for striated, rather than smooth, muscle are expressed there.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cardiac gene expression is cooperatively regulated by an intertwined network of transcription factors and microRNAs (miRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Srivastava, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cordes and Srivastava, 2009</xref>). Perturbations in the activity or expression of factors within this network result in cardiac structural and functional defects in animal models and in humans. Among these, serum response factor (SRF) and Myocardin (Myocd) cooperate to directly regulate the myogenic gene program in both cardiac and smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Treisman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sepulveda et al., 2002</xref> reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang and Olson, 2004</xref>). These factors transcriptionally regulate numerous miRNAs that, in turn, regulate transcription factors to reinforce specific cellular decisions and behavior. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kwon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Niu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cordes et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>miRNAs are small, ∼21 nucleotide (nt), single-stranded RNAs that negatively regulate the stability and translation of mRNA transcripts. miRNAs target sequences within the 3′ UTRs of mRNA transcripts that are highly complementary to the miRNA seed sequence (nt 2–8) and have imperfect complementarity outside of the seed region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Valencia-Sanchez et al., 2006</xref>). Due to the degenerate nature of miRNA:mRNA interactions, a single miRNA may have hundreds of mRNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartel, 2009</xref>). Often miRNAs target multiple genes in a common pathway, thereby amplifying the effect of an individual miRNA on a given biological process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fish et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cordes et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p><italic>microRNA-1 (miR-1)</italic> is a highly conserved miRNA and its expression is enriched specifically in cardiac and skeletal muscle. In mice, it is expressed in the heart and somites of the developing embryo during myogenic differentiation, beginning around embryonic day (E) 8.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). The cardiac expression of <italic>miR-1</italic> increases during development, with a dramatic rise in the postnatal period. RNA sequencing has revealed that <italic>miR-1</italic> is the most abundant miRNA in the adult mouse heart, representing up to 40% of all miRNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rao et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p><italic>miR-1</italic> is transcribed as part of a bicistronic cluster with another striated muscle-enriched miRNA, <italic>miR-133a</italic>. In the genomes of most mammals, a duplication event has occurred resulting in two copies of the <italic>miR-1/133a</italic> locus, with <italic>miR-1-2</italic> and <italic>miR-133a-1</italic> on chromosome 18 and <italic>miR-1-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133a-2</italic> on chromosome 2 of the murine genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both precursors are transcriptionally regulated by several key myogenic transcription factors, including Myogenin, MYOD, SRF, MYOCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kwon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rao, 2006</xref>) and MEF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). When processed, both the <italic>miR-1-2</italic> and <italic>miR-1-1</italic> precursors give rise to identical mature <italic>miR-1</italic> species, suggesting evolutionary pressure on both alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). An additional miRNA cluster encoding <italic>miR-133b</italic> and <italic>miR-206</italic> is expressed uniquely in skeletal muscle, with the mature sequence of <italic>miR-206</italic> sharing a common seed with <italic>miR-1</italic>, but varying by 4 nts outside of the seed region.</p><p>Deletion of <italic>miR-1-2</italic> in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>), which reduces the total expression of cardiac <italic>miR-1</italic> by roughly 50%, results in a spectrum of cardiac defects on a pure 129 background, including incompletely penetrant lethality, cardiomyocyte proliferative defects, and electrophysiological abnormalities. In flies, loss of the single <italic>miR-1</italic> gene results in abnormal myogenic differentiation and cell polarity defects in cardiac progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kwon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sokol, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">King et al., 2011</xref>); however, the consequences of complete loss of <italic>miR-1</italic> in mammals are unknown.</p><p>In this study, we report that targeted deletion of the <italic>miR-1-1</italic> locus results in a phenotype similar to that described for <italic>miR-1-2</italic> null mice, and that the complete loss of <italic>miR-1</italic> is uniformly lethal before weaning due to cardiac dysfunction. We show that the loss of <italic>miR-1</italic> results in perinatal heart failure with myocardial sarcomeric defects, hypophosphorylation of Myosin Light Chain 2, and ectopic expression of Telokin, a smooth muscle-restricted inhibitor of Myosin Light Chain 2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we found the SRF co-factor, MYOCD, which is critical for transcriptional activation of both the cardiac and smooth muscle gene programs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoofnagle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2002</xref>), is directly targeted by <italic>miR-1</italic>. The smooth muscle isoform of <italic>Myocd</italic> was preferentially upregulated in the absence of <italic>miR-1</italic> and likely contributed to ectopic activation of the smooth muscle gene program in the heart. Our findings reveal that <italic>miR-1</italic> is embedded in an SRF-dependent cardiac gene program that promotes sarcomerogenesis and myogenic differentiation, while simultaneously repressing the smooth muscle program.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and characterization of <italic>miR-1-1</italic> null mice</title><p>We used homologous recombination to delete one allele of the <italic>miR-1-1</italic> precursor in embryonic stem (ES) cells, with a floxed neomycin cassette used for positive selection.

We found a reduction in fractional shortening, as well as an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimension in the <italic>miR-1-1</italic> knockout animals, indicating ventricular dilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Mild ventricular dilation was confirmed histologically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D I and II</xref>). Additionally, we observed areas of fibrosis in the ventricular myocardium of the <italic>miR-1-1</italic> knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D III and IV</xref>). Like <italic>miR-1-2</italic> knockouts, <italic>miR-1-1</italic> knockout animals exhibited subtle conduction abnormalities, including prolonged ventricular depolarization and repolarization, indicated by a broader QRS complex and longer QT interval than controls. Additionally, <italic>miR-1-1</italic> knockout mice showed broader P waves without alteration of the PR interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Intermittent atrial arrhythmias were observed in two of five knockout animals analyzed, but were not observed in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Thus, mice lacking <italic>miR-1-1</italic> were grossly similar to those lacking <italic>miR-1-2</italic>, in that they exhibited partial lethality as well as subtle conduction abnormalities.</p><p>Cardiac conduction defects in the <italic>miR-1-2</italic> knockout mice were at least partially ascribed to dysregulation of the <italic>miR-1</italic> target, <italic>Irx5</italic>. Similarly, we found that <italic>Irx5</italic> was upregulated in the <italic>miR-1-1</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). <italic>miR-1-1</italic> knockout mice also had a partial decrease in mature <italic>miR-133a</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Previously, using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, the <italic>miR-133a</italic> precursor levels were reported to be unchanged in the <italic>miR-1-2</italic> knockout animals.

At weaning, no lethality was observed in the double-heterozygous mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) similar to the <italic>miR-1-1</italic> knockout on a mixed background. Using gene expression microarray analyses, we found 201 genes that were dysregulated in the single knockouts or double-heterozygous mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Of those, 24 genes were coordinately dysregulated in animals of all three genotypes. The majority of genes (195/201) were similarly altered between the double heterozygotes and at least one of the single knockouts.

Most of these mice were viable and fertile on the mixed background, though mice lacking both the copies of <italic>miR-1-2</italic> were under-represented at weaning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating some difference in the compensatory ability of the two loci.</p><p>Single-allele mice (¾ alleles knocked-out) were intercrossed to generate mice completely lacking <italic>miR-1</italic>. <italic>miR-1</italic> compound-null mice on a mixed background were born at slightly less than Mendelian ratios and were of normal birth weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4 fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplements 4 and 5</xref>). Roughly a quarter of the double-knockout animals died very soon after birth. In a subset of these animals, we observed ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and misalignment of the aorta over the ventricular septum (overriding aorta), likely accounting for their lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). Surviving <italic>miR-1</italic> double-knockouts failed to thrive post-natally, with no double-knockout animals surviving beyond P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Examination of surviving <italic>miR-1</italic> double-knockouts revealed expansion of the superior portion of the right ventricle (conus) and enlargement of the atria, when compared to wild-type mice beginning at P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, asterisk). By P4, and more extensively by P10, the dilation of all cardiac chambers was observed, with a particularly notable enlargement of the right atria. Echocardiography revealed severely impaired fractional shortening by P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>) with poor systolic function. Frequent ventricular thrombi were observed by P4, consistent with impaired cardiac function in these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

The presence of frequent sinus pauses was observed in all knockout animals analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>).

Sarcomeres in <italic>miR-1</italic> null cardiomyocytes showed significant disruption when compared to those from <italic>miR-1</italic> double-heterozygous littermates.

We selected this time point in order to reveal primary changes in gene expression due to the loss of <italic>miR-1</italic> and not those that may arise secondary to heart failure. Given that many direct miRNA targets are upregulated at the protein, but not transcript level, we expected that sequencing analysis of this stage would identify pathways that are dysregulated in the <italic>miR-1</italic> knockout, some of which may involve direct <italic>miR-1</italic> targets. We utilized the GREAT interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McLean et al., 2010</xref>) to evaluate the enrichment of miRNA targets within the set of genes that were upregulated in the <italic>miR-1</italic> null hearts, compared to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Myocardin (MYOCD), which is expressed predominantly in cardiac and smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2001</xref>), is one such cofactor. MYOCD is necessary and sufficient for smooth muscle differentiation in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2003</xref>) and is necessary for the differentiation and maintenance of ventricular cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoofnagle et al., 2011</xref>).

These findings suggest that MYOCD/SRF dependent gene expression is specifically upregulated in the <italic>miR-1</italic> knockout hearts.</p><p>Using qPCR to compare the expression of <italic>Myocd</italic> in <italic>miR-1</italic> double-knockout hearts and controls, we found that the expression of this critical transcription factor was increased roughly twofold upon deletion of <italic>miR-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

This splicing event results in a truncated protein, lacking the N-terminal–MEF2 interaction domain of the full-length cMYOCD. Although the functional significance of these two isoforms is not well understood, the promoters of some smooth muscle-restricted genes, such as <italic>Tagln</italic> (<italic>Sm22),</italic> are more sensitive to smMYOCD than cMYOCD, while some cardiac promoters, such as <italic>Myh6</italic> (<italic>α-Mhc),</italic> are more responsive to cMYOCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Imamura et al., 2010</xref>).

More specific upregulation of <italic>smMyocd</italic> was not evident with statistical confidence in our RNA-seq data likely due to insufficient sequencing depth to detect the small 44 bp exon 2a inclusion within the relatively low overall abundance of <italic>smMyocd</italic> transcript.</p><p>While c<italic>Myocd</italic> still represents the predominant isoform in <italic>miR-1</italic> double-knockout hearts (data not shown), subtle changes in transcription factor expression can result in dramatic changes in gene expression.

The uniform lethality of <italic>miR-1</italic> double-knockout animals, associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and abnormal heart rhythm, indicates that <italic>miR-1</italic> is required for normal cardiac contractility. At a cellular level, we found that sarcomere disruption is one feature that underlies the impaired cardiac function, and reintroduction of <italic>miR-1</italic> into ex vivo cardiomyocytes was sufficient to partially rescue this phenotype. <italic>miR-1</italic> functions to negatively regulate the smooth muscle-specific inhibitor of MLC phosphorylation, Telokin. Aberrant upregulation of Telokin and the resulting decrease in phosphorylated MLC in <italic>miR-1</italic> null hearts may contribute, in part, to the sarcomeric contractility defect. <italic>miR-1</italic> regulation of <italic>Telokin</italic> is accomplished by direct targeting of its 3′ UTR, as well as through targeting of its transcriptional regulator, <italic>Myocd</italic>. In particular, <italic>miR-1</italic> preferentially regulates <italic>smMyocd</italic>, thereby complementing the effects of <italic>miR-133</italic> to suppress the smooth muscle gene program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>miR-1</italic> is required for normal sarcomere formation and maintenance</title><p>In ex vivo cardiomyocytes, restoring <italic>miR-1</italic> expression alone was sufficient to partially rescue the sarcomeric defects of <italic>miR-1</italic> double-knockout hearts, demonstrating that the loss of <italic>miR-1</italic> plays a causative role in this phenotype, but not ruling out a contribution from decreased <italic>miR-133a</italic> expression. In this and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mishima et al., 2009</xref>), genes related to the actin cytoskeleton are highly responsive to alterations in <italic>miR-1</italic> expression. MLC phosphorylation is critical for sarcomere assembly and regulating the speed and force of contraction in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 2001</xref>). In mammals, there are multiple MLC2 isoforms, but deletion of the single cardiac zebrafish isoform results in a lack of thick filament assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rottbauer et al., 2006</xref>). At a molecular level, phosphorylation of MLC2 results in a conformational shift in the associated MHC, bringing it into closer proximity to the thin filament and increasing the probability of cross-bridge formation. Not surprisingly, in humans, <italic>MLC2</italic> mutations are associated with myopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Poetter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, decreased phosphorylation of MLC in the absence of <italic>miR-1</italic> likely plays a role in the sarcomeric disruption and cardiac dysfunction in <italic>miR-1</italic> double-knockouts.</p><p>We found that one mechanism by which <italic>miR-1</italic> normally acts to maintain p-MLC in the heart is through the repression of the usually smooth muscle-restricted protein Telokin. Telokin expression in smooth muscle is thought to maintain cells in a less contractile state, and it is interesting that the heart employs <italic>miR-1</italic> to ensure the absence of Telokin through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Although it is not possible to distinguish the contribution of transcriptional regulation of Telokin vs direct <italic>miR-1</italic> targeting of the <italic>Telokin</italic> 3′ UTR, the dramatic degree of Telokin protein upregulation compared to the more moderate <italic>Telokin</italic> mRNA increase is consistent with some degree of translational control by <italic>miR-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). How Telokin misexpression affects cardiac function has not been directly evaluated; however, ectopic expression in the myocardium has been reported in a doxorubicin induced rat model of cardiomyopathy, although the precise mechanism by which Telokin contributes to this pathology is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dudnakova et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>While the focus of this study was to explore the function of <italic>miR-1</italic> in the heart, <italic>miR-1</italic> likely plays a more subtle role in the skeletal muscle. It is worth noting that electron microscopy of P0 <italic>miR-1</italic>-null skeletal muscle showed the presence of ordered sarcomeric structures (data not shown) and neonatal mice were mobile. While we cannot rule out a more subtle skeletal muscle phenotype due to the early lethality, it is possible that the skeletal muscle specific <italic>miR-1</italic> family member, <italic>miR-206</italic>, can compensate for the loss of <italic>miR-1</italic> in this tissue. A clear understanding of the role that the <italic>miR-1</italic> family plays in the context of skeletal muscle will require the generation a skeletal muscle-specific compound deletion of <italic>miR-1-1</italic>, <italic>miR-1-2</italic> and <italic>miR-206</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><italic>miR-133a</italic> downregulation in <italic>miR-1</italic> null hearts</title><p>The marked downregulation of <italic>miR-133a</italic> in the <italic>miR-1</italic> double-knockouts is a critical consideration with respect to the interpretation of some of the phenotypes that we observed. While targeted disruption of <italic>miR-1</italic> might adversely affect transcriptional read-through of the <italic>miR-1-1/miR-133a-2</italic> locus, secondary downregulation of <italic>miR-133a</italic> expression from regulatory feedback mechanisms also appears to occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">Figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>). <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133a</italic> are dramatically upregulated during the differentiation of cardiac and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ivey et al., 2008</xref>).

Consistent with this model, the loosely organized sarcomeric morphology and the abnormal mitochondrial morphology we observed by TEM are similar to those of more immature cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hom et al., 2011</xref>). The upregulation of members of the cardiac fetal gene expression program, such as <italic>Nppa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), and even the upregulation of smooth muscle genes, which are normally expressed in embryonic cardiomyocytes, supports this paradigm. As such, the expression of <italic>miR-133a</italic>, a key developmentally regulated miRNA, may be secondarily downregulated in <italic>miR-1</italic> double-knockout mice as a result of a subtle cardiac differentiation or maturation defect, although the exact mechanism is unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133a</italic> clusters cooperate to normally repress smooth muscle gene expression in the heart</title><p>The power of miRNAs to affect biological processes is amplified by the ability of a single miRNA to regulate multiple nodes within a genetic network. <italic>Srf</italic> is a direct target of <italic>miR-133a</italic>, and its expression, as well as that of many smooth muscle target genes, is upregulated in the hearts of <italic>miR-133a</italic>-knockout animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). We found that SRF mRNA and protein expression in <italic>miR-1</italic> double-knockout hearts was unaffected, despite the partial downregulation of <italic>miR-133a</italic>. Nevertheless, some of the smooth muscle genes upregulated in <italic>miR-133a</italic> double-knockout hearts were also upregulated in the <italic>miR-1</italic> double-knockout animals <italic>(Acta2, Cald1, Csrp2, Cnn1, Tagln),</italic> while others, including <italic>Telokin, cMyocd</italic> and <italic>smMyocd</italic>, were uniquely upregulated in the <italic>miR-1</italic> double-knockouts. Our data suggest that <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133a</italic>, transcribed together from bicistronic miRNA clusters, cooperate to repress SRF-dependent smooth muscle gene expression in the heart by independently regulating SRF or its co-factor, MYOCD, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p><p>We also found that the <italic>Telokin</italic> promoter is preferentially responsive to the smMYOCD isoform, upregulated in the absence of <italic>miR-1</italic>. This is consistent with the observation that, while both MYOCD isoforms share an identical SRF-interacting domain, they are not functionally equivalent with respect to mediating the transcription of SRF target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Creemers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Imamura et al., 2010</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript describes the effect of compound deletion of <italic>miR-1-1</italic> and <italic>miR-1-2</italic>. The authors had previously published on the phenotype of <italic>miR-1-2</italic> deletion and they now show the phenotype of <italic>miR-1-1</italic> and double <italic>miR-1-1/2</italic> mutants. Complete deletion of <italic>miR-1</italic> results in death and cardiac dysfunction. The authors have uncovered an interesting mechanism to explain the phenotype. They show that <italic>miR-1</italic>-null cardiomyocytes have abnormal sarcomere organization and decreased phosphorylation of the regulatory myosin light chain-2 (MLC2). The smooth muscle restricted inhibitor of MLC2 phosphorylation, Telokin, is ectopically expressed in the myocardium, along with other smooth-muscle genes. The authors determine that the mechanism underlying <italic>miR-1</italic> repression of Telokin expression is both by direct targeting via seed sites in the 3' UTR and also by repressing the transcriptional regulator, Myocardin. These data therefore imply that <italic>miR-1</italic> functions to regulate the maintenance of the striated muscle phenotype in cardiomyocytes. This is an interesting study. However the following points need to be addressed before publication.</p><p>1) The authors claim that <italic>miR-1-1</italic> knockout mice have a comparable phenotype to the <italic>miR-1-2</italic> knockout animals and that deletion of one of the isoforms is responsible for roughly half the total amount of <italic>miR-1</italic> present in the heart. What are the targets that are responsible for the phenotype in the <italic>miR-1-1</italic> knockout mice and do they overlap with the targets that the authors previously identified to be responsible for the <italic>miR-1-2</italic> knockout phenotype? Are the <italic>miR-1</italic> targets described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> also regulated in either the <italic>miR-1-1</italic> or <italic>miR-1-2</italic> knockout mice?</p><p>2) What are the differences between the <italic>miR-1-2</italic> het/<italic>miR-1-1</italic> het and the phenotype of either the <italic>miR-1-1</italic> or <italic>1-2</italic> homozygous null?</p><p>3) <italic>miR-133a</italic> is also reduced in the <italic>miR-1-1</italic> KO based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. How much of the double <italic>miR-1</italic> mutant phenotype is due to loss of <italic>miR-133</italic>? This question is considered indirectly in a few instances but not really adequately addressed. The authors have RNA sequence data that they can use to predict <italic>miR-1</italic> (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and <italic>miR-133</italic> target genes. If, as the authors suggest, reduced <italic>miR-133a</italic> is only a minor part of the phenotype they observe then there should not be an enrichment in the upregulated genes for <italic>miR-133a</italic> seed sites. If <italic>miR-133a</italic> regulated genes are also important for the phenotype then this can be further validated and incorporated into the story.</p><p>4) If Myocardin is upregulated in the <italic>miR-1</italic> knockout mice, would one not expect to see an increase in <italic>miR-133</italic> instead of a decrease?</p><p>5) Myocardin upregulation seen on the RNAseq dataset should show the different isoforms. If so this should be included in the paper and if not then this should be explained/discussed.</p><p>6) Regarding the RNAseq dataset please comment on why there are equal numbers of up and down regulated genes – perhaps the stage that was analyzed is too late since there would be predicted to be more genes upregulated.</p><p>7) Due to the artificial nature of luciferase experiments, one could envision that Telokin is solely regulated by <italic>miR-1</italic> at the transcriptional level.

To address this comment, we utilized the GREAT interface to evaluate the enrichment of putative miRNA targets within the set of genes that were upregulated in the <italic>miR-1</italic>-null hearts compared to wild-type controls. We found that genes containing <italic>miR-1/206</italic> seed sequence complementarity were most significantly enriched in this dataset. Genes targeted by <italic>miR-495</italic>, <italic>miR-518a-2</italic>, <italic>miR-501</italic> and <italic>miR-409</italic> were also enriched, though to a lesser degree. Notably, <italic>miR-133a</italic> predicted targets were not found to be upregulated in the <italic>miR-1</italic> null hearts, providing confidence that reduced <italic>miR-133a</italic> is only a minor part of the phenotype and may not reach the threshold for functional significance. These data have been added to the Results and are presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) If Myocardin is upregulated in the</italic> miR-1 <italic>knockout mice, would one not expect to see an increase in</italic> miR-133 <italic>instead of a decrease</italic>?</p><p>If Myocardin were the only determinant of <italic>miR-133</italic> expression, then we would indeed expect to see an increase in <italic>miR-133</italic> in the <italic>miR-1</italic> knockout mice. However, transcriptional regulation of the <italic>miR-1/133</italic> loci are coordinately regulated by several transcription factors including Myocd, SRF, Mef2, Myod, MyoG and Nkx2-5. Additionally, our data show that the increase in Myocardin expression in <italic>miR-1</italic> knockout mice is primarily due to aberrant expression of the smooth muscle Myocardin isoform; thus we would not necessarily expect to see upregulation of transcription of any one striated muscle-enriched Myocardin target.</p><p><italic>5) Myocardin upregulation seen on the RNAseq dataset should show the different isoforms. If so this should be included in the paper and if not then this should be explained/discussed</italic>.</p><p>The smooth muscle isoform of Myocardin is distinguished by inclusion of Exon 2A, which is comprised of only 44 nucleotides. This fact alone makes the difference difficult to observe in an RNAseq dataset. Additionally, as a transcription factor, Myocardin is expressed at very low levels and the smooth muscle isoform comprises only a relatively small subset of the total Myocardin transcript in cardiomyocytes. Therefore, at the depth of our RNA-seq analysis, the read coverage at that Exon was limiting and precluded detection of its differential expression with any statistical confidence. We have added a sentence to the Results to address this apparent discrepancy.</p><p><italic>6) Regarding the RNAseq dataset please comment on why there are equal numbers of up and down regulated genes</italic> – <italic>perhaps the stage that was analyzed is too late since there would be predicted to be more genes upregulated</italic>.</p><p>Although miRNAs are known to be “repressors”, we would not have predicted that there would be a predominance of upregulated genes in our RNAseq dataset because 1) dysregulation of transcriptional regulators or members of signaling pathways will undoubtedly cause both upregulation and downregulation of numerous downstream genes; and 2) miRNAs often repress translation rather than promote degradation of their target mRNAs. We would, however, expect to have an enrichment of mRNAs with a <italic>miR-1</italic> binding site in the upregulated set compared to the downregulated set of genes, and this indeed was the case (see point 3). To clarify this issue, we added a sentence to the Results section stating:</p><p>“Given that many direct miRNA targets are upregulated at the protein, but not transcript level, we expected that sequencing analysis of this stage would identify pathways that are dysregulated in the <italic>miR-1</italic> knockout, some of which may involve direct <italic>miR-1</italic> targets.”</p><p><italic>7) Due to the artificial nature of luciferase experiments, one could envision that Telokin is solely regulated by miR-1 at the transcriptional level. Can the authors comment on this</italic>?</p><p>This point is certainly valid and deserving of comment in the text. We have added a sentence to the Discussion stating:</p><p>“Although it is not possible to distinguish the contribution of transcriptional regulation of Telokin vs direct <italic>miR-1</italic> targeting of the Telokin 3’ UTR, the dramatic degree of Telokin protein upregulation compared to the more moderate <italic>Telokin</italic> mRNA increase is consistent with some degree of translational control by <italic>miR-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).”</p><p><italic>8) In general, the phenotypic analysis is strong. The authors may consider showing some of the ECG data with different types of atrial arrhythmias</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and in response we have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1–figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref> showing representative ECG tracings.</p><p><italic>9) The Results section can be written more concisely with part of the text moved to the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>We have edited the Results to be more concise and moved text to the Discussion, as appropriate.</p><p><italic>10) Did the authors check to see whether there is a phenotype in the skeletal muscles of the compound miR-1 knockout mice? This is not essential for this paper, but a mention in the Discussion would be interesting</italic>.</p><p>Electron microscopy analysis of P0 <italic>miR-1</italic>-null skeletal muscle showed the presence of ordered sarcomeric structures. The newborn mice were mobile and could feed, but because of their early demise, we could not assess their muscle strength more rigorously, particularly under stress. <italic>miR-206</italic> continues to be expressed in skeletal muscle so a triple knockout of <italic>miR-1-1, miR-1-2</italic> and <italic>miR-206</italic> will be required to assess the consequences of complete loss of the <italic>miR-1/miR-206</italic> family in skeletal muscle.
