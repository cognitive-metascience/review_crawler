Exploiting the advantages of the zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) model, we showed that macrophages and microglia respond immediately upon oncogene activation in the brain. Overexpression of human AKT1 within neural cells of larval zebrafish led to a significant increase in the macrophage and microglia populations. By using a combination of transgenic and mutant zebrafish lines, we showed that this increase was caused by the infiltration of peripheral macrophages into the brain mediated via Sdf1b-Cxcr4b signaling. Intriguingly, confocal live imaging reveals highly dynamic interactions between macrophages/microglia and pre-neoplastic cells, which do not result in phagocytosis of pre-neoplastic cells. Finally, depletion of macrophages and microglia resulted in a significant reduction of oncogenic cell proliferation. Thus, macrophages and microglia show tumor promoting functions already during the earliest stages of the developing tumor microenvironment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31918.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Brain tumors can be aggressive, difficult to treat and are often incurable. Removing brain tumors by surgery can be challenging because the tumor cells infiltrate into the healthy tissue. Brain tumors grow in close physical contact with other cells, such as cells of the immune system. This includes cells called macrophages and microglia, which normally defend us against injuries and infections. However, instead of acting against the tumor as one might expect, macrophages and microglia actually support the growth of brain tumors.</p><p>It is not clear how and when during the development of a brain tumor the macrophages and microglia start helping the tumor cells to grow. Previous studies in this area have focused on these cell types found in advance brain tumors. Chia et al. have now looked at the earliest stages of tumor development, monitoring how macrophages and microglia respond to cancer cells.</p><p>To mimic human brain tumors, Chia et al. expressed a cancer-promoting version of a human protein in nerve cells of zebrafish larvae. These cells started behaving like early tumor cells. Live microscopy revealed that the tumor cells attract macrophages and microglia into their area, and that they also activate the immune cells. Biochemical experiments showed that the early tumor cells make and release a protein called Sdf1. Macrophages and microglia sense Sdf1 in the environment with a protein called Cxcr4 on their cell surfaces. When the gene for Cxcr4 was deleted in the zebrafish, the macrophages and microglia were not recruited into the developing tumors. When macrophages and microglia were depleted from the zebrafish larvae, the nerve cells with the mutant protein grew less well, supporting the idea that the immune cells enhance the development of early tumors.</p><p>A better understanding of how tumor cells and immune cells interact in the brain may help in the search for new anti-cancer drugs. Furthermore, the way in which macrophages and microglia are recruited to the tumor cells could be similar when tumors return after treatment. Future studies will test this hypothesis and, if it proves true, interfering with the macrophage and microglia response might delay the relapse of tumors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>brain tumor</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>live imaging</kwd><kwd>tumor microenvironment</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Establishment Award, C49916/A17494</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sieger</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pre-neoplastic cells in the brain release SDF1, which mediates an immediate infiltration of macrophages that differentiate into microglia-like cells and promote proliferation of pre-neoplastic cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microglia are the resident macrophages of the brain (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kettenmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casano and Peri, 2015</xref>]). Microglia are derived from primitive macrophages that invade the brain during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ginhoux et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schulz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herbomel et al., 2001</xref>). Due to the neuronal environment, they finally differentiate to microglia and build up a resident population that is almost evenly dispersed throughout the central nervous system. Microglia fulfil a tremendous repertoire of functions in the brain. In addition to their classical immune functions, numerous studies have described roles for microglia in brain development, vessel patterning, synaptic pruning, the regulation of neuronal activity and even the influence of certain animal behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casano and Peri, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite the variety of beneficial functions in the brain, microglia can also act detrimentally during certain pathologies. Brain tumors represent probably the most severe example of harmful microglial functions. Microglia and infiltrating macrophages have been shown to infiltrate high-grade gliomas and can account for up to 30% of the tumoral mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Graeber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badie and Schartner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li and Graeber, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coniglio and Segall, 2013</xref>). Instead of anti-tumoural activity, they display pro-tumoural functions and promote tumor growth. Macrophages and microglia have been shown to promote tumor cell proliferation and invasiveness, to modify the extracellular matrix, to induce angiogenesis and to induce an immunosuppressive environment promoting tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Markovic et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Komohara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pyonteck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hambardzumyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ellert-Miklaszewska et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, these pro-tumoural functions seem to be independent of the tumor grade, as they have also been described for low-grade gliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daginakatte and Gutmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daginakatte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simmons et al., 2011</xref>). However, the earliest responses of macrophages and microglia to cancerous cells in the brain have not been addressed so far. It is not known when macrophages and microglia respond to oncogenic transformations in the brain and which signals are involved. Furthermore, we do not know how these initial responses physically appear. Are aberrant oncogenic cells initially removed by macrophages and microglia? Do pro-tumoural activities of macrophages and microglia develop only at later tumor stages? Or is the behavior of macrophages and microglia already co-opted during the early oncogenic stages in a way that they promote tumor growth? Understanding these early events is crucial as it is tempting to speculate that similar responses of macrophages and microglia occur during tumor recurrence. Thus, identifying the underlying mechanisms is a first step toward the development of new therapeutic strategies that target macrophages and microglia within brain tumors.</p><p>To address the early responses of macrophages and microglia to oncogenic alterations in the brain, we made use of the larval zebrafish model. We and others have already demonstrated that the zebrafish is a powerful tool to study microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peri and NÃ¼sslein-Volhard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sieger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oosterhof et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Svahn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shiau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shen et al., 2016</xref>). Besides the genetic and optical advantages of the zebrafish larvae, the small size of the zebrafish brain allows imaging of the entire microglial network and its responses to pathological events. Furthermore, recent work has highlighted the suitability of the larval zebrafish model to investigate brain tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ju et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mayrhofer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ju et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kitambi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Geiger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lally et al., 2007</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hamilton et al. (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Welker et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we combined these advantages to study the responses of macrophages and microglia to early pre-neoplastic cells in the brain. By overexpression of human dominant active AKT1 in neural cells, we induced abnormal cellular growth and morphology, increased proliferation and early differentiation, mimicking the earliest stages of brain tumor growth. Importantly, we detected an immediate response of macrophages and microglia to these oncogenic events in the brain. This included a significant increase in macrophage and microglia cell numbers, which was caused by the infiltration of peripheral macrophages and mediated by Sdf1b released from oncogenic cells to activate the CXCR4b receptor on macrophages. Furthermore, macrophages and microglia showed highly dynamic cellular interactions with oncogenic cells. Finally, by reducing the number of macrophages and microglia, we showed that these cells actively promote proliferation of the pre-neoplastic cells in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of human AKT1 induces cellular transformation in the larval zebrafish brain</title><p>To investigate the response of macrophages and microglia to early pre-neoplastic cells, we overexpressed a dominant active version of the human AKT1 gene in the larval zebrafish brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ramaswamy et al., 1999</xref>). AKT1 is a downstream serine-threonine kinase in the RTK/PTEN/PI3K pathway which is highly activated in the majority of human glioblastomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McLendon and Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008</xref>). Human AKT1 has been reported previously to induce malignant transformations in various neural cell types in zebrafish leading to glioma growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mayrhofer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jung et al., 2013</xref>). To achieve expression in the nervous system, we expressed AKT1 under the neural-specific beta tubulin (NBT) promoter using a dominant active version of the LexPR transcriptional activator system (ÎLexPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Emelyanov and Parinov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mazaheri et al., 2014</xref>). The NBT promoter is active in neural cells throughout zebrafish development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peri and NÃ¼sslein-Volhard, 2008</xref>). We either injected a lexOP:<italic>AKT1</italic>-lexOP:tagRFP construct into embryos of NBT:ÎLexPR:lexOP-pA (NBT:ÎLexPR) transgenic fish or co-injected an NBT:âlexPR-lexOP-pA driver plasmid together with a lexOP:<italic>AKT1</italic>-lexOP:tagRFP construct to achieve AKT1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In both scenarios, the NBT promoter drives expression of the transcriptional activator LexPR in neural cells which activates transcription of genes downstream the lexOP promoter sequence. These injections gave rise to mosaic expression of the oncogene within the larval nervous system (visualised through RFP expression of the construct) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). During the course of development, AKT1 expression-induced morphological transformations resulting in larger cells with an abnormal morphology which was not observed upon injection of a lexOP:tagRFP control construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Immunohistochemistry using an anti-AKT1 antibody revealed strong expression of the human AKT1 protein upon lexOP:<italic>AKT</italic>1-lexOP:tagRFP construct injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To test for differentiation in AKT1 overexpressing cells, we performed immunohistochemistry for the differentiation marker Synaptophysin, which has been shown to be expressed in CNS tumors with neuronal differentiation as well as in neuroendocrine tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wiedenmann et al., 1986</xref>). Indeed, expression of AKT1 led to an early onset of expression of Synaptophysin, which was not observed in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To test for differentiation toward the glial lineage in AKT1-positive cells we stained for the glial cell marker GFAP. GFAP was neither detected in AKT1-expressing cells nor in RFP control cells at 8 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Intriguingly, oncogenic alterations have been previously shown to induce dedifferentiation of neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedmann-Morvinski et al., 2012</xref>), thus we wondered if AKT1 overexpression is capable of inducing dedifferentiation in zebrafish neural cells. Interestingly, immunohistochemistry for the stem cell marker Sox2 revealed a subset of AKT1 cells which were positive for Sox2 while none of the RFP control cells appeared to be positive for Sox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, the number of proliferating AKT1-positive cells was significantly increased compared to control RFP cells (assessed by immunostaining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Finally, the oncogene expression led to significant impairment in survival with only 35.6% (62/174 larvae) surviving until 30 days post-fertilization (dpf) upon AKT1 overexpression compared to 90.8% (118/130 larvae) in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Examination of 20 AKT1 expressing fish at 1 month of age showed persistent expression of the RFP-tag in the brain, with variable mosaicism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâH</xref>). Some of the RFP expressing cells showed neuronal features, including RFP-labeled axons and dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), while 1/3 of the brains showed large clones of RFP-expressing cells, which grew deeply in the brain parenchyma, apparently without disrupting the brain architecture. Immunostaining of these areas with a panel of antisera (PCNA, AKT1, GFAP and Synaptophysin) showed disrupted cell architecture, with increased mitotic figures, as well as positive staining for AKT1, GFAP and Synaptophysin, suggesting abnormal growth and differentiation, suggestive of brain tumors with mixed neuronal and glial components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1IâN</xref>). The heterogeneous population of cells detected within these tumors is most probably a result of the early dedifferentiation events that we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This is in line with previous observations in rodent models, showing that dedifferentiated cells are capable of generating a NSC or progenitor state which gives rise to heterogeneous populations observed in mature tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedmann-Morvinski et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31918.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Human AKT1 induces transformation in the larval zebrafish brain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) To achieve expression in neural cells under the NBT promoter, the NBT:âLexPR-lexOP-pA zebrafish line was used.

Interestingly, at this early time point we observed a significant increase in microglia numbers in AKT1-positive brains when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of AKT1 impacted on microglial morphology. Under normal physiological conditions, microglia show a highly ramified phenotype with several fine processes that are constantly extended and retracted to survey their environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nimmerjahn et al., 2005</xref>). In response to a pathological insult in the brain, the microglia retract their processes and assume an amoeboid morphology which reflects their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karperien et al., 2013</xref>). This change in morphology leads to a change in the ratio of the microglia cell surface to microglia cell volume, which can be used as a read out for their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gyoneva et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Aiâiii</xref>). Based on these morphological criteria, we analyzed the microglia in AKT1 overexpressing brains and compared to control brains at 8 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>).

Injection of lexOP:<italic>AKT1</italic>-lexOP:tagRFP or lexOP:tagRFP constructs into oocytes of double transgenic mpeg1:EGFP/NBT:ÎLexPR fish allowed us to follow microglial responses to oncogenic cells or control cells in high temporal and spatial resolution. In control embryos, microglia showed the typical ramified morphology, and cell surface contacts between microglia and control RFP cells were only occasionally observed and of short durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, nÂ =Â 7 samples analyzed). In line with our previous observations based on 4C4 immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the density of microglia within AKT1-expressing brains was high and most microglial cells showed an amoeboid morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, nÂ =Â 9 samples analyzed). Interestingly, microglia were observed to stay within close vicinity to AKT1 positive cells throughout the duration of the experiment and most microglial cells were in direct surface contact with the oncogenic cells. These surface contacts were long lasting and consisted of different types. Microglia were observed to flatten their surfaces against the surfaces of AKT1-positive cells and then moving their surfaces around the surfaces of AKT1 cells for hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, arrowheads, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Other microglial cells showed interactions with several AKT1-positive cells by constantly expanding and retracting their processes upon contact with surfaces of AKT1 positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, arrows, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Importantly, many of these interactions were observed for several hours without any disruption. Thus, based on the persistence of these interactions it is unlikely that these were random contacts simply enforced by the high density of microglial and AKT1-positive cells. To address this further, we injected lower amounts of the lexOP:<italic>AKT1</italic>-lexOP:tagRFP construct into oocytes of double transgenic mpeg1:EGFP/NBT:ÎLexPR fish and screened for fish with lower numbers and isolated AKT1-positive cells.

Interestingly, we did not detect a difference in the number of PCNA positive microglia when comparing AKT1-positive brains to control brains (not shown). Thus, we speculated that the presence of pre-neoplastic cells in the brain might cause an infiltration of peripheral macrophages, which then differentiate into 4C4-positive microglia-like cells.

Within this population of L-plastin<sup>+</sup> cells, the majority of cells were positive for 4C4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bii</xref>). As we did not detect proliferation of resident microglia, we hypothesized that infiltrated macrophages differentiated into microglia-like cells, leading to the higher numbers of 4C4-positive cells in AKT1-positive brains. If this hypothesis was true, then we should be able to detect an earlier time point when macrophages have just entered the brain but not differentiated to 4C4-positive cells yet. To test this, we performed L-plastin and 4C4 immunostainings at 3 dpf in AKT1-positive brains. Importantly, at 3 dpf we detected a 4.5-fold increase in the number of L-plastin<sup>+</sup>/4C4<sup>-</sup> cells in AKT1 positive brains compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ci</xref>). However, numbers for 4C4-positive microglia were similar to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Cii</xref>).

As numbers of 4C4<sup>+</sup> cells were only increased at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bii</xref>) we conclude that these infiltrated macrophages differentiated into microglia like (4C4<sup>+</sup>) cells over time.

Several elegant studies have shown that macrophages and microglia infiltrate brain tumors and promote their growth (for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hambardzumyan et al., 2016</xref>)). However, so far it was unclear when myeloid cells first respond to oncogenic events in the brain. We made use of the larval zebrafish model to address the earliest stages of tumor induction due to activation of oncogenes. By overexpressing a dominant active version of the human <italic>AKT1</italic> gene, we induced cellular alterations in the larval zebrafish brain. These were reflected in abnormal cellular morphology, increased proliferation and an early onset of Synaptophysin expression. Intriguingly, we detected an immediate response of macrophages and microglia to AKT1-induced cellular alterations. By using a combination of mutant and transgenic zebrafish lines, as well as immunohistochemistry for macrophages and microglia, we showed an immediate increase in the population of macrophage and microglia cells. This increase was the result of infiltrating macrophages that differentiated into microglia-like cells as observed by expression of the 4C4 antigen. These results are in line with recent data from rodent models investigating the contribution of macrophages and microglia to the myeloid cell population within gliomas. Based on multiple models of murine brain malignancy and genetic lineage tracing, Bowman et al. showed that infiltrating macrophages are abundant in primary and metastatic brain tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowman et al., 2016</xref>). A further study using genetically engineered mouse models to distinguish monocytes/macrophages from microglia showed that 85% of the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) within the glioma were infiltrated monocytes/macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the authors concluded that infiltrating monocytes transitioned to macrophages and microglia-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). The increased number of 4C4 positive cells detected in our model might reflect these microglia-like cells. This is further supported by our live imaging experiments showing that infiltrating macrophages start expressing <italic>p2ry12</italic>, which has been shown to be microglia specific across different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crotti and Ransohoff, 2016</xref>). However, further markers will be required to test if these cells are microglia-like or fully differentiated microglial cells.</p><p>Interestingly, while the CCL2/CCR2 signaling axis seems to be the main attractant for monocytes at the later stages of glioma growth, we show that Sdf1b/Cxcr4b signaling is responsible for macrophage infiltration during the initial stages of oncogene activation in the brain. Importantly, a role for SDF1/CXCR4 signaling in macrophage attraction has been described before in rodent models of breast cancer and tumor relapse after chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hughes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boimel et al., 2012</xref>). Our data show that the pre-neoplastic AKT1 cells produce Sdf1b, which is in line with previous studies showing that AKT1 is involved in activating the expression of SDF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Furue et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conley-LaComb et al., 2013</xref>). Other studies revealed an AKT-mediated induction of the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) and Sp1-binding sites were shown to be functional within the human SDF1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">GÃ³mez-Villafuertes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pore et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">GarcÃ­a-Moruja et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, AKT1-induced Sdf1b expression might be mediated via Sp1.</p><p>Furthermore, we show that Sdf1b produced by the pre-neoplastic cells acts specifically on macrophages and microglia but is not required in an autocrine fashion during these early stages. By using a zebrafish mutant for <italic>cxcr4b,</italic> we showed that Cxcr4b signaling is required for macrophage infiltration upon AKT1 expression in the brain. Only the specific rescue of Cxcr4b in macrophages and microglia led to increased microglial numbers in the mutant background while a specific rescue in oncogenic cells did not alter the phenotype. Importantly, we also detected a significant decrease in the number of proliferating AKT1 cells in the <italic>cxcr4b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant background, which could not be rescued by Cxcr4b expression in these cells. Thus, Sdf1b/Cxcr4b signaling is not required for proliferation of AKT1-expressing cells in an autocrine fashion during initial stages of oncogenic activation. This might highlight another difference between the early and late stages of tumor growth, as autocrine SDF1/CXCR4 signaling has been shown to be involved in proliferation of various glioma cell lines (for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gagliardi et al., 2014</xref>)).</p><p>Intriguingly, rescuing Cxcr4b expression in macrophages and microglia in the <italic>cxcr4b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant background led to a significant increase in proliferation of AKT1-positive cells, suggesting a role for microglia in promoting proliferation of pre-neoplastic cells. To further address this, we depleted macrophages and microglia independently of Cxcr4b using the immunosuppressant Dexamethasone, the specific CSF-1R inhibitor Ki20227 and the zebrafish <italic>irf8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant. Importantly, we observed a significant decrease in the number of proliferating AKT1 cells upon macrophage and microglia depletion. Thus, macrophages and microglia promote proliferation of pre-neoplastic cells in the brain. Microglia have been shown to release stress-inducible protein 1 (STI1) for example, which increased proliferation of glioma cells in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho da Fonseca et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, co-culture studies showed that release of TGF-Î² by microglia-stimulated glioma growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wesolowska et al., 2008</xref>). Whether the same signals are released by microglia to promote proliferation during early stages of transformation needs to be addressed in future studies. Importantly, the fact that microglia promote the growth of pre-neoplastic cells rather than inhibiting their growth is further supported by the live imaging experiments conducted in this study. As macrophages and microglia are professional phagocytes, they are able to phagocytose cells that are detrimental to the body. However, within the time series acquired to monitor the behavior of macrophages/microglia toward AKT1-positive cells, we did not observe phagocytosis events. Macrophages/microglia infiltrated areas with high numbers of oncogenic cells and showed continuous interactions with these cells. Interestingly, similar observations were made in rodent and zebrafish live imaging models showing direct cellular interactions between microglia and glioma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Resende, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hamilton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayerl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ricard et al., 2016</xref>). Our study highlights that signals stimulating these cellular interactions are produced early upon activation of an oncogene and seem to persist to later stages of tumor growth. However, neither the identity of these signals nor the impact of these interactions on tumor cells is known yet. As microglia have been shown to directly interact with highly active neurons with increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2012</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels might be increased in AKT1-positive cells resulting in ATP/ADP release to promote the observed interactions with microglia. Identification of the signals mediating these interactions is of high priority now to address the functional significance of these cellular contacts.</p><p>In summary, we show for the first time that macrophage and microglia are activated during the earliest stages of oncogene activation in the brain and develop their pro-tumoural activity immediately by promoting proliferation of pre-neoplastic cells. It is tempting to speculate that similar interactions occur during tumor recurrence, thus inhibiting the underlying signals might offer additional therapeutic options.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

They argue that this is due to an infiltration of primitive macrophages into the brain after AKT activation, and that this is mediated by an sdf1b/cxcr4b axis. They extend this argument to suggest that these microglial cells are pro-tumorigenic, as has been previously demonstrated in murine models of glioma. The data to indicate that AKT1 activation leads to an early increase in microglial cells is the most convincing. There are several issues that could improve this manuscript:</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The early effects of NBT-AKT1</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, the authors argue that AKT1 activation gives rise to a mixed neuronal/glial pre-neoplastic tumor. Yet the promoter they used is putatively a neuronal driver, making it unclear to me why the glial population is increased as well. Where are these cells arising from? Along these lines, there is no quantification of the neuronal vs. glial populations to know how important each of these populations are. Are these glial populations important for the microglial effects as well? Finally, the panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> are very difficult to understand, and need to be labeled much more explicitly as to what each panel represents (i.e. what is L and what is M, etc.).</p><p>2) The effects of AKT1 on microglial activation</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, it is very difficult to discern what is morphologically different in the AKT1 overexpressing cells compared to controls. The quantification seems to indicate activation phenotypes, but to a non-expert in this morphology this would be difficult to understand. The method for morphology-based assessment of the activated state of microglia is not specified and needs to be quantified explicitly. A much higher resolution image of one or 2 cells, with clear delineation of what was scored in panel 2C would be more useful.</p><p>Along the same lines, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref> the images seem consistent with the idea that the microglial/neuronal cells stay in contact with each other, but it seems just as possible that there are simply more microglial cells in general, thus less room for them to move around. Are the increased interactions between microglia/macrophages and Akt-1 expressing neural cells due to increased numbers/size of the Akt-1 expressing cells (just more chance of &quot;bumping&quot; into each other) or is there truly a functional relationship with Cxcr4-Sdf1b interactions? How do the authors quantify these effects of persistence? What do they propose is the importance of such persistence?</p><p>3) The recruitment of primitive macrophages into the brain</p><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is somewhat confusing and not that convincing for recruitment versus differentiation. First, because of the curvature of the zebrafish brain, some areas of the maximally projected picture must include zones outside of the brain parenchyma. The area that correspond to parenchyma only should be delimited. Next, they propose that the first cells are recruited L-plastin<sup>+</sup>/4C4<sup>-</sup> primitive macrophages, which then eventually differentiate into L-plastin<sup>+</sup>/4C4<sup>+</sup> microglia. But this type of analysis would require a time course showing that these newly arrived cells come first, and then differentiate into the 4C4<sup>+</sup> population, and I cannot see what type of time course was done. It seems like all the staining was done at 8dpf, so how can one argue that the cells are first recruited from the periphery and then differentiate in situ. Is there a transgenic marker for the peripheral primitive macrophages which would allow for time-lapse imaging to show that these cells are indeed recruited into the brain after AKT1 activation?</p><p>Finally, an alternative explanation for the reduced infiltration of macrophages in the <italic>cxcr4b</italic> mutant could be that these fish possess fewer peripheral macrophages than siblings. Can you assess their population to exclude this possibility?</p><p>4) The role of microglial cells in proliferation of AKT1 positive cells</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, the authors indicate that CXCR4b might be necessary for proliferation of the AKT1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). To then delineate whether this was through the microglia or not, they perform macrophage versus neuronal rescue experiments, which is a nice way of getting at the question. Confusingly, however, the authors state &quot;â¦the specific rescue of Cxcr4b in macrophages and microglia led to increased albeit not significantly, proliferation rates of AKT1 positive cells&quot;. This statement seems to indicate that the authors feel that the effect of Cxcr4b on the AKT1 positive cells is mediated by macrophages, but don't provide evidence this is the case and in fact do not report the control versus macrophage rescue data (only the macrophage rescue at 35.3+-2.83%) with a p=1. Is this because the rescue was mosaic so you don't expect rescue of this effect?</p><p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> to shows that the macrophages/microglia are required for AKT1<sup>+</sup> tumor proliferation, despite the fact that the CXCR4b data seems to argue against this. In these experiments, the authors state that AMD3100 showed reduced proliferation of AKT1 cells (from 48 to 24%, i.e. a 50% reduction). They then state that control cells also showed a &quot;slightly reduced proliferation&quot;, but the numbers they report go from 13.6% to 6.8%, i.e. also about a 50% decrease. In essence the effect of AMD3100 is not really different in the control versus AKT1 cells. Likewise, both the dexamethasone and Ki20227 data alone do not really demonstrate whether this reduction of AKT1<sup>+</sup> proliferation is via the microglia/macrophages either, since it could be a more direct effect on the tumor cells themselves. A clearer explanation of these effects on proliferation would be helpful.</p><p>5) The Akt-Sdf1 axis</p><p>Akt sits at the nexus of many signaling pathways â can the authors speculate on how its activation modulates Sdf1 expression in the neural cell?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31918.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The early effects of NBT-AKT1</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, the authors argue that AKT1 activation gives rise to a mixed neuronal/glial pre-neoplastic tumor.

However, the glial component (tested via GFAP immunostaining) develops only at later time points and is not present at the early time points when the microglia response is detected. We provide new data in the revised version of the manuscript showing that at 8 dpf the pre-neoplastic cells are negative for GFAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As we detect a prominent microglial response at this time point, we conclude that the glial populations are not required for the microglial effects observed. Furthermore, we provide new data showing that at 8 dpf a subset of the pre-neoplastic AKT1 cells were positive for the stem cell marker Sox2, while none of the neural control cells appeared to be positive for Sox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This is suggestive of cellular dedifferentiation caused by oncogene activation. This is a phenomenon that was described a few years ago in a rodent glioma model (Friedmann-Morvisnki et al., 2012). Friedmann-Morvisnki and colleagues showed that oncogenic alterations can induce dedifferentiation of mature neurons and astrocytes. These dedifferentiated cells generate a NSC or progenitor state which then gives rise to the heterogeneous populations in brain tumors at later stages.</p><p>Thus, we assume that we observed a similar phenomenon in our model where AKT1 induces dedifferentiation of neural cells (reflected in Sox2 activation) and these cells give rise to the heterogeneous cell population within tumors at 30 dpf. We have added this explanation to the Results now (subsection âExpression of human AKT1 induces cellular transformation in the larval zebrafish brainâ).</p><p>We have rearranged <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> and provide improved labeling to allow an easier understanding of the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The effects of AKT1 on microglial activation</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, it is very difficult to discern what is morphologically different in the AKT1 overexpressing cells compared to controls. The quantification seems to indicate activation phenotypes, but to a non-expert in this morphology this would be difficult to understand. The method for morphology-based assessment of the activated state of microglia is not specified and needs to be quantified explicitly. A much higher resolution image of one or 2 cells, with clear delineation of what was scored in panel 2C would be more useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not providing a detailed description of the morphology-based assessment of the microglial activation state in the manuscript. To assess and quantify microglial morphology we used the surface rendering tool in Imaris (Bitplane). This allows segmentation of individual cells in 3D. Based on this we calculated the ratio of the cellular surface and cellular volume of individual cells. Ramified (non-activated) microglia show a relatively small cellular volume and thus a surface/volume ratio of ~1. In contrast, amoeboid microglia show a surface/volume ratio of ~0.6. As there is a continuum of transition steps from ramified to amoeboid, we set a threshold and considered all cells with a ratio smaller 0.8 as activated. This approach has been used and published by others in the past (Gyoneva et al., 2014). In the revised version, we provide higher resolution images of the different morphologies of microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, we provide segmented images generated with Imaris (Bitplane) showing the surface application on representative cells. We have also included a description of the quantifications in the Materials and methods and provide a reference to the previously published work from Gyoneva et al., using this method (subsection âImage analysis and quantificationsâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along the same lines, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref> the images seem consistent with the idea that the microglial/neuronal cells stay in contact with each other, but it seems just as possible that there are simply more microglial cells in general, thus less room for them to move around. Are the increased interactions between microglia/macrophages and Akt-1 expressing neural cells due to increased numbers/size of the Akt-1 expressing cells (just more chance of &quot;bumping&quot; into each other) or is there truly a functional relationship with Cxcr4-Sdf1b interactions? How do the authors quantify these effects of persistence? What do they propose is the importance of such persistence?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point and we agree that the higher density of cells could enforce interactions by chance. However, many of these direct cellular surface interactions were observed for several hours without any interruptions, thus it is unlikely that these were random contacts simply enforced by the high density of microglial and AKT1 positive cells. To address this further, we provide a new data set in the revised version. Here, we injected lower amounts of the lexOP:<italic>AKT1</italic>-lexOP:tagRFP construct into oocytes of double transgenic mpeg1:EGFP/NBT:ÎLexPR fish and screened for fish with lower numbers and isolated AKT1 positive cells. In these larvae microglia were frequently seen to interact with AKT1 positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4, n</xref> = 6 samples analyzed) (subsection âMicroglia show highly dynamic interactions with AKT1 positive cellsâ). These interactions lasted for several hours and were not seen with control cells (not shown). Thus, we conclude that microglia are pro-actively interacting with AKT1 positive cells. Importantly, direct cellular surface interactions between microglia and tumor cells were observed by others in recently published rodent glioma models as well (Resende et al. 2016; Bayerl et al. 2016; Ricard et al. 2016). Furthermore, we observed direct cellular interaction between microglia and human glioblastoma cells in a recently published xenograft model (Hamilton et al., 2016). We discuss these findings in the Discussion of the manuscript (second to last paragraph). However, the underlying mechanisms stimulating these interactions have not been addressed yet and the functional importance of these cellular contacts is not known. In the revised version of the manuscript we speculate on a putative role for Ca<sup>2+</sup>/ATP signaling as microglia have been shown to directly interact with highly active neurons with increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (Li et al., 2012). Future studies will be needed to identify the underlying mechanism and to address a putative functional impact of these interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The recruitment of primitive macrophages into the brain</p><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is somewhat confusing and not that convincing for recruitment versus differentiation. First, because of the curvature of the zebrafish brain, some areas of the maximally projected picture must include zones outside of the brain parenchyma. The area that correspond to parenchyma only should be delimited. Next, they propose that the first cells are recruited L-plastin<sup>+</sup>/4C4<sup>-</sup> primitive macrophages, which then eventually differentiate into L-plastin<sup>+</sup>/4C4<sup>+</sup> microglia. But this type of analysis would require a time course showing that these newly arrived cells come first, and then differentiate into the 4C4<sup>+</sup> population, and I cannot see what type of time course was done. It seems like all the staining was done at 8dpf, so how can one argue that the cells are first recruited from the periphery and then differentiate in situ. Is there a transgenic marker for the peripheral primitive macrophages which would allow for time-lapse imaging to show that these cells are indeed recruited into the brain after AKT1 activation?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the presentation of the maximum intensity projected images was slightly confusing. As stated in the Materials and methods (subsection âImage analysis and quantificationsâ), only cells within the brain parenchyma were counted. We have demarcated the outline of the brain parenchyma in the revised version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to illustrate this and specified this within the text (subsection âMacrophage infiltration in response to AKT1 induced transformation leads to increased numbers of 4C4 microgliaâ, first paragraph) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> legend.</p><p>We are grateful for the suggestion to provide a time course to identify a time point when L-plastin<sup>+</sup>/4C4<sup>-</sup> primitive macrophages have been recruited to the brain but have not differentiated into L-plastin<sup>+</sup>/4C4<sup>+</sup> microglia yet. We have analyzed infiltration and differentiation at 3 dpf and added this new data set to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Indeed, at 3 dpf we detect a significant increase of L-plastin<sup>+</sup>/4C4<sup>-</sup> primitive macrophages in AKT1 positive brains compared to controls (Figure 4Ci). Intriguingly, we do not detect an increase in L-plastin<sup>+</sup>/4C4<sup>+</sup> microglia at this time point (Figure 4Cii). Thus, these newly infiltrated cells have not differentiated. As we detect an increase in L-plastin<sup>+</sup>/4C4<sup>+</sup> microglia at later time points in the absence of proliferation, these new results further support our conclusion that newly infiltrated L-plastin<sup>+</sup>/4C4<sup>-</sup> macrophages differentiate into L-plastin<sup>+</sup>/4C4<sup>+</sup> microglia like cells over time.</p><p>To address this point even further we performed live imaging experiments upon AKT1 overexpression in a double transgenic model and overexpressed AKT1 in p2ry12:p2ry12-GFP/mpeg1:mCherry zebrafish. In these zebrafish, all macrophages (including microglia) are positive for mCherry and microglia can be identified based on their additional P2ry12-GFP expression. Intriguingly, we detected p2ry12-GFP<sup>-</sup>/mCherry<sup>+</sup> macrophages at the dorsal periphery of AKT1 positive brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>) at 5.5 dpf. Eventually, some of these macrophages infiltrated the brain parenchyma and started expressing GFP over time, showing their differentiation towards a p2ry12-GFP<sup>+</sup>/mCherry<sup>+</sup> microglia-like cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>, arrowheads, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>).</p><p>In summary, these two new data sets strongly support our conclusion that peripheral macrophages are recruited to the brain and differentiate towards microglia-like cells upon AKT1 overexpression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, an alternative explanation for the reduced infiltration of macrophages in the cxcr4b mutant could be that these fish possess fewer peripheral macrophages than siblings. Can you assess their population to exclude this possibility?</p></disp-quote><p>Cxcr4b mutant zebrafish do neither show a general deficit in the number of peripheral macrophages nor in their function. We provide new data in the revised version of the manuscript to compare peripheral macrophages in wt and <italic>cxcr4b</italic> mutant zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>, subsection âCxcr4b signaling is required for the increase in macrophage and microglial numbersâ, first paragraph) and donât detect differences. Furthermore, microglia numbers were similar in <italic>cxcr4b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>controls and wildtype controls, showing that Cxcr4b signaling is not needed for the normal developmental population of the brain by microglia (WT Control: 85.4 Â± 2.46, n = 35; <italic>cxcr4b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>Control: 79.8 Â± 2.57, n = 45, <italic>p</italic> = 0.103 (n.s.); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Finally, we also refer to a recent publication showing that macrophages in <italic>cxcr4b<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>zebrafish show normal recruitment and function upon mycobacterial infections (Torraca et al., 2017). Thus, we conclude that the reduced infiltration of macrophages in the cxcr4b mutant upon AKT1 overexpression is due to the inability of the macrophages to respond to Sdf1b signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The role of microglial cells in proliferation of AKT1 positive cells</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, the authors indicate that CXCR4b might be necessary for proliferation of the AKT1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). To then delineate whether this was through the microglia or not, they perform macrophage versus neuronal rescue experiments, which is a nice way of getting at the question. Confusingly, however, the authors state &quot;â¦the specific rescue of Cxcr4b in macrophages and microglia led to increased albeit not significantly, proliferation rates of AKT1 positive cells&quot;. This statement seems to indicate that the authors feel that the effect of Cxcr4b on the AKT1 positive cells is mediated by macrophages, but don't provide evidence this is the case and in fact do not report the control versus macrophage rescue data (only the macrophage rescue at 35.3+-2.83%) with a p=1. Is this because the rescue was mosaic so you don't expect rescue of this effect?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for highlighting this point. Indeed, we concluded that Cxcr4b is specifically required in macrophages and microglia and that these cells promote proliferation of AKT1<sup>+</sup> cells. As these rescue experiments are based on mosaic expression of Cxcr4b the number of samples analyzed in the previous version of the manuscript was not high enough to achieve statistically significant results. We have repeated these rescue experiments in the meantime and provide higher sample numbers for the final analysis. Importantly, the final data set confirms our conclusion and shows that the specific rescue of Cxcr4b in macrophages and microglia leads to a significant increase in the proliferation rates of AKT1 positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> to shows that the macrophages/microglia are required for AKT1<sup>+</sup> tumor proliferation, despite the fact that the CXCR4b data seems to argue against this. In these experiments, the authors state that AMD3100 showed reduced proliferation of AKT1 cells (from 48 to 24%, i.e. a 50% reduction). They then state that control cells also showed a &quot;slightly reduced proliferation&quot;, but the numbers they report go from 13.6% to 6.8%, i.e. also about a 50% decrease. In essence the effect of AMD3100 is not really different in the control versus AKT1 cells. Likewise, both the dexamethasone and Ki20227 data alone do not really demonstrate whether this reduction of AKT1<sup>+</sup> proliferation is via the microglia/macrophages either, since it could be a more direct effect on the tumor cells themselves. A clearer explanation of these effects on proliferation would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the presentation of the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> was not optimal and did not fully support our conclusions. We have reviewed this paragraph and figure again and have re-arranged based on the following points. Firstly, we acknowledge that AMD3100 is not an optimal tool to interfere with Cxcr4b signaling in zebrafish. Our own data in the previous version of the manuscript showed a discrepancy between AMD3100 treatment and the Cxcr4b mutant zebrafish. While the <italic>cxcr4b</italic> mutant zebrafish did not show a reduced proliferation rate of control cells compared to wildtype zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), we detected a decrease in the proliferation rate of control cells upon AMD3100 treatment. Thus, we concluded that the decrease upon AMD3100 treatment must be caused by Cxcr4b independent effects of AMD3100. Furthermore, we spoke to other zebrafish researchers including experts in the Cxcr4b field, who confirmed that they were not able to phenocopy the zebrafish <italic>cxcr4b</italic> mutant with AMD3100. In conclusion, we realized that the use of AMD3100 did not provide any new insights compared to the <italic>cxcr4b</italic> mutant data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, F</xref>) but rather blurred the clear data generated with the mutant. Thus, we decided to remove the AMD3100 data set from the manuscript.</p><p>Instead we performed a Cxcr4b independent depletion of macrophages and microglia to address their impact on the proliferation of AKT1<sup>+</sup> cells. Treatment with Dexamethasone and Ki20227 lead to a robust depletion of macrophages and microglia (Figure 8Ai). Furthermore, both compounds significantly decreased the proliferation rate of AKT1<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure 8Aii). As the treatment with Dexamethasone, Ki20227 and DMSO were done in parallel in the same experiment we present the results together in one graph now and performed a one-way ANOVA with Bonferroniâs post-hoc tests to analyze statistical significance.</p><p>Finally, to address the impact of macrophages and microglia on the proliferation of AKT1<sup>+</sup> cells without any pharmacological interference we made use of the zebrafish <italic>irf8<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutant. The <italic>irf8</italic> null mutant (<italic>irf8<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) zebrafish was characterized to lack macrophages up to around 6 dpf, with recovery from 7 dpf while microglia were absent in the brain until 31 dpf (Shiau et al., 2015). In line with published observations we did not detect 4C4 positive microglial cells in <italic>irf8<sup>-/-</sup></italic>larvae at 8dpf (Figure 8Bi). Interestingly, upon AKT1 overexpression in <italic>irf8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> larvae we detected a small population of 4C4 positive cells (Figure 8Bi). These cells were probably derived from the population of macrophages that recover in <italic>irf8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> larvae from 7 dpf, which then infiltrated into the brain due to AKT1 overexpression and differentiated into 4C4<sup>+</sup> cells. Importantly, the number of 4C4 positive cells was 80% lower in <italic>irf8<sup>-/-</sup></italic>larvae compared to wildtype larvae upon AKT1 overexpression (Figure 8Bi), which allowed us to address the impact on the proliferation of AKT1 positive cells. While proliferation rates of neural cells remained constant in <italic>irf8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> controls (Figure 8Bii), we detected an almost 60% reduction in proliferation of AKT1 positive cells compared to AKT1 positive cells in wildtype larvae (Figure 8Bii).</p><p>In summary, the combination of the pharmacological data and the <italic>irf8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant data allows us to conclude that macrophages and microglia promote proliferation of AKT1 positive cells in the larval zebrafish brain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The Akt-Sdf1 axis</p><p>Akt sits at the nexus of many signaling pathways â can the authors speculate on how its activation modulates Sdf1 expression in the neural cell?</p></disp-quote><p>We provide a speculation on how AKT1 modulates Sdf1 expression in the Discussion of the revised manuscript (second paragraph). In brief, previous studies revealed an activation of specificity protein 1 (Sp1) by AKT and Sp1 binding sites have been shown to be functional within the Sdf1 promoter (GÃ³mez-Villafuertes et al. 2015; Pore et al. 2004; GarcÃ­a-Moruja et al. 2005). Thus, Sdf1 expression might be modulated via Sp1 activated by AKT1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
