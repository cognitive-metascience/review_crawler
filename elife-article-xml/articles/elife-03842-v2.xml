elusive. In this study, we investigate the uncharacterized gene <italic>Flattop (Fltp)</italic> that is transcriptionally activated during PCP acquisition in ciliated tissues. <italic>Fltp</italic> knock-out mice show BB docking and ciliogenesis defects in multiciliated lung cells. Furthermore, Fltp is necessary for kinocilium positioning in monociliated inner ear hair cells. In these cells, the core PCP molecule Dishevelled 2, the BB/spindle positioning protein Dlg3, and Fltp localize directly adjacent to the apical plasma membrane, physically interact and surround the BB at the interface of the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton. Dlg3 and Fltp knock-outs suggest that both cooperatively translate PCP cues for BB positioning in the inner ear. Taken together, the identification of novel BB/spindle positioning components as potential mediators of PCP signaling might have broader implications for other cell types, ciliary disease, and asymmetric cell division.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03842.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03842.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03842.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Epithelial tissues are sheets of cells that line the surface of many parts of the body, including the airways and the inner ear. Small hair-like structures called cilia can be found on the top surface of many epithelial cells and are arranged in a precise, ordered pattern. Such patterning ensures that cilia can work in a co-ordinated manner, for example by beating together to help clearing mucus from airways.</p><p>Cilia grow out from ‘basal bodies’ and, like many other important structures in a cell, these basal bodies must be oriented along the correct side of an epithelial tissue. This is achieved by ‘planar cell polarity signaling’, which makes sure that the structures inside a cell are correctly aligned, and ensures that polarized cells themselves are correctly oriented across the epithelial tissue. Disruption of this signaling can result in developmental defects.</p><p>Some proteins help to establish polarity in a cell by altering the cell's cytoskeleton—the structural support and transport network of the cell. A ‘core’ complex of proteins then coordinates how the cells are arranged throughout the epithelial tissue. Although many of the proteins involved in each of these roles are known, how they interact with each other to establish planar cell polarity remains poorly understood.</p><p>Now, Gegg et al. report that, in mice, a protein called Flattop functions to position basal bodies—and thus cilia—by working together with another protein called Dlg3. In mice that cannot produce Flattop, cilia formation is defective in the lung, and the cilia in the inner ear are positioned incorrectly. Gegg et al. found that in the inner ear, Flattop and Dlg3 physically interact with each other and two other proteins—including one of the core proteins involved in planar cell polarity. This protein complex then surrounds the basal bodies at the point where they connect to the cell's cytoskeleton.</p><p>Future challenges will be to clarify how the protein complex anchors to the cytoskeleton and how it interacts with other core planar cell polarity proteins in the cells of the inner ear. It will also be important to see whether this protein complex fulfills a similar role in other ciliated epithelial tissues.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03842.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03842.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>basal body</kwd><kwd>spindle positioning</kwd><kwd>planar cell polarity</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>Flattop</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emmy-Noether Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lickert</surname><given-names>Heiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC CiliaryDisease</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lickert</surname><given-names>Heiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In cell types that acquire planar cell polarity, the protein Flattop regulates basal body docking and positioning.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The conserved PCP signaling pathway regulates the orientation of cells and organelles within the plane of an epithelium and is crucially important for developmental patterning as well as organ morphogenesis, homeostasis, and physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Seifert and Mlodzik, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang and Nathans, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peng and Axelrod, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wallingford, 2012</xref>). Pioneering studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Xenopus</italic> have revealed that global, non-cell autonomous, and cell intrinsic signaling mechanisms act in concert to establish tissue polarity. Core PCP molecules including Van Gogh-like (Vangl1-2), Cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor (Celsr1-3), Frizzled (Fzd3, 6), Dishevelled (Dvl1-3), and Prickle (Pk1-2) are localized asymmetrically at the cell cortex to provide polarity information for morphogenesis and oriented cell division. Significant progress has been made in understanding the asymmetric core PCP localization in vertebrates but it is less clear how this regulates cytoskeletal rearrangements that drive morphogenesis via tissue specific downstream effector molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wallingford, 2012</xref>). Thus, the identification of novel PCP effectors that indicate pathway activity and mediate signaling and/or morphogenesis will be the key to unravel the function of this molecular pathway in development and disease.</p><p>Besides the Rho family of GTPases, which are also implicated in apical–basal (A–B) polarity establishment, the best-studied PCP effector molecules are Inturned (Intu) and Fuzzy (Fuz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Collier and Gubb, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gray et al., 2009</xref>). Both directly regulate ciliogenesis by mediating the assembly of the apical actin cytoskeleton but are not required for the polarized accumulation of core PCP components. The core PCP molecule Dvl2 localizes near the base of cilia and functions together with Intu and Rho GTPases to dock and polarize BBs for cilia formation and directed ciliary beating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2008</xref>). BBs are amplified deep in the cytoplasm of multiciliated cells (MCCs) and apical plasma membrane (PM) transport depends on Dvl and the vesicle trafficking protein Sec8. Up-to-date it is not understood how core PCP molecules physically connect to effector molecules, how this leads to asymmetric membrane polarization and cytoskeletal rearrangements, and if these mechanisms are conserved among different cell types in various organs and during evolution.</p><p>First functional evidence for PCP in lung development came from the analysis of Celsr1, Vangl2, and Scribble (Scrib) mutant mice, which showed defects in branching morphogenesis and narrowed lung airways due to cytoskeletal and junctional defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yates et al., 2010</xref>). Multiciliated lung cells first arise at embryonic day (E) 14.0 in the trachea as well as in the main bronchi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jain et al., 2010</xref>). Similar to the mucociliary epithelium in frog, differentiation depends on BB amplification, docking, and orientation that allows the formation of hundreds of motile cilia. The differentiation of multiciliated lung cells and the dynamics of the underlying cell biological processes can be modeled in air liquid interface (ALI) cultures of primary mouse tracheal epithelial cells (mTECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">You et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vladar and Stearns, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vladar et al., 2012</xref>). Asymmetric localization of core PCP molecules at apical junctions regulates the orientation of motile cilia along the longitudinal tissue axis for directed beating and mucus clearing. This likely interdepends on non-cell autonomous cues and intrinsic polarized microtubule (MT) network topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vladar et al., 2012</xref>). Currently, PCP effector molecules that link core molecules, BBs, polarized MTs, and the actin cytoskeleton have not been identified. A better understanding of these molecular processes could provide further insight into a multitude of ciliary dysfunction syndromes of the lung and other organs.</p><p>The best-established model to study PCP in vertebrates is the organ of Corti in the inner ear (IE). Mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) are arranged in one inner (IHC) and three outer HC (OHC) rows. The lateral polarization of the V-shaped actin-based stereocilia bundles on HCs strongly depends on ciliogenesis and PCP for proper sound perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Montcouquiol et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jones and Chen, 2008</xref>). Core PCP molecules like Celsr1, Dvl2/3, Fz3/6, and Vangl2 are localized to distinct apical membrane compartments of HCs and supporting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ezan and Montcouquiol, 2013</xref>). This differential localization seems not sufficient to instruct morphogenesis of actin-rich hair bundles in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jones and Chen, 2008</xref>). Instead, it depends on opposing localization of evolutionarily conserved spindle positioning and apical polarity proteins that serve as a blueprint for kinocilium migration and bundle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ezan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tarchini et al., 2013</xref>). It remains unclear, how core PCP molecules couple to spindle positioning complexes and the actin cytoskeleton to orchestrate morphogenesis.</p><p>Spindle positioning proteins as well as the actin and MT cytoskeleton act together with cues from the cell cortex, such as apical junctions and polarity proteins to direct spindle positioning in mammalian epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kunda and Baum, 2009</xref>). In addition to Inscuteable (mInsc in mammals), Partner of Inscuteable (mPins/LGN in mammals) and the G-protein coupled receptor Gα<sub>I</sub> and other evolutionary conserved proteins, such as the basolateral determinants and septate junction localized proteins Dlg and Scrib, regulate A–B spindle positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knoblich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Siller and Doe, 2008</xref>). In mammals, five <italic>Dlgs</italic> have been identified and we have recently shown that their function has diverged during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Van Campenhout et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, Dlg3 is the only family member that is involved in apical transport and required for tight junction (TJ) consolidation. Taken together, the function of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dlg in spindle positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bellaiche et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergstralh et al., 2013</xref>) and mammalian Dlg3 in PCP establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Van Campenhout et al., 2011</xref>), suggested to us that Dlg3 could mediate PCP-dependent BB positioning.</p><p>In this study, we identified <italic>Fltp</italic> as a gene expressed in regions of active PCP signaling including the node, the MCCs of the lung, and the sensory hair cells of the inner ear. Knock-out analysis revealed that Fltp is required for BB docking and cilia formation in the lung as well as BB and kinocilium positioning in the IE. Using ALI cultures, we show that <italic>Fltp</italic> expression is induced while BBs are amplified and docked at the apical PM in differentiating MCCs. Fltp localizes next to BBs, and MT plus ends in the apical actin network and is required for efficient BB docking and cilia formation. We provide evidence that Dlg3 functions together with Fltp to position BBs and kinocilia in the inner ear. Dlg3 and Fltp physically interact with each other, the core PCP protein Dvl2, and the pericentriolar matrix protein γ-Tubulin, suggesting that we have identified a novel BB positioning complex in the inner ear. Together, our data implicate that Fltp is a novel regulator important for BB docking and positioning in mono- and multiciliated cell types that acquire PCP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of <italic>Fltp</italic> as a Foxa2 target gene</title><p>We discovered <italic>Fltp</italic> as a functionally non-annotated gene (<italic>1700009P17RiK</italic>) in a screen to identify Foxa2 target genes involved in polarity establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burtscher and Lickert, 2009</xref>) and expressed in monociliated node cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tamplin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kinzel et al., 2010</xref>).

Switching mTEC culture to ALI conditions induces a differentiation process of lung progenitor cells towards a MCC phenotype. During differentiation the progenitor cells pass through different maturation stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>): Monociliated lung progenitor cells (stage I) start centrosome/BB amplification followed by BB transport and docking (stage II–III) and subsequent cilia formation (stage IV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vladar et al., 2012</xref>). In these cultures, Fltp-driven H2B-Venus reporter activity is activated at the transition from stage I to stage II when centrosomes/BBs are amplified and docked in heterozygous and homozygous Fltp ALI cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). <italic>Fltp-H2B-Venus</italic> expression increases during maturation until cells are terminally differentiated. This correlates with active PCP signaling and initial asymmetric core component localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vladar et al., 2012</xref>). Subcellular co-localization studies further revealed that Fltp is localized to the apical, but not sub-apical actin cytoskeleton and fills the gaps in the actin network from where MT-based cilia project (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–Cʹʹʹ,E</xref>). Moreover, Fltp co-localizes with newly synthesized MT plus ends that are labeled with anti-EB1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Together with the direct adjacent localization of Fltp next to the pericentriolar matrix stained by γ-Tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), these data suggest that Fltp connects BBs and ciliary MT plus ends to the cortical actin cytoskeleton.

Due to PCP defects in the IE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Van Campenhout et al., 2011</xref>), we hypothesized that the mammalian scaffold protein Dlg3 might be a cortical adaptor for PCP-mediated BB positioning. Due to the lack of good antibodies and tools, we generated a transgenic mouse line that constitutively expresses a Venus fluorescent protein fused to the N-terminus of Dlg3 (Dlg3-Venus) (see Supplemental ‘Materials and methods’). Next, we examined the subcellular localization of the Dlg3-Venus fusion protein in relation to BB, kinocilium, stereocilia bundle, core PCP molecules, and TJs in cochlea HCs using LSM and three-dimensional reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–Bʹ,F–H</xref>). Dlg3 specifically localizes in a crescent shape to the bare zone around the BB and co-localizes with the core PCP component Dvl2 at lateral TJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–Bʹ,G</xref>), the area where mPins/LGN, mInsc, and Gα<sub>i</sub> are localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ezan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tarchini et al., 2013</xref>).

Interestingly, Fltp localizes at the interface between Dlg3 and the actin-based stereocilia bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–Eʹ</xref>), further suggesting that Fltp might be an adaptor protein linking spindle/BB positioning proteins to the apical actin cortex.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03842.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Fltp is located at the interface of apical actin and Dlg3 in IE hair cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>, <bold>C</bold>–<bold>D′</bold>, <bold>F</bold>–<bold>H</bold>) Single section LSM of outer HCs of an <italic>Fltp</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup><italic>; Dlg3-Venus</italic> animal at E18.5 reveals that Dlg3-Venus is located at the lateral membrane and at the medial membrane (or the lateral membrane of the supporting cell) of IE HCs (<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>).

When compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–Dʹ,J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the lateral crescent of Dlg3 in Fltp mutants is disturbed and BBs are not correctly positioned in the middle of the apical Dlg3 crescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–Hʹ,J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>), implicating that Fltp binds to Dlg3 to position BBs, kinocilia, and stereocilia bundles. If Dlg3 and Fltp cooperate to position BBs, one would predict that these proteins physically interact. Dlg3 contains a central SH3 domain which could bind to the SH3 binding or PRR domain of Fltp. We tested this by co-immunoprecipitation experiments of Streptavidin-Flag (SF)-tagged Dlg3 variants and Fltp-myc variants from serum starved and ciliated HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). These experiments suggest a physical interaction of Fltp with Dlg3, which requires the highly conserved N-terminal SH3 binding domain of Fltp, but not the SH3 domain of Dlg3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). As Dvl2 localizes directly adjacent to Dlg3 and Fltp in the inner ear, we next examined the association of endogenous Dvl2 and γ-Tubulin with overexpressed SF full-length Fltp and SF-Dlg3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).

First, the <italic>Fltp</italic> gene and reporter are expressed in several tissues known to depend on active PCP signalling, such as the node, ependymal cells, floor plate, lung, eye, and IE. Second, <italic>Fltp</italic> expression kinetic correlates with dynamic PCP acquisition, terminal differentiation, and cellular morphogenesis in the lung and the IE. Third, the double knock-out of <italic>Fltp</italic> and the core PCP gene <italic>Celsr1</italic> show a more severe PCP phenotype than both single mutants, raising the possibility that both genes act in the same pathway, which needs further confirmation. If this is the case, then Fltp seems to be a downstream effector molecule in the PCP pathway, as it is not required for PCP establishment, but rather for cell intrinsic PCP transduction leading to cytoskeletal rearrangements. This is supported by the fact that phenotypes observed for the PCP effectors Intu and Fuz in the mucociliary epithelium of the frog and Fltp in the murine lung are strikingly similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2008</xref>). Additionally, spindle positioning rather than core PCP mutant phenotypes mirrors the Fltp mutant phenotype in the IE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ezan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tarchini et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, Fltp is localized at the interface of spindle positioning complexes that capture MT plus ends and connect to the PM and the apical actin cytoskeleton. Loss of Fltp leads to failure in BB docking and positioning most probably through disconnection of the BB, MT, and actin cytoskeleton in the mammalian lung and IE. Although the mechanisms of Fltp action in these two tissues might differ, a common theme seems that Fltp acts at the interface of the MT and actin cytoskeleton for BB docking and positioning, which we discuss in the following sections.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Fltp regulates BB docking and cilia formation in the lung</title><p>PCP is best studied in the mammalian IE, but is also apparent in MCCs of the lung and mucociliary epithelium of the frog skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wallingford, 2012</xref>). In both terminally differentiated cell types, core PCP molecules are asymmetrically localized at the apical PM and translate long-range PCP signals into cell intrinsic cytoskeletal changes that coordinate BB docking and positioning as well as cilia formation in mono- and multiciliated cells. In MCCs of the frog skin the PCP effector proteins Intu and Fuz have been shown to control ciliogenesis and together with Dvl control apical docking and planar polarization of BBs by coordinating apical actin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2008</xref>). It was further suggested that the PCP effector Fuz and Dvl2 control membrane trafficking and vesicle fusion at the BB essential for ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gray et al., 2009</xref>). Studying Fltp function in the ALI primary cell culture system allowed us to link the onset of <italic>Fltp</italic> expression to the time of BB amplification, docking, and cilia formation. In MCCs, we have shown a close association of Fltp with the apical actin–MT cytoskeleton and BBs. Fltp localization at the apical surface is reminiscent of Dvl, Sec8, and Intu localization in frog multiciliated mucociliary epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2006</xref>). Lack of Fltp function leads to BB docking defects and reduced number of cilia formed at the apical PM in ALI cultures and in vivo. Fltp physically interacts with Dlg3 and the core PCP molecule Dvl2, which regulates BB transport together with proteins of the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2008</xref>). We have previously shown that Dlg3 is the only Dlg family member that is monoubiquitinated by Nedd4 and Nedd4-like E3 ligases. This is required for apical PM transport mediated by the motor protein Dynein IC and Sec8, a component of the exocyst complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Van Campenhout et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, taken together, these findings suggest that Fltp cooperates with Dlg and Dvl family members to regulate apical BB transport and docking of BBs in multiciliated tissues. However, there is likely not a strong parallel between BB docking in MCCs and BB positioning in the IE, a topic which needs to be addressed in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Fltp and the spindle positioning protein Dlg3 act in concert to position BBs in the IE</title><p>To better understand the function of Fltp, we further focused our analysis on the IE as a well-described model for PCP. It was previously shown that core PCP molecules localize to distinct apical membrane compartments, but differential localization seems not sufficient to instruct morphogenesis of actin-rich hair bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jones and Chen, 2008</xref>). Instead, BB as well as kinocilium formation and positioning is essential for hair bundle morphogenesis, which is regulated by opposing localization of spindle positioning proteins and apical polarity proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ezan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tarchini et al., 2013</xref>). mInsc, mPins/LGN, and Gα<sub>i</sub> localize in a microvilli-free zone (bare zone) at the lateral side, whereas the apical polarity complex consisting of Partitioning defective 3 and 6 (Par3, 6) as well as atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) localize at the medial side. Surprisingly, localization of spindle proteins was not affected in the classical PCP mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ezan et al., 2013</xref>), which either suggests redundancy in the PCP pathway or alternative mechanisms that position spindle proteins and BBs in the IE. We provide evidence that Fltp and Dlg3 position BBs and stereocilia bundles in the IE in addition to Gα<sub>i</sub>, mPins/LGN, and mInsc, suggesting that we have identified important new molecules for BB/spindle positioning in mammals. Dlg3 and Fltp together surround the BB and anchor this organelle asymmetrically to the apical cortex likely via Dvl2 and TJ-associated proteins on the one side and attachment to the apical actin cytoskeleton on the other side. We have recently shown that the scaffold protein Dlg3 is important for apical polarity and TJ formation by interaction with a number of TJ-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Van Campenhout et al., 2011</xref>). In the fruit fly, Dlg, Mushroom body defective (Mud), and Pins are absolutely necessary for spindle positioning in various cell types in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bellaiche et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergstralh et al., 2013</xref>). The co-localization of Gα<sub>i</sub>, mPins/LGN and mInsc, and Dlg3-Venus in the bare zone further suggests that also in mammals these proteins act in concert to position BBs and spindles. Furthermore, the basolateral polarity complex consisting of Dlg, Lgl, and Scrib is known to establish membrane domains by reciprocal inhibitory interactions with the apical aPKC-Par3/6 polarity complex and to regulate A–B spindle positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knoblich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Siller and Doe, 2008</xref>). These reciprocal inhibitory interactions of the apical and basolateral polarity complex at the apical surface further stabilized the positioning of BBs at the apical PM. But how spindle positioning complexes are linked to the actin cytoskeleton is still a mystery in mammals. In yeast, MT plus ends are captured by Kar9a, which binds directly to a type V myosin motor bound to actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Korinek et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2000</xref>). As described above, Fltp functions very likely as a molecular adaptor protein localized between the interface of spindle positioning complexes and the apical actin cytoskeleton. Loss of Fltp function leads to disconnection of MT-based kinocilium and actin-based stereocilia bundles. Together, this suggests that Fltp couples BB/spindle positioning proteins to core PCP molecules and to the actin cytoskeleton in the IE. Further studies have to be conducted to precisely clarify how this complex is anchored to the cytoskeleton and core PCP components.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title><italic>Fltp</italic> function in development and disease</title><p>Knock-out analysis of <italic>Fltp</italic> revealed an important function in the terminal differentiation of multiciliated lung cells and the morphogenesis of stereocilia bundles on IE HCs. This emphasizes that PCP acquisition and remodeling of the actin- and MT-based cytoskeleton is crucially important for the maturation and function of terminally differentiated cell-types in tissues and organs. Consequently, mutations of both core PCP and effector molecules lead to a wide spectrum of ciliary dysfunction syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gerdes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wallingford, 2012</xref>). For instance, in primary cilia dyskinesia, lack of directed mucociliary clearance and recurrent respiratory tract infections can eventually progress to permanent lung damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Storm van's Gravesande and Omran, 2005</xref>). The <italic>Fltp</italic> knock-out mouse shows BB docking and cilia formation defects in MCCs of the lung as well as terminal airway constrictions. This suggests that human <italic>FLTP</italic> might be mutated in lung disease, a hypothesis that we are currently testing with our clinical partners. Moreover, mutation of Fltp leads to a stereocilia morphogenesis defect in the cochlea of the IE, which suggests that mutation of <italic>FLTP</italic> can cause hearing loss in human. Mutations in human <italic>DLG3</italic> are associated with X-linked mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lickert and Van Campenhout, 2012</xref>) and we have previously identified that the scaffolding protein Dlg3 regulates apical polarity and TJ formation as well as PCP in the IE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Van Campenhout et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, we have shown that Fltp and Dlg3 cooperate in BB positioning in the IE. As <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dlg acts as a tumor suppressor regulating proliferation and asymmetric cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>), it is well possible that the Fltp–Dlg3 complex is involved in similar cellular processes in mammals. Indeed, we have evidence that Fltp regulates cell division of intestinal stem cells (Böttcher and Lickert, in preparation), suggesting that we identified a novel molecule with brought implication for ciliary disease and stem cell-mediated tissue homeostasis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal data</title><p>Mouse keeping was done at the central facilities at HMGU in accordance with the German animal welfare legislation and acknowledged guidelines of the Society of Laboratory Animals (GV-SOLAS) and of the Federation of Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA).

To clear the embryos, we incubated 2× in xylol for 5–10 min (depending on the thickness of the specimen). For tissue penetration of the paraffin, the specimen was left in paraffin at 65°C ON. On the next day, they were transferred into fresh paraffin and incubated at 65°C ON. The embryos were orientated and embedded into a mold. The cooled down paraffin blocks were mounted onto a grid and sectioned on a microtome. The sections were mounted on glass slides, dried ON at 37°C, dewaxed in xylol (2 × 15 min), fixed with mounting medium, and covered with a cover slip. After one night at 4°C, the sections were ready for microscopical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Histological staining of paraffin sections using Nuclear Fast Red (NFR)</title><p>First, paraffin sections on glass slides were dewaxed twice for 15 min in xylene.

H<sub>2</sub>O. Then, a dehydration step followed within an afferent alcohol row (70–100%, see above). Finally, the slides were incubated twice in xylene for 15–30 min and once in Roti-Histol for 15–30 min. After incubation in Roti-Histol, slides were put on a paper towel, sprinkled with a few drops mounting medium, and covered with a cover slip.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical significance was calculated using Prism (GraphPad Software).

I am including the three reviews (lightly edited) at the end of this letter, as there are many specific and useful suggestions in them that will not be repeated in the summary here.</p><p>All of the reviewers were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work. Overall, the experiments appear to be carefully executed. However, all three reviewers believe that the data is over-interpreted in many places, and that this detracts from the manuscript. In particular, the evidence for a direct connection with PCP is circumstantial. There are also significant questions related to the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3 and 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We would like to encourage you to resubmit a revised manuscript that addresses the specific issues raised in the reviews below. With respect to the writing, I can appreciate that in the current publishing environment one feels compelled to impress editors and reviewers, which leads to an almost irresistible temptation to over-state one's own conclusions. <italic>eLife</italic> is trying to restore some balance to the world of scientific writing; we welcome self-critical comments and we believe that such comments actually enhance the reader's ability to judge the science fairly.</p><p>I will offer two examples of scientific writing that I think illustrates the preceding point.

Since the work is based on studies of mutant mice and cells, it is very strong and I like the study very much.</p><p>I regret that several results are a bit overstated and/or not fully supported by the morphological illustrations provided. The main point is to tone down some overstated claims at several places in the text. As it is written, the paper presents a fully demonstrated model that is supported by the data but not yet demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt. The last part of the Introduction is a good example of what I mean. The whole discussion is unfortunately hyperbolic along the same lines.</p><p>I understand that formal proof of the model cannot be provided using reagents available and therefore the authors should not be required to do additional experiments.</p><p>On the other hand, they should pay attention and significantly edit their text to make it less speculative and more factual. I also have some remarks about figures.</p><p>1) Introduction:</p><p>In MGI, five Dlg genes are mentioned, each has been inactivated separately and Dlg1 is clearly the most critical, with neonatal lethality; intriguingly, Dlg3 knock-outs are reported to be viable and fertile.</p><p>2) Results:</p><p>a) Authors mention the presence of two P-rich domains in Fltp. P-rich regions are not detected using “conserved domain” (Entrez website), and the concentration of P in the boxed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> does not seem that high.

The text and legend do not allow the reader to understand <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>. Similarly, it is not very clear that Fltp localizes along the length of cilia (B,B'). This being said, the defective docking of BB in culture is very convincing, more than what is described in vivo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. How can this be explained?</p><p>e) Inner ear, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. From 5C, I have the impression that PCP in IHC is even more disturbed than in OHC, and seems to be confirmed in the quantification N. However, Fltp is said to be expressed on in OHC. Does this mean that Fltp has some non-cell autonomous effects, or that low expression is present in IHC?</p><p>f) For quantification, authors mention ANOVA; it is probably acceptable for relatively small angles, less than 40<sup>o</sup> in this series of data. Still, authors should be aware that comparison of angles is usually done using circular statistics, because arithmetic mean of angles is not meaningful.</p><p>g) The addition of phenotypes in Celsr1+Fltp mutants is interesting and worth showing. On the other hand, I do not think that this indicates that both proteins act in the same PCP pathway; they could just as well act in two parallel pathways. I think the text should be modified to take this into account. I also do not understand why authors looked at the localization of Vangl1 rather than Vangl2; which has a stronger action in PCP - for which good Abs are available commercially.</p><p>3) Last part of Results and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>The subtitle and the following text are too strong. The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are really informative, yet colocalisation does indicate but no prove interaction. The change in localization upon inactivation of Fltp, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, provide a stronger argument for interaction than simple colocalisation, and the Co-IP in HEK cells is also a strong indication. As authors know and although their data are strong, interactions should be demonstrated using techniques such as IP in vivo, or FRET and others. I agree that this is undoable given the reagents available. However, given this intrinsic limitation, strong claims are not acceptable and should be significantly tuned down.</p><p>4) As mentioned above, the Discussion, although scholarly and informative, is somewhat hyperbolic and should be more nuanced. I would also like to have the opinion of the authors on why the effect on cilia docking is present only in some cells, whereas Fltp seems to be a unique gene without paralog.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors present data showing that Fltp has a function in localizing basal bodies in multiciliated airway cells and in cochlear hair cells. Fltp is expressed in many ciliated cells where the PCP pathway functions. In fltp mutant MCCs, BBs fail to dock, and in mutant cochlea, BB/kinocilia are mispositioned and stereocilia bundles are misoriented and distorted. Fltp localizes apically in both cell types. The authors also describe, using a mutant, a function for Dlg3 in orienting BB/kinocilia. Finally, they show that transfected Fltp and Dlg3 co-IP, and that gamma tubulin and Dvl2 are also pulled down. These data could perhaps make a reasonable story that Fltp is involved in BB positioning in several cell types. However, the manuscript is written in such a way to substantially over-interpret their data, and a number of important holes in the data exist. As an appropriately described piece of work, it would be an editorial decision as to whether the results merit publication in this journal.</p><p>The overreaching interpretation of the results is evident with regard to several points. The authors devote considerable discussion to how Fltp participates in linking tubulin and actin in these processes, based only on the localization data and the phenotype, without any ultrastructure or biochemistry to support these conclusions. This discussion should all be deleted from the main text, and relegated to speculation in the Discussion.</p><p>A considerable omission is the failure to examine a potential role for Dlg3 in MCCs. Is there any MCC phenotype in the mutant? If not, how should one interpret the docking defect in comparison to the hair cell phenotype? This highlights the problem that there is not a strong parallel between BB docking in MCCs and BB positioning in hair cells.</p><p>A third substantial and related problem is that the model is very unclear. The cartoon suggests that Fltp localizes to stereocilia, but the binding data suggest it should be found with gamma tubulin at the BBs. Finally, the authors discuss function at the TJs. Since MCCs don't have the equivalent of stereocilia, where is the commonality? In these cells, Fltp is seen in the apical meshwork, but the resolution is too low to make specific conclusions about exactly where. We know too little to extract any inference about commonality of Fltp function from the two cell types.</p><p>There is one very troubling piece of data that must be explained, and unsatisfactory resolution will invalidate the MCC findings. The IMARIS resonstructions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> HI show mostly docked vs many undocked BBs, but it is normally easy to find cells in day 4 cultures with undocked BBs, as cells continue to differentiate for some time. Care must be taken that these are representative. Therefore the quantitative data are essential. The MTEC data from day2 and day4 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref> are at best, extremely confusing, and at worst, suggest the possibility that the results should be discarded. First, it is unclear what the authors are measuring. The number of BBs? The number or percent of docked BBs? Number of cells with docked BBs? This must be made clear. Furthermore, in this highly reproducible system, at ALI+2 days, there are only very few cells with multiple cilia, yet the authors' data seem to suggest that 80% of the cells are multiciliated (to completion??). In the best wildtype cultures, 80% of cells are never seen to become multiciliated. Furthermore, by day 4, the number has declined to 60%? Why? At this stage, the numbers should still be increasing. In light of this, how are we to interpret the mutant results? We need a description of what is being measured, as well as images to corroborate.</p><p>Another problem is with the “genetic interaction” between fltp and celsr1. Genetic interaction is typically shown between heterozygotes that have no phenotype on their own, or between one het with no phenotype and a homozygote with a weak phenotype. The authors make double homozygous mutants and show an enhanced phenotype. Yet each homozygote has a phenotype of its own, and therefore the result could simply be an additive phenotype. The result therefore DOES NOT show a genetic interaction and provides NO EVIDENCE that Fltp is in the PCP pathway. The result is equally consistent with distinct pathways converging on a shared output. Numerous other statements describing Fltp function in PCP signaling are also misleading. For example, describing Dvl2 function at BBs as a PCP function is not valid. Indeed, the MCC phenotype is not a PCP phenotype at all, and the hair cell phenotype impacts PCP, but is presumably quite downstream. Taken together, it is not reasonable to describe the results as being effectors of PCP. This is another big example of interpretation not correctly reflecting the findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper reports the discovery of a novel gene that acts as an essential downstream effector of PCP function in ciliated cells. Overall the paper is quite interesting and if correct would provide a good addition to the literature in this area, though there are several issue that must be resolved before publication can be considered. Moreover, many conclusions are overstated, and unnecessarily so, since the story is a good one even without the overreach.</p><p>The paper identified flattop in a screen for targets of foxa2, and this new gene is expressed in ciliated cells. Mutant mice display defects in the airway cilia as well as defects in kinocilium polarity in the cochlea, and these are traced to defects in basal body positioning. In the cochlea, fltp shows genetic interaction with the core PCP protein celsr1. The authors then show that the tight junction protein Dlg3 localizes to an interesting pattern in the cochlear hair cells and that fltp and dlg3 functionally and physically interact to control basal body position.</p><p>1) Many references are made to “Detailed” subcellular co-localization studies. But these data are not at all clear in their current form. In particular the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are over-interpreted. It is stated that Fltp “specifically” colocalizes with newly synthesized MT plus-ends, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows much green where there is no red and much of the converse as well.</p><p>2) The claim is made in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> that fltp is localized to the apical but not the sub-apical actin in multiciliated cells, yet <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows only a single x/y image and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> shows Zo1, but not actin. How is this claim justifiable from these data?</p><p>3) The authors need to comment on the possible role for fltp in basal body amplification. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the most obvious phenotype in the mutants may not be BB docking, but the reduction in BB numbers. This issue is a big one because recent work on cyclin O from Kinter and Omran shows that BB docking and amplification may be linked.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03842.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1) Introduction: <italic>In MGI, five Dlg genes are mentioned, each has been inactivated separately and Dlg1 is clearly the most critical, with neonatal lethality; intriguingly, Dlg3 knock-outs are reported to be viable and fertile</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer is right and we corrected this in the manuscript.

The data shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>are really informative, yet colocalisation does indicate but no prove interaction. The change in localization upon inactivation of Fltp, illustrated in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref><italic>, provide a stronger argument for interaction than simple colocalisation, and the Co-IP in HEK cells is also a strong indication. As authors know and although their data are strong, interactions should be demonstrated using techniques such as IP in vivo, or FRET and others. I agree that this is undoable given the reagents available. However, given this intrinsic limitation, strong claims are not acceptable and should be significantly tuned down</italic>.</p><p>We changed the subtitle and tuned down the statements accordingly.</p><p>4) As mentioned above, the Discussion, although scholarly and informative, is somewhat hyperbolic and should be more nuanced.</p><p>We partially rewrote the Discussion to tune down the overstated conclusions.</p><p><italic>I would also like to have the opinion of the authors on why the effect on cilia docking is present only in some cells, whereas Fltp seems to be a unique gene without paralog</italic>.</p><p>This is a very interesting question for which we have no definitive answer. The most likely explanation is the presence of other genes with similar functions, such as the PCP effector molecules Intu and Fuz (see Discussion).</p><p>We have initially concentrated our analysis on the lung and inner ear. Closer inspection of other cell types might reveal additional phenotypes, e.g. multiciliated ependymal cells were not investigated. In very rare cases (&lt;1%) we observed an exencephalus phenotype indicative of a PCP-related phenotype. In Figure 1–figure supplement 3B Mendelian ration shows a slight underrepresentation of Fltp 129 KO animals, which we note in the figure legend. It is highly speculative, but left-right defects due to inappropriate ciliary position at the node might cause congenital heart defects. We will investigate this possibility in future experiments.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>The authors present data showing that Fltp has a function in localizing basal bodies in multiciliated airway cells and in cochlear hair cells. Fltp is expressed in many ciliated cells where the PCP pathway functions. In fltp mutant MCCs, BBs fail to dock, and in mutant cochlea, BB/kinocilia are mispositioned and stereocilia bundles are misoriented and distorted. Fltp localizes apically in both cell types. The authors also describe, using a mutant, a function for Dlg3 in orienting BB/kinocilia. Finally, they show that transfected Fltp and Dlg3 co-IP, and that gamma tubulin and Dvl2 are also pulled down. These data could perhaps make a reasonable story that Fltp is involved in BB positioning in several cell types. However, the manuscript is written in such a way to substantially over-interpret their data, and a number of important holes in the data exist. As an appropriately described piece of work, it would be an editorial decision as to whether the results merit publication in this journal</italic>.</p><p><italic>The overreaching interpretation of the results is evident with regard to several points. The authors devote considerable discussion to how Fltp participates in linking tubulin and actin in these processes, based only on the localization data and the phenotype, without any ultrastructure or biochemistry to support these conclusions. This discussion should all be deleted from the main text, and relegated to speculation in the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer and toned down or deleted over-statements.</p><p><italic>A considerable omission is the failure to examine a potential role for Dlg3 in MCCs. Is there any MCC phenotype in the mutant? If not, how should one interpret the docking defect in comparison to the hair cell phenotype? This highlights the problem that there is not a strong parallel between BB docking in MCCs and BB positioning in hair cells</italic>.</p><p>The aim of our study was not to compare BB docking in MCCs and BB/cilia positioning in inner ear hair cells, but rather to provide a description of the Fltp phenotype in the lung and inner ear. We focused more on cellular and molecular mechanism of Fltp function in the inner ear, as it is a well-described PCP model system (as stated in the new discussion). Due to the Fltp phenotype in BB positioning, we focused in this system on Dlg3, as Drosophila Dlg is a well-known spindle positioning protein.</p><p>For this reviewer we examined a potential role of Dlg3 in MCCs. We analysed lungs of Dlg3 KO animals and could not detect an obvious difference in BB docking or cilia formation between KOs and WT animals (n=2). This indicates that Dlg3 and Fltp cooperate in the inner ear to position BB/cilia and other Dlg family members might compensate for Dlg3 loss-of-function in the lung MCCs. We provide this information for the reviewer only, because this goes beyond the scope of our manuscript.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><p>(A-B) Show cryosections of a WT lung stained with acetylated tubulin (red) and pericentrin (green) and DAPI (blue).

The cartoon suggests that Fltp localizes to stereocilia, but the binding data suggest it should be found with gamma tubulin at the BBs</italic>.</p><p>We apologise and removed the model from the figure set.</p><p>Finally, the authors discuss function at the TJs.</p><p>We discuss Dlg3 function at the TJ in the context of the IE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), because Dlg3 was shown to localise to apical TJs and interact with TJ-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Van Campenhout et al., 2011</xref>; Dev Cell).</p><p><italic>Since MCCs don't have the equivalent of stereocilia, where is the commonality? In these cells, Fltp is seen in the apical meshwork, but the resolution is too low to make specific conclusions about exactly where. We know too little to extract any inference about commonality of Fltp function from the two cell types</italic>.</p><p>We now provide higher quality pictures of the localization of Fltp in the apical meshwork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). As stated above, we do not intend to extract commonality of Fltp function in mono- and multiciliated cell types. However, the obvious commonality is the localization and close association of Fltp with the apical actin and MT cytoskeleton, the BB(s) and cilia (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figure 4 and 7</xref>) and the function in BB docking and positioning (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig8">Figure 4, 5 and 8</xref>).</p><p><italic>There is one very troubling piece of data that must be explained, and unsatisfactory resolution will invalidate the MCC findings. The IMARIS resonstructions in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>HI show mostly docked vs many undocked BBs, but it is normally easy to find cells in day 4 cultures with undocked BBs, as cells continue to differentiate for some time</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers comment that in day 4 cultures cells with undocked BBs can be found. This is exactly what we observed, except that Fltp homozygous cultures always show a reduced number of docked BBs compared to WT cultures.</p><p><italic>Care must be taken that these are representative. Therefore the quantitative data are essential. The MTEC data from day 2 and day 4 shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1"><italic>Figure 4-figure supplement 1</italic></xref> <italic>are at best, extremely confusing, and at worst, suggest the possibility that the results should be discarded. First, it is unclear what the authors are measuring. The number of BBs? The number or percent of docked BBs? Number of cells with docked BBs? This must be made clear</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for the bad representation of our data; we measured number of cells with docked BBs (amount of docked BBs was categorized in different percentage groups). As this is too complicated we simplified the quantification and took care that we analysed representatives.</p><p>ALI cultures do not always differentiate with same rate and efficiency. To normalize for variability in differentiation we only compared WT and HOM cultures when they differentiated to a comparable extend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</xref>). The percentage of differentiating MCCs; according to GFP/pericentrin staining among all cells analysed is shown.</p><p>Next, we examined BB docking by staging the differentiating cells into stage II-III (BB amplification and docking) and stage IV (every BB has a cilia and is docked) (see model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This revealed at day 2 and day 4 BB docking defects in Fltp knock-out cultures, when compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Representative images and how we quantified these are shown below:<fig id="fig13" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><p>(A-A’’) WT cultures at day 0, ALI day 2 and ALI day 4.

In the best wildtype cultures, 80% of cells are never seen to become multiciliated</italic>.</p><p>We only analysed cells differentiating into MCCs and excluded non-differentiating cells present in the ALI culture. The overall percentage of cells that started differentiating according to anti-GFP and anti-Pericentrin staining can be seen in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</xref> (max. 22%). We categorized these cells into cells in stage II-III (BB amplification and docking) and stage IV (every BB has a cilia and is docked) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1B</xref>.</p><p>Additionally, we analysed mTECs at ALI day 0 (directly before switching) and day 1. We could show that MCCs are already present before switching to ALI conditions. We propose that cells which are already multiciliated at day 0 develop to fully mature stage IV MCCs by day 2 accounting for this high amount of stage IV cells at day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p><italic>Furthermore, by day 4, the number has declined to 60%? Why? At this stage, the numbers should still be increasing. In light of this, how are we to interpret the mutant results? We need a description of what is being measured, as well as images to corroborate</italic>.</p><p>This is a very good question for which we do not have a definitive answer. MCCs are already present at day 0 and 1. From day 0 to day 2 the amount of stage II-IV cells increases from approx. 5% to 18%. We hypothesize that this rapid increase in stage II-IV cells is due to the presence of MCCs before the switch to ALI conditions. These cells might also more efficiently show BB docking and cilia formation. Additionally, new stage I cells are entering the differentiation process after switch to ALI conditions. The amount of these cells increases and potentially reduce the number of docked stage IV cells at day 4. To definitively proof this hypothesis, we would need to do live cell analysis, which is beyond the scope of this work. The number of differentiating cells are still increasing.</p><p><italic>Another problem is with the “genetic interaction” between fltp and celsr1. Genetic interaction is typically shown between heterozygotes that have no phenotype on their own, or between one het with no phenotype and a homozygote with a weak phenotype. The authors make double homozygous mutants and show an enhanced phenotype. Yet each homozygote has a phenotype of its own, and therefore the result could simply be an additive phenotype. The result therefore DOES NOT show a genetic interaction and provides NO EVIDENCE that Fltp is in the PCP pathway. The result is equally consistent with distinct pathways converging on a shared output</italic>.</p><p>We totally agree with the comment that Celsr1+Fltp could also act in two parallel pathways and we added this to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Numerous other statements describing Fltp function in PCP signaling are also misleading. For example, describing Dvl2 function at BBs as a PCP function is not valid. Indeed, the MCC phenotype is not a PCP phenotype at all, and the hair cell phenotype impacts PCP, but is presumably quite downstream. Taken together, it is not reasonable to describe the results as being effectors of PCP. This is another big example of interpretation not correctly reflecting the findings</italic>.</p><p>We agree and have toned down the statements as outlined above for reviewer 1.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) Many references are made to “Detailed” subcellular co-localization studies. But these data are not at all clear in their current form. In particular the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>are over-interpreted.
