Here, we show that <italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 truncating mutations occur at higher than expected frequencies and produce proteins that lack canonical p53 tumor suppressor activities but promote cancer cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Functionally and molecularly, these p53 mutants resemble the naturally occurring alternative p53 splice variant, p53-psi. Accordingly, these mutants can localize to the mitochondria where they promote tumor phenotypes by binding and activating the mitochondria inner pore permeability regulator, Cyclophilin D (CypD). Together, our studies reveal that <italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 truncating mutations, contrary to current beliefs, act beyond p53 loss to promote tumorigenesis, and could inform the development of strategies to target cancers driven by these prevalent mutations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17929.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17929.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>tumor suppressor</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>TP53 truncations</kwd><kwd>CypD</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCI P01 CA129243-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ladanyi</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name><name><surname>Lowe</surname><given-names>Scott W</given-names></name><name><surname>Sordella</surname><given-names>Raffaella</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and molecular analysis of TP53 exon-6 truncating mutations reveal that these mutations, contrary to current belief, promote tumorigenesis and point towards strategies for treating cancers driven by these prevalent mutations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The International Cancer Genome Consortium has recognized that the <italic>TP53</italic> gene is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hollstein et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Olivier et al., 2010</xref>). Genetic studies show that, in most tumors, <italic>TP53</italic> point mutations co-occur with the loss of one copy of the <italic>TP53</italic> gene (LOH) due to deletions in chromosome 17 where the <italic>TP53</italic> locus is located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Menon et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Olivier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rivlin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with these observations and the two-hit hypothesis proposed by A.G. Knudson, experimental evidences have led to the description of <italic>TP53</italic> as a tumor suppressor gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knudson, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Finlay et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Donehower et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>This simplistic vision has been challenged by recent studies spurred by the observation that <italic>TP53</italic> missense mutations do not have a uniform distribution; rather, they occur more frequently at specific residues (R175, G245, R248, R249, R273 and R282) often referred to as ‘hotspot’ <italic>TP53</italic> mutation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Petitjean et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brosh and Rotter, 2009</xref>). The high frequency of these mutations led to the hypothesis that these hotspot mutations could not only result in loss of function activities, but also could confer an advantage of growth to cancer cells. Indeed, many lines of evidence have now demonstrated that certain p53 missense mutants could exhibit a gain of function activities during tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brosh and Rotter, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oren and Rotter, 2010</xref>). For instance, some of the gain of function mutations, including R175H, R248Q, R273H, resulted in an increase in cell invasion, cell migration, cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis in different in-vitro models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muller and Vousden, 2014</xref>). Additionally, mice expressing <italic>TP53</italic> R172H (human R175H) and R270H (human R273H) mutations manifest a broad spectrum of aggressive tumors that are more metastatic in nature when compared to p53-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Olive et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doyle et al., 2010</xref>). Though different gain of function mutants exhibit various pro-tumorigenic phenotypes, their mechanism of function mostly relies on alterations to the p53 transcription program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Freed-Pastor and Prives, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we similarly report that certain <italic>TP53</italic> truncating mutations promote tumorigenesis rather than halt it. In fact, we observed that <italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 truncating mutations occur at higher than expected frequencies and, when ectopically expressed in cells, induce the acquisition of pro-metastatic features. In contrast to <italic>TP53</italic> missense gain of function mutations, we found that <italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 truncating mutations are necessary for cell survival in normal 2-D cell growing conditions. These <italic>TP53</italic> truncating mutations also different from a canonical p53 missense gain of function mutants in regards to their mode of action. As we have shown in this study, these p53 mutants lack transcriptional activity and, instead, have phenotypes that depend on their molecular and functional interactions with Cyclophilin D in the mitochondria.</p><p>Much like EGFR, ROS and ALK mutations have been candidates for precision medicine, the relatively frequent distribution of exon-6 <italic>TP53</italic> truncating mutations in certain tumors, combined with the availability of CypD inhibitors, implies that these mutations may similarly be successfully targeted with precision medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 truncating mutations occur at a higher than expected frequency</title><p>While the gain of function activity of p53 missense mutants has been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brosh and Rotter, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oren and Rotter, 2010</xref>), the biological effects of p53 nonsense mutants have yet to be explored.</p><p>To address this, we first examined a panel of 22 sequencing studies, predominantly carried out by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project and accessed using the cBio portal, referred to here as the 'TCGA cohort' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cerami et al., 2012</xref>). Studies were selected for inclusion on the basis of having more than 100 samples per tumor type and at least 10 tumors with <italic>TP53</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, it is evident that <italic>TP53</italic> nonsense mutations are distributed non-randomly with increased frequency in correspondence to <italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 (i.e. <italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 nonsense). Interestingly, our analysis also indicated that nonsense mutations occur at sites distinct from those affected by missense mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These findings were confirmed in an independent pan-cancer dataset of 3797 cases, in which targeted sequencing was performed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>), referred to here as the 'MSKCC cohort' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17929.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 truncating mutations occur at higher than expected frequency.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of <italic>TP53</italic> nonsense (top, black) and missense (bottom, green) mutations in the TCGA cohort (n = 2521 tumors).

As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, we found that in the case of missense mutations the relative expected frequency was 0.34, while the relative observed frequency was 0.64, based on the analysis of the TCGA cohort. This finding suggests that missense mutations are observed at a frequency that is 1.9 fold higher than expected. In the case of nonsense mutations, we observed a slight difference between the expected frequency (i.e., 0.054) and observed frequency (i.e., 0.084) of mutations. Interestingly, when we limited our analysis only to exon-6 nonsense mutations we found a 4–5 fold increase in the observed frequency compared to the expected frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This finding indicates that nonsense mutations in exon-6 occur nearly 5 times more frequently than all <italic>TP53</italic> mutations (p=3.869e-11) and 2–3 times more frequently than either missense mutations or nonsense mutations outside of exon-6 (p=3.71e-4 and p=8e-5, respectively). These results were confirmed in the MSKCC cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>In addition to nonsense mutations, frameshift and splice site mutations may produce truncated proteins. We found that even though nonsense mutations occur at a rate of 13%, overall truncating mutations account for more than 25% of all <italic>TP53</italic> mutations in both datasets examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also observed that the distribution of <italic>TP53</italic> mutations differs in various tumor types, ranging from 7.3 to 94.9% in the case of multiple myeloma (MM) and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OVCA) respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As for <italic>TP53</italic> truncating mutations, their frequency of occurrence spans from 1.46% in MM to 27.53% in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Notably, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), esophageal adenocarcinoma (ESAD), squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), the frequency of <italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 truncating mutations was higher than 6% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Although the frequency of <italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 truncating mutations followed the distribution of <italic>TP53</italic> mutations in the majority of tumors examined, this was not always the case. This phenomenon is best exemplified by our observations of lung small cell carcinoma (LUSCC) wherein, despite the nearly ubiquitous presence of <italic>TP53</italic> alterations, we found no exon-6 truncations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, in the MSKCC cohort, we found a statistically significant increase in the frequency of <italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 truncating mutations in colorectal cancer (CRC) metastatic site tumors with respect to primary tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Our studies, in fact, revealed that p53 exon-6 truncating mutants not only lack transcriptional activities and the capacity to respond to DNA damage, but are also uniquely able to activate a pro-tumorigenic cellular program.</p><p>Consistent with the capabilities of these p53 mutants to promote rather than halt tumorigenesis, <italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 truncating mutations are highly abundant and are enriched in certain tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Although, in principle this implies that these specific mutants could increase the fitness of tumors, we cannot exclude the possibility that the higher than expected frequency we observed in tumors could alternatively be explained by a specific etiology and/or a particular mutagenic modality. Additional experiments in mouse model systems will be required to better understand the ontogeny of these mutations.</p><p>One interesting feature of the p53 exon-6 truncating mutants is their similarity to the naturally occurring p53 isoform p53-psi. Much like p53-psi, they lack part of the DNA binding and oligomerization domains as well as the nuclear localization sequences; however, they are partially localized to the mitochondria where they are able to bind and activate Cyclophilin D.</p><p>CypD is a positive regulator of the opening of the MPTP. Inhibition of CypD activity, either genetically or pharmacologically, has been reported to reduce mitochondrial permeability and induce changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Hence, unsurprisingly, we observed that the expression of <italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 truncating mutations is sufficient to increase the MPTP.</p><p>In the past, an augmented mitochondrial permeability has always been associated with decreased cell viability. Yet, cells expressing <italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 truncating mutations are proliferating under normal conditions and are actually dependent on CypD for their survival. These observations are consistent with more recent reports indicating that the MPTP has a role not only in inducing cell death under cellular stress, but also in physiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kwong and Molkentin, 2015</xref>) and in the induction of phenotypic changes associated with pro-metastatic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Senturk et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The requirement of mitochondria localization, interaction with CypD and the lack of transcriptional activities distinguish <italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 truncating mutations from other p53 gain of function mutants with pro-tumorigenic functions (e.g. R175, G245, R248, R249, R273 and R282). Despite the fact that p53 gain of function mutants are also capable of inducing pro-metastatic features, we found that their activities strongly depend on their nuclear localization and transcriptional activities.</p><p>In our study, structure-function analysis has also shown that the p53 W146* mutant is unable to interact with CypD despite its ability to localize to the mitochondria. Interestingly and contrary to p53-psi and p53 exon-6 truncating mutants, the expression of the p53 W146* mutant increased the expression of E-cadherin instead of reducing it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>), and decreased the permeability of the MPTP in a calcein assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). To explain this observation, it is tempting to speculate that the p53 W146* mutant may interact with other components of the MPTP and antagonize the function of CypD. Further studies will be required to illuminate the underpinning mechanisms.</p><p>The selective dependencies of cancer cells harboring exon-6 <italic>TP53</italic> truncating mutations to CypD activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–F</xref>) is particularly exciting, as it begs the design of novel targeted therapeutics. Notably, the high prevalence of p53-psi or <italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 truncating mutations in certain tumors also suggests that this class of <italic>TP53</italic> mutations represents a strong precision medicine candidate target comparable to the well-documented EGFR, ROS and ALK mutations in NSCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Korpanty et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our studies indicated that multiple <italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 truncating mutations, despite lacking transcriptional and canonical p53 tumor suppressor activities, can reprogram the cells’ signaling networks, change the ‘dependency’ of cells and their cell state. As these mutations structurally and functionally mimic the naturally occurring p53-psi isoform, we propose that <italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 mutations are best described as 'separation of function' rather than simply 'gain of function' or 'loss of function' Interestingly, approximately one-third of all human genetic disorders are caused by mutations that generate premature stop codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frischmeyer and Dietz, 1999</xref>). Hence, <italic>TP53</italic> exon-6 truncating mutations could represent a paradigm for other diseases that could similarly be driven by the separation of function isoforms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Xenograft assay</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the National Research Council’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom Joaquin Espinosa (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Charles Sawyers as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jean-Christophe Bourdon (Reviewer #2) and Antony Braithwaite (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Sordella and colleagues report the characterization of p53 exon 6 truncation mutants in human cancer cells. The manuscript contains a number of interesting observations, that could be summarized as follows:</p><p>1) Exon 6 nonsense (truncation) p53 mutants occur at a higher frequency relative to missense mutations, are stably expressed in many tumor cell lines (effectively bypassing nonsense-mediated decay) and, in the case of colorectal tumors, are more common in metastases than primary tumors.</p><p>2) Exon 6 nonsense p53 mutants harbor gain-of-function (GOF) activity, promoting cell viability, EMT-like properties in vitro and metastasis in a mouse model.</p><p>3) Exon 6 nonsense p53 mutants are mostly excluded from the nucleus, localizing instead to cytoplasm and mitochondria, where they bind to cyclophilin D (CypD) and promote mitochondrial membrane permeability.</p><p>4) Cancer cell lines expressing exon 6 nonsense mutants display dependency on both mutant p53 and CypD, suggesting an epistatic relationship between these proteins in promoting cell survival and EMT features.</p><p>Overall, the Reviewers found the paper interesting, fulfilling a gap in the p53 field, as p53 truncated mutants have not been explored in detail. The GOF mechanism reported was deemed interesting, because it is clearly different from that observed for p53 missense mutants, which act in the nucleus via transcriptional effects.</p><p>After thorough discussion, the Reviewers agreed to encourage submission of a revised manuscript addressing several major and minor points:</p><p>Essential points:</p><p>1) Reviewers agreed that a main conclusion in the manuscript is not fully supported by the data and that additional work is required to prove this point. The authors claim that p53 mutants lacking the DNA binding domain regulate mitochondrial membrane permeability (through MPTP activity) in a CypD-dependent manner. The data show that mutant p53 R213* binds to CypD but it is unclear whether this interaction occurs in the mitochondria or in the cytoplasm (if in the cytoplasm, it would imply that mutant p53 inhibits localization of CypD to the mitochondria which would explain its reduced mitochondrial localization in H1299 cells overexpressing R213* or R196*).

The authors claim that p53 mutants lacking the DNA binding domain regulate mitochondrial membrane permeability (through MPTP activity) in a CypD-dependent manner. The data show that mutant p53 R213* binds to CypD but it is unclear whether this interaction occurs in the mitochondria or in the cytoplasm (if in the cytoplasm, it would imply that mutant p53 inhibits localization of CypD to the mitochondria which would explain its reduced mitochondrial localization in H1299 cells overexpressing R213* or R196*). Furthermore, it is unclear whether overexpression of CypD abolishes MPTP closure promoted by depletion of mutant p53R213*.

The table compares the theoretical (e.g., expected frequency) of mutations with the frequencies of mutations we observed (e.g., observed frequency) in the TCGA and MSKCC datasets. In the case of missense mutations, we estimated an expected frequency of 0.34. In both the TCGA and the MSKCC cohorts, the observed frequency was 0.64 and 0.52, respectively. Therefore, we calculated the frequency of missense mutations observed in tumors was 1.5 and 1.9 fold higher than the expected frequencies in the TCGA and in the MSKCC datasets respectively. As for nonsense mutations, the expected frequency was 0.054 while the observed frequency was 0.084 in the TCGA data set and 0.076 in the MSKCC data set. This was not the case for exon-6 nonsense mutations. In fact, we found that while the expected frequency was 0.0098, the observed frequency was 0.05 in the TCGA cohort and 0.04 in the MSKCC cohort.</p><p>Altogether these data indicate that the exon-6 nonsense mutations, differently from missense or other non-sense mutations are 4-5 fold more frequent than expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-E</xref>).</p><p>– Panel F. Small cell lung carcinoma was indicated as LUSCC in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>. As indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, 'MM' stands for multiple myeloma.

We are not sure about the comment of the reviewer as multiple myeloma was not refer to in the text.</p><p>– Panel G. While the ratio between IF-indel is higher in the metastatic group, the low number of samples with primary tumors (n= 3 primary and n= 10 metastatic tumor site) rendered this finding statistically insignificant, as indicated.</p><p><italic>2.2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

We are not clear on the nature of the additional bands observed, and believe they are most likely the result of proteolysis. Interestingly, western blot analysis in B16 cells did not show these extra-bands. Further studies will be required to better understand the nature and a possible functional role of these additional p53 species.</p><p><italic>–</italic> Panel D. The cell lines were generated using a lentiviral ectopic expression system described in the materials and methods section. We have now replaced the original image and provided a better resolution with particular attention to DAPI levels.</p><p>The reason why we used A549 cells to illustrate differences in the morphology of cells upon ectopic expression of p53 mutants was mainly based on the fact that A549 cells form a nice columnar epithelial monolayer when they reach confluence. This facilitates the analysis of the distribution of cortical actin, stress fibers and E-cadherin. Nevertheless, as shown in in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, also in the H1299 cells we observed that ectopic expression of R196* and R213* induced an increase in the expression of mesenchymal markers (p-value *&lt;0.05, unpaired t-test).</p><p><italic>–</italic> Panel E.
