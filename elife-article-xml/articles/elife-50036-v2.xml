nearly always involve multi-drug combinations developed by experimentation in humans; unfortunately, the mechanistic basis for the success of such combinations has rarely been investigated in detail, obscuring lessons learned. Here, we use isobologram analysis to score pharmacological interaction, and clone tracing and CRISPR screening to measure cross-resistance among the five drugs comprising R-CHOP, a combination therapy that frequently cures Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas. We find that drugs in R-CHOP exhibit very low cross-resistance but not synergistic interaction: together they achieve a greater fractional kill according to the null hypothesis for both the Loewe dose-additivity model and the Bliss effect-independence model. These data provide direct evidence for the 50 year old hypothesis that a curative cancer therapy can be constructed on the basis of independently effective drugs having non-overlapping mechanisms of resistance, without synergistic interaction, which has immediate significance for the design of new drug combinations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>combination therapy</kwd><kwd>drug resistance</kwd><kwd>tumor heterogeneity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50-GM107618</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palmer</surname><given-names>Adam C</given-names></name><name><surname>Chidley</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Sorger</surname><given-names>Peter K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54-CA225088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palmer</surname><given-names>Adam C</given-names></name><name><surname>Chidley</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Sorger</surname><given-names>Peter K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1072965</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palmer</surname><given-names>Adam C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000913</institution-id><institution>James S.

For some types of cancer, multidrug combinations have been developed that produce frequent cures, whereas cure by monotherapy is rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frei and Antman, 2000</xref>). In current practice, the search for new drug combinations focuses on identifying drugs that exhibit synergy. Although ‘synergy’ is often used loosely it is best defined by Bliss or Loewe criteria, which test whether a combination is stronger than expected from the sum of the drugs’ individual effects; antagonism arises when combinations are less active than additivity would predict. In translational cancer biology such measurements are most commonly made using cultured cells or genetically defined mouse models. Despite the current emphasis on synergy, historically successful combinations were developed according to quite different hypotheses. For example, Law and Frei et al. argued for combining drugs that are independently effective and have non-overlapping mechanisms of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frei et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Law, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Law, 1952</xref>). Such combinations are expected to overcome clonal heterogeneity present within each patient’s cancer. Heterogeneity between patients can also be a reason why drug combinations improve response rates, even when each patient only benefits from the most active monotherapy. However, cure is almost never achievable by monotherapy, and the superiority of curative combinations cannot be explained by patient variability in best single-drug response (the topic of our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Palmer and Sorger, 2017</xref>]).</p><p>The pharmacological principles underlying curative combination therapies are largely unknown because most such combinations were developed via empirical experimentation in patients, and the combinations that worked have only rarely been subjected to detailed mechanistic analysis. Knowing the design principles behind existing curative regimens should assist in rationally assembling new cancer medicines into curative combinations. A key question for such an effort, and for oncology drug discovery in general, is determining which among several different properties of a combination should be given the greatest weight: strong individual activity and low cross-resistance as proposed five decades ago, or synergistic interaction as currently emphasized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nature Medicine, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Testing whether a higher order multi-drug combination (that is, one with more than two constituents) exhibits synergistic interaction can only be accomplished ex vivo by measuring and analyzing the responses of cells to drugs applied individually and in combination over a range of concentrations, for example by isobologram analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Greco et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Loewe, 1953</xref>). When evaluated at fixed doses the superiority in vivo of a combination over monotherapy can occur without a true pharmacological interaction and is therefore not sufficient evidence of synergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berenbaum, 1989</xref>). Testing whether a combination exhibits low cross-resistance is more challenging because it requires systematic exploration of resistance mechanisms; different mechanisms of resistance display different cross-resistance properties. It has long been possible to isolate cell clones resistant to single drugs and then assay for sensitivity to other drugs, but this approach is not practical at a scale needed to test Law and Frei’s hypothesis, as was recognized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Law (1956)</xref>. Efficient analysis of cross-resistance has become feasible only recently with technical breakthroughs in multiplexed clone tracing and reverse genetic screening. DNA barcode libraries allow large numbers (≥10<sup>6</sup>) of uniquely tagged clones to be tested in parallel for resistance to multiple drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhang et al., 2015</xref>), and genetic screens using CRISPR-Cas9 technologies enable genome-wide identification of loss and gain of function changes that confer resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jost et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). To date, barcode and CRISPR-Cas9 libraries have been used to study mechanisms of resistance primarily to targeted therapies and identify new combinations of such drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hata et al., 2016</xref>); they have not yet been used to test Law and Frei’s ‘non-overlapping resistance’ hypothesis by analyzing combinations of cytotoxic drugs that are the backbone of curative therapies.</p><p>In this paper, we measure pharmacological interaction and cross-resistance among components of R-CHOP, a five drug chemo-immunotherapy that achieves high cure rates in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). R-CHOP has five constituents: R – rituximab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD20, a protein expressed on the surface of all B cells; C – cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) an alkylating agent; H – hydroxydaunomycin (doxorubicin, or Adriamycin), a topoisomerase II inhibitor; O – Oncovin (vincristine), an anti-microtubule drug and; P – prednisone, a steroid. R-CHOP was developed over an extended period of time via clinical experiments in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lakhtakia and Burney, 2015</xref>). The constituents of R-CHOP are known to be individually cytotoxic to DLBCL cells in vivo, and the drugs have largely non-overlapping dose-limiting toxicities, which permits their combined administration in patients. The reasons for the clinical superiority of R-CHOP in DLBCL remain poorly understood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pritchard et al. (2013)</xref> observed no synergy among pairs of drugs in CVAD (similar to CHOP) in a mouse cell line model of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and in profiling the effects of 93 gene knockdowns by RNA interference on drug sensitivity, the change in sensitivity to CVAD was equal (for almost every knockdown) to the average of its changes in single-drug sensitivity; this demonstrates that CVAD does not act as a more potent version of a single drug, nor does it exhibit a new signature of genetic dependencies.</p><p>We tested for pharmacological interaction among all pairs of R-CHOP constituents across a full dose range in three DLBCL cell lines and assessed interaction using both the Bliss independence and Loewe additivity criteria. We observed little if any synergy: most drug pairs were additive and some were antagonistic. We also tested higher order combinations at fixed dose ratios with similar results. We then screened for cross resistant mutations using random mutagenesis with clone tracing as well as CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) with genome-scale libraries. The rate of multi-drug resistance was near the theoretical minimum predicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Law (1952)</xref>, where the ‘fractional killing’ achieved by a combination is the product of each individual drug’s fractional kill. This suggests that high single-agent activity and low-cross-resistance are key attributes of the curative R-CHOP regimen.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Components of R-CHOP do not exhibit synergy in killing Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma cells</title><p>Pharmacological interactions among R-CHOP constituents were measured in human Pfeiffer, SU-DHL-4 and SU-DHL-6 cell lines. All three lines are derived from germinal center B-like DLBCL, the subtype most responsive to R-CHOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alizadeh et al., 2000</xref>). Prednisone and cyclophosphamide are pro-drugs that are activated by liver metabolism. We therefore used the pre-activated forms of these drugs: prednisolone and 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide (which spontaneously converts to the active compound 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide in water) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ludeman, 1999</xref>). Rituximab kills B-cell lymphomas through multiple CD20-dependent mechanisms that include complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC), antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and direct killing via CD20 cross-linking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weiner, 2010</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kobayashi et al., 2013</xref>), we observed that rituximab can kill DLBCL cells in culture via CMC when human serum is included in the culture media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Among seven DLBCL cell lines tested, none exhibited a cytotoxic response to prednisolone alone at clinically relevant concentrations, although the rate of cell division was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Prednisone is cytotoxic to DLBCL in first-line clinical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lamar, 2016</xref>); the absence of cytotoxicity in DLBCL cell culture, which is consistent with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knutson et al., 2014</xref>), might reflect selection for prednisone resistance in cell lines established from post-treatment patients. As there exist no generally available treatment-naïve DLBCL cell lines, we are not able to test whether such cultures might respond in vitro to prednisolone.</p><p>Pharmacodynamic interactions among drugs comprising R-CHOP were first measured in Pfeiffer cells. For each of 10 drug pairs, an 11 × 11 ‘checkerboard’ was created with each drug increasing in concentration along one of the two axes, spanning a 100-fold range. Cells were incubated with drugs for 72 hr, which spans at least one in vivo half-life in humans for each of C, H, O and P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Jonge et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gidding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Speth et al., 1988</xref>); R has an elimination half-life of 3 weeks in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tran et al., 2010</xref>). Cell viability was measured using a luminescent ATP assay (CellTiter-Glo) that was linearly proportional to live cell number as determined by microscopy and vital staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The ratio of cell number in drug-treated and untreated control cultures (relative cell number) was used to compute normalized growth rate inhibition values (GR values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hafner et al., 2016</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Pharmacological interaction was then assessed based on excess over Bliss Independence and by isobologram analysis (which tests for Loewe additivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berenbaum, 1989</xref>]). We have previously used isobologram analysis to confirm synergistic interaction among HER2 and CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancers, which serves as a positive control for the identification of synergy by drug-drug ‘checkerboard’ experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goel et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The Bliss model assesses the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs according to the proportion of cells killed (rather than potency, as measured by IC<sub>50</sub> for example), and drugs are scored as interacting only if their combined effect exceeds a null model of independence involving statistically independent probabilities of cell killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bliss, 1939</xref>). Specifically, if given doses of drugs <italic>a</italic> or <italic>b</italic> alone kill proportions of cells equal to <italic>p<sub>a</sub></italic> or <italic>p<sub>b</sub></italic> and these probabilities of death are not correlated, then the proportion of cells expected to die from a combination of these drugs at the same doses is <italic>p</italic><sub>expected</sub><italic> = p<sub>a</sub> +</italic> (1 – <italic>p<sub>a</sub></italic>)×<italic>p<sub>b</sub> =  p</italic><sub>a</sub> <italic>+ p<sub>b</sub> – p<sub>a</sub></italic> ×<italic>p<sub>b</sub></italic>. In this model, synergy or antagonism is defined as an observed excess or deficiency in the proportion of cells killed; we assessed this on a logarithmic scale (Excess over Bliss, <italic>EOB =</italic> Log<sub>10</sub>(1 – <italic>p</italic><sub>expected</sub>) <italic>–</italic> Log<sub>10</sub>(1 <italic>– p</italic><sub>observed</sub>)) to identify increases in fractional kill. For example, in comparing 99% kill with 99.9% kill, the difference is less than 1% on a linear scale, but a logarithmic scale correctly reveals a 10-fold difference in the probability of survival. By this analysis, we find that pairs of drugs in R-CHOP are largely independent, except that killing by O is strongly antagonized by the presence of either C or H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Antagonism may be a consequence of the effects of these drugs on the cell cycle: killing of mitotic cells by O is expected to decrease when C- or H-induced DNA damage prevents entry into mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barlogie et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cutts, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidoff and Mendelow, 1993</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pairs of drugs in R-CHOP exhibit little synergy, but some strong antagonism, in a Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma cell line.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Pfeiffer cells grown in microtiter plates were treated with drug combinations for 72 hr followed by a luminescence-based assay for cell viability. ‘Excess over Bliss’ measures the observed deviation from Bliss Independence.

The DLBCL cell lines Pfeiffer, SU-DHL-4, SU-DHL-6 were each seeded in 384-well plates at 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL in complete media with or without 5% pooled human complement serum, and were treated with a range of rituximab concentrations. After 72 hr treatment, cell viability was measured by luminescent assay of ATP (CellTiter-Glo). Untreated control wells defined 100% relative luminescence. (<bold>b</bold>) Prednisolone does not exhibit substantial cytotoxicity to DLBCL cultures in vitro. DLBCL cultures were seeded in 384-well plates, treated with prednisolone for 72 hr, and relative viability was assayed by CellTiter-Glo. None of 7 cell lines demonstrated cytotoxicity at clinically relevant doses (dashed vertical line marks the estimated Cmax of 8 μM). Because untreated cultures divide ~2 to 3 times in 72 hr, reduction of luminescence to ~50% of untreated control indicates a partial reduction in proliferation rate and not net cytotoxicity. Note: SU-DHL-7 has been identified as a descendent of SU-DHL-8, which is also a DLBCL culture. (<bold>c</bold>) Luminescence from CellTiter-Glo is linear with live cell number over a wide range. Pfeiffer cells were concentrated by centrifugation and resuspended in a reduced volume of media, and the density of live cells was counted using a haemocytometer and trypan blue staining. This culture was seeded in 384-well plates with a volume of 30 μL per well of complete media and cell densities ranging from 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> down to 50 cells per mL, prepared via serial dilution. 24 replicate wells were prepared at each density. Immediately after inoculation, the plate was subjected to a luminescent assay of ATP by CellTiter-Glo. A solid red line represents the region of highly linear relationship between live cell density and luminescence (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.997); at higher densities luminescence begins to saturate, and at lower densities significant noise is observed. A vertical gray line indicates the initial cell density used in drug response assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), and a blue shaded region indicates the cell density range relevant to these assays. (<bold>d</bold>) Growth Rate (GR) metrics correct for the confounding effect of cell division on cytotoxicity. Cell division during a drug treatment assay affects the relationship between cell death and cell count relative to untreated controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hafner et al., 2016</xref>). To correct for this effect, absolute cell counts of untreated cultures were measured before and after treatment to quantify cell proliferation (Materials and methods). Plots indicate the relation between relative cell number (measured by CellTiter-Glo) and fraction of cells killed. The ‘no human serum’ scale is relevant to pairwise interactions in CHOP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and ‘5% human serum’ is relevant to pairs of R and others drugs in CHOP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and all measurements of high-order interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Similar relationships were measured and applied for SU-DHL-4 and SU-DHL-6.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50036-fig1-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>In isobologram analysis, contour lines (isoboles) corresponding to a constant phenotype (the fraction of cells killed) are plotted across a two-way dose-response landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Greco et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Loewe, 1953</xref>). The shape of the contours is diagnostic of drug interaction: straight contours correspond to drug additivity, convex contours to synergy and concave contours to antagonism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, inset). This arises because straight contours correspond to a scenario of ‘dose-equivalence'; that is, a unit of drug <italic>a</italic> can substitute for a unit of drug <italic>b</italic> and <italic>vice versa</italic> (when units are normalized by potency). When contours are convex, a disproportionately small dose of <italic>a</italic> plus <italic>b</italic> is as active as a full dose of either monotherapy. Isobologram analysis of drug pairs in R-CHOP confirmed results from Bliss analysis, namely that interactions among R-CHOP constituents range from strongly antagonistic to approximately additive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As discussed earlier, prednisolone was not cytotoxic on its own but it slightly sensitized cells to C and to H. CMC by rituximab was approximately additive with each of C, H, and O, whereas C and H severely antagonized O. Note that the small convexity visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> when R is combined with other agents does not meet the 2-fold deviation from additivity that is the recommended threshold for avoiding false claims of synergy due to errors in measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Odds, 2003</xref>). We conclude that no drug pair in R-CHOP exhibits synergistic interaction by either isobologram analysis (Loewe additivity) or Bliss independence.</p><p>To test for higher order interactions, we exposed each of the three different DLBCL cell lines to all 26 possible combinations of 2, 3, 4, or five drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Because high-order combinations cannot feasibly be studied across multi-dimensional dose ‘checkerboards’, R-CHOP constituents were tested at fixed ratios scaled so that constituents were equipotent with respect to cell killing when assayed individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The activity of drug combinations was then quantified by <italic>Fractional Inhibitory Concentrations</italic> (FIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elion et al., 1954</xref>], also known as <italic>Combination Index</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chou, 2010</xref>]), which is a fixed-ratio simplification of Loewe’s isobologram analysis. If single drugs achieve a given effect magnitude, 50% killing for example, at concentrations <italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>, or <italic>C</italic> (using three drugs as an example), and their combination achieves the same effect at concentrations <italic>a + b + c</italic>, then <italic>FIC = a/A + b/B + c/C</italic> (note that Loewe additivity corresponds to FIC = 1 and synergy is commonly defined as FIC &lt;0.5). In all three DLBCL cultures, we observed that small excesses over additivity for R and P on CHO was balanced by antagonism within CHO, producing net effects ranging from approximately additive to slightly antagonistic (for five drugs in Pfeiffer FIC = 0.80 ± 0.15; for SU-DHL-6 FIC = 1.1 ± 0.3 and for SU-DHL-4 FIC = 1.7 ± 0.2; 95% confidence, n = 4–8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). The absence of synergy across high-order combinations was supported by Bliss analysis of the same data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Emergent pharmacological interactions involving combinations of 3 or more drugs can be identified as deviations from the assumption of dose additivity using data from lower order drug interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cokol et al., 2017</xref>); nearly all such terms supported the hypothesis of no interaction (emergent FIC = 1) with the only substantial deviations representing mild antagonism (emergent FIC up to 1.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Plotted here are dose responses to each single drug as measured in the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> for Pfeiffer (n=8; including two biological duplicate cultures, here plotting four lines per drug that are each the mean of technical duplicates). For each drug, a 400-fold dose range was selected (see axes below the plot) to align all 4 cytotoxic agents (rituximab, 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide (4-H-Cyclo.), doxorubicin, and vincristine) such that they enter the cytotoxic regime of their dose response (crossing the dashed gray line) at similar positions and that this position aligns with the clinical Cmax (peak serum concentration) of prednisolone. This alignment defines the 'relative concentration' units in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. The concentration range also aligns the clinical Cmax (colored triangles on concentration axes) of each drug, except for rituximab which is very highly potent against Pfeiffer cells. Relative luminescence (left axis) was converted to biological effect (right axis) by measuring absolute cell count of untreated cultures before and after drug treatment (Materials and methods): in this experiment untreated cultures increased in cell count by approximately 7-fold, and therefore relative luminescence of ≈14% corresponds to no net growth or death (“no growth” on axis). A net cytotoxic effect is evidenced only by relative luminescence lower than 14% (e.g. +50% killing at ≈7% luminescence, +80% killing at ≈3% luminescence).

The ‘Excess over Bliss’ measures the observed deviation from the Bliss Independence model: in these heat maps blue indicates antagonism (less killing), and red indicates synergy (more killing).

One million mutagenized clones were barcoded using a lentiviral DNA barcode library (ClonTracer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhang et al., 2015</xref>). Because the library was complex (≈7 × 10<sup>7</sup> barcodes) and infection performed at low multiplicity (MOI ~0.1), over 99% of barcoded clones are expected to contain a unique barcode. Barcoded cells were expanded in puromycin to select for the lentiviral vector. From a single well-mixed suspension of cells, a batch was reserved to measure pre-treatment barcode frequencies, and the remainder was distributed into 18 replicate cultures (three per drug tested) with each culture providing 12-fold coverage of barcoded clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To model the clinical scenario of strong selection pressure from intensive treatment cycles (as opposed to continuous low dose therapy), drugs were applied for 72 hr at a dose established in a pilot study as the highest dose allowing any surviving cells to re-grow in drug-free media in under 2 weeks (Materials and methods). Cultures were exposed to two rounds of drug treatment followed by a recovery period of 4 to 11 days as needed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Because prednisolone monotherapy only slowed growth, which is difficult to score in a short duration culture, cells were treated with prednisolone at 20 μM for 20 days (the R-CHOP regimen contains multiple five-day courses of prednisone). Enrichment for specific clones was calculated based on relative barcode frequencies prior to and after treatment.</p><p>Thousands of clones were reproducibly enriched in replicate cultures exposed to the same drug. To score cross-resistance and account for culture-to-culture variation across repeats, we constructed an error model by scrambling barcode identities within each replicate. This revealed that at least 300-fold more barcodes were ≥10 fold enriched in repeat experiments for any single drug than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We also accounted for fitness differences observed in vehicle-only cultures (~1% of barcodes were enriched ≥10 fold in the presence of DMSO; see Materials and methods). Correlations between enrichment scores in replicate drug treatments were highly significant (p&lt;10<sup>−900</sup>; n ≈ 10<sup>6</sup>) although of modest magnitude (0.1 to 0.3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This arises because drug exposure imposes population bottlenecks on non-resistant clones, which represent the majority of the population, causing barcodes to be detected, or not, on a stochastic basis. Among barcodes with non-zero counts in replicate experiments, correlation was higher (0.35 to 0.58). We used the geometric mean of enrichment for each barcode as a metric of drug resistance across replicates. Instances of stochastic (and thus irreproducible) enrichment are strongly penalized by this metric; conversely, barcodes are favored if they are reproducibly enriched in independent cultures (which is evidence of heritability). Drug resistant clones could potentially be lost in any one replicate due to stochastic drift, causing an underestimate of drug resistance. However, our use of large initial populations, triplicate experiments, and a metric that scores as positive barcode enrichment in 2 of 3 replicates help to minimize this concern.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>In mutagenized clones single-drug resistance is common but multi-drug resistance is rare.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Reproducibility of DNA barcode enrichment among triplicate drug treatments.

False discovery of coincident enrichment exceeding 10-fold in two or more drugs was rare (&lt;2.5%) and we therefore selected this threshold for subsequent analysis. For each of the four individually active drugs (i.e. RCHO), 2000 to 13,000 barcodes were identified with geometric mean enrichment ≥10 fold, representing resistance frequencies of 2 × 10<sup>−3</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>−2</sup>. The vast majority of enriched clones were unique to one drug, with only 30 to 300 clones (depending on the pair of drugs) enriched in two different conditions; the latter is diagnostic of double-drug resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). Triple-drug resistant clones were even less abundant (between 1 and 10 clones per set of three drugs) and no clones were identified that conferred resistance to each of R, C, H and O when applied individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Note that these frequencies are based on determining the co-occurrence of barcodes enriched in single-drug experiments.

To estimate ξ in clone-tracing studies on ENU-mutagenized cells, we first performed two independent sets of clone tracing experiments (each in triplicate) for resistance to O alone.

Inspired in part by multi-drug cures for tuberculosis, it was proposed that lasting remission required combined use of chemotherapies having different mechanisms of action and thus, different mechanisms of resistance (see retrospectives by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frei and Antman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schnipper, 1986</xref>). Recent mathematical models of tumor evolution support these ideas, and predict that curing a cancer requires non-cross-resistant drug combinations in which the probability of acquiring resistance to all drugs is effectively zero (given the number of tumor cells and the magnitude of tumor cell killing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bozic et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, contemporary drug development focuses on identifying synergistic pharmacological interactions among drugs when considering possible new combination therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Lazikani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chou, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lehár et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nature Medicine, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sun et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this paper we directly assess pharmacological interaction and cross-resistance among the drugs comprising R-CHOP, a highly successful curative cancer therapy developed over the course of decades by experimentation in patients with DLBCL. To investigate the pharmacological mechanisms underlying the success of R-CHOP we studied R-CHOP constituents individually and in combination in DLBCL cell lines. Over a wide range of drug concentrations, we observed no significant synergy among R-CHOP drugs using either Bliss Independence or Loewe Additivity criteria: pairwise drug interactions ranged from additive to antagonistic, and the combined activity of all five drugs was close to purely additive. The significance of antagonism among some drug pairs is not clear but studies of antibiotics have shown that antagonistic drug interactions can suppress the emergence of drug-resistant mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chait et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Michel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yeh et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We investigated the frequencies and mechanisms of resistance to R-CHOP using DNA barcoding and CRISPRi/a technology. These three approaches made it possible to explore drug resistance and cross-resistance caused by point mutations, chromosome aberrations, and increased or decreased gene dosage. Large library size (10<sup>6</sup> clones) is a strength of the barcoding approach and it yielded &gt;10<sup>4</sup> DLBCL mutants resistant to one or more drugs (as measured in biological triplicate). Genome-wide CRISPRi/a screening is more challenging technically, but it reveals the identities of genes involved in resistance and sensitivity. The results of all three resistance screens were clear: progressively fewer clones were observed with resistance to one, two, three or four drugs.</p><p>The specific frequencies of drug resistance reported in this study may not be directly relevant to the clinical setting, since such frequencies depend on experimental features such as population size, drug concentrations, and the inherent sensitivity of the cultures under study. Instead, the key finding is that the number of multi-drug resistant cells we observe is close to the theoretical minimum: with no cross-resistance, the number of cancer cells resistant to each of <italic>n</italic> drugs approximately equals <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∏</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>P</italic><sub>0</sub> is the initial cancer cell population and <italic>f<sub>i</sub></italic> is the frequency of resistance to drug <italic>i</italic>.

However, the quantitative impact of transporters and similar genes on the overall frequency of multi-drug resistance is relatively modest because mutation or over-expression of such genes is substantially rarer than of genes conferring resistance to single drugs; moreover, the transporters we identified were active only on a subset of R-CHOP drugs, not all of them. In the clinical setting, a newly diagnosed patient often has <italic>P</italic><sub>0</sub> &gt;10<sup>10</sup> lymphoma cells, and sensitivity to each drug in R-CHOP is expected to vary widely among patients due to innate resistance (speculatively, 10<sup>−6</sup> &lt; <italic>f<sub>i</sub></italic> ≤ 1, where complete resistance to drug <italic>i</italic> corresponds to <italic>f<sub>i</sub></italic> = 1). Thus, even in the absence of acquired cross-resistance, R-CHOP does not cure all cases of DLBCL, a phenomenon we discuss below.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of our analysis</title><p>The current work was performed in cultured cells and it is likely that the components of R-CHOP have additional mechanisms of action in human patients that we were unable to assay. For example, rituximab is cytotoxic to DLBCL by signaling-induced cell death, complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC), and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weiner, 2010</xref>). In this study, we only scored CMC since DLBCL cultures displayed little direct induction of apoptosis, and ADCC reconstituted in vitro using peripheral blood mononuclear cells elicits insufficient cell death for selection of resistant clones (typically less than 50% killing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dall'Ozzo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reff et al., 1994</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that ADCC interacts synergistically with chemotherapy but note that the immunosuppressive effects of many chemotherapies disfavor this hypothesis. With regard to the evolution of drug resistance, rituximab may behave as though it is several drugs in one due to its multiple mechanisms of action, although CD20 loss constitutes a shared cause of resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Prednisone, the pro-drug of prednisolone, can induce remissions of DLBCL even as a single agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lamar, 2016</xref>), although cytotoxicity was not evident in cell cultures and therefore not adequately tested in our studies. It is also possible that synergistic or antagonistic interactions may occur by mechanisms specific to the in vivo setting; cell non-autonomous processes involving the immune system are one obvious possibility. R-CHOP is often successful in treating Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) related DLBCL, suggesting that adaptive immunity is not essential to its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ribera et al., 2008</xref>). Cell culture is nonetheless an appropriate and necessary setting in which to test the Law and Frei hypothesis: such a test requires molecular manipulations and phenotypic screens over wide dose ranges that can only be performed in culture, and evidence that an animal model (or patient) benefits from combination therapy does not discriminate among alternative mechanisms of benefit. Moreover, the assessment of synergistic interactions in new drug combinations is most often performed in culture, making our analysis of interactions in R-CHOP relevant to current drug discovery efforts.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>The role of multiple drug mechanisms in increasing the probability of cure by combination therapy.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Conceptual schematic of the role of multiple drug mechanisms, each subject to different mechanisms of resistance, in the eradication of drug resistant clones and cure of a patient’s cancer.

The effect of combination therapy in each patient depends on initial tumor burden and the magnitude of effect of each constituent drug (<italic>f<sub>1</sub></italic>, <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>, etc), which varies across patients. Whether a patient is cured depends on the number of cancer cells surviving all drugs (vertical gray line), which can be zero in some patients and large in others, even if drugs are always additive and lack cross-resistance. Consistent with the clinical history of DLBCL, increasing the number of individually efficacious and non-cross-resistant drugs in combination therapies is expected to increase the fraction of patients cured; although an added drug could fail to improve efficacy if it lacks individual efficacy or is cross-resistant with drugs already given. It remains unresolved whether chemotherapy must eradicate every cancer cell.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50036-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The fractional kill hypothesis and patient-to-patient variability</title><p>In their 1964 study on the curability of experimental leukemia, Skipper, Schabel, and Wilcox observed that a given dose of alkylating chemotherapy kills a fixed fraction of cancer cells regardless of population size (equivalently, the logarithm of the number of cancer cells is reduced by a fixed quantity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Skipper et al., 1964</xref>). ‘Fractional kill’, also called ‘log kill’, has been observed for many cancer therapies and is thought to reflect the impact of genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity on drug response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Spencer et al., 2009</xref>). Considered in the context of combination therapy, the number of ‘log kills’ contributed by each drug is expected to be arithmetically additive if the drugs have different resistance mechanisms, precisely as we have observed for R-CHOP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). For example, if each of two drugs elicit 99% kill (two log-kills), and the 1% surviving fractions overlap by no more than chance, as occurs with low cross-resistance, then only 1% of 1% of cancer cells will survive both drugs used in combination, resulting in 99.99% kill (2 + 2 = 4 log-kills). Thus, combinations of individually effective drugs with low cross-resistance can achieve high fractional tumor cell killing despite a lack of synergistic drug interaction.</p><p>Enhanced fractional kill can equivalently be understood from a pharmacological perspective. As discussed above, the dose response of DLBCL to R-CHOP is very close to additive, which is nonetheless a basis for therapeutic superiority over monotherapy. Because toxicities limit the maximum dose of each single agent, when the constituents of a combination have qualitatively different toxicities (as in R-CHOP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neal and Hoskin, 2009</xref>) they can be administered simultaneously at close to maximum tolerated doses. The result of a higher ‘sum of dose intensities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frei et al., 1998</xref>) is precisely what is predicted based on the fractional cell kill model, if it can be achieved at acceptable toxicity.</p><p>The results of this paper do not suggest that drug additivity and low cross-resistance are sufficient for cure: a critical feature of an additive drug combination is the absolute magnitudes of each drug’s efficacy (or log-kills). Because of the large numbers of cancer cells often present in DLBCL at the time of diagnosis (&gt;10<sup>10</sup>), and because the goal of a therapy is to get below a critical number of surviving cancer cells – less than one for the sake of argument – it is logical to presume that each drug in R-CHOP must contribute 2–3 log kills, on average, to achieve a cure. It remains unknown whether a cure requires that a chemotherapy regimen achieve less than one viable cell or if the immune system can clear malignant diseases when cell number falls below some threshold above one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frei, 1972</xref>). The conclusions in the current paper are agnostic with respect to this important issue.</p><p>How does patient-to-patient variability impact the success of therapies such as R-CHOP? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, we schematize the effect of both (i) inter-patient variability in drug response and (ii) addition of log-kills of different magnitudes. Across a population of patients, the absolute magnitude of each drug’s effect is expected to vary (denoted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> by lines of different lengths) as does initial tumor size (denoted by the differing origins of the lines). We have previously shown that inter-patient variability in sensitivity to different drugs explains some of the benefit of combination therapies, simply by increasing the probability of a good response to any one drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Palmer and Sorger, 2017</xref>). In therapies such as R-CHOP, each patient’s net response is the sum of single-drug responses, with each drug’s contribution varying from one patient to the next. Any single drug could be ineffective in some patients, even among patients who might be cured by the combined effect of other drugs in their treatment. Increasing the number of individually effective drugs increases the probability that a patient will have multiple strong responses achieving a curative degree of fractional kill (denoted by the heavy green line). These concepts are consistent with the historical facts that some cases of DLBCL are curable with three drugs (CVP), more are cured with four drugs (CHOP) and yet more with five (R-CHOP); but even with the best available therapy some patients are still not cured. Improving survival further by adding new drugs to R-CHOP has proven challenging, and prior to the introduction of Ritixumab the 7-drug ‘ProMACE-CytaBOM’ regimen failed to improve DLBCL survival relative to CHOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fisher et al., 1993</xref>). The reasons for this are likely to be multi-faceted: some drugs in ProMACE-CytaBOM may be ineffective in many patients; they may have overlapping toxicities leading to dose reductions and interruptions that compromise efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabanillas, 2007</xref>); and they may have overlapping resistance with standard therapies such that they fail to achieve greater fractional kill.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Systematic study of drug cross-resistance</title><p>With respect to drug synergy in combination therapy, a fundamental limitation of current tests for pharmacological interaction is they pertain to doses near the IC<sub>50</sub> value and are therefore relevant to the most drug-susceptible part of a cell population. In contrast, the primary obstacle to cure in most settings is thought to be acquired drug resistance caused by rare resistance mutations, which can arise even at very high doses. Unfortunately, systematic analysis of cross-resistance is very difficult using conventional cell culture techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Law, 1956</xref>), perhaps explaining why the ‘non-overlapping resistance’ hypothesis has not been extensively explored in pre-clinical drug development. The introduction of clone tracing and genome-wide CRISPR technologies fundamentally changes the situation: using these methods, cross-resistance can easily be studied for any new combination therapy active in cultured cells. Moreover, since screening for resistance is best performed on individual drugs and cross-resistance identified in a subsequent computational comparison, information on resistance genes can be acquired cumulatively, making cross-resistance analysis scalable to many drugs and many combinations. Consistent with this idea, clone tracing has been proposed as a general approach to identifying combination regimens with non-overlapping resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhang et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings supports this proposal and demonstrate the additional advantages of CRISPRi/a. We propose that screening for cross-resistance should become as routine in pre-clinical cancer pharmacology as screening for pharmacological interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

After being split from a common ancestor, cultures were propagated in parallel for at least one week before any experiment. Dose responses to single or multiple drugs were measured on DLBCL cells grown in sterile black polystyrene 384-well assay plates. Each well was inoculated with 30 μL of culture at density 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL, and promptly afterwards concentration gradients of drugs were added to wells by D300 digital dispenser (Hewlett-Packard). All chemotherapies were dispensed as DMSO solutions, while rituximab was prepared at 2.5 mg/mL with 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, with a 90 s incubation after pipetting into the print cassette for liquid to be drawn into the print head. At the highest dispensed concentration of rituximab, this conferred a final Triton X-100 concentration of 3 parts-per-million, which we confirmed did not by itself inhibit the growth of DLBCL cells. Wells on plate edges were filled but not used for any measurements. The drug dispensing arrangement of each plate was spatially randomized (and re-organized during data analysis); thereby any spatial bias across a plate becomes random error rather than systematic error across dose responses. Whole control plates of untreated cultures demonstrated no detectable row bias or column bias. Each plate contained &gt;40 untreated wells in randomized locations (not on edges) that served as no-inhibition controls. Assay plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, inside containers humidified by sterile wet gauze.

Following a 10 min incubation at room temperature, each well’s luminescence was measured in a plate reader (BioTek Synergy H1). At the time of the 384-well plates’ initial seeding, 1.5 mL cultures in 6-well plates were prepared from the same cell suspension, with separate cultures including or excluding 5% HCS. At the time of drug addition to plates, one of each such culture was harvested, and cell density was counted (Bio-Rad TC20 using trypan blue), and 72 hr later (at the time of CellTiter-Glo addition to 384-well plates) another such untreated 1.5mL culture was harvested and counted. From these density measurements we calculated the number of cell divisions occurring during the time of the assay, which was used during data analysis to determine Growth Rate (GR) metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hafner et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, we used GR = log<sub>2</sub>[(relative viability after treatment, according to CellTiter-Glo) × (cell number per μL of untreated control culture at t=72 h) / (cell number per μL of untreated control culture at t=0)] / log<sub>2</sub>[(cell number per μL of untreated control culture at t=72 h) / (cell number per μL of untreated control culture at t=0)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). By this measure GR=1 indicates full, uninhibited growth, GR=0 indicates complete growth arrest, or that proliferation and death are in balance (final cell count = initial cell count), and GR&lt;0 indicates net cytotoxicity (final cell count &lt; initial cell count); note that we did not impose an asymptotic lower bound of -1 as described by Hafner et al (this would be computed as 2<sup>GR</sup> – 1). HCS slightly speeded the division rate of Pfeiffer in the absence of drugs (17% shorter doubling time), and slightly diminished Pfeiffer sensitivity to 4-H-Cyclo. Pairwise drug interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) were measured over an 11×11 ‘checkerboard’ of logarithmically-spaced drug concentrations (5 points per order of magnitude), with 5% HCS in media only in interactions with rituximab (for this reason 4-H-Cyclo. is less potent in its isobologram with rituximab). The concentration range for each drug was selected based on preliminary dose-ranging studies so as to span a range from no detectable effect on growth to 98% reduction in cell number relative to untreated control cells, which corresponds to growth arrest plus 90% cell killing. High-order drug interactions, including pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), were measured over 14-point concentration gradients of one to five drugs, in all cases including 5% HCS so that drug sensitivity and drug-free cell division rate was consistent across conditions that would be compared in analysis. For these high-order interactions, each independent culture (biological replicate) was measured with cultures seeded into duplicate plates (plate-to-plate technical duplicates). Each of these four combinatorially complete drug response sets spanned two 384-well plates, which each contained a full set of single-drug gradients, and thus single-drug responses were in total measured in octuplicate. In the analysis, ‘100% luminescence’ was defined on a per-plate basis by the interquartile mean of at least 50 drug-free wells within that plate (excluding edges). For isobologram analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the topology of drug response over the 11×11 checkerboards was smoothed by a nearest-neighbor median filter; this will apply no change to a monotonic response surface, and only smoothes data in cases of locally non-monotonic (that is, jagged) dose response. The absence of this filter changes no conclusions regarding interaction types but yields occasionally jagged isoboles. Fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) are calculated by comparing dose responses of drug combinations to dose responses of their constituent single drugs. Given a mixture of drugs at a dose that causes 50% killing, FIC<sub>50</sub> is the sum of each drug’s concentration in that mix as a fraction of the single-agent doses producing the same effect: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>FIC</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>50</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>IC50</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>drug in combination</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>IC50</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>drug alone</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Lentiviral particles carrying ClonTracer were produced by calcium phosphate transfection of HEK293T cells (grown in DMEM with 10% FBS and 10 mM HEPES) with ClonTracer plasmid (10 μg per 10 cm dish) and lentiviral packaging and VSV-G plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.G (Cellecta CPCP-K2A; 10 μg of mix per 10 cm dish). Supernatants of transfected HEK293T cells were harvested at 48 hr and again at 72 hr post-transfection. Supernatants were pooled and clarified by centrifugation (500 × g, 10 min). Lentiviral particles were concentrated from supernatant by mixing three parts supernatant with one part Lenti-X concentrator solution (ClonTech 631231), incubating overnight at 4°C, centrifuging at 1500 × g and 4°C for 45 min, removing supernatant, and resuspending pellet at 1/100 original volume in PBS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>DNA barcoding of cell lines</title><p>10<sup>8</sup> Pfeiffer cells in complete media were treated with 100 μg/mL N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) for 4 hr; this was previously determined to be the highest dose tolerable by Pfeiffer for this duration without conferring detectable cell death. Cells were washed twice and returned to drug-free media for 72 hr to recover. 10<sup>7</sup> of these cells were infected with the ClonTracer lentiviral library by ‘spinoculation’. In this protocol, five microcentrifuge tubes were prepared containing 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells in 1 mL complete media, with 8 μg/mL polybrene, and lentivirus at a volume yielding a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 (per tube, this was 5 μL of 100 × concentrate of lentivirus containing supernatant; see measurement of MOI below). Tubes were incubated for 10 min (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>), and centrifuged at 800 × g and 37°C for 60 min. The supernatant was removed, and each cell pellet was resuspended in 4 mL complete media (5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL) and transferred to one well of a 6-well plate for continued growth (incubation at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Volume of lentivirus to produce this MOI had been previously determined by test infections of Pfeiffer with different volumes of lentiviral solution, after which the fraction of infected Pfeiffer cells were counted by flow cytometric analysis of the red fluorescent protein encoded by the ClonTracer cassette (BD LSRII, ex:488 nm, em:575/26 nm), having first gated out dead cells (Violet Viability kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific L34958, ex:405 nm, em:450/50 nm) (note, red fluorescence was not readily detectable until 2 days post-infection). From the measured fraction of fluorescent cells, MOI was calculated assuming a Poisson distribution of infection events. Cells were expanded in complete media for 3 days before applying selection for infected cells (which carry a puromycin resistance gene in the ClonTracer cassette): 3 days in 0.25 μg/mL, 3 days in 0.5 μg/mL, and then 2 days in 1 μg/mL puromycin. At this time flow cytometry could not detect a significant population of non-fluorescent cells. Barcoded Pfeiffer cells were grown without puromycin for an additional 4 days before selection experiments in R-CHOP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Selection for drug-resistant clones</title><p>From a well-mixed suspension of barcoded Pfeiffer cells, 10<sup>8</sup> cells were harvested and frozen for measurement of pre-treatment DNA barcode frequencies by sequencing. From the same suspension of cells and at the same time, 15 replicate cultures were prepared in 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks with 25 mL of complete media containing 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL of barcoded Pfeiffer cells. The total count of 12.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per flask is calculated to contain 99.999% of the 10<sup>6</sup> unique clones assuming equal initial abundance and random assortment into flasks. Because rituximab displayed an ‘inoculum effect’ with limited cytotoxicity at high cell density, three cultures for rituximab treatment were prepared at lower density and higher volume: 60 mL of barcoded Pfeiffer at 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL in 150 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks, in media supplemented with 5% HCS. The total count of 6 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells in each rituximab-treated flask is calculated to contain 99.7% of the 10<sup>6</sup> clones. For each drug, and DMSO control, three replicate flasks were treated for 72 hr at the following concentrations: 4 μM 4-H-Cyclo.; 50 nM doxorubicin; 5.6 nM vincristine; 16 μg/mL rituximab; 0.04% (i.e., 0.0004 v/v) DMSO (the highest DMSO concentration delivered with any drug). These drug concentrations were chosen on the basis of preliminary dose-finding experiments that identified them to be the highest concentration, in a series of 2-fold concentration steps, from which any surviving cells repopulated the culture within 2 weeks of recovery following the 72 hr drug treatment. Following treatment, cultures were washed twice and resuspended in drug-free media. During recovery, culture volumes were adjusted to maintain cell density within the recommended range (3–15 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL). No cells were disposed of except from the DMSO control flasks, which suffered no inhibition but were maintained for a ‘recovery’ time to match drug-treated flasks. Following recovery to a population size twice the initial inoculum, the recovered cultures were exposed to repeat treatments (each flask treated by the same drug as before), and recovery. Following the second recovery, cultures were centrifuged and cell pellets harvested for barcode sequencing. Prednisolone treatments were designed differently because it was not cytotoxic to cultured Pfeiffer cells (nor any of six other DLBCL cell lines) in concentrations up to 50 μM. Therefore, triplicate Pfeiffer cultures (25 mL in 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks) were maintained in 20 μM prednisolone for 20 days, with cell density maintained between 3–15 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL and with fresh prednisolone administered with media changes every 72 to 96 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This treatment duration was estimated to produce ≈20-fold enrichment of clones fully resistant to the mild inhibitory effect of prednisolone (≈13 divisions in 20 days ⇒ enrichment from resisting 20% growth inhibition = (1/0.8)<sup>13</sup> = 18-fold).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Barcode amplification and sequencing</title><p>To avoid contamination of pre-amplification materials with amplified DNA barcodes (which are approximately a billion-fold more concentrated), all materials, processes and equipment used prior to PCR amplification of ClonTracer barcodes were physically and temporally quarantined from all materials, processes and equipment used following PCR (distant benches and equipment, never both used on the same day). Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from frozen cell pellets with DNeasy Blood and Tissue extraction kits (Qiagen 69504), using the spin-column protocol including RNase A incubation. Four spin columns were used per sample of 10–15 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells; whereas the pre-treatment sample was a larger population of 3 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells applied to eight spin columns. DNA concentration was measured by SYBR green fluorescence with a λ dsDNA calibration curve (readings on BioTek Synergy H1). ClonTracer DNA barcodes consist of a repeating ‘Strong (G or C) - Weak (A or T)’ pattern with no detectable PCR amplification bias so that barcode counts measured by deep sequencing are proportional to clone abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhang et al., 2015</xref>). Barcodes were amplified from 20 μg of gDNA per sample, representing 3 million diploid genomes as template, with Q5 polymerase (New England Biolabs M0492). This was accomplished with parallel 50 μL reactions with 2 μg of template each. The pre-treatment sample was amplified from 40 μg of DNA, representing 6 million diploid genomes. Primer sequences were as described previously (see Supplemental Table 2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhang et al., 2015</xref>). Reaction success and yield was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR products of all treatment conditions were pooled and size selected (133 bp) by excision from an agarose gel (using SYBR-safe stain and blue LED illumination) with purification by QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen 28704). PCR product from pre-treatment cell sample was processed separately rather than pooled with others.

Absolute barcode counts in pre- and post-treatment samples were then converted to the fraction of all counts for that sample. Each barcode’s enrichment in a given drug treatment was calculated as post-treatment frequency divided by pre-treatment frequency. The biological triplicates of each treatment were merged to a single score by calculating the geometric mean enrichment. Each repeat was assigned a minimum enrichment of 1 when calculating geometric mean, to prevent severely penalizing barcodes that were not detected in one of three repeats; this is motivated by the statistical possibility that a barcode may be absent from any one flask’s inoculum. A small fraction of barcodes exhibited geometric mean enrichment &gt;1 in DMSO-treated cultures (1% of barcodes were enriched ≥10 fold), and therefore to normalize for these differences in fitness that are unrelated to drug sensitivity, we divided each barcode's enrichment scores in drug treatments by its enrichment in DMSO only when DMSO-enrichment was greater than 1 (enrichment scores in a drug treatment were not increased by having DMSO enrichment score less than 1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Lentivirus production for CRISPR reagents</title><p>HEK293T cells were transfected with the lentiviral plasmid of interest (as mentioned in relevant sections below), psPAX2 (Addgene #12260) and pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene #8454) in a 2:2:1 molar ratio using lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Individual indexed libraries were mixed in equimolar ratio and were further purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). After determining accurate concentrations by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using the NEBnext library quant kit for Illumina (NEB), pooled libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform using a 50 bp single read on a high output standard v4 flow cell with a 15–20% PhiX spike-in. A total of 51–72 million reads were obtained for each indexed screen (minimum coverage of 250×).</p><p>The fastq sequencing files were analyzed using a Python-based ScreenProcessing pipeline previously reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horlbeck et al. (2016)</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mhorlbeck/ScreenProcessing">https://github.com/mhorlbeck/ScreenProcessing</ext-link>) with the following modification introduced due to the use of a mix of forward primers with a staggered region of different length. All reads were first processed using Cutadapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martin, 2011</xref>) to remove the linker sequence in front of the sgRNA barcode in each read (<named-content content-type="sequence">CTTGGAGAACCACCTTGTTG</named-content>). To count the abundance of each sgRNA barcode in every sample, trimmed sequences were aligned to the library of protospacers present in the hCRISPRi_v2 or hCRISPRa_v2. Typically, 83–87% of the number of raw reads were aligned to the library of protospacers. The count files were next used to generate negative control genes, and calculate enrichment phenotypes and Mann-Whitney p-values as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horlbeck et al., 2016</xref>). To estimate technical noise in the screen, simulated negative control genes (the same number as that of real genes) were generated by randomly grouping 10 sgRNAs from the pool of ~4000 non-targeting control sgRNAs present in the libraries. The phenotypic effect of each sgRNA was quantified by the rho phenotype metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kampmann et al., 2013</xref>) which calculates the log2 fold change in abundance of an sgRNA between the treated and vehicle control samples, subtracting the equivalent median value for all 4000 non-targeting sgRNAs, and dividing by the number of population doubling differences between the treated and vehicle control populations. Similarly, untreated growth phenotypes (‘gamma’ phenotypes) can be calculated by a comparison of vehicle control and T0 samples; and ‘tau’ phenotypes can be calculated by a comparison of treated and T0 samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kampmann et al., 2013</xref>). For each gene (and simulated control gene), which is targeted by 10 sgRNAs, two metrics were calculated: (i) the mean of the strongest five rho phenotypes by absolute value, and (ii) the p-value of all 10 rho phenotypes compared to the 4000 non-targeting control sgRNAs (Mann-Whitney test). For genes with multiple independent transcription start sites (TSSs) targeted by the sgRNA libraries, the two metrics were calculated independently for each TSS and the TSS with the lowest Mann-Whitney p-value was chosen for further analysis. sgRNAs were required to have a minimum of 25 counts in at least one of the two conditions tested to be included in the analysis. To deal with the noise associated with potential low count numbers, a pseudocount of 10 was added to all counts. Genes that had less than eight sgRNA rho phenotypes were not included for further analysis. Read counts and phenotype scores for individual sgRNAs are available in the Supplemental Data. Gene-level phenotype scores and p-values are available in the Supplemental Data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>CRISPRi cyclophosphamide hypersensitivity screen</title><p>The additional CRISPRi cyclophosphamide screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) for identification of hypersensitive hits was performed and analyzed as described above with the following key modifications. Pfeiffer CRISPRi cells (2 × 10<sup>8</sup>) were transduced with the top five half library of hCRISPRi_v2 (Addgene #83969, that is five sgRNAs per gene) at an MOI of 0.3 in 200 mL culture medium + 8 μg/mL polybrene in 2 × 225 cm<sup>2</sup> cell culture flasks. 24 hr post-transduction, cells were harvested and resuspended in 300 mL fresh medium in 3 × 225 cm<sup>2</sup> cell culture flasks. Starting 48 hr post-transduction, the culture medium was exchanged daily and cells were maintained at 0.8 × 10<sup>6</sup>/mL in puromycin (0.6 μg/mL) in 300–400 mL. After 3 days in puromycin, cells were recovered for 1 day in puromycin-free medium. A T0 sample of 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells was harvested and stored at −80°C. The CRISPRi screen was initiated using 2.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells at 0.4 × 10<sup>6</sup>/mL in 1 × 225 cm<sup>2</sup> cell culture flask. For the duration of the screen, cells were maintained in 1 × 225 cm<sup>2</sup> cell culture flask at a minimum concentration of 0.4 × 10<sup>6</sup>/mL in 62.5 mL (minimum coverage of 250 cells per sgRNA) by exchanging the medium to fresh medium every 2 days. 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide (2.5 μM final concentration) was added on day 0 and day 8. The cyclophosphamide CRISPRi screen underwent 4.38 fewer population doublings than the DMSO control screen. At day 15, gDNA was extracted from 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells from each screen and half of that was used as template in PCR reactions (coverage of 250×). A total of 31–34 million reads were obtained for each indexed sample and 81–82% of those reads were aligned to the reference library of protospacers. Negative control genes were generated by randomly grouping five sgRNAs from the pool of ~2000 non-targeting control sgRNAs present in the half-library. For each gene (and simulated control gene), which is targeted by five sgRNAs, two metrics were calculated: (i) the mean of the strongest three rho phenotypes by absolute value, and (ii) the p-value of all five rho phenotypes compared to the 2000 non-targeting control sgRNAs (Mann-Whitney test). Low count numbers were dealt with by adding a pseudocount of 1 to all zero counts. Gene ontology analysis was performed on the full output list of genes ranked by hypersensitivity score using GOrilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eden et al., 2009</xref>). The reported p-value is the enrichment p-value computed according to the GOrilla algorithm. The 'FDR q-value' represents the correction of the p-value for multiple testing hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Validation of CRISPR screens</title><p>Validation of the genome-wide screens was performed by building and characterizing individual knockdown (n = 9) and overexpression (n = 8) cell lines identified in the screens as single-drug or multi-drug resistant. The target sgRNA sequences were selected from the genome-wide sgRNA libraries based on the strength of the observed screen phenotype. sgRNAs were cloned into expression vectors, and cell lines were built and characterized as described above (see ‘Evaluation of CRISPRi/a cell lines using sgRNAs targeting individual genes’ and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for oligonucleotide sequences). Knockdown sgRNA lentivirus particles were transduced into Pfeiffer CRISPRi cells and overexpression sgRNA lentivirus particles were transduced into K562 CRISPRa and into a polyclonal population of Pfeiffer CRISPRa. This population of cells was built in the same way as K562 CRISPRa (see ‘Generation of Cas9-expressing cell lines’) except that Pfeiffer cells (ATCC CRL-2632) were used and a polyclonal population of cells with high GFP (top 25%) and BFP (top 50%) levels was purified using one round of FACS.</p><p>The sensitivity of each cell line to R-CHOP drugs was determined by measuring a 13–17 point dose response curve for each drug in a similar way as described above (see ‘Measurement of drug-drug interactions’). Data from two sets of biological replicates composed each of two technical replicates was analyzed to compute an IC50 and 95% confidence intervals, by fitting to a sigmoidal dose-response with the ‘NonlinearModelFit’ function in Wolfram Mathematica 12. Drug IC50s of unperturbed cells were determined from data of two independent non-targeting sgRNAs each measured in two biological replicates composed of two technical replicates (n = 8).</p><p>In order to detect differences in drug sensitivities of individual overexpression cell lines over a longer period of time than 3 days, co-culture competition experiments were performed. Individual overexpression Pfeiffer CRISPRa cell cultures were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with a Pfeiffer CRISPRa cell culture transduced with a non-targeting sgRNA control. Co-cultures were grown in 12-well plates in 1 mL complete medium over the course of 16 days, maintained at a density between 0.1–1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup>/mL and were treated with pulses of R, C, H or O. Drug-treated co-cultures underwent significantly less population doublings than a DMSO-treated control (between 4.5 and 6.5 less population doublings). Genomic DNA was isolated from samples of each co-culture taken at T = 0, and T = 16 days for each drug (or DMSO) selection (0.5–1.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells) using the QiAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen 51304) (48 samples from eight co-cultures). The composition of each co-culture was determined by qPCR amplification of the sgRNA barcodes in each gDNA sample using sgRNA-specific forward primers and a common reverse primer (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). All nine pairs of primers were specific to their target sgRNA barcode as no unspecific amplification of other barcodes was observed and qPCR amplification was linear (efficiency: 0.9–1.1). Each co-culture gDNA sample was probed with a primer pair against the targeting sgRNA barcode and a primer pair against the non-targeting sgRNA barcode. The ratio of the two cell lines was determined from the difference in C<sub>T</sub> values. Any change in fitness due to individual gene overexpression is detected by comparison of the DMSO sample at T = 16 days and the sample at T = 0. Changes in drug resistance due to individual gene overexpression are detected by comparison of drug-treated samples at T = 16 days and DMSO samples at T = 16 days. Values reported (N<sub>mutant</sub>/N<sub>control</sub>) are from three technical replicates of the qPCR quantification and are determined by the difference in C<sub>T</sub> values between the targeting and non-targeting sgRNA between drug-treated and DMSO-treated samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cross-resistance analysis of CRISPR screens</title><p>For each gene, a single aggregate resistance score was calculated by multiplying the two metrics determined in the screen processing pipeline (resistance score = -log<sub>10</sub>(Mann-Whitney p-value)×mean of the strongest five rho phenotypes). Genes required eight or more observed sgRNA rho phenotype scores in a specific screen for inclusion in the analysis. In order to account more accurately for the technical noise in the screen, 10 random sets of ≈19,000 simulated control genes were generated (matching the number of actual gene targets). A resistance score was then calculated for each simulated control gene in all 10 sets for all the drugs tested (four for CRISPRi and three for CRISPRa). Genes that have a resistance score above a specific cutoff in at least two conditions tested are defined as ‘cross-resistant’. The cutoff for cross-resistance analysis was determined by systematically quantifying the number of simulated control genes that would score as cross-resistant over the full range of resistance score cutoffs (in 0.01 increments). We selected a cutoff that scored on average over the 10 sets of control genes a single (or less than one) double resistant negative control simulated gene over all possible two drug combinations. Cross-hypersensitivity analyses were performed in an analogous way (the hypersensitivity score was calculated in the same way as the resistance score).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Quantifying cross-resistance in clone tracing and CRISPR screens</title><p>Strength of cross-resistance for different sets of drugs was quantified as a weighted sum of the maximum and minimum cross-resistance scenarios. Given rates of single-drug resistance 10<sup>-A</sup> and 10<sup>-B</sup> to drugs <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>, the theoretical minimum rate of cross-resistance is 10<sup>–A–B</sup> (this scenario is indicated by cross-resistance parameter ξ<bold> =</bold> 0), and the theoretical maximum rate of cross-resistance is min(10<sup>–A</sup> or 10<sup>–B</sup>) (this scenario is indicated by cross-resistance parameter ξ = 1). Given an observed frequency of multi-drug resistance (MDR), cross-resistance ξ is computed as the solution to the equation: MDR frequency = ξ × minimum(10<sup>–A</sup> or 10<sup>–B</sup>) + (1 – ξ)× 10<sup>–A–B</sup>. This solution is ξ = (10<sup>–A–B</sup> – MDR) / (10<sup>–A–B</sup> – minimum(10<sup>–A</sup> or 10<sup>–B</sup>)).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank F Stegmeier and C Bhang for ClonTracer, A Letai and A Eberly Puleo for rituximab, and also M Chung, L Albacker, L Maliszewski, M Cokol, S Chopra, and K Subramanian for helpful discussions.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>is a member of the SAB or Board of Directors of Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Glencoe Software, Applied Biomath and RareCyte Inc and has equity in these companies.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The work addresses an important question in the field of combination cancer therapy: whether successful treatment requires that the individual drugs in combination have synergistic activity, as is often assumed. Using three experimental approaches (drug interaction analysis, clone tracing and CRISPRa and CRISPRi screening), your group provides compelling evidence that drug synergy is not required. Rather, low levels of cross-resistance and additivity between the drugs are sufficient for cure, as demonstrated using Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma and R-CHOP combination therapy as a model. As highlighted in the discussion, it will be interesting to extend this work to the in vivo setting where multiple immuno-oncology combinations are now being investigated.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A curative combination therapy achieves high fractional cell killing through low cross-resistance and drug additivity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Charles Sawyers as the Reviewing Editor and Eduardo Franco as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Palmer and colleagues use three experimental approaches: drug interaction analysis, clone tracing and CRISPR screening, to argue that a successful combination therapy does not require drug synergy, as is commonly thought, but low levels of cross-resistance between the drugs. They demonstrate this principle using R-CHOP, a combination therapy that is often successful in curing Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma. All three reviewers found the topic to be thought-provoking and the experimental approach to be clever with convincing results. We will consider the manuscript for publication if you can address the points below in a revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) More precise definition of synergy versus additivity:</p><p>As the notion of drug synergy (as well as additivity and antagonism) is at the very core of the paper, a discussion of the precise definitions of synergy, additivity and antagonism in the Introduction or at the beginning of Results would be very useful.

The Results section now includes the precise – and straightforward – mathematical definitions of Bliss independence and Loewe additivity (Results section paragraph three).

Cmax values lie at the upper end of the experimentally tested ranges, which we consider appropriate given that Cmax is by definition the peak in concentration. Rituximab is the only case in which Cmax is much greater than the experimental range at which we observed potent killing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Resistance experiments were not done using the entire combination:</p><p>The authors looked for resistance mutations to a drug combination by applying drugs individually and identifying DNA barcodes of mutant cells that were significantly enriched in two or more conditions.

This was necessary for the obvious reason that we require regrowth to allow cells to be recovered for barcode sequencing. Two-fold increases in drug concentration were observed to leave no survivors, which we think is related to the observation that DLBCL cultures very rarely survive attempts at single-cell cloning (in the absence of chemotherapy). The reasons for this are therefore likely to be unrelated to drug-mediated cell killing and instead, likely reflect autocrine conditioning of media or some other requirement for a minimum number of cells in a well.</p><p>Thus, a ‘full-dose’ combination that achieves a greater fractional kill than monotherapy, and reduces the number of surviving cells to the point at which ‘single cell cloning’ is a problem, would be scored as an absence of multi-drug resistance. In this case, H<sub>0</sub> would be rejected for what are likely to be artefactual reasons. An alternative approach could be to apply the combination at lower dosage, to impose an overall similar fractional kill. Figure 3B is intended to illustrate why in a lower-dosage combination that leaves measurable survivors, barcode enrichment could equally result from modest multi-drug resistance, or strong resistance only to one drug in the combination. Thus a measurement of barcode enrichment after a treatment with multiple drugs cannot clearly distinguish between multi-drug resistant clones and single-drug resistant clones. For these reasons we believe that the most technically robust way to measure cross-resistance between drugs is to profile resistance to every drug individually. This, and not any technical complexity, is the reason we did not test the full R-CHOP combination at high dose.</p><p>We have edited the results to note these technical points and to point out that stochastic drift in single-drug experiments may cause an underestimate of both single- and multi-drug resistance frequencies. The revision also notes aspects of experimental design, including our use of large populations and biological triplicate experiments, that are intended to minimize the loss of meaningful signals due to stochastic drift.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Implications for in vivo setting, where synergy may be relevant:</p><p>The authors sufficiently describe issues related to the use of rituximab and prednisone in cell culture studies.

The reviewers are correct that drugs working via immune mechanisms cannot be studied in cell monoculture. The discussion has been revised to note that there may be mechanisms of synergy or antagonism specific to the in vivo setting, particularly those that may derive from immunological effects that we cannot measure in cell culture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Revisions to the model figure:</p><p>The &quot;model&quot; figure is somewhat problematic given the data in this manuscript and the previous Cell manuscript by these authors.

The impact of patient-to-patient variability and independent drug action explored in our Cell paper and the additive kill model in the current paper <italic>are</italic> conceptually compatible, and while they do not always manifest in the same clinical scenarios, the revised manuscript presents a reconciliation of these concepts (Figure 9). We summarize below this reconciliation as explained in the revised text.</p><p>In our prior study we found that patient-to-patient variability in ‘best single agent response’ (reviewer’s point B) was able to explain increased response rates and prolonged PFS achieved with combinations used to treat essentially incurable metastatic carcinomas. However, ‘best single agent response’ is insufficient to explain cures, because single chemotherapies cure almost no cases of advanced cancer. In curative therapies, multiple agents must be active in each patient and they must achieve an effect superior to the best monotherapy; the data in the current paper argues that for R-CHOP the nature of this superiority is that the drugs are additive with respect to cell killing (not synergistic).</p><p>In summarizing this concept, Figure 9A illustrates drug additivity, free of the complications of patient variability. It represents the simplest way in which active agents can ‘add up’ on a ‘log-kill’ scale.</p><p>The revised Figure 9B introduces the complication of patient-to-patient variability in sensitivity to each drug. In this case, multiple drugs are active in each patient but the magnitude of activity is variable across patients. In some cases, we hypothesize, patients may even receive no benefit from some of the components of the combination. In principle though, the success of a multidrug regimen does not require that every drug be active in all patients; instead, it need only be true that patients experience sufficient activity from the set of drugs that will ‘add up’ to a curative fractional kill. Why some drugs act in an independent manner and others are additive is not addressed by the current experimental study of R-CHOP. We speculated at the end of our Cell article that drugs may be additive or synergistic in the subset of patients in which both are significantly active, but in the metastatic cancers analyzed in that study, response rates were generally low and too few patients were responsive to <italic>both</italic> drugs for additivity to be statistically detectable in a trial. Whether this is a correct or sufficient explanation is unknown.</p><p>We are working to formally codify these concepts in a future (theory) manuscript but hope the explanation above suffices, in combination with revisions to Figure 9B and changes made to the text.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ exhortation to better explain the reconciliation of these concepts and hope to have achieved this with the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, it is unclear what the authors mean by &quot;cross-resistance&quot; in the model figure.

The caption of Figure 9 has been revised to specify that in this context we refer to heterogeneity within a given patient; low cross-resistance in this context results in addition of ‘log-kills’.</p></body></sub-article></article>
