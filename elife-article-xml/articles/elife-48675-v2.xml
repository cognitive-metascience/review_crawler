AdipoRs, calreticulin, and T-cadherin. To identify the major binding partner of circulating native adiponectin, we expressed these receptors on the surface of HEK293 cells. Adiponectin, either that in mouse or human serum, purified from serum, or produced by mammalian cells, bound to cells expressing T-cadherin, but not to those expressing AdipoR1 or calreticulin. The stable introduction of T-cadherin and AdipoR1 into CHO cells resulted in the cell surface localization of these receptors. Native adiponectin in serum bound to cells expressing T-cadherin, not to those expressing AdipoR1. The knockdown of T-cadherin, but not AdipoRs resulted in the significant attenuation of native adiponectin binding to C2C12 myotubes. Therefore, native adiponectin binding depended on the amount of T-cadherin expressed in HEK293 cells, CHO cells, and C2C12 myotubes. Collectively, our mammalian cell-based studies suggest that T-cadherin is the major binding partner of native adiponectin in serum.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adiponectin</kwd><kwd>T-cadherin</kwd><kwd>calreticulin</kwd><kwd>binding</kwd><kwd>receptors</kwd><kwd>cell surface</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#16K09802</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kita</surname><given-names>Shunbun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#16K09801</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maeda</surname><given-names>Norikazu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#15H04853</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shimomura</surname><given-names>Iichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CREST</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shimomura</surname><given-names>Iichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Uehara Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shimomura</surname><given-names>Iichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Binding study of native adiponectin existing in serum supported the importance of T-cadherin but not AdipoRs nor calreticulin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adiponectin is a circulating factor that is secreted from adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Maeda et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nakano et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Scherer et al., 1995</xref>). Three types of receptors have been identified for this uniquely abundant circulating protein: AdipoRs, calreticulin, and T-cadherin.</p><p>AdipoR1 was discovered by expression cloning from a C2C12 myotube cDNA library through evaluations of the binding of biotin-labeled globular adiponectin produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> as bait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yamauchi et al., 2003</xref>). It belongs to the PAQR receptor family, which has a 7-transmembrane domain with an opposite topology to the GPCR family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Calreticulin is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal Ca2+-buffering chaperone that exists in the ER of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mendlov and Conconi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Michalak et al., 2009</xref>). Cell surface exposure to calreticulin was initially reported to initiate the clearance of viable or apoptotic cells through binding to LRP on phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gardai et al., 2005</xref>). A subsequent study demonstrated that adiponectin opsonized apoptotic cells, and the phagocytosis of cell corpses was mediated by the binding of adiponectin expressed in insect cells or <italic>E. coli</italic> to calreticulin on the macrophage cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Takemura et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>T-Cadherin was discovered by expression cloning from a C2C12 myotube cDNA library through evaluations of cell binding to coated recombinant adiponectin produced in HEK293 mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hug et al., 2004</xref>). It is classified as a member of the classical cadherins, such as E-cadherin and N-cadherin, due to its high homology of five extracellular cadherin repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hulpiau and van Roy, 2009</xref>). However, T-cadherin is a unique cadherin with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor on its C terminus and does not possess the transmembrane or intracellular domain generally required for signaling, which may hinder the function of T-cadherin as an adiponectin receptor.</p><p>The adiponectin protein accumulates in tissues, such as the heart, muscle, and vascular endothelium, through binding with T-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Denzel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fujishima et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Matsuda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Parker-Duffen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tanaka et al., 2019</xref>). In T-cadherin null mice, the accumulation of the adiponectin protein was completely absent in these tissues, and, thus, HMW multimer adiponectin accumulated in blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Denzel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Matsuda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Parker-Duffen et al., 2013</xref>). These findings were in contrast to the lack of significant changes in plasma adiponectin levels in AdipoR1- and R2-double knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yamauchi et al., 2007</xref>). Human SNP studies including GWAS also indicated the importance of T-cadherin, but not AdipoRs or calreticulin, for plasma adiponectin levels, cardiovascular diseases, and glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Buniello et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dastani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kitamoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Morisaki et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies have attributed the functions of adiponectin to either of these receptors by showing a decrease in their functions via the genetic loss or mRNA knockdown of their receptors, including AdipoRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Straub and Scherer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yamauchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yamauchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yamauchi et al., 2007</xref>), calreticulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Takemura et al., 2007</xref>), and T-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Denzel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fujishima et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Parker-Duffen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tanaka et al., 2019</xref>). However, the direct binding of native adiponectin in biological fluids, such as serum, to its receptor warrants further study.</p><p>We herein demonstrated that native adiponectin in serum bound to cells expressing T-cadherin, but not to those expressing AdipoRs or calreticulin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We investigated the binding of native adiponectin in serum to three adiponectin receptors by transiently overexpressing the cDNA of each receptor in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We directly examined mouse serum as the ligand solution, including the most native adiponectin, purified adiponectin from mouse serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukuda et al., 2017</xref>), and full-length recombinant adiponectin produced in HEK293 cells. Native-PAGE showed differences in the distribution of molecular species between serum or purified adiponectin and recombinant adiponectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Recombinant adiponectin contained a lower amount of HMW multimer adiponectin than mouse serum and purified adiponectin from serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Transient transfection resulted in the successful overexpression of each receptor based on their expression levels quantified by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The treatment of cells with different preparations of adiponectin at 4Â°C for 1 hr resulted in the binding of prepared adiponectin only to cells expressing mouse T-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Mouse serum and purified adiponectin showed similar binding, whereas recombinant adiponectin containing a lower amount of 6-mer and the HMW multimer exhibited markedly weaker binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The results of a native-PAGE analysis showed that more than 6-mer of multimeric adiponectin specifically bound to cells expressing mouse T-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), which is consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukuda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hug et al., 2004</xref>).

We previously reported that purified recombinant T-cadherin bound purified adiponectin with an affinity of KDÂ =Â 1.0 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukuda et al., 2017</xref>). The present results showed the saturable binding of native adiponectin in serum to cells expressing T-cadherin, which is consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukuda et al., 2017</xref>). Regarding AdipoR1 and calreticulin, three possibilities have been proposed: they were not effectively translated, were not effectively presented on the cell surface, or did not support the binding of native adiponectin in serum to cells.</p><p>To confirm that all receptors were effectively translated and presented on the cell surface, we expressed affinity-tagged receptors in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We added a high-affinity PA tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fujii et al., 2014</xref>) to the N termini of T-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ciatto et al., 2010</xref>) and calreticulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mendlov and Conconi, 2010</xref>) and to the C terminus of AdipoR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yamauchi et al., 2014</xref>) such that each receptor exposed the PA tag outside of the cell. Transiently expressing cells were surface-biotinylated, and lysates were applied to streptavidin beads. Total cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> Total) and streptavidin-captured cell-surface proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> Cell surface) were analyzed by Western blotting. The anti-PA-tag antibody NZ-1 detected similar levels of all receptors in total cell lysates and cell surface fractions, indicating that these receptors were successfully translated and expressed on the cell surface. Although AdipoR1 poorly migrated on the SDS-PAGE gel, this may have been due to heat-induced protein crosslinking or aggregate formation during sample processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tanford and Reynolds, 1976</xref>). The correct sorting of this protein to the cell surface suggested that AdipoR1 was expressed with the correct conformation on the cell surface. Under these conditions, a binding study with mouse serum revealed the dose-dependent binding of native adiponectin to cells expressing PA-tagged T-cadherin, but not to those expressing PA-tagged calreticulin or AdipoR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

The successful expression of the receptors in these cells was confirmed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Serum adiponectin binding was only observed on cells expressing PA-tagged T-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In contrast, the binding of the PA tag antibody NZ-1 to intact cells was detected on cells expressing PA-tagged T-cadherin and AdipoR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These results demonstrated that AdipoR1 was stably expressed on the cell surface with the expected topology of the PA tag outside of cells, but did not induce the binding of native adiponectin in serum. Calreticulin was not recognized by NZ-1 in the binding study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), suggesting that the PA tag at the N terminus of calreticulin was not accessible by NZ-1.</p><p>This may have been due to some steric hindrance because calreticulin with the N-terminal PA tag was detected on Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and immunostaining of fixed and permeabilized cells by NZ-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Calreticulin is essentially an ER-resident protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gardai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Takemura et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, stably expressed calreticulin in CHO cells may not have been sorted to the cell surface.</p><p>Based on these different approaches, we concluded that the expression of AdipoR1 may not promote native adiponectin binding. We also concluded that if calreticulin is expressed on the cell surface, it may not promote native adiponectin binding. The present results demonstrated that only the expression of T-cadherin on the cell surface may increase the binding of native adiponectin.</p><p>Since the above studies employed artificial expression systems, and AdipoR1 and T-cadherin were both identified from the C2C12 cDNA libraryÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hug et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yamauchi et al., 2003</xref>), we examined native adiponectin binding to C2C12 myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The absolute expression level of T-cadherin mRNA in differentiated C2C12 myotubes was markedly higher than that of AdipoRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We investigated the knockdown effects of these receptors on the binding of serum-containing adiponectin in C2C12 myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). The introduction of RNAi before differentiation resulted in the effective knockdown of T-cadherin, AdipoR1, or AdipoR1 and R2 after 3 days of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The knockdown of T-cadherin resulted in significant reductions in adiponectin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). The knockdown of AdipoR1 or both AdipoR1 and R2 did not significantly reduce adiponectin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Although slight decreases were observed in adiponectin binding by the knockdown of AdipoR1 or both AdipoR1 and R2, the strong correlation (R<sup>2</sup>Â =Â 0.9896) between T-cadherin expression and adiponectin binding at all experimental points suggested that these changes were due to the decreased expression of T-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Collectively, these results indicated that native adiponectin binding also depends on the amount of T-cadherin expressed in C2C12 myotubes.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48675.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Knockdown of T-cadherin but not Adipors nor calreticulin affected native adiponectin binding to c2c12 myotubes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental outline.

The expression of T-cadherin gave adiponectin binding, which is consistent with our previous finding showing that recombinant T-cadherin binds HMW adiponectin in a 1: one ratio with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukuda et al., 2017</xref>). There was no detectable binding of adiponectin on the AdipoR or calreticulin. AdipoR was discovered by expression cloning. The overexpression of AdipoR was expected to promote ligand binding. The initial discovery of AdipoRs also indicated that HEK293 cells overexpressing AdipoRs bound <italic>E. coli</italic> recombinant globular adiponectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yamauchi et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, difficulties are associated with speculating about the much weaker affinity or the requirement for some âaccessoryâ proteins to confer adiponectin binding activity to AdipoRs.</p><p>Since numerous studies indicated that AdipoRs mediate adiponectin signaling in a number of cell types, an additional activating mechanism for AdipoRs by adiponectin, thatÂ is, the reductive or proteolytic generation of the trimer, monomer, and/or globular adiponectin, may exist. The results of the present study, which focused on the direct binding of native HMW adiponectin, may indicate the activation of AdipoRs by low-molecular-weight (LMW) forms. On the other hand, in the case of calreticulin, this was evidenced by a neutralizing antibody treatment inhibiting the adiponectin interaction with cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Takemura et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, some âaccessoryâ proteins may be required to confer adiponectin binding activity to calreticulin.</p><p>T-cadherin binds clinically important HMW multimer adiponectin with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukuda et al., 2017</xref>) and mediates adiponectin-induced exosome biogenesis and ceramide efflux to exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Obata et al., 2018</xref>). Such exosome-effect required T-cadherin, but not AdipoRs. The exosome mediates cell-cell communication by transferring signaling components such as microRNAs, bioactive lipids, and proteins in addition to its role in waste disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kita et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>). The stimulation of exosome biogenesis by adiponectin was the first demonstration of a secreted factor modulating exosome biogenesis and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Obata et al., 2018</xref>). Adiponectin in serum or purified native adiponectin together with T-cadherin accumulated inside multivesicular bodies, the site of exosome generation, both in cultured endothelial cells and the in vivo wild-type mouse aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Obata et al., 2018</xref>). The systemic level of exosomes in blood was decreased by approximately 50% following the genetic loss of adiponectin or T-cadherin, but was increased by the overexpression of adiponectin in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Obata et al., 2018</xref>). The molecular mechanisms by which adiponectin stimulates exosome biogenesis are currently under investigation. We speculate that native HMW adiponectin with its multimeric structure may cause the higher-order clustering of T-cadherin, a membrane-anchored protein that resides in lipid rafts, and, thus, may stimulate exosome biogenesis. Adiponectin-induced increases in exosome biogenesis were not restricted to cultured endothelial cells because they were also observed in C2C12-differentiated myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tanaka et al., 2019</xref>) These findings support T-cadherin mediating adiponectin functions as a receptor for native HMW multimer adiponectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kita et al., 2019</xref>). The present results may further contribute to clarifying the activating mechanism of AdipoRs by LMW adiponectin, generated by reduction or proteolytic cleavage, followed by HMW adiponectin binding to cell surface T-cadherin.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editorsâ note: this article was originally rejected after discussions between the reviewers, but the authors were invited to resubmit after an appeal against the decision.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Native adiponectin existing in serum binds with T-cadherin, but not with AdipoRs nor Calreticulin&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Morris Birnbaum (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>This study focused on elucidating the physiological binding partner(s) for native adiponectin. With cell culture based studies, they have revealed that serum adiponectin exclusively bound to T-cadherin, but not to the &quot;classical&quot; AdipoR receptors nor Calreticulin. The strength of the study is that they have shown binding of &quot;native&quot; adiponectin to T-cadherin as this has not been shown before. However, the study has several weaknesses which preclude publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. First, the binding system used is somewhat &quot;dirty&quot; limiting careful biochemical analyses. Second, the overall advance of the study is unclear as it has already been shown that adiponectin binds to T-cadherin. Third, all reviewers highlighted weaknesses with the binding assay pinpointing the inability of the authors to reach saturation binding, an essential criterion for a receptor-ligand interaction. Finally, as highlighted by reviewer 1, much more work is required to prove a lack of interaction between adiponectin and the other receptor systems.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript presents data showing serum adiponectin binds to T-cadherin overexpressed in HEK293 cells as well as endogenous T-cadherin in C2C12 cells. These findings are solid and convincing since in such experiments adiponectin is in native forms and being adsorbed directly in such forms. The claim that T-cadherin is a &quot;receptor&quot; for adiponectin is justified by these data and conforms to other solid papers in the field. These data do not add much to the literature as it is already established that adiponectin binds to T-cadherin, although this is a new way of demonstrating the phenomenon. But the claim is convincing.</p><p>On the other hand, the failure to show binding of serum adiponectin to other purported receptor molecules (R1 and R2 as well as Calreticulin) is more difficult to interpret. The claim that these are not true receptors could be true, but it is impossible to prove a negative. What if there are &quot;accessory&quot; proteins required to confer binding activity to these other putative receptors? Expression of the receptors alone would not be sufficient to display binding in that case. Normally, ligand-receptor interactions are quantified by binding of pure ligand with pure receptor, which allows binding constants to be calculated. This is not the case here, since the ligand is in a complex mixture (serum) and the &quot;receptor&quot; is also within a complex structure (cell membrane). These complications raise concerns about the conclusion, and have caused other groups to use gene KO mice to interrogate putative &quot;receptor&quot; function.</p><p>On balance, this paper should be published since it raises an important question for the field. Publication would also highlight the need to determine binding affinities for the putative receptors. However, the study doesn't add mechanistic information to the field, and doesn't define why dysfunction of adiponectin occurs when the R1/R2 receptors are deleted in mice. For those reasons, it could be argued that this paper belongs in a specialty journal.</p><p>One other point is that careful editing of this manuscript for proper English usage would be mandatory prior to publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, Kita et al. have focused on the elucidation of physiological binding partner(s) for native adiponectin. With cell culture based studies, they have revealed that serum adiponectin exclusively bound to T-cadherin, but not to AdipoR nor Calreticulin. While this study contains potential interests, several issues need to be properly addressed to enhance the significance of this study.</p><p>1) Due to molecular structure of T-cadherin protein, it remains elusive to guess the mode(s) of action for adiponectin signaling. More discussion and/or speculation would be more helpful for general readers to understand adiponectin action and signaling.</p><p>2) Along the same line, it is unclear whether T-cadherin might behave as a typical receptor protein for adiponectin. For example, typical receptors are saturated by ligands. However, provided data (Figures 1, 2 and 3) did not show any saturation pattern nor dose response. This issue needs to be properly addressed by experimental data.</p><p>3) The authors demonstrated that native adiponectin bound to T-cadherin. Have you compared the binding affinity with native and recombinant adiponectin proteins to three potential receptors? If there is any difference, it needs to be described and discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In spite of the identification of adiponectin quite a number of years ago, the nature of its receptors remains controversial. The rationale for the current study is that the major criterion for evaluating a potential receptor should be that it binds native adiponectin and not just recombinant product. This seems quite reasonable and therefore the strength of the paper is that it seeks to accomplish that. The weakness is that the nature of the protocol involves performing the binding study on a very complex, on might say &quot;dirty&quot; system, in which it is challenging to infer the actual biochemical even being measured. At a minimum, the authors' need to be much more precise in their language and judicious in what they claim the data show. For example, the authors state &quot;These results clearly indicate that T-cadherin can bind native adiponectin.&quot; This is a gross overinterpretation of this experiment. What the authors show is that overexpression of T-cadherin in cells allows them to bind increased amounts of adiponectin. There is no information to indicated that the adiponectin is binding directly to T-cadherin or, for that matter, that T-cadherin is involved in the binding of hormone. This interpretation might be plausible, but it is far from proven.</p><p>The authors do demonstrate that the binding is concentration dependent, which is important for true receptor binding, but they do not establish saturability, which is essential to arguing the physiological relevance of the event being measured. Thus, it would add to the weight of the argument of they could show a full binding curve up to the point of saturability. It is relatively straightforward to vary expression to make sure the receptor level is low enough that it can be saturated with the adiponectin levels present in serum.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Congratulations, we are pleased to inform you that your article, &quot;Native adiponectin in serum binds to cells expressing T-cadherin, but not AdipoRs or calreticulin&quot;, has been accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> as a Short Report article.</p><p>While the reviewers still identified some shortcomings with your study, it was generally considered that your paper makes an important contribution to the field. In particular, there is an abundance of evidence in the literature to show that adiponectin signals via the ADIPOR1 and 2 receptors. Your work questions the breadth of this conclusion and shows that as a minimum the field needs to carefully consider the role of this alternate adiponectin receptor, T cadherin. This paper clearly shows that adiponectin binds to T-cadherin with considerable affinity under somewhat physiological conditions. As to whether the origin or nature of the ligand influences the binding specificity is unclear but this is certainly something important to consider that this work highlights. While, as pointed out by two of the reviewers, there is a long way to go to ascertain how the adiponectin-T-cadherin interaction signals in cells this is perhaps something for a future study.</p><p>Please address as best you can each of the points raised by the reviewers as noted below. Also I noted that some restructuring of your figures is necessary to consolidate space and to improve the presentation of the data. Furthermore, I still believe you could shorten the article without loss of clarity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper provides data supporting the view that binding of adiponectin to cells is through T-cadherin rather than other purported receptor types. There are three issues that diminish the impact of the paper:</p><p>1) The first paragraph is an overly long &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; type of Introduction that should be heavily edited and organized into multiple paragraphs around the several discrete ideas.</p><p>2) The major impact of this study would be that bio-effects of adiponectin are mediated through T-cadherin, not the other putative receptors, but unfortunately no bio-effects are studied in these experiments. While the results are very interesting and certainly provocative, a definitive experiment on this key point showing that T-cadherin but not the other receptors mediates important bio-effects is missing.</p><p>3) The cell biology/microscopy data are too limited. Multiple fields should be shown and appropriate controls with null signal. The data should be quantified from many fields as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this work, Kita et al. have demonstrated that native adiponectin would exclusively bind to T-cadherin. With cell culture model, they showed that serum or purified adiponectin preferentially bound to T-cadherin but not to AdipoR nor Calreticulin. Although they provided more data and tried to strengthen Discussion part in the resubmitted manuscript, it still has technical limitations to reach the firm conclusion.</p><p>1) Although it has been reported that adiponectin binds to AdipoRs, calreticulin, and T-cadherin, they argued that the major binding protein for native adiponectin is T-cadherin. If the binding affinity of native adiponectin to adipoRs or calreticulin would be much weaker than T-cadherin, it seems that the experimental condition in this study might be too harsh to detect weak interaction with others. They have to adopt alternative methods to affirm the extent of protein interactions. Along the same line, they need to measure/compare binding affinity of recombinant adiponectin with other proteins including AdipoR and Calreticulin.</p><p>2) To convince that native adiponectin exclusively binds to T-cadherin, it is crucial to provide positive control data.</p><p>3) It has been suggested to examine intracellular signaling cascades such as phospho-AMPK and phospho-p38 upon the interaction between native adiponectin and potential receptors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I was ambivalent about this manuscript the first time around and the authors have only improved it with the additional experiments. In all honesty, this will never be the cleanest study and will not have the highest level of impact due to lack of mechanism, whatever the authors do to address the issues. However, I continue to believe that it brings up a valid point about the ambiguity of the true adiponectin receptor and the data are strong enough to provide a valid challenge to the dogma. On balance, I recommend acceptance.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48675.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This study focused on elucidating the physiological binding partner(s) for native adiponectin.

Furthermore, we would like to emphasize that the ligand in serum is the most natural ligand that maintains its ability to interact with the physiological binding partner. Numerous constituents, including a large number of proteins, exert adequate blocking effects to investigate whether the interaction between the physiological ligand and binding protein is specific. Moreover, the use of a recombinant ligand may make the experiment unreproducible because the same recombinant ligand cannot be made at another site. The ligand-receptor interaction in a more purified system can have mean if the ligand can bind with the receptor in a more physiological situation like in serum as our experiment.

The Nature study also showed that HEK293 cells overexpressing AdipoRs bound <italic>E. coli</italic> recombinant globular adiponectin (Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B, Yamauchi et al., 2003). Therefore, difficulties are associated with speculating about the requirement for âaccessoryâ proteins to confer adiponectin binding activity to AdipoRs.</p><p>Numerous studies have indicated that AdipoRs mediate adiponectin signaling. Therefore, there may be additional activating mechanisms of AdipoRs by adiponectin, i.e., reductive or proteolytic generation of the trimer, monomer, and/or globular adiponectin.

Numerous studies indicated that AdipoRs mediate adiponectin signaling.

The present study focused on the direct binding of native HMW adiponectin (more than hexamer) and the results obtained suggest the activation of AdipoRs by these LMW forms, possibly on the site of cells after HMW adiponectin binding to cell-surface T-cadherin is cleaved.

The ligand-receptor interaction in a more purified system can have mean if the ligand can bind with the receptor in a more physiological situation like in serum as our experiment The results of our new experiment indicate that recombinant adiponectin has limited affinity to T-cadherin due to the presence of less of the HMW form.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At a minimum, the authors' need to be much more precise in their language and judicious in what they claim the data show.

What the authors show is that overexpression of T-cadherin in cells allows them to bind increased amounts of adiponectin.

It is well known that adiponectin stimulates intracellular signaling cascades such as phospho-AMPK and phospho-p38. And the loss of AdipoRs was shown to decrease these signaling. One explanation will be the generation of low molecular weight form of adiponectin such as globular form after binding to T-cadherin. However, it was recently reported that the primary cellular function of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 is to maintain membrane fluidity (Ruiz M et al., J Lipid Res. 2019 May;60(5):995-1004). Loss of them might disturb membrane fluidity and thereby decrease signaling. Another explanation may be intracellular signaling by HMW-adiponectin internalization through binding to T-cadherin without interaction with AdipoRs.

They have to adopt alternative methods to affirm the extent of protein interactions. Along the same line, they need to measure/compare binding affinity of recombinant adiponectin with other proteins including AdipoR and Calreticulin.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing an important discussion point in this study. As discussed in the Results and Discussion section (ninth paragraph), in the case of calreticulin, the interaction with adiponectin was evidenced by a neutralizing antibody treatment inhibiting the adiponectin interaction with cells expressing calreticulin (Takemura et al., 2007). So, possibilities of the requirement of calreticulin for adiponectin binding such as the requirement of some accessory protein may exist. In the case of AdipoRs, AdipoR was discovered by expression cloning, as discussed in the Results and Discussion section (eighth paragraph). Expression cloning requires repeated washing steps before separation by FACS. Therefore, the overexpression of AdipoR is expected to promote firm ligand binding. The initial discovery of AdipoRs also indicated that HEK293 cells overexpressing AdipoRs bound <italic>E. coli</italic> recombinant globular adiponectin (Yamauchi et al., 2003). Therefore, difficulties are associated with speculating about the much weaker binding affinity or requirement for some âaccessoryâ proteins to confer adiponectin binding activity to AdipoRs.

Therefore in this sense, T-cadherin can be thought of as positive control.
