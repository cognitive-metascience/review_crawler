developing societies with high child mortality rates is unclear. We identified all parents in Iceland born 1800–1996 and compared the mortality rates of 47,711 parents who lost a child to those of their siblings (N = 126,342) who did not. The proportion of parents who experienced child loss decreased from 61.1% of those born 1800–1880 to 5.2% of those born after 1930. Child loss was consistently associated with increased rate of maternal, but not paternal, death before the age of 50 across all parent birth cohorts; the relative increase in maternal mortality rate ranged from 35% among mothers born 1800–1930 to 64% among mothers born after 1930. The loss of a child poses a threat to the survival of young mothers, even during periods of high infant mortality rates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>child loss</kwd><kwd>psychological stress</kwd><kwd>mortality</kwd><kwd>attachment</kwd><kwd>sex difference</kwd><kwd>demography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001840</institution-id><institution>RANNIS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>163362-051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valdimarsdóttir</surname><given-names>Unnur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>726413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valdimarsdóttir</surname><given-names>Unnur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A large-scale, sibling-based analysis of the Icelandic population spanning two centuries demonstrates an increase in maternal mortality rates after child loss on both sides of a major demographic transition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The death of a child is arguably one of the most stressful events that a parent can experience. Grief is the natural emotional response to such loss and has been described across human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lindemann, 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bowlby, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parkes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyden et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Einarsdóttir, 2004</xref>). Intense or prolonged grief can induce behaviours and physiological states that are detrimental to health and survival. Thus, child loss has been associated with elevated risks of psychiatric symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kreicbergs et al., 2004</xref>), psychiatric hospitalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2005</xref>) and sickness absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilcox et al., 2015</xref>), cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2003a</xref>), and some cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2002b</xref>). Studies also suggest that parents, particularly mothers, who lose a child face increased risk of death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Levav et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qin and Mortensen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agerbo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rostila et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rostila et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Espinosa and Evans, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schorr et al., 2016</xref>), both from suicide and natural causes. The aforementioned studies were all conducted in affluent developed populations, where infant mortality rates are low and life expectancy is high. In contemporary developing nations, infant mortality rates (number of deaths during first year per 1000 live births) &gt;50 are common, whereas in developed nations they are usually lower than eight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">United Nations, 2015</xref>). Parent-child attachment in pre-industrial and developing populations has been a matter of debate, with some historians arguing for parental reluctance to invest emotions in children where mortality rates are high, while others argue that parents' attachment and grief after child loss is similar across human populations, past and present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Magnússon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Woods, 2003</xref>). One way to shed light on this issue is to study the impact of child loss on parent mortality in the same population before and after a demographic transition that dramatically altered infant mortality rates.</p><p>Here, we examine the association between child loss and parent mortality in Iceland from 1817 until 2015, a period that spans a drastic transition from a poor agricultural society to an affluent industrial society. One marker of this drastic change is that infant mortality rates in Iceland (per 1000 births) dropped from one of the highest known values in history, 238 in 1881–1885 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jónsson and Magnússon, 1997</xref>), to one of the lowest, 2.07 in 2005–2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Statistics Iceland, 2019</xref>). We used a comprehensive genealogical database to assess whether the relative rate of parent mortality after child loss changed during this transition, and to determine whether this rate was further affected by factors such as parent’s sex and age at loss, the number of children as well as the age of the lost child. In line with some previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2003b</xref>), we used parent mortality as a measure of the cumulative health response to the emotional and physiological strain of child loss. While mortality obviously does not capture the entire range of such reactions, it has the advantage of being reliably recorded at different times in a genealogical database.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We followed all Icelandic parents, born 1800 or later, from the birth of their first child (earliest from 1817) until death or to the end of 2015 (see further in Materials and methods). From 1817 to 2015, 64 044 parents lost at least one child (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> - Table 1). The proportion of parents who experienced child loss decreased from 61.1% among parents born 1800–1880 to 5.2% among parents born 1931–1996. To adjust for potential confounding by socioeconomic status or other familial factors that might affect the risk of mortality, our primary analyses were focused on the 47,711 parents who lost a child and had at least one sibling who did not lose a child (N = 126,342). Compared to their siblings who did not lose a child, parents who lost a child were more likely to be women, have more children, be younger at first childbirth and older at cohort entry, and have a longer follow-up time (p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Similar patterns were observed for mothers and fathers who lost a child, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> - Table 2).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43476.002</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Descriptive characteristics of parents born from 1800 to 1996 who lost a child by death during their life course, and their siblings who did not lose a child, N (%).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Parents with loss</th><th>Parents without loss</th><th valign="top">P for difference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Total number</td><td>47 711</td><td>126 342</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Sex</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Female</td><td>25 125 (53)</td><td>63 328 (50)</td><td rowspan="2">3.65e-21 <break/></td></tr><tr><td>Male</td><td>22 586 (47)</td><td>63 014 (50)</td></tr><tr><td>Total number of children</td><td>276 819</td><td>531 736</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Number of children, mean (SD)</td><td>5.80 (3.19)</td><td>4.21 (2.71)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Number of children</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1775 (4)</td><td>16 012 (13)</td><td rowspan="4">0</td></tr><tr><td>2–4</td><td>17 766 (37)</td><td>64 908 (51)</td></tr><tr><td>5–9</td><td>21 947 (46)</td><td>39 019 (31)</td></tr><tr><td>10+</td><td>6223 (13)</td><td>6403 (5)</td></tr><tr><td>Age at first child birth, mean (SD)</td><td>25.55 (5.09)</td><td>27.16 (6.11)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Age at matching<sup>*</sup>, mean (SD)</td><td>38.76 (15.39)</td><td>37.35 (14.60)</td><td>8.84e-67</td></tr><tr><td>Age at matching<sup>*</sup></td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>13–30</td><td>17 963 (38)</td><td>52 434 (42)</td><td rowspan="4">1.84e-70</td></tr><tr><td>31–50</td><td>19 980 (42)</td><td>51 348 (41)</td></tr><tr><td>51–75</td><td>8123 (17)</td><td>19 480 (15)</td></tr><tr><td>76+</td><td>1645 (3)</td><td>3080 (2)</td></tr><tr><td>Age of deceased child, mean (SD)</td><td>9.44 (14.95)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Length of follow-up, mean (SD)</td><td>31.79 (18.36)</td><td>25.45 (18.03)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Age at death</td><td>70.81 (16.66)</td><td>71.80 (16.20)</td><td>1.40e-21</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>* Age at loss of first child for parents who lost a child; the same age for their siblings who did not lose a child or the age when the siblings became parents, whichever came later.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43476.003</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of premature mortality after loss of a child among young parents followed up to age 50, by time since loss and demographic characteristics, compared to their siblings.</title><p>We stratified by sibling groups and additionally adjusted for birth year and sex.

Separately analyzed by time since loss and demographic characteristics, we did not observe significantly increased mortality in response to child loss for parents after 50 years of age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> - Table 3). However, when broken down into the seven smaller birth-cohort periods, we observed significantly increased mortality in parents older than 50 who lost a child and were born after 1930 (HR 1.11; 95% CI 1.03–1.20; p=0.0063), particularly among fathers (HR 1.21; 95% CI 1.08–1.37; p=0.0009; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Curiously, this recent increase in mortality after the age of 50 years is associated with child loss that mostly occurred before the age of 50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). As a result, we postulate that the recent increase in parent mortality rate after the age of 50, particularly in fathers, may be due to an increased risk of long-term social isolation after child loss. In support of this notion, we indeed found very high mortality rates for parents born after 1930 who lost a child and had no living children at the age of 50, regardless of the sex of deceased child (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> - Table 4).</p><p>In a sensitivity analysis, restricting to parent-sibling pairs born within five years from the parents who lost a child, comparing same-sex siblings, or adjusting for the number of children alive at time of matching, we observed similar estimates of parental mortality rates after child loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>). The only notable difference was that, in the birth cohort 1931–1996, the impact of child loss on maternal mortality after 50 years of age became statistically significant. We further restricted unexposed siblings to those who were already parents at the age when the index sibling lost a child, which also yielded similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The study period spans two centuries of drastic demographic transition in Iceland, from a poor developing nation with a particularly high infant mortality rate, to a modern affluent nation with one of the lowest rates of infant mortality in history. Although we observed a more modest elevation in overall parent mortality rates after child loss before 1930 compared to thereafter, the most striking finding is the consistent increase in premature maternal deaths in response to child loss throughout the 199 years of observation.</p><p>This study leverages a unique nationwide data source of genealogies with virtually complete follow-up over a 199 year period spanning an extreme change in indicators of societal development, for example infant and child mortality rate. Although based on an unusually large set of data, our study has several limitations that should be noted. First, we have no information about the causes of death for children or parents. Such data could be used to help verify the causal relationship between deaths of children and parents and to uncover patterns in the causes of death among parents (e.g. suicide or cardiovascular deaths) after child loss. Some impact of reverse causation, for example the ill-health of parents increasing the mortality risk of their children, cannot be ruled out. However, the health and welfare of children was even more dependent on their parents, particularly fathers, in pre-demographic transition (pre-welfare state times) societies. The relatively stable effect estimates of parent mortality rates after child loss across calendar periods and the consistently lower impact of child loss on paternal mortality argues against a strong influence of reverse causality. Second, we did not have direct information about the socioeconomic status of parents. However, as socioeconomic status tends to cluster in families, our sibling-controlled analysis is likely to adjust for much of the confounding due to this source. Third, it is possible that the fragmented registration of births in earlier times (particularly in the case of infant deaths) resulted in misclassification of some parents who had truly lost a child and, thus, somewhat conservative estimates of excess parent mortality rates in earlier times. Last, in the sibling cohort, parents who lost a child differed somewhat from those that did not lose a child with respect to sex, number of children, age at first birth, age at entry to the cohort, length of follow-up time and age at death. We therefore made every effort to adjust for these covariates in our analyses. We adjusted for age at follow-up and sex in all analyses and presented separate results for the different birth cohorts. We further performed subgroup analyses by age of parents at loss (or matching), parent age at first childbirth, follow-up time and number of children alive at loss, and demonstrated that the association between child loss and parent mortality is observed across the range of these covariates. Indeed, parents who lost a child may have to live longer to experience such an event, however, such survivor bias (if any) due to a selection of survivors to the exposed group would rather yield conservative estimates of parent mortality after a child loss. On the other hand, the siblings used for comparison that were not yet parents at the age as when the index parents lost a child may have a survival advantage, which could yield exaggerated estimates of parent mortality after child loss. However, we observed similar results in a sensitivity analysis that was restricted to unexposed siblings who were already parents at the same age as when the index parents lost a child.</p><p>The large increase in the rate of premature maternal mortality after child loss in 19<sup>th</sup> century Iceland suggests that mothers formed strong emotional bonds with their children – in spite of very harsh conditions and a strong expectation of child loss. This is consistent with accounts of intense grieving among mothers who lost a child in a contemporary developing society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Einarsdóttir, 2004</xref>). In contrast, the paternal mortality response to child loss is much weaker throughout the observation period and only statistically significant for older fathers (i.e. parent mortality after 50 years of age) born after 1930.</p><p>What could account for this stable sex difference in parent mortality rate after child loss? One possibility is a difference in the attachment of mothers and fathers to their children, which could result in a greater emotional response of mothers and concomitant psychological and physiological consequences. Throughout the 199-year study period, mothers may have had greater opportunity than fathers to form early emotional attachment to their infants through gestation and breastfeeding. Although historical accounts suggest that breastfeeding may have been rarer in 19th to early 20th century Iceland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garðarsdóttir, 2005</xref>) than in the present, it does not seem to have prevented mothers from forming strong emotional bonds with their children as illustrated by the elevated risks of maternal death after child loss. It is possible that females are born with a tendency to form stronger emotional bonds with children than males. Although our results cannot disentangle the impact of nature and nurture in this context, it is interesting to note that the mortality response of fathers to child loss before the age of 50 has not significantly increased despite the greater contribution of fathers to the postnatal care of children in recent decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huerta et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Another possible explanation for our findings is a sex difference in the emotional response to traumatic events in general. Women have been reported to have a greater risk of mental disorders after exposure to emotional trauma than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tolin and Foa, 2006</xref>). The intensity of such responses may result in a multitude of other mental and physical ailments which in turn can affect the risk of mortality through, for example suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wilcox et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Panagioti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gradus et al., 2010</xref>) and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Song et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Edmondson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gradus et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies in contemporary developed populations have reported evidence for greater risk of psychiatric hospitalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2005</xref>) and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2003b</xref>) after child loss in mothers than in fathers. Interestingly, an opposite sex difference is seen for mortality rate after spousal loss, where mortality rate elevation is more pronounced among widowers than widows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shor et al., 2012</xref>). However, this difference may in part be due to a greater dependence of older males on social and emotional support provided by spouses. A similar mechanism is indicated in our results, namely the increased mortality of older parents after child loss in more recent times.</p><p>Our results show that even in the poor agricultural population of 19th century Iceland, with one of the highest infant mortality rates measured in humans, there was a considerable impact of child loss on premature maternal mortality rates. This contradicts claims that mothers in poor cultures adapt to high infant mortality rates with reduced emotional investment (as reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Woods, 2003</xref>). Indeed, one implication of our findings is that child loss is likely to constitute a major threat to the survival of mothers in societies with high infant mortality rates. Taken together these findings highlight the importance of the mother-child bond and the extensive health threats that arise when it is broken.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data sources and study participants</title><p>The data source for the current study is the deCODE Genetics genealogy database, containing information on kinship, dates of birth and death of Icelandic population largely since settlement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gudbjartsson et al., 2015</xref>).

In cases where parents experienced child loss, we obtained information about parents’ age when losing their first child and the child's age at the time of death.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Follow-up and ascertainment of parental mortality</title><p>We followed all parents from the year of entry to the study (when first becoming parents). The person-time of parents was defined as unexposed from entry to the cohort until the loss of their first child, death, or end of the observation period (end of 2015), whichever happened first. Person-time was defined as exposed (for parents who lost a child) from the date of their first child loss until death or end of the observation period (end of 2015).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Population-based matched cohort</title><p>Since life expectancy has changed dramatically across the study period, we performed population-based matched cohort analysis, based on 64,050 parents who lost a child during follow-up, who were matched on birth year (±1 year) and sex to parents who did not lose a child. To this end, we randomly selected three parents (born before 1920) or five parents (born 1920 or later) who had not lost a child at the time when the index parent lost a child (i.e. the reference time). Six parents who lost a child but could not be matched to any parents without loss were excluded. The resulting data set comprised 64,044 parents who lost a child and 218,824 matched parents who did not lose a child. We followed all participants from the reference time until death or December 31st, 2015, whichever came first.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Siblings-based cohort</title><p>To allay the concerns of potential confounders shared by family members (such as socioeconomic status, lifestyle and genetic components), we restricted our primary analysis to a sibling-based cohort. Of note, although the siblings used as reference in this analysis did not lose a child, they did lose a niece or nephew which, if truly influencing the rate of mortality, may lead to conservative estimates. Among 64,044 parents with loss, 54,532 (85.1%) had at least one sibling defined as sharing the same biological mother. Each parent with loss was paired with three available siblings on average (range 2–16) who had not lost a child at the same age when the index parent lost a child (i.e. the reference age), whereas 6821 parents were excluded because they only had siblings who had experienced child loss. We followed all participants from the reference age, or the age when the siblings became parents, whichever came later, until the age at loss of a child, death, or December 31st, 2015, whichever occurred first. Specifically, siblings who did not lose a child started to contribute to the follow-up at the same age as the parent who lost a child or at a later age when they became parents. The sibling-based cohort comprised 47,711 (74.5%) parents who lost a child and 126,342 matched siblings without loss.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We first compared the characteristics of parents who lost a child (exposed) with those who did not (unexposed) across birth cohorts for the following covariates: sex, mean age at loss, mean child's age at the time of death and total number of children. In this analysis, we used a <italic>chi-square</italic> test for the categorical and a <italic>t-test</italic> for the continuous covariates. We then calculated the crude mortality rates (deaths per 1000 person-years) in both exposed and unexposed cohorts, overall and stratified by parental sex, birth cohorts, and/or age at follow-up.</p><p>Although we performed parallel analyses on the population-based matched cohort, the primary analysis was focused on the siblings-based cohort which provides a better control of unmeasured confounders shared by siblings. We used conditional Cox proportional hazard regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals of mortality for exposed parents relative to unexposed parents, while stratifying on the matched pairs in analyses of population-based matched cohort or sibling groups in analyses of siblings-based cohort. We used time since the reference time and age at follow-up as the underlying timescale for population-based matched cohort and sibling-based cohort, respectively. All models were additionally adjusted for birth year for the population-based matched analysis (because ±1 birth year was allowed in matched pairs), and adjusted for birth year and parental sex in the sibling-based analysis. Of note, we did not match on parental sex in the sibling-based cohort but adjusted for it in all models and thereby accounting for the effect of sex on mortality rate across the sibling groups. Matched pairs or sibling groups who were invariant with regard to the outcome were included, although they did not contribute to the estimates. Guided by the timing of the dramatic societal change and to ensure sufficient statistical power for each period, the same analyses were performed for seven birth cohorts separately (every 20 years from 1800 to 1900, 1901–1930, and 1931–1996). Because of the better control of potential confounders, we only performed the subsequent analyses in the sibling-based cohort.</p><p>To investigate potential bias due to common external causes of death (e.g. pandemics or accidents taking the lives of both parents and children) we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding all parent-child pairs with identical date of death. Due to differential impact across birth cohorts, the subsequent analyses were always separated by birth cohorts. All analyses were performed on men and women separately.</p><p>As the average life expectancy of Icelanders increased considerably from 1817 to the present, we performed separate analyses of parent mortality before and after the age of 50 years, that is 13-50 and ≥51 years. To reduce the potential differences between siblings we, in sensitivity analyses, restricted to parent-sibling pairs born within 5 years from the parents who lost a child (N = 96,041, 55.2%) as well as to unexposed siblings who were already parents at the same age as when the index parents lost a child (N = 135,719, 78.0%). To further address the potential influences of parent sex and number of children, in another sensitivity analysis, we only compared same-sex siblings and additionally adjusted for number of alive children at the time of loss/matching, respectively.</p><p>Parent mortality before and after age of 50 years was further analyzed in subgroups of age of the deceased child (0, 1–5, 6–17, or ≥18 years old), number of children alive at loss (0, 1–3, or ≥4), sex of the deceased child, parental age at loss (13–30, 31–40, or 41–50 years old), and parental age at first childbirth (13–21, 22–24, 25–27, or ≥28 years).</p><p>The excess risk of mortality beyond age 50 among parents born 1931–1996 was further explored with respect to the age of parents when the loss occurred (13–30, 31–50 or ≥51 years); as well as sex of deceased child and number of children by age 50.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using R, version 3.3.1. Survival analysis was performed with the packages ‘survival’ and graphs were plotted with the package ‘ggplot2’. All R-codes used in the primary analyses are available (Source Code File 1).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study is funded by the Icelandic Research Fund- RANNIS (Grant of Excellence; nr: 163362–051) and the European Research Council (StressGene; nr: 726413).

As the authors state, several papers have shown loss of a child is associated – in observational studies – with a higher risk of parental death, particularly for mothers. However, the novelty in this study is using a sibling comparison design over a 200-year time frame with a large sample size. Hence they are able to answer the question &quot;is the phenomenon of interest – increased risk of parental death following the death of a child – particular to industrialized human populations in which child death is quite rare.&quot; The answer from this paper is clearly 'no' – even in a context in which child death affects more than half of parents, the authors detect a raised risk of death among mothers and (in a more specific context) fathers.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The mother's risk of premature death after child loss across two centuries&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by M. Dawn Teare as the Reviewing Editor and Eduardo Franco as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Susan C Alberts (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are some puzzling features of this study that it would be helpful to understand better. Parents who lost a child and had more children, were younger at first birth, were more likely to be women and had longer follow-up that those who did not lose a child (Table 1). Was the difference in% women for parents with and without loss significant? If so, please add to the text. More generally, please explain these differences between the parents with and without loss, and consider whether the differences are an artefact of the design/implementation that might bias the estimates.</p><p>2) The difference in age between parents with loss and their siblings could be because follow-up time started when the child died for the parents with loss, and started for the sibling when the sibling became a parent. As such, for the sibling the time between their nephew/niece dying and the birth of their first child might be &quot;immortal&quot; time (1) that gives the sibling a survival advantage. For example, if the parent and their childless sibling both died a week after the child died, then the sibling would not be eligible for the study, making the surviving eligible siblings more strongly selected survivors than the parents with loss. Please consider whether such an issue could affect the estimates and amend the method or add a limitation explaining this point.</p><p>3) Please explain the adjustment for sex in the sibling design in more detail. Was the sibling design adjusted for sex composition of the sibling pairs, i.e., both female, both male, etc., because men and women have children at different ages, giving a different exposure time till age 50 years?</p><p>4) Given the above concerns about the handling of exposure time, would it be helpful to add a twin comparison possibly with exposure time handled in a different way?</p><p>5) Number of children could be a confounder (common cause of exposure and outcome) or a mediator, because a higher number of children affects parental survival. Obviously, the more children in a family the greater risk of a child dying. Alternatively, parents might have a 'replacement' child after a death. Would it be possible to distinguish between these possibilities and conduct the analyses accordingly? Would a marginal structural model help? Alternatively, it would be helpful to see estimates adjusted for number of children in the family.</p><p>6) The authors allude to an important point in the Discussion when they say &quot;…we have no information about the causes of death for children or parents. Such data could be used to help verify the causal relationship between deaths of children and parents and to uncover patterns in the causes of death among parents (e.g. suicide or cardiovascular deaths) after child loss.&quot; This seems a highly salient point: Indeed, a causal relationship in the other direction is quite possible, and mutual causal arrows are possible. That is, child death may be greatly increased in cases where parents are unwell or in poor condition – implying a causal arrow from parent health to child death. Conversely, the risk of parental death after child death may be particularly high for parents in poor health. The authors need to lay out these alternative causal pathways more explicitly. Is there any data that could provide insight into these questions?</p><p>7) It would be good to know a bit more about the completeness (or lack thereof) of the dataset and whether the authors used any specific techniques to deal with this incompleteness. For instance, The authors make the statement &quot;it is possible that the fragmented registration of births in earlier times (particularly in the case of infant deaths) resulted in misclassification of some parents who had truly lost a child and, thus, somewhat conservative estimates of excess parent mortality rates in earlier times.&quot; And &quot;The database contains an almost complete record of the ancestors of contemporary Icelanders back to around 1650 and, after 1880, is based on death records from a geographically comprehensive set of parish records.&quot; It is difficult to get a full picture of dataset completeness from this relatively scanty information. What proportion of records are incomplete? A table with information about various types of missing data would be advisable.</p><p>8) It would be helpful if the discussion focused more on the strengths and weaknesses of the study.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The mother's risk of premature death after child loss across two centuries&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Reviewer #2 still has concerns about survivor bias. Comparing people who survived at least one child with those who did not may result in selection bias. Adjusting for potential confounding variables will not protect against this. Essentially the people who have child loss may have to live longer, which may obscure the effect of losing a child.

We have now added P for difference for all comparisons in Table 1 and revised the text accordingly. The P for difference across parental groups was &lt;0.05 for all covariates, including: parents’ sex, number of children, age at first birth, age at entry to the cohort, length of follow-up time and age at death.</p><p>Although we note a statistically significant difference between sibling groups on all covariates we have directly addressed each of these factors in our analyses and, therefore, are confident that they do not account for our results. We adjusted for age at follow-up (as the underlying timescale) and sex in all analyses and present results for each of the studied birth cohorts throughout. In Table 2, we further present the association between child loss and premature parent mortality rate stratified by parental age at loss/matching and follow-up time, and sub-grouped by the number of children alive at loss. These results are not consistent with the notion that our findings are driven by differences between the groups on the abovementioned factors. Although varying somewhat, the association between loss and survival is evident across the range of these covariates. The considerable differences in average follow-up time between parents who did vs. did not lose a child (31.79 vs. 25.45 years, respectively) is likely explained by the parents who did not lose a child at the time of matching but later encountered a child loss and were then censored as end of follow-up in that matching set. This is relatively common in the earlier birth cohorts due to the higher mortality rates for children in that period. This concern is partly alleviated by Figure 2, where the follow-up of parents is restricted to 50 years across all birth cohorts. Moreover, the results in Table 2 do not suggest a considerable variation in parent mortality across extended periods of follow-up time from child loss/matching. This further argues against the possibility that the difference of average follow-up length between two groups may account for our findings.</p><p>Modified manuscript text:</p><p>Results section: “Compared to their siblings who did not lose a child, parents who lost a child were more likely to be women, have more children, be younger at first birth and older at cohort entry, and have a longer follow-up time (P&lt;0.05; Table 1).”</p><p>Discussion section: “Last, in the sibling cohort, parents who lost a child differed somewhat from those that did not lose a child with respect to sex, number of children, age at first birth, age at entry to the cohort, length of follow-up time and age at death. We therefore made every effort to adjust for these covariates in our analyses. We adjusted for age at follow-up and sex in all analyses and presented separate results for the different birth cohorts. We further stratified analyses by age of parents at loss (or matching), follow-up time and number of children alive at loss, and demonstrated that the association between child loss and parent mortality is observed across the range of these covariates.”</p><p>Materials and methods: “In this analysis, we used a chi-square test for the categorical and a t-test for the continuous covariates.”</p><p>See also Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The difference in age between parents with loss and their siblings could be because follow-up time started when the child died for the parents with loss, and started for the sibling when the sibling became a parent. As such, for the sibling the time between their nephew/niece dying and the birth of their first child might be &quot;immortal&quot; time (1) that gives the sibling a survival advantage. For example, if the parent and their childless sibling both died a week after the child died, then the sibling would not be eligible for the study, making the surviving eligible siblings more strongly selected survivors than the parents with loss. Please consider whether such an issue could affect the estimates and amend the method or add a limitation explaining this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the sibling design needs further clarification in the manuscript. First, in order to be at risk of losing a child, one needs to have one. Thus, our analysis of index persons who lost a child and their siblings only considers follow-up time where both of these groups were parents. We started to follow the siblings who already had a child from the same age as their index-sibling when he/she lost a child. If the siblings did not have any children at the age when the index-persons lost a child, these were not included in the analysis until they subsequently had one, and then only from the age when they became parents. Indeed, we agree with the reviewer that the time between the sibling’s nephew/niece dying and the birth of their first child is “immortal” and was therefore not included in our analysis and should not bias our estimates. Indeed, both groups (individuals with or without child loss) need to survive long enough to become parents to be considered for analysis. The reviewer notes that the parents who lost a child are a bit further into his/her life history than their siblings who are still childless at the time of the loss. However, the population cohort – where even higher hazard ratios are observed – does not have that problem. Please also refer to the results of our sensitivity analysis below (Point #4), restricting the sibling cohort to unexposed siblings born within 5 years of the parents who lost a child.</p><p>We have now clarified this important issue in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Modified manuscript text:</p><p>“Specifically, siblings who did not lose a child started to contribute to the follow-up at the same age as the parent who lost a child or at a later age when they became parents.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please explain the adjustment for sex in the sibling design in more detail. Was the sibling design adjusted for sex composition of the sibling pairs, i.e., both female, both male, etc., because men and women have children at different ages, giving a different exposure time till age 50 years?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not restrict the sibling sets to all females or all males since that would inevitably have further raised the bar for selection of siblings. Instead, we matched a mother who lost a child to all her eligible siblings with children, including both her sisters and brothers, who had not lost a child at the same age. We adjusted for sex in the sibling-based analysis which accounts for the effect of sex on mortality rate across sibling sets. Moreover, we used attained age as the underlying time scale and therefore the age difference was also controlled for. We have now further clarified the sibling-based analysis in the Materials and methods.</p><p>Modified manuscript text:</p><p>“Of note, we did not match on parental sex but adjusted for it in all models and thereby accounting for the effect of sex on mortality rate across the sibling groups.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Given the above concerns about the handling of exposure time, would it be helpful to add a twin comparison possibly with exposure time handled in a different way?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, a twin-based comparison would be underpowered due to the low number of pairs. However, we have now conducted a sensitivity analysis restricting to 96,041 (55.2%) siblings born five years before or after the index parents.

This is why we did not adjust for it in our primary analysis. Instead, we performed a subgroup analysis by the number of children alive at the time of loss among parents who lost a child (Table 2), where we did not observe varying effect sizes across subgroups. In accordance with the reviewer’s note, we now present results from a sensitivity analysis, adjusting for the number of children alive at loss/matching. The results are consistent with those of the main analyses, except that maternal mortality after 50 years of age, in the birth cohort 1931-1996, becomes statistically significant (Figure 2—figure supplement 6). Adjusting for or matching on children born after loss (“replacement children”) is challenging, since the parents need to survive long enough to have them. This would introduce a survival bias. We have therefore opted not to adjust for the number of any post-loss/matching children in our analysis.</p><p>Modified manuscript text:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>In a sensitivity analysis, restricting to parent-sibling pairs born within five years from the parents who lost a child or adjusting for the number of children alive at time of matching, we observed similar estimates of parental mortality rates after child loss (Figure 2—figure supplements 5-6).

We have no data on causes of death while previous studies (e.g. Li et al., 2003) suggest that child loss in modern times (after 1980) increases the risk of maternal death, particularly of unnatural causes but also natural causes. We agree with the reviewer that some risk of reverse causation (parent’s ill health increasing risk of child’s death and subsequent death of parent) cannot be ruled out. However, if deteriorating parental health was strongly associated with the risk of child death, we might expect the association between child loss and parent mortality to be particularly evident during the first years of follow-up. However, the relatively stable association between child loss and parent mortality across follow-up times (as shown in Table 2) does not indicate a strong influence of reverse causality in these data. Indeed, families (mothers and children) were extremely financially dependent on fathers, such that if fathers died or were unable to work, then families were often separated and children fostered – which usually meant very hard work and diminished living conditions for these children. Thus, if parents' ill-health was a driving factor, we would expect a stronger association between child loss and father's mortality. However, it is indeed maternal mortality rate, and not paternal mortality rate after child loss, which is consistently elevated across all follow-up periods.</p><p>Modified manuscript text:</p><p>Discussion: “Some impact of reverse causation, e.g. the ill-health of parents increasing the mortality risk of their children, cannot be ruled out. However, the health and welfare of children was even more dependent on their parents, particularly fathers, in pre-demographic transition (pre-welfare state times) societies. The relatively stable effect estimates of parent mortality rates after child loss across calendar periods and the consistently lower impact of child loss on paternal mortality argues against a strong influence of reverse causality.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It would be good to know a bit more about the completeness (or lack thereof) of the dataset and whether the authors used any specific techniques to deal with this incompleteness.

This would lead to a misclassification of some parents, which in our study are considered as unexposed (parents that have not lost a child), but in fact should have been considered as exposed (parents who lost a child). We note that the impact of such misclassification on our results is in the form of a conservative bias. Thus, if there is a difference in survival between exposed and unexposed parents, such misclassification would only lead us to underestimate this difference and is therefore not a major concern for this study.

Of course, it is possible that these issues do not matter, but it would be helpful if the authors could explain why not, or amend accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises several important issues.</p><p>The reviewer remains concerned for a potential bias based on that “people who have child loss may have to live longer” than the comparison cohort of parents who do not experience a child loss. However, such type of bias, if any, caused by a selection of “survivors” to the exposed population would rather yield conservative estimates of the increase in parent mortality after a child loss. Also, as explained in more details below, we carefully designed our study to compare the two groups of parents, with and without a child loss, from the same age (i.e. the age when the loss of the child in one group occurred) whenever possible. Thus, both groups were at the same age at the start of follow-up (i.e., at the time of matching).</p><p>Thus, we remain convinced that our study design entails few, if any, possible conditions giving rise to survivor bias as described in the paper cited by the reviewer in the last round of review (2). We followed parents who lose a child starts immediately after child loss and, due to the fact that we use parental age as the underlying time scale, the follow-up of the matched parents not yet exposed to child loss starts at the same age/time point as for the exposed parents yielding identical conditions for ascertaining mortalities among these two compared groups. The sibling controls are followed from the same age as the parent that lost a child, or from the age when becoming a parent if they are not yet parents when their sibling lost a child; the latter, according to the definition above, may give rise to survivor bias. For this reason, we reran our sibling-based comparison, limiting it to unexposed siblings who were already parents at the age as the index sibling who lost a child. The results remained largely similar (if anything, the point estimates indicated even stronger associations) and we have added this sensitivity analysis to the revised manuscript (Figure 2—figure supplement 8).</p><p>Thus, we believe that the reviewer’s concern of survivor bias should be eliminated through our study design only considering person time of unexposed siblings who have reached the exact age at the index parent’s loss. In other words, both exposed and unexposed parent’s need to survive through the same age in order to be compared. Therefore, the amount of “immortal time” is similar across these groups. We have now clarified this issue by adding the following statements to the manuscript:</p><p>Modified manuscript text:</p><p>“We further restricted unexposed siblings to those who were already parents at the age when the index sibling lost a child, which also yielded largely similar results (Figure 2—figure supplement 8).”</p><p>“Indeed, parents who lost a child may have to live longer to experience such an event, however, such survivor bias (if any) due to a selection of survivors to the exposed group would rather yield conservative estimates of parent mortality after a child loss. […] However, we observed similar results when we in a sensitivity analysis restricted to unexposed siblings who were already parents at the same age as when the index parents lost a child.”</p><p>“To reduce the potential differences between siblings we, in sensitivity analyses restricted to parent-sibling pairs born within five years from the parents who lost a child (N=96,041, 55.2%) as well as to unexposed siblings who were already parents at the same age as when the index parents lost a child (N=135,719, 78.0%).”</p><p>In contrast to the abovementioned concern for selection (survivor) bias induced by the study design where certain individuals (or person time) are selected to or excluded from a study (3), we believe that the remaining points raised by the reviewer represent conditions of confounding but not selection bias (4). Our study is indeed a nationwide complete follow-up of all parents during a 199-year period; no individual is excluded from the study on the basis of sex, age at first childbirth or total number of children. As the reviewer correctly points out, these factors may be associated with parental survival and some of them are unequally distributed across the compared parental groups and therefore need to be accounted for in the analysis. We have indeed made extensive efforts to account for these factors in our analysis.</p><p>Sex is accounted for in the population analysis by matching on sex, i.e. the rates of mortality are only compared between pairs of exposed and unexposed mothers and then fathers, separately. To preserve statistical power, we did not match on sex in the sibling analysis while controlling for sex in all models. We have now performed additional analysis confined to sister- and then brother-pairs (discordant on child loss) yielding similar estimates in the primary analysis albeit with lower precision. These results have been added to the manuscript (Figure 2—figure supplement 6).</p><p>Modified manuscript text:</p><p>“In a sensitivity analysis, restricting to parent-sibling pairs born within five years from the parents who lost a child, comparing same-sex siblings, or adjusting for the number of children alive at time of matching, we observed similar estimates of parental mortality rates after child loss (Figure 2—figure supplements 5-7).”</p><p>“To further address the potential influences of parent sex and number of children, in another sensitivity analyses, we only compared same-sex siblings and additionally adjusted for number of alive children at the time of loss/matching, respectively.”</p><p>Other factors mentioned by the reviewer have appropriately, as potential confounders, been addressed in Table 2 in subgroup analyses. There we e.g. demonstrate that maternal mortality rates below the age of 50 are considerably elevated across parent groups with varying number of children, with the greatest excess observed after loss of an only child. In the last round of revisions, we further performed additional analyses controlling for the number of children at the time of matching revealing virtually identical, if anything stronger, results (Figure 2—figure supplement 7).</p><p>In accordance with the reviewer’s comment, we have now added a subgroup analysis of age at first child birth in Table 2, revealing that the association between child loss and maternal mortality rates below the age of 50 is present in every subgroup of parental age at first child birth.</p><p>Modified manuscript text:</p><p>“We further performed subgroup analyses by the age of parents at loss (or matching), parent age at first childbirth, follow-up time and number of children alive at loss, and demonstrated that the association between child loss and parent mortality was observed across the range of these covariates.”</p><p>“Parent mortality before and after age of 50 years was further analyzed in subgroups of age of the deceased child (0, 1-5, 6-17, or ≥18 years old), number of children alive at loss (0, 1-3, or ≥4), sex of the deceased child, parental age at loss (13-30, 31-40, or 41-50 years old), and parental age at first childbirth (13-21, 22-24, 25-27, or ≥28 years old).”</p><p>Finally, as we explained in the last round of revisions, the discrepancy between the parental groups in follow-up time is driven by the high incidence of child loss, particularly during 20th century. Our study design mimics a prospective study, where the investigators have at every time point of the observation no information on which parent will live or die, or lose a child. Therefore, parents were randomly selected as matched “control parents” while they had not lost a child and then censored from that control group at the time of child loss (if it occurred). Due to the high incidence of child loss, many parents were later censored from the control group at the time of child loss and assigned to a new set (now as index-individuals) yielding the relatively shorter follow-up time of parents not exposed to child loss relative to the exposed. Thus, the Cox model does not generate estimates of parental mortality rates based on comparison between two distinct groups of parents, exposed and unexposed to child loss, but on the basis of hazards during exposed and unexposed person time.</p><p>1) Levesque LE, Hanley JA, Kezouh A, et al.
