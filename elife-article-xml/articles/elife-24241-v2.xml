However, it is presently impossible to measure selectively axonal ATP levels in the electrically active nervous system. We combined transgenic expression of an ATP-sensor in neurons of mice with confocal FRET imaging and electrophysiological recordings of acutely isolated optic nerves. This allowed us to monitor dynamic changes and activity-dependent axonal ATP homeostasis at the cellular level and in real time. We find that changes in ATP levels correlate well with compound action potentials. However, this correlation is disrupted when metabolism of lactate is inhibited, suggesting that axonal glycolysis products are not sufficient to maintain mitochondrial energy metabolism of electrically active axons. The combined monitoring of cellular ATP and electrical activity is a novel tool to study neuronal and glial energy metabolism in normal physiology and in models of neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24241.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24241.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24241.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain contains an intricate network of nerve cells that receive, process, send and store information. This information travels as electrical impulses along a long, thin part of each nerve cell known as the nerve fiber or axon. The act of sending these electrical signals requires a lot of energy, and energy in cells is most often stored within molecules of adenosine triphosphate (called ATP for short).</p><p>Importantly, a better understanding of how the production and consumption of ATP in nerve cells relates to electrical activity would help scientists to better understand how a shortage of energy in the brain contributes to diseases like multiple sclerosis. However, to date, it has been challenging to study the dynamics of ATP in nerve cells that are active.</p><p>Now, Trevisiol et al. describe a new system that allows changes in ATP levels to be seen within active nerve cells. First, mice were genetically engineered to produce a molecule that works like an ATP sensor only in their nerve cells. This made it possible to visualize the amount of ATP inside the axons in real-time using a microscope. Measuring ATP levels and recording the electrical signals moving along an axon at the same time allowed Trevisiol et al. to see how ATP content and electrical activity correlate and regulate each other.</p><p>The experiments reveal that strong electrical activity reduces the ATP content of the axon. Trevisiol et al. also discovered that nerve cells are unable to generate enough energy on their own to sustain their electrical activity. These results provide evidence that other cells in the brain – most likely non-nerve cells called oligodendrocytes – play an active role in delivering energy-rich substances to the axons of nerve cells.</p><p>In the future, the same tools and approaches could be used to monitor ATP levels and electrical activity in mice that model neurological disorders. Such experiments could tell scientists more about how disturbing energy production in nerve cells affects these diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24241.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24241.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ATP</kwd><kwd>axon</kwd><kwd>myelin</kwd><kwd>imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirrlinger</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nave</surname><given-names>Klaus-Armin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saab</surname><given-names>Aiman S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ATP imaging of spiking optic nerve axons in real time reveals correlation between ATP levels and electrical activity as well as contribution of lactate metabolism to axonal ATP homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the vertebrate nervous system, long axons have emerged as the 'bottle neck' of neuronal integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coleman and Freeman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nave, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hill et al., 2016</xref>). In neurodegenerative diseases, axons often reveal first signs of perturbation, e.g. spheroids, long before the pathological hallmarks of disease are seen in neuronal somata, such as large protein aggregates or neuronal cell death. In white matter tracts, Wallerian degeneration of axons is a carefully regulated program of self-destruction that upon reaching a threshold leads to rapid calcium-dependent proteolysis of axonal proteins. This degeneration can be experimentally triggered in different ways, including acute axonal dissection or by blocking mitochondrial energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coleman and Freeman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hill et al., 2016</xref>). In disease situations, the mechanisms leading to axon loss are much less clear. For example, in spastic paraplegia (SPG), which comprises an entire family of inherited axon degeneration disorders, long myelinated tracts of the spinal cord are progressively lost. However, virtually none of the subforms shows a clear link between the primary defect and the later loss of myelinated axons, with the possible exception of mitochondrial disorders, in which the perturbation of axonal energy metabolism is assumed to underlie a loss of axonal ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferreirinha et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tarrade et al., 2006</xref>). However, a disturbed energy balance has never been shown. Similarly, in the equally heterogeneous group of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathies of the peripheral nervous system only a small subset is caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. In most patients (CMT1A) the primary defect resides in the axon-associated myelinating glia (Schwann cells), and it is unknown whether the axonal energy metabolism is perturbed before the onset of axon degeneration.</p><p>Axonal ATP consumption in white matter tracts largely depends on the electric spiking activity that differs between regions, and it is virtually impossible to biochemically determine ATP selectively in the axonal compartment and under 'working conditions' with a high temporal and spatial resolution. To solve this problem, we have developed a novel approach to simultaneously study action potential propagation and ATP levels in axons of optic nerves of mice, a white matter tract suitable for studying axonal energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stys et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saab et al., 2016</xref>). We established the transgenic mouse line ThyAT, in which the fluorescent ATP-sensor ATeam1.03<sup>YEMK</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>) shows pan-neuronal expression in vivo. Stimulating electrically optic nerves acutely isolated from those mice, we combined recordings of compound action potentials (CAP) with confocal imaging of the ATP-sensor to evaluate and compare both axonal conductivity and ATP levels. We find that (1) axonal glycolysis is not sufficient to robustly sustain CAPs and physiological ATP levels, but mitochondrial function is needed to provide ATP; (2) during high-frequency propagation of action potentials, CAPs are a well-suited parameter to estimate axonal ATP levels; (3) lactate metabolism is essential for the maintenance of axonal ATP levels, and its inhibition severely affects energy homeostasis of myelinated axons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ATP imaging in optic nerves</title><p>The genetically encoded ATP-sensor ATeam1.03<sup>YEMK</sup> allows FRET-based monitoring of cellular ATP levels close to real-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>).

However, axonal ATP production strongly depends on mitochondrial respiration, and axonal glycolysis alone is insufficient to maintain ATP levels, even in the virtual absence of electrical activity (baseline recording conditions with 0.033 Hz stimulation frequency).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24241.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Impairment of axonal ATP and CAP by glucose deprivation and/or inhibition of mitochondrial respiration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Removal of glucose from the aCSF (glucose deprivation, GD, 45 min) induces similar ATP (red) and CAP (black) decays starting at around 13 min after onset of the treatment.

Similarly, when MCT1/MCT2-mediated lactate transport was inhibited using the specific inhibitor AR-C155858 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ovens et al., 2010</xref>), relative ATP levels were strongly reduced (at 100 Hz: 24.8 ± 4.1%; p=0.0004; n = 5 nerves), but with no effect on CAP performance (at 100 Hz: Glc: 69.5 ± 4.2%; Glc+AR-C155858: 62.8 ± 3.3%; p=0.37; n = 6 nerves; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating the presence of a ‘safety window’. When lactate metabolism was impaired, ATP/CAP ratios strongly deviated from the normal ‘1:1 ratio’ observed in the presence of glucose alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). Collectively, these results strengthen the conclusion that pyruvate/lactate metabolism is required to maintain ATP levels in fast spiking axons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The axonal energy balance is determined by the equilibrium of ATP consumption and ATP generation, which is a function of axonal spiking frequency and metabolic support, the latter provided in part by glycolytic oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fünfschilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saab et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we have generated transgenic mice expressing an ATP-sensor in neurons and in the axonal compartment of myelinated nerves. These mice allowed us to study for the first time the interrelationship of electrical activity and axonal ATP homeostasis in real time by adapting an established optic nerve model of white matter electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Ransom, 2007</xref>). Specifically, we show that both CAPs and axonal ATP content decrease in a stimulation frequency-dependent manner, and that even in the presence of glucose as (exogenous) energy substrate, lactate contributes to ATP homeostasis. We also analyzed short-term adaptations of metabolism in a model of ischemic stroke when ATP demands are increased, i.e. the recovery phase from transient glucose deprivation and mitochondrial inhibition.</p><p>While being a powerful experimental system, some caveats need to be taken into account to interpret the obtained results. First, the signal of the ATeam1.03<sup>YEMK</sup> sensor is not linearly related to ATP over an extended range of concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>). However, in cultured neurons the cytosolic ATP concentration has been estimated at approximately 2 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rangaraju et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pathak et al., 2015</xref>), i.e. within the linear range of ATeam1.03<sup>YEMK</sup>. We are thus confident that the observed changes in sensor signal reflect similar relative changes of axonal ATP. However, as calibration of the ATP-sensor signal to absolute cytosolic concentrations is difficult in the myelinated optic nerve, a precise estimation of the absolute concentration of axonal ATP awaits further technical advances. Nevertheless, changes of the ATP signal in the course of an experiment could be detected even after mild stimulations, which suggest that the basal axonal ATP level is within the dynamic range of the sensor with its K<sub>D</sub> of 1.2 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Secondly, with the spatial resolution of our approach, ATP signals reflect mean cytosolic concentrations in the axoplasm. It has been suggested that local differences of ATP consumption by Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase lead to ATP microdomains close to the cell membrane with low ATP concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Toloe et al., 2014</xref>). Contrarily, ATP diffusion is reported to be very fast not allowing formation of ATP microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barros et al., 2013</xref>). While such highly localized changes of ATP would be missed in our experiments, they are unlikely to affect the principle findings.</p><p>Finally, CAPs recorded with supra-threshold stimulation reflect the summation of action potential propagation of virtually all axons within the optic nerve. In contrast, ATP imaging was performed on a single optical plane close to the surface of the nerve comprising typically around 30 axons. Therefore, the observed ATP signals are likely not representative for all axons, as the diffusion of substrates into the core of the nerve may be less efficient than to axons closer to the surface. Our attempts to address this issue by 2-photon laser scanning microscopy deeper within the nerve have failed so far, due to scattering occurring in a densely packed and fully myelinated optic nerve (ASS, unpublished observation). Taking such an inside-out gradient of increasing perfusion efficacy into account, our approach is presently the best possible approximation of the simultaneous monitoring of both parameters. Thus, we are not yet able to assign absolute ATP concentrations to physiological properties of spiking axons. However, we can readily (i) monitor ATP changes as a function of axonal spiking activity, (ii) compare metabolites, (iii) assess the role of disease-causing mutations on axonal conduction and energy metabolism, also under physiological challenge, and finally (iv) study selected drugs and nutrients in axonal energy metabolism to explore treatment strategies.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Monitoring axonal ATP homeostasis</title><p>Targeting the energy producing biochemical pathways by the withdrawal of glucose (GD), blocking mitochondrial respiration (MB), or both (MB+GD), rapidly reduced axonal ATP content, as expected. In GD, ATP fell after 13 min, consistent with the utilization of astroglial glycogen as a reserve fuel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Ransom, 2007</xref>). In contrast, MB caused an immediate drop in ATP. In all conditions, ATP decreases preceded or coincided with CAP decay, confirming that energy depletion causes axonal failure (but see caveat above). Interestingly, after GD in the subsequent recovery phase with glucose, the restoration of ATP levels appeared delayed compared to the recovery of conduction. We therefore suggest that at the beginning of reperfusion most newly generated ATP is consumed by Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases for reestablishing ion gradients and conduction before it accumulates in the axon and binds to the ATP-sensor.</p><p>Astrocytes can mobilize glycogen and generate lactate to support axonal energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2005</xref>). However, it has been a long-standing debate whether neuronal compartments prefer glucose or lactate as energy-rich substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pellerin and Magistretti, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dienel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nave, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hirrlinger and Nave, 2014</xref>). In the optic nerve, glucose and pyruvate/lactate can sustain CAP propagation. We found that axonal ATP levels were significantly lower during HFS when nerves were incubated with lactate or pyruvate as the sole energy substrate. This suggests that lactate/pyruvate alone does not support ATP production as well as glucose and confirms observations in cultured cerebellar granule cells with repetitive activation of NMDA-receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lange et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, lactate metabolism contributes to axonal energy homeostasis, even in the presence of glucose, as evidenced by blocking lactate metabolism with D-lactate or AR-C155858. In the presence of these inhibitors, ATP decreased more strongly than CAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>), suggesting the presence of a ‘safety window’. It also breaks the striking correlation of ATP and CAP observed under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E,F</xref>). One possible explanation is that changes in CAP are related to ATP consumption, while inhibition of lactate transport affects ATP production. Since the axonal stimulation protocol is unchanged, also the consumption of ATP should be similar in the presence of inhibitors of lactate metabolism. Therefore, the inhibition of lactate metabolism impairs ATP production and causes a lower steady-state level of ATP, but the consumption rates during HFS remain the same.</p><p>Furthermore, this finding suggests that ‘endogenous’ lactate (i.e. produced from glucose) is more efficient than lactate provided in the medium. One possibility is that glucose enters the nerve more rapidly than lactate, because glucose transporter expression is optimized in comparison to MCT1. Moreover, glucose and glycolysis intermediates are readily shuttled via gap junctional coupling between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, with lactate being generated also close to the periaxonal space, whereas exogenous lactate has a more complex path of diffusion involving mostly extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hirrlinger and Nave, 2014</xref>). We note that from an evolutionary point of view, such optimization of glucose utilization is of advantage for the brain, because the liver always aims at generating a constant blood glucose level, even under starvation conditions.</p><p>Taken together, combining ATP imaging and electrophysiology, we demonstrate that metabolic imaging is a very sensitive analysis tool for real-time monitoring of axonal energy homeostasis and the underlying neuron-glia interactions in electrically active fiber tracts. Applied to models of diseases this technology will be able to detect subtle perturbations of axonal energy homeostasis and allow addressing the hypothesis that energy deficits are an early and most likely causal event for neurodegeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Animals were treated in accordance with the German Protection of Animals Act (TSchG §4 Abs. 3), with the guidelines for the welfare of experimental animals issued by the European Communities Council Directive 2010/63/EU as well as the regulation of the institutional ‘Tierschutzkommission’ and the local authorities (T04/13, T20/16; Landesdirektion Leipzig, LAVES Niedersachsen).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Transgenic mice</title><p>Animals were bred in the animal facility of the Max-Planck-Institute for Experimental Medicine as well as the Medical Faculty of the University of Leipzig.

The CAP area is proportional to the total number of excited axons and represents a convenient and reliable means of monitoring optic nerve axon function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stys et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saab et al., 2016</xref>). CAP was expressed as area under the CAP wave form in a range of approximately 1.5 ms, defined by the beginning of the response (typically at 0.2 ms after the stimulus) and approximately the end of the second peak of the CAP wave form, thereby analyzing the first and second peak characteristic of the optic nerve evoked CAP. These two peaks are indicative for the large and medium-sized axons within the optic nerve, which are those that will mainly be resolved by confocal imaging of the ATP sensor expressed in axons. During high frequency action potential propagation, amplitudes of CAP peaks generally decrease, while peak latencies increase. The measured CAP area integrates these two functional changes of nerve conduction. It is, therefore, a parameter well suited to quantify overall functional changes of the optic nerve. Data were normalized to the mean obtained during the initial 15 min (defined as baseline, i.e. no experimental condition applied). Results from several nerves were pooled, averaged, and plotted against time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>ATP</title><p>The relative amount of ATP in the optic nerve was calculated in two steps.

The F/C ratio was then normalized to zero using the F/C value obtained by application of MB+GD at the end of each experiment, i.e. by depleting all axons from ATP. Furthermore, F/C values obtained during baseline recordings in 10 mM glucose at the beginning of each experiment were set to one. In all experiments, YFP fluorescence upon direct excitation of YFP was analyzed in parallel. Importantly, YFP fluorescence intensity remained stable throughout the experiments suggesting that the observed changes of the F/C ratio are most likely not due to artificial modulation e.g. by changes in intra-axonal pH.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>ATP and CAP parameters</title><p>For GD, MB and MB+GD conditions, <italic>m</italic> coefficients for the slope-intercepts at the point of maximal change of the signal were used to calculate the CAP and ATP rate per second, during the initial decay and the recovery following reperfusion with aCSF containing 10 mM glucose.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marc Freeman; Brian MacVicar; Peter Stys. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary: All three reviewers thought that this was an important study and were enthusiastic about publication after appropriate revisions. The major issue was concerning the sample size on some of the experiments particularly the last set of data, and with some technical considerations raised by reviewers 2 and 3 that require your attention and potentially some additional data. This sample size issue is well-elaborated in the comments of reviewer 2 below. You may also want to consider whether the MCT experiments contribute sufficiently to the manuscript to warrant inclusion as described by reviewer 1. As the reviewer comments are rather straightforward and non-overlapping, the original text of their reviews is included below. Your revisions should modify the text of the revised manuscript so that readers of your paper that have similar concerns will be able to assess the data appropriately.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is a very important study that combines live imaging, a mouse model of disease, and metabolic experiments to explore some very basic and important questions in axonal biology. Nave and colleagues, for the first time to my knowledge, directly measure (simultaneously) compound action potentials (CAP) and axonal ATP levels in a dissected whole optic nerve preparation. They first generate what will be a very useful mouse for the field where an ATP sensor is expressed under control of the Thy1 promoter and identify lines that nicely label most neurons. They then track ATP levels and CAP after stimulation at different frequencies. In short, they provide a number of interesting observations that argue for a major role for ATP in axons in regulating the ability of neurons to fire. By performing glucose deprivation and blockade of mitochondrial function they explore the differences in how ATP levels fall, how that affects CAPs, and how quickly neurons recover the ability to fire CAPs. Through these experiments they answer many long standing questions and show: 1) axonal glycolysis is not enough to robustly sustain CAPs, mitochondrial function is key, 2) blocking mitochondrial function rapidly blocks CAPs, 3) glucose, pyruvate and lactate can all sustain CAP activity, and 4) blockade of MCT function or lactate transport only mildly affects CAP, but more strongly affects ATP. It is suprising how much ATP can be around, yet CAPs still fire. The final interesting, but not fully explained phenotype that is observed is the fact that PLP1 KO animals exhibit strong defects in ATP and CAPs, even in the presence of extracellular lactate or glucose. Why PLP1 KO animals are more sensitive than WT controls to high frequency stimulation is unclear. Finally, the MCT het KO experiments are not particularly informative. If easy, repeating the experiment in an oligo-specifc cKO situation would be very interesting. So, I'm not sure what that experiment really adds.</p><p>Overall the experiments are very well done, they establish an exciting new system to examine axonal ATP levels and CAPs in an intact nerve preparation, and they provide some of the most satisfying experiments I know of that address the sufficiency of glucose, lactate, and pyruvate for sustaining axonal ATP and CAPs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This study follows from an impressive series of discoveries over the past few years from this research team on the roles for oligodendrocytes in providing energy substrates to maintain axonal functions and survival. They have created a very impressive and clever animal model of disease with a novel strategy to detect ATP levels in neurons using a FRET sensor for ATP. This potentially provides the authors with a method to examine the changes in ATP levels and metabolically driven alterations in ATP at different times leading up to clear manifestations of the disease phenotype. The authors observed remarkable parallels between CAP and ATP that are very reassuring for the interpretation of their altered relationship in the disease model. The authors have also been able to test the impact of spiking frequencies on ATP levels as a parallel to several previous studies that have shown decreasing ATP levels reduces action potential firing in optic nerves. Again, the authors found striking correlations between the spike frequency, the decrease in ATP levels and the impact on compound action potentials as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>1) The authors show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> that there is a striking correspondence between decreases in both CAP and ATP during high frequency stimulation. However, the relationship appears to break down when changes are compared in fairly high concentrations of D-lactate or in the MCT<sub>1/2</sub> inhibitor AR-C155858. Why is this?</p><p>2) The pH dependence from the original Imamura PNAS paper is complex and varies depending on the ATP concentration. The excitation for FRET at 458 is a longer wavelength than the Imamura paper (435 nm). At 435 nm there is selective excitation of CFP but at 458 there is some excitation of YFP. Therefore, at this wavelength there is a minor component of YFP direct excitation contributing to the FRET signal. This is a potential worry that the authors could eliminate by testing the pH dependence using their system. The authors mention normalizing some of the results with changes in YFP fluorescence changes. However, this is not clearly explained in the Methods. Was this always done? Could changes in pH play a role in altering the FRET signals in the animals’ disease models at different times of development. I suspect not but the authors should include some discussion on these points.</p><p>3) The activity dependent changes in ATP signals and therefore ATP changes during high frequency spiking are very interesting. However, the results in Figure 6 are the critical data for concluding there are early changes in the disease model. There are small changes in the disease model in the ATP FRET signal at 50 Hz stim in glucose and in the lactate groups. However, these results are only from 3 nerves in each group (Figure 6D and F). This small number seems too low particularly as there is one quite divergent value in the 50 Hz lactate category. In addition the authors should include both the number of animals and the number of nerves (e.g. was more than one nerve used from one animal). The text in the Results section states there were 4 nerves in each set but there are only 3 points in the bar charts and the figure legends says 3 nerves.</p><p>4) Subsection “PLP loss in oligodendrocytes impairs axonal ATP homeostasis”, last paragraph: The authors hint there is a non-significant trend towards reduced ATP levels in the optic nerves from <italic>Slc16a1</italic> gets but I don't see this and it is not significant. Therefore, I would conclude that there is no effect if it is not statistically significant. In the conclusions &quot;Applied to a mouse model of X-linked spastic paraplegia or SPG-2 we were able to detect an effect of mutant oligodendrocytes on axonal energy metabolism and physiology several months before these animals develop widespread axonal loss and spastic paraplegia. Compared at a preclinical stage to wildtype nerves, ATP homeostasis is impaired in axons conducting at high frequency, but appears normal under resting conditions.&quot; The data has the minimum n values to state that ATP homeostasis is impaired. The authors should increase the number of experiments to provide more robust evidence. There may be variations in the handling etc. that may distort a few of the values in such a few experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting and elegant study of CNS axon energy metabolism with a focus on axonal ATP using using a novel axonally-expressed FRET-based fluorescent ATP reporter. Importantly, they shed important light on how genetic defects of myelin production paradoxically result in axonal degeneration.</p><p>1) &quot;while after 2min of MB+GD the F/C-ratio was reduced by 35.1% ± 1.7% (n=19 121 nerves; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>)&quot;: p values and significance need to be cited.</p><p>2) Subsection “Data analysis” – CAP analysis: I agree with authors' choice of analyzing CAP area up to 1.5ms, which should include large and medium-sized axons, the ones that will be resolvable by confocal imaging. Authors should explain this point in Methods.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: authors should include a supplementary figure showing representative CAP waveforms and how they decay with the various energy deprivation paradigms, which may differ.</p><p>4) Given points 2 and 3 above, raises a potential difficulty: consider <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> for example, where CAP changes also include a significant lengthening of the waveform: by restricting the area analysis to 1.5ms, while still imaging ATP FRET signals in medium-sized axons by confocal, there may arise an artifactual disconnect between CAP area and axonal ATP levels, merely because CAP lengthening will move significant signal beyond their 1.5ms integration window. Authors should explain how they dealt with this potential limitation and how it may have affected their results.</p><p>5) Subsection “ATP homeostasis of myelinated axons depends on lactate metabolism”, last paragraph: &quot;…plus 20mM D-lactate.…&quot;: authors should clarify that physiological lactate is the L isomer for readers who may not know.</p><p>6) Discussion, third paragraph: given their ATP FRET reporter, can the authors give a rough estimate of absolute ATP concentrations in axons? This would be an interesting piece of reference data for the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24241.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is a very important study that combines live imaging, a mouse model of disease, and metabolic experiments to explore some very basic and important questions in axonal biology.

So, I'm not sure what that experiment really adds.</italic> </p><p>We very much agree with these points and have changed the manuscript accordingly (see also the response to referee 2 below).</p><p>The original &quot;motivation&quot; to include Plp1 KO and MCT1 het data at this stage was twofold. We had thought this could provide a missing &quot;proof-of-principle&quot; that the recently discovered function of oligodendrocytes in metabolic support of axon function (Fünfschilling et al., Nature 2012; Lee et al., Nature 20012) and our much older observation that oligodendrocytes are required for axonal integrity independent of myelin itself (Griffiths et al., Science 1998; Lappe-Siefke et al., Nat Genet. 2003) are two sides of the same coin. However, we realize that it is better to make this point with a full-sized data set once we have generated the necessary mouse numbers. Additional mouse mutants will be available only in about 6 months from now.</p><p>Similarly, the motivation to include MCT1 heterozygous mice here was the attempt to bridge to the Nature paper by Lee et al. (2012), assuming axonal degeneration in the optic nerve is preceded by an early metabolic phenotype. Surprisingly, no differences in axonal ATP levels were detected yet between MCT heterozygous mice and controls (see original Figure 6—figure supplement 1). This is likely no contradiction to Lee et al. as we investigated optic nerves at much earlier time points. Most likely, we will make different observations later in life. We also point out that the most degeneration-prone axons of Lee et al. 2012 (and also in Griffiths et al., 1998) are those of small radial caliber, whereas we selected on average larger axons for FRET analysis and CAP recordings.</p><p>We have now followed the advice of referee 1 and have removed Figure 6—figure supplement 1 from the final manuscript. The suggestion to include oligodendrocyte-specific MCT1 cKO mice awaits the collaboration with our US colleagues who may be willing to provide us with MCT1-floxed mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] 1) The authors show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> that there is a striking correspondence between decreases in both CAP and ATP during high frequency stimulation. However, the relationship appears to break down when changes are compared in fairly high concentrations of D-lactate or in the MCT<sub>1/2</sub> inhibitor AR-C155858. Why is this?</italic> </p><p>We presume this point refers to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> (notably <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). Indeed, this is an intriguing finding, which confirms CAP area on one hand as a proxy for axonal ATP levels; however, under metabolic stress (high frequency stimulation in combination with inhibition of lactate metabolism) CAP recordings appear less vulnerable than ATP measurements.</p><p>The concentration of ATP in the axon is affected by both the usage of ATP and its production. Changes in CAP might be more related to ATP consumption, while inhibition of lactate transport and metabolism most likely mainly affects ATP production. As the stimulation protocol is identical in controls and after application of D-lactate or AR-C155858, we assume that consumption of ATP is similar in these conditions. Therefore, we think the most likely explanation is that inhibition of lactate metabolism impairs ATP production, resulting in a lower level of ATP as observed in our experiments.</p><p>Formally, we cannot exclude other mechanisms, such as the increasing levels of extracellular K<sup>+</sup> or altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. However, all changes in CAP are likely related to ATP consumption, while inhibition of lactate transport would affect ATP production. We also note that the CAP waveform is not affected by the presence of these inhibitors (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that axonal conduction properties not dramatically impaired.</p><p>A discussion of this issue has been added to the last paragraph of the subsection “ATP homeostasis of myelinated axons depends on lactate metabolism”.</p><p><italic>2) The pH dependence from the original Imamura PNAS paper is complex and varies depending on the ATP concentration. The excitation for FRET at 458 is a longer wavelength than the Imamura paper (435 nm). At 435 nm there is selective excitation of CFP but at 458 there is some excitation of YFP.

Could changes in pH play a role in altering the FRET signals in the animals’ disease models at different times of development. I suspect not but the authors should include some discussion on these points.</italic> </p><p>We agree this is an important point that indeed might affect experiments using FRET based sensors for metabolites.</p><p>In our experiments, we had always determined the ATP concentration by a ratiometric measurement, i.e. FRET / CFP = (excitation of CFP / emission of YFP) divided by (excitation of CFP / emission of CFP). YFP-fluorescence is considered the most pH sensitive part of the sensor and YFP fluorescence should change in case of significant pH changes. We had therefore also monitored (routinely) the YFP fluorescence following direct YFP excitation at 514 nm to reveal such pH effects, which we did not detect. In fact, the YFP signal was very stable in those experiments, which is shown for the experiments with application of mitochondrial blockage plus glucose deprivation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> of the original manuscript. Thus, it is unlikely that the ATP-signal is mainly a modulation of the readout due to pH changes. We have added a clarifying statement in the Methods section (subsection “ATP”).</p><p>In response to this point, we have added more experiments analyzing YFP fluorescence during glucose deprivation, mitochondrial blockage, and during high frequency stimulation (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>) and added a corresponding description in the Results sections “Kinetics of ATP decline during energy deprivation” and “ATP homeostasis of myelinated axons depends on lactate metabolism”. This shows that also under more challenging conditions, pH changes did not significantly affect our ATP recordings.</p><p><italic>3) The activity dependent changes in ATP signals and therefore ATP changes during high frequency spiking are very interesting. However, the results in Figure 6 are the critical data for concluding there are early changes in the disease model. There are small changes in the disease model in the ATP FRET signal at 50 Hz stim in glucose and in the lactate groups. However, these results are only from 3 nerves in each group (Figure 6D and F).

Here, ATP imaging of one nerve could not be properly analyzed (due to loosing of focal plane) while CAP recordings were normally analyzed. We have now repeated these experiments and n numbers are now for both inhibitors increased to n=6 for CAP and n=5 for ATP.

When using a &quot;fixed&quot; time window (as done in our present analysis) there is no need to define the borders between different peaks, which can be difficult and arbitrary, or to define the time point when the CAP area reaches baseline level again (note the asymptotic curve). However, as pointed out this approach is risking an overestimation of the loss of CAP area with increasing peak latencies (which is indeed the case for the high frequency stimulation depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, the CAP areas measured with a &quot;fixed&quot; time window integrate two functional changes of nerve conduction: the decrease of peak amplitudes and the increase in peak latency. It is, therefore, a parameter well suited to quantify overall functional changes of the optic nerve. As already discussed in our original manuscript, ATP imaging was performed in a single optical plane comprising typically around 30 axons with a random proportion of large and medium sized axons, while CAP recordings reflect the summation of action potential propagation of virtually all axons within the optic nerve. We therefore never did attempt to relate changes in single CAP peaks to ATP changes. However, the results obtained are consistent between different nerves irrespectively of the selected imaging region (and therefore the proportion of large and medium-sized axons), suggesting that both parameters used are a good approximation for the functional properties of the optic nerve.</p><p>We have a clarifying sentence Methods section “CAP”.</p><p><italic>5) Subsection “ATP homeostasis of myelinated axons depends on lactate metabolism”, last paragraph: &quot;…plus 20mM D-lactate.…&quot;: authors should clarify that physiological lactate is the L isomer for readers who may not know.</italic> </p><p>We agree and have added an explanatory note on D-lactate and L-lactate in the third paragraph of the subsection “ATP homeostasis of myelinated axons depends on lactate metabolism”.</p><p><italic>6) Discussion, third paragraph: given their ATP FRET reporter, can the authors give a rough estimate of absolute ATP concentrations in axons? This would be an interesting piece of reference data for the field.</italic> </p><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that the absolute concentration of ATP in axons is a missing information. Indeed, we have spent significant effort in trying to calibrate the ATP sensor, which, however, is more difficult than expected:</p><p>i) Calibration should be performed in the same tissue as the measurement itself (optic nerve axons) in order to avoid errors caused by sample specific optical properties i.e. scattering light in anisotropic tissue.</p><p>ii) For calibration, ATP concentrations need to be controlled from outside, e.g. by permeabilizing the membrane, but without leakage of the sensor itself. So far we were unsuccessful to do this, because myelin membranes require quite harsh permeabilization conditions.</p><p>iii) Even if permeabilization is successful, it is difficult to achieve an equal distribution of ATP inside and outside a cellular compartment. We note that ATP is a negatively charged molecule that does not diffuse freely into axons through a membrane with a negative membrane potential.</p><p>iv) Numerous intracellular enzymes use ATP and it is almost impossible to block all ATP consuming processes (the main consumer Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase can be blocked, but many others not). The risk remains that ATP inside the axon is lower than outside. For all these reasons we have not included absolute ATP concentrations in our original manuscript.</p><p>However, as we readily see changes of the ATP signal in the course of an experiment, it is very likely that the basal ATP level is within the dynamic range of the sensor (Kd = 1.2 mM, Imamura et al., 2009), possibly close to 2 mM. This concentration would also be in line with the recently reported concentration of free ATP in cultured neurons (1.4 mM; Rangaraju et al., 2014) and synaptic boutons of cultured neurons (2-4mM; Pathak et al., 2015).</p><p>We have added a sentence explaining this issue in the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>To really solve this issue in the not too distant future, we have started analyzing the ATP sensor signals by fluorescent life time imaging (FLIM). This approach should allow a more precise calibration and absolute measurement of ATP concentrations in optic nerves, as the FLIM readouts are expected to not be that affected by the cellular environment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
