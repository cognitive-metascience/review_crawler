pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05864.001</object-id><p>Morphogenesis emerges from complex multiscale interactions between genetic and mechanical processes. To understand these processes, the evolution of cell shape, proliferation and gene expression must be quantified. This quantification is usually performed either in full 3D, which is computationally expensive and technically challenging, or on 2D planar projections, which introduces geometrical artifacts on highly curved organs. Here we present MorphoGraphX (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.MorphoGraphX.org">www.MorphoGraphX.org</ext-link>), a software that bridges this gap by working directly with curved surface images extracted from 3D data. In addition to traditional 3D image analysis, we have developed algorithms to operate on curved surfaces, such as cell segmentation, lineage tracking and fluorescence signal quantification. The software's modular design makes it easy to include existing libraries, or to implement new algorithms. Cell geometries extracted with MorphoGraphX can be exported and used as templates for simulation models, providing a powerful platform to investigate the interactions between shape, genes and growth.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05864.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05864.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05864.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals, plants and other multicellular organisms develop their distinctive three-dimensional shapes as they grow. This process—called morphogenesis—is influenced by many genes and involves communication between cells to control the ability of individual cells to divide and grow. The precise timing and location of events in particular cells is very important in determining the final shape of the organism.</p><p>Common techniques for studying morphogenesis use microscopes to take 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) time-lapse videos of living cells. Fluorescent tags allow scientists to observe specific proteins, cell boundaries, and interactions between individual cells. These imaging techniques can produce large sets of data that need to be analyzed using a computer and incorporated into computer simulations that predict how a tissue or organ within an organism grows to form its final shape.</p><p>Currently, most computational models of morphogenesis work on 2D templates and focus on how tissues and organs form. However, many patterning events occur on surfaces that are curved or folded, so 2D models may lose important details. Developing 3D models would provide a more accurate picture, but these models are expensive and technically challenging to make.</p><p>To address this problem, Barbier de Reuille, Routier-Kierzkowska et al. present an open-source, customizable software platform called MorphoGraphX. This software extracts images from 3D data to recreate curved 2D surfaces. Barbier de Reuille, Routier-Kierkowska et al. have also developed algorithms to help analyze growth and gene activity in these curved images, and the data can be exported and used in computer simulations.</p><p>Several scientists have already used this software in their studies, but Barbier de Reuille, Routier-Kierzkowska et al. have now made the software more widely available and have provided a full explanation of how it works. How scientists can extend and customize MorphoGraphX to answer their own unique research questions is also described. It is anticipated that MorphoGraphX will become a popular platform for the open sharing of computational tools to study morphogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

Key to this methodology is the combination of time-lapse microscopy to quantify changes in cell geometry and gene expression with dynamic spatial modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jönsson et al., 2012</xref>). Confocal microscopy is frequently the tool of choice for data collection, as the proliferation of fluorescence markers and variations in the method make it possible to visualize proteins, organelles, cell boundaries, and even protein–protein interaction and protein movement in vivo. Other technologies such as serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denk and Horstmann, 2004</xref>) make it possible to study sub-cellular structures at a much higher resolution on fixed samples. However, despite the rapid advancement of 3D imaging technologies, there is a lack of methods and software to process and quantify these data and to integrate them within simulation environments.</p><p>Most simulation models of morphogenesis operate on 2D templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dumais and Steele, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jönsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merks et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stoma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kondo and Miura, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Varner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kennaway et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Santuari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aegerter-Wilmsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kierzkowski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sampathkumar et al., 2014</xref>). This is not surprising since many key biological processes occur on surfaces, for example in epithelial layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lecuit and Lenne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Savaldi-Goldstein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heller et al., 2014</xref>). Morphogenesis involves complex 3D deformation, such as folding during gastrulation in animal systems or bulging out of new lateral organs in plants, causing significant curvature in the tissues controlling these events. It is therefore essential to be able to quantify cell shapes and fluorescence-based reporters on curved surface layers of cells. The simplest method to achieve this is to take several image slices and project them onto a single plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chickarmane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuchen et al., 2012</xref>). However, when trying to quantify cell shape change, division orientations, or growth, distortions due to the projection quickly become too large as the angle between the surface and the projection plane increases. Even small amounts of tissue curvature can hinder the accurate imaging of a single cell layer over an entire sample. To alleviate some of these issues, methods have been developed to determine the 3D position of cell junctions on the surface, while the segmentation into cells is still performed on flat 2D images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dumais and Kwiatkowska, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">de Reuille et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Routier-Kierzkowska and Kwiatkowska, 2008</xref>). However these approaches are labor intensive, limited to tissues that can be visualized as a flat 2D image, and are not accurate when the angle of the tissue with the projection plane becomes too large. Furthermore, methods based on tissue casts combined with stereo reconstruction of SEM images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dumais and Kwiatkowska, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Routier-Kierzkowska and Kwiatkowska, 2008</xref>) need to be combined with methods using fluorescent markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Uyttewaal et al., 2012</xref>) if gene expression is to be monitored.</p><p>Here we present a method and the open-source software MorphoGraphX (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.MorphoGraphX.org/">www.MorphoGraphX.org</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>) to quantify the temporal evolution of cellular geometry and fluorescence signal on curved 2D surface layers of cells over multiple time points in both plants and animals. In addition to 2D curved surfaces, MorphoGraphX also possesses a rich set of tools for full 3D image processing and cell segmentation, and can be used to easily transfer realistic cell geometries and fluorescent marker data into computational modeling environments. MorphoGraphX is built from a collection of loadable modules (shared libraries), centered around an interactive visualization core that exploits the latest features of modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). This design allows the software to be easily adapted to changing research needs, and facilitates the integration of algorithms from other open-source imaging processing libraries into a custom work flow. The software is the first of its kind specialized to process curved surface layers of cells, and here we demonstrate its capabilities both in plant and animal systems.</p><boxed-text id="box1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05864.003</object-id><label>Box 1.</label><caption><title>All resources for MorphoGraphX, including the user manual, the latest software downloads and the source code, can be found on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.MorphoGraphX.org/">www.MorphoGraphX.org</ext-link>.</title><p>The latest version of the documentation is also distributed with MorphoGraphX itself, and is available from the ‘Help’ menu (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

After extracting the shape of an organ, 3D data just below the surface can be projected onto it, creating a curved image of the outer layer of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This enables the extraction of precise cell outlines without the distortions associated with a flat 2D projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have found that many algorithms designed for 2 and 3D image processing can be adapted to our curved surface images. Feature extraction in MorphoGraphX typically follows a pattern: (i) volumetric data (often a cell outline marker) is pre-processed to remove noise or obstructions; (ii) the object of interest is turned into a mask (binary image); (iii) the object is extracted as a surface mesh; (iv) volumetric data is projected onto the surface; (v) the projection is used for segmentation of the surface into cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). The segmentation can be fully automatic (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>) or directed by manually placed seeds. Steps (i–iii) can be repeated as surfaces of interest will often be used to help pre-processing the volumetric data. For example, surfaces can be used to trim the 3D image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), or to select regions of interest for data analysis.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05864.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Feature extraction and 3D editing of confocal image stacks.</title><p>A sample workflow from raw data to segmented cells is presented for an <italic>A. thaliana</italic> flower (<bold>A</bold>–<bold>F</bold>).

In organs with larger cells, a more sophisticated analysis of the signal near the walls, such as that used in the CellSeT software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pound et al., 2012</xref>), could be implemented for curved surfaces.

In addition, the use with segmented images allows the border exclusion zone to be assigned automatically, substantially reducing the clicking required and greatly increases throughput. Fiber orientation is determined by finding the principal component of color gradient within each cell. The main orientation of fibers (<bold>B</bold>, white segments) is perpendicular to the direction of maximal gradient. The degree of fiber orientation (<bold>B</bold>, colormap), or anisotropy, is given by the formula: (gradientMax/gradientMin -1).

This is particularly useful to distinguish protein expression levels at different depths within an organ. As an illustration, in the shoot apical meristem of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> we can observe that the auxin efflux carrier PINFORMED1 (PIN1) is first upregulated in the epidermis at the site of incipient primordium initiation before being activated in deeper layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kierzkowski et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Quantification can also be performed at the sub-cellular scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pound et al., 2012</xref>). The amount of fluorescence signal projected onto the triangle mesh can be divided into a membrane localized portion and a cell interior portion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is accomplished by summing all the signal within a fixed distance from a cell border and considering it as being associated with the membrane, while all the signal further away from the cell outline is called internal. The process can be used to quantify what portion of a tagged protein, for example, the auxin efflux carrier PIN1, is localized to the plasma membrane or internalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakayama et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Projection of the signal on the surface allows to summarize essential information from several channels of a large confocal data set into a very compact form. For example, the global shape of the sample can be extracted from an autofluorescence signal, while the cell wall or membrane marker collected in another channel is used to segment cells and obtain their geometry. The expression level of a protein from a third channel may then be quantified at the cellular level based on the segmentation. Finally, several samples in a time lapse experiment can be compared to obtain information about the temporal evolution of shape and gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Time lapse analysis</title><p>In addition to data from single image stacks, MorphoGraphX is able to process and compare multiple time points. This enables the analysis of stacks before and after experimental treatments, or time-lapse data. This capability relies on an efficient method to co-segment samples from two time points. One approach is to segment both stacks separately and then to use an automated algorithm to match the points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandez et al., 2010</xref>). However, automatic segmentation and matching can be prone to errors that have to be checked and corrected by hand, which can be very time-consuming depending on the error rate. For this we have developed a user-friendly interface in MorphoGraphX to manually identify cell lineages on curved surfaces representing the tissue at different time points (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). Errors in lineage are detected automatically by comparing the neighborhoods of daughter cells and their parents. Once the co-segmentation is complete, changes in cell area or gene expression over the interval between two time points can be computed and visualized as a heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Cell proliferation can also be visualized as a colormap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vlad et al., 2014</xref>), along with marking of the new walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Pairwise correspondence between time points can be combined in longer time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), for example to perform clonal analysis over several days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vlad et al., 2014</xref>).

The shoot apex is the source of all the aerial structure of the plant. At the summit, a slow growing central zone harbors the stem cell niche, surrounded by a fast growing peripheral zone where organ initiation occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Steeves and Sussex, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dumais and Kwiatkowska, 2002</xref>).

The first geometrical indicator of primordium initiation we noted was a slightly elevated curvature at the corner of the meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwiatkowska and Dumais, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kwiatkowska, 2004</xref>). This early change in shape coincided with increased growth in the peripheral zone. The peripheral zone itself displayed differential growth dependent on the dynamics of primordium initiation. Regions adjacent to older primordia exhibited fast, highly anisotropic expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Interestingly, while auxin activity is already visible at the first sign of primordium initiation, DR5 expression does not strictly correlate with growth. In particular, no DR5 signal is detected in the fast expanding regions close to older primordia. We also found that DR5 expression is present in the crease separating young primordia from the meristem, an area where the cells exhibited a slight decrease in surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

This has wide application, since many biological processes happen on surfaces, and the method has been proven in both animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aegerter-Wilmsen et al., 2012</xref>) and plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Santuari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chitwood et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kierzkowski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakayama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Rybel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kierzkowski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wabnik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sampathkumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vlad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshida et al., 2014</xref>) systems, in embryonic as well as mature tissues. The method is especially powerful for time-lapse confocal imaging, where laser exposure has to be kept to a minimum, limiting penetration to the outermost layers of the sample. In addition to curved surface image processing, MorphoGraphX provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the visualization and editing of 3D volumetric data, making it possible to digitally remove obstructing objects from the surface of interest, such as the peripodial membrane overlying the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aegerter-Wilmsen et al., 2012</xref>). We have also included a range of standard 3D image processing tools, similar to those available in many other softwares (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sommer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Federici et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mosaliganti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>). These can be used for 3D segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Rybel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshida et al., 2014</xref>), or to pre-process data before surface extraction.</p><p>The modular design of MorphoGraphX allows the integration of existing libraries and the creation of custom processing ‘pipelines’, going from the raw microscopy image to feature extraction and fluorescence quantification. MorphoGraphX is implemented as a collection of shared libraries, and new libraries can be added or removed without recompiling MorphoGraphX. This combines the functionality of plugins with the computational efficiency of C++. The most common operations for 3D visualization, filtering and editing have been written to exploit the massively parallel architecture of modern graphics cards, which can have thousands of processing cores. As a result, 3D operations that would normally be very slow to run on a common PC take seconds to perform, making use of the computational power of inexpensive consumer graphics cards. Many of the more complex operations use the multi-core capabilities of the CPU. This makes most operations interactive and user-friendly, allowing the researcher to easily experiment with new work flows, algorithms and parameters. The flexibility of MorphoGraphX also simplifies the development of modules to import 3D voxel data and cellular or surfaces meshes from other custom imaging platforms. Such bridges have been created to import data from recently published growth tracking softwares including the MARS-ALT multi angle reconstruction pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandez et al., 2010</xref>), and the stereo SEM reconstruction software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Routier-Kierzkowska and Kwiatkowska, 2008</xref>).</p><p>MorphoGraphX has been used to quantify cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aegerter-Wilmsen et al., 2012</xref>), growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kierzkowski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vlad et al., 2014</xref>), mechanical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kierzkowski et al., 2012</xref>) and protein localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakayama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kierzkowski et al., 2013</xref>), as well as 3D cell geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Rybel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshida et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to quantification, a current challenge in understanding development is to integrate these new data with computational models. Cellular geometry extracted from biological samples can be easily exchanged with modeling tools, such as Organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sampathkumar et al., 2014</xref>) and VVe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassel et al., 2014</xref>). Meshes extracted in MorphoGraphX can be used directly for realistic simulation templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassel et al., 2014</xref>), or simplified depending on modeling requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Santuari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wabnik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sampathkumar et al., 2014</xref>).

For GPU processing, MorphoGraphX uses CUDA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone">https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone</ext-link>) via the Thrust template library (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://thrust.github.io/">http://thrust.github.io</ext-link>). Multi-threaded host processing is done using OpenMP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://openmp.org/wp/">http://openmp.org/wp/</ext-link>). CUDA requires a compatible nVidia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nvidia.com/">http://www.nvidia.com</ext-link>) graphics card. The user interface is designed in Qt4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://qt-project.org/">http://qt-project.org/</ext-link>), and OpenGL is used for 3D rendering (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.opengl.org/">http://www.opengl.org</ext-link>).</p><p>MorphoGraphX can be extended using either C++ modules or Python scripts. C++ modules can be loaded at the start of MorphoGraphX through a plug-in system, inspired by the shared library loading architecture of Lpfg in VLab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Federl and Prusinkiewicz, 1999</xref>). C++ processes can access all the internal data structures used in MorphoGraphX and modify them as needed. They can also call other processes or query for their existence, and get parameter values in a uniform way from the graphical user interface. The last parameter values used for each process are stored in the project (.mgxv) file for future reference. All process calls and their parameters are logged to a re-playable python script log file created in the current directory. Each process is represented as a light C++ object defining the name, parameters and code of the process and is bundled in shared libraries for easy distribution. The shared library is placed into a system or user process folder, and the processes it contains are loaded upon startup.</p><p>Python scripts can also be written and executed within MorphoGraphX using the Python Script process. This option offers a more limited interaction with MorphoGraphX as a script is only able to launch other processes and not directly interact with the data structure. However, it allows use of the wealth of modules existing for Python 2.7 for file interactions and data analysis. Most data analysis processes import/export their data as CSV files to facilitate the writing of Python modules for complex or ad-hoc data analysis.</p><p>Surfaces are represented by vertex–vertex systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 2004</xref>), which implement graph rotation systems. Properties can be stored in the mesh, such as the label attributed to an individual vertex, the normal associated to it or a value for the projected signal. The rendering uses a modified front-to-back depth peeling technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Everitt, 2001</xref>) interweaving the volumetric rendering between peels of translucent surfaces. The volumetric rendering itself is done using volume ray casting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levoy, 1990</xref>), using the depth of the successive pair of peels to limit the ray casting to the region currently being rendered. This method allows for correct polygon–polygon and polygon-volume intersections. Combined with occlusion detection, we implemented early ray termination when the total opacity of the current fragment becomes too high for subsequent peels to be visible.</p><p>MorphoGraphX can be easily extended to import and export voxel and triangle mesh data in various formats. For voxel data, MorphoGraphX can read and write the tiff format compatible with ImageJ or Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). 3D data can also be loaded from series of 2D images using any of the various image formats supported by the C++ Template Image Processing Toolkit (CImg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tschumperlé, 2012</xref>). The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wills, 2012</xref>) is used to import and export VTK triangle meshes. Various other formats, such as the Stanford Polygon File format (.ply), Wavefront's Object format (.obj) or 3D Systems StereoLithography format (.stl), are also supported directly. For many of the mesh imports, polygons with be converted to triangles upon loading by generating a center point and making a triangle fan.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Feature extraction from volumetric data</title><p>The first step in processing the data stacks is to remove noise and then identify the which voxels belong inside of the organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). 3D image processing filters for noise reduction are followed by edge detection combined with feature filling. Once the inside of the organ is identified it is represented as a binary image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Next the surface is extracted using a variant of the marching cubes algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloomenthal, 1988</xref>). Fairly large cubes are used, creating a relatively coarse mesh and avoiding the extraction of very small features due to surface noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Once a coarse surface mesh is extracted, it is uniformly subdivided. The resolution of this initial mesh has to be sufficient for a first segmentation, which can be subsequently refined.</p><p>After the surface is extracted and subdivided, a column of signal normal to the surface is projected onto the mesh at every vertex, creating a 2D curved image of the cell outlines on the surface layer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). The image is segmented into cells using a seeded watershed segmentation algorithm. After blurring the image, auto-seeding is performed by finding local minima of signal within a given radius. Seeds are then propagated with watershed. Depending on the radius used for detecting the local minima, several seeds can be placed within a single cell, resulting in over-segmentation. The cells are later merged, based on the relative strength of signal on the walls separating them (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). Normalization of the signal with a radius greater than that of the largest cell typically improves merging results. For convenience, the processes are chained together in a single auto-segmentation process. The final segmentation is then manually corrected. The amount of manual correction required can vary depending on signal quality, and in some cases it can be more efficient to perform some or all of the seeding manually.</p><p>We have placed emphasis on designing the user interface for MorphoGraphX to streamline the process of manual seeding and segmentation correction (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2 media3">Videos 2, 3</xref>).</p><p>After the initial segmentation, the edges of the cells will often look rough, as there are not enough points to describe them correctly. To extract the geometry more precisely, the mesh can be subdivided specifically at the interfaces between cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) or in areas of high signal intensity. After subdivision the signal is re-projected, and the surface segmented again. The seeds are retained during this process so that re-seeding is not required. Several steps of subdivision and re-segmentation can be applied until the desired precision is achieved (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). The resulting mesh will be dense around the areas of interest (e.g., the interface between cells), while keeping the areas of low interest (the inside of cells) coarse, thus limiting the total size of the mesh file.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cell growth and geometry analysis</title><p>Once the cells have been segmented from two different time points, the cells and their progeny can be identified manually. Each mesh is loaded in a separate channel and roughly aligned manually so that the cells outlines match. For each cell in the second time point, the user identify a mother cell with a mouse click (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). The lineage information is then used to compare cell size (areal growth) or the projected signal intensity in the original cells and their daughters.</p><p>A segmented mesh contains information about the cells neighborhood, that is, which are the cell walls shared by two cells and where do the cell walls intersect. The mesh can be simplified to contain only vertices necessary to describe each cell contour and the connections between neighbor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Plant cells do not slide with respect to each other, therefore the junction between cell walls can be used as landmarks to track tissue deformation over time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Green et al., 1991</xref>). Combined with the cell lineage information, the simplified cellular mesh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) is used to find the correspondence between cell junctions in meshes extracted from different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). After identifying pairs of junctions conserved in both meshes using the lineage information, we project for each cell the junctions on the average cell plane and compute a best fit of the 2D transformation (translation, rotation, anisotropic scaling) that will minimize the squared distance between pairs of junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodall and Green, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Routier-Kierzkowska and Kwiatkowska, 2008</xref>). Decomposing the transformation into singular vectors and values gives the PDGs and associated scaling values (PDG<sub>max</sub>, PDG<sub>min</sub>), that describe anisotropic growth. Anisotropy values used in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2 fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 2, 3</xref>) were computed according to the following definition: anisotropy = PDG<sub>max</sub>/PDG<sub>min</sub>.</p><p>The cellular mesh can also be used to compute other quantities, such as the tissue curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). In that case the vertices belonging to the cell outline are used to compute the principal curvatures for each cell center, within a given periphery. Color maps resulting from the computation of growth, curvature, signal quantification, etc. can be written to a spreadsheet giving easy access for further processing. Similarly, cell axis vectors can also be exported to be either re-rendered in MorphoGraphX or loaded for further analysis using other software, such as Matlab or Python.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Volumetric (3D) segmentation</title><p>The ITK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoo et al., 2002</xref>) auto-seeded watershed segmentation algorithm implemented in MorphoGraphX was used to segment the cells in 3D in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5, 6D</xref>.

approval of the authors). An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “MorphoGraphX: A platform for quantifying morphogenesis in 4D” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, there was considerable enthusiasm for the MorphographX resource, but it was felt that its broad utility as a resource is dependent on making several additions, modifications and consolidations to the existing manuscript and accompanying software and documentation.</p><p>These additions include detailed technical specifications about how to use MorphoGraphX, its flexibility with other software packages, importing and exporting data analyses, and community-based resources to accommodate the heavy usage, additional resources/packages/libraries, and software updates that will undoubtedly ensue for what will very likely be a popular and useful resource.</p><p>Specific issues to address are enumerated below (1-3):</p><p>1) Production of a “user manual” with sufficient detail that a new user could install and use the software for the applications described in this manuscript. MorphographX should be described in sufficient detail to be used by developmental biologists without extensive computational backgrounds. The manual could be modeled upon the protocol currently published (and behind a pay-wall) in the recent paper in Plant Cell Morphogenesis Methods and Protocols (2014). All reviewers consider it essential that the “operating instructions” for something touted as open-source software also be made freely available.</p><p>1A) The integration into a complete experimental pipeline should be laid out. For example, the manuscript mentions the possibility to export data to other software for modeling or statistical analysis. However the workflow for such a transition is not described. How can data derived from MorphoGraphX be exported and processed with existing software (e.g. R, Excel, modeling software)? Buried in the Materials and Methods is the mention that “Most data analysis processes import/export their data as CSV files…”, but how to do this is never explained in the manuscript. What variables or statistics should the user expect to be exported, how much control does the user have in the types of data exported or how processed it is? Additionally, can this be done through the GUI, or will it be done through the terminal? Maybe an interesting way to demonstrate this is for some of the example data analyzed in this manuscript, provide .csv/.txt example outputs as supplemental information.</p><p>1B) On the other end of the pipeline, what kind of data structure is needed as input (are there “ideal” settings for z-steps, fluorescence intensities, time intervals).</p><p>2) Access to software, updates for software and the manual must be accessible in the same place. These could be hosted on the <italic>eLife</italic> site or on a third party site, but stable user access must be possible. Readers should know where to go to download the software, manual, and other resources. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.MorphoGraphX.org">www.MorphoGraphX.org</ext-link> needs to be mentioned more than once, more prominently in the <italic>eLife</italic> article; creating a box in the <italic>eLife</italic> manuscript with this information prominently highlighted would be one approach.</p><p>Currently, if one visits <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.MorphoGraphX.org">www.MorphoGraphX.org</ext-link>, there are references to publications, to a “protocol” paper, and notes from courses on MorphoGraphX, but no consolidated resource. Having a single resource/manual (rather than several scattered ones) is very important. Having a single resource directs users to one set of instructions, and offers a single starting place for beginners. Additionally, if manual versions are tied to software updates, then documentation is traceable, and over time dedicated users will be able to pinpoint changes quickly that have accumulated since the last version. It may be that the internal documentation for the software is extensive, but a separate document is important still.</p><p>The online resource with the actual software to download and manual will be critical. The current hosting at Max Planck is fine (likely to be stable), but have the authors considered someplace like GitHub or other widely used version control websites to keep their software and updates? This may make access more robust in the long term.</p><p>Related to documentation: do the authors anticipate that the community will write their own plug-ins, modules, libraries, and code for MorphoGraphX that will be shared? Will it become like ImageJ where the community contributes as much as the software platform? If so, maybe this should be built into <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MorphoGraphX.org">MorphoGraphX.org</ext-link> as well.</p><p>One way to consider providing documentation follows an example from Hadley Wickham's ggplot2. In addition to the “manual” which is cut and dry about the functions to use, there is a book and also an excellent self-published online resource. Many other R folks also publish on top of this all in the Journal of Statistical Software, or a “vignette”, to give examples of how to use packages (the <italic>eLife</italic> MorphoGraphX article is probably closest to a vignette).</p><p>R example of documentation, ggplot2:</p><p>The actual manual: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/ggplot2.pdf">http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/ggplot2.pdf</ext-link></p><p>The online resource: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/">http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/</ext-link></p><p>A book: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://books.google.com/books?id=bes-AAAAQBAJ%26printsec=frontcover%26dq=ggplot2:+Elegant+Graphics+for+Data+Analysis%26hl=en%26sa=X%26ei=9U6oVJnJKsy8yQTJtoGwAw%26ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage%26q=ggplot2%3A%20Elegant%20Graphics%20for%20Data%20Analysis%26f=false">https://books.google.com/books?id=bes-AAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ggplot2:+Elegant+Graphics+for+Data+Analysis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9U6oVJnJKsy8yQTJtoGwAw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ggplot2%3A%20Elegant%20Graphics%20for%20Data%20Analysis&amp;f=false</ext-link></p><p>3) There should be extensions/additions to the capabilities beyond what was published previously by the authors and others. Several of these applications have been hinted at in the text (for example semi-automated segmentation, extraction of 3D data from complex cell shapes (like lobed cells), tracking of subcellular elements). The detailed explanation of how to do one or two of these other analyses should be provided in the revised version.</p><p>Our suggestions for those one or two detailed applications are:</p><p>3A) Quantification of differential fluorescence levels within a cell (starting third paragraph of the subsection headed “Signal quantification” about PIN1-XFP fluorescence). Such a tool would likely be of general use. Some things to consider: Is it possible to obtain a percentage of membrane area that is occupied by PIN1-XFP compared to the whole cell? How does the software distinguish which of two neighboring cells expresses the signal? Can the software determine the overall orientation of the PIN1-XFP signal, as compared to the general tissue orientation (e.g. can it determine whether PIN1-XFP in root elongation zones always faces tipwards)?</p><p>3B) The opportunity for subcellular analysis was hinted at, but more details are needed. For example, quantification of microtubule orientation is an important feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), but it is not explained clearly here. How is this algorithm better than the published or commercially available ones (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamant et al. 2008</xref>)? Is it possible to get the standard deviation of the orientation (e.g. the anisotropy of MT orientation) mapped onto a tissue? How might this tool be used to determine microtubule growth/shrinkage rates? Is it adaptable to track particles like vesicles or Golgi stacks? Has the software been used with data that features things moving at high velocities (e.g. captured with spinning disc confocal microscopy)? Where are the limitations of the software in this regard?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05864.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Production of a “user manual” with sufficient detail that a new user could install and use the software for the applications described in this manuscript.

When writing processes (plug­ins), programmers are required to provide long descriptions for the process themselves as well as all parameters. These are available within MorphoGraphX as tooltips when the mouse hovers over a process or parameter. In addition, a manual is generated on­the­fly from this information, available from the “Help” menu. This ensures that it is never out of date, and provides a way for documentation to automatically accompany plug­ins that come from other sources. After a plug­in is installed in the plug­ins folder, its documentation will immediately appear in the reference manual.
