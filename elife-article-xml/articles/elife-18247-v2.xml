While some information is known about the afferent circuitry that endogenously drives this neural activity and behavior, the downstream receptors and anatomical projections that mediate these acute risk aversive behavioral states via the LC-NE system remain unresolved. Here we use a combination of retrograde tracing, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, electrophysiology, and in vivo optogenetics with localized pharmacology to identify neural substrates downstream of increased tonic LC-NE activity in mice. We demonstrate that photostimulation of LC-NE fibers in the BLA evokes norepinephrine release in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), alters BLA neuronal activity, conditions aversion, and increases anxiety-like behavior. Additionally, we report that β-adrenergic receptors mediate the anxiety-like phenotype of increased NE release in the BLA. These studies begin to illustrate how the complex efferent system of the LC-NE system selectively mediates behavior through distinct receptor and projection-selective mechanisms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18247.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18247.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

noradrenergic system (LC-NE) comprises a widespread projection network throughout the central nervous system capable of modulating a diverse range of behaviors including arousal, learning, pain modulation, and stress-induced negative affective states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berridge and Waterhouse, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sara, 2009</xref>). Understanding the neural circuit basis for how this nearly ubiquitous neuromodulatory network exerts influence on negative affect is a critical step towards therapeutically targeting stress-induced neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schwarz and Luo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reyes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arnsten et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kebschull et al., 2016</xref>). One particular efferent projection from the LC is to the basolateral amygdala (BLA). The BLA is an important candidate anatomical substrate for the widely known role of norepinephrine (NE) in affective behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berridge and Waterhouse, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Davis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Valentino and Aston-Jones, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Robertson et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Grissom and Bhatnagar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Siuda et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Plummer et al., 2015</xref>). The BLA is notable for integrating sensory information to encode and drive diverse and opposing affective behaviors including anxiety, fear, aversive, and reward behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Stuber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tye et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Namburi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beyeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wolff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bermudez and Schultz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bruchas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Knoll et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sugase-Miyamoto and Richmond, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Crowley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sears et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roozendaal et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Miranda et al., 2007</xref>). Notable efforts to uncover the role of the BLA and adrenergic signaling in consolidation of fear memories have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sears et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roozendaal et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">2006</xref>), as well as recent studies showing that acute stress activates BLA adrenergic receptors (agnostic to the source of NE) to promote anxiety and other stress-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Miranda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buffalari and Grace, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chang and Grace, 2013</xref>). Similarly acute stress paradigms cause selective activation of LC-NE neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCall et al., 2015</xref>). Together, there have been significant efforts to examine how source-independent noradrenergic (importantly, there are multiple sources of NE innervating the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Robertson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Plummer et al., 2015</xref>) signaling in the BLA can alter synaptic plasticity, fear encoding, and memory consolidation, yet few studies have directly examined how the neuromodulatory LC-NE system utilizes BLA output to alter acute risk averse behaviors, such as anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Grissom and Bhatnagar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buffalari and Grace, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2007</xref>).</p><p>Downstream and independent of this projection, recent studies have demonstrated that direct activation of both basolateral amygdala (BLA) cell bodies or their projections is both anxiogenic and socially aversive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Siuda et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tye et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Felix-Ortiz and Tye, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that increasing BLA excitatory output through Gαs G-protein activation, and more specifically, β-adrenergic receptor signaling causes acute social anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Siuda et al., 2016</xref>). Separately, noradrenergic cell firing in the LC has been shown to increase in the context of stressful stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abercrombie and Jacobs, 1987a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">1987b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aston-Jones et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mana and Grace, 1997</xref>). While the anatomical projections from the LC and their cell types have been studied for several years, the precise mechanisms by which fibers from the LC can directly influence BLA function to promote negative affective behaviors are not understood. Specifically, how LC-BLA projections generate affective behavioral responses through specific receptor systems and modulation of cell activity is unknown.</p><p>To determine the role of locus coeruleus noradrenergic influence on BLA function and negative affective behavior we optogenetically manipulated LC-NE inputs into the BLA, directly testing whether NE is released from LC terminals into the BLA and whether this terminal stimulation can drive anxiety-like and aversive behavioral responses. We demonstrate that photostimulation of LC projections to the basolateral amygdala releases NE and that this photostimulation evokes downstream modulation of neuronal activity in BLA neurons that project to anxiogenic brain regions. Stimulation of these fibers is sufficient to produce conditioned aversion and the stimulation-induced increased noradrenergic tone is sufficient to produce anxiety-like behavior mediated by local β-adrenergic receptor activity (β-ARs) in the BLA. Taken together, we report a previously undefined role for LC-BLA projections in mediating negative affective behavior through activation of β-ARs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genetic and anatomical isolation of BLA-projection LC-NE neurons</title><p>Our previous work demonstrated that increased tonic LC-NE activity induces anxiety-like and aversive behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Siuda et al., 2015a</xref>), we next sought to test whether these same behaviors can be generated by stimulating LC-NE fibers at localized projections in the BLA. To examine the potential sources of NE from the LC to the BLA we identified and isolated the projection using two distinct retrograde tracing approaches. First, we injected the tracer Fluorogold into the BLA of wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, this non-selective retrograde tracing approach revealed known inputs into the BLA from the LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Robertson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Asan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fallon et al., 1978</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We next used a dual injection strategy to anatomically isolate BLA-projecting LC-NE<sup>+</sup> neurons. To do so, we used mice expressing Cre under the promoter for tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for catecholamine synthesis (<italic>Th</italic><sup>IRES-Cre</sup> mice)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Savitt et al., 2005</xref>). Here, we injected a red retrobead tracer into the BLA and the green-labeled adeno-associated virus, AAV5-DIO-Ef1α-ChR2(H134)-eYFP, into the LC (<italic>Th</italic><sup>IRES-Cre</sup>::LC-BLA:ChR2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). In these animals, we identified BLA-projecting <italic>Th</italic><sup>+</sup> LC neurons with the presence of both fluorophores in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Next, to examine <italic>Th</italic><sup>+</sup> terminal innervation of the BLA, we injected the cell-filling, Cre-dependent reporter AAV5-DIO-Ef1α-eYFP in the LC of <italic>Th</italic><sup>IRES-Cre</sup> mice (<italic>Th</italic><sup>IRES-Cre</sup>::LC-BLA:eYFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Here we clearly observed labeled LC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>) and their projection fibers terminating in the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). To further corroborate these findings, we examined recent projection experiments performed by the Allen Brain Institute Mouse Connectivity (ABIMC) project that also genetically and anatomically isolate this projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Oh et al., 2014</xref>).

To do so, we examined the baseline firing rate, waveforms, and bursting properties of recorded units. Neurons that increase firing in response to LC-BA terminal stimulation have a significantly lower mean basal firing rate (2.194 ± 2.22 SD) than those that decrease firing (13.06 ± 11.82 SD), however neither group is distinguishable from non-responsive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). To quantifiably assess the waveform shapes of the recorded neurons, we calculated the average waveform for each neuron and performed a linear correlation on these values within each group of neurons. These analyses demonstrate that all neurons that increase firing to LC-BLA photostimulation have an r value greater than 0.835 and all neurons that decrease have an r value above 0.820, while the population of neurons that did not significantly respond to photostimulation have an r above 0.515. These results indicate that neurons that do not respond to photostimulation are less internally similar, while the excited and inhibited cells are more similar within groups, suggesting that these modulated neurons are more likely to each be part of single class of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). Finally, we examined the bursting properties of the recorded neurons. While most neurons exhibited some bursting properties, no differences were found between groups in terms of frequency of bursting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>), mean firing rate during bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>), or the percentage of spikes from the recording sessions that occurred within a burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref>). Together, these heterogeneous firing properties are consistent with previous studies using iontophoresis of NE into the BLA, and further highlight the complex pharmacological and circuit activity that NE modulates within the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buffalari and Grace, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ferry et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huang et al., 1996</xref>).

Taken together, these data suggest that photostimulation of LC-BLA projections releases NE into the BLA and this same photostimulation alters BLA firing. This altered firing appears to preferentially increase activity in BLA neurons that project to area known to modulate negative affect such as the CeA and vHPC. In behaving animals, this stimulation of LC terminals in the BLA facilitates a conditioned aversion and acute anxiety-like behaviors. Importantly, the experiments here cannot determine whether the observed changes in BLA unit activity and the conditioned place aversion are mediated directly by NE release from LC terminals. Instead, these affects could be generated through antidromic stimulation of LC cell bodies (and their diverging efferent projections) or through plastic changes resulting from the repeated and long-term stimulation protocols used during the two 30 min conditioning sessions. However, using local, site-specific pharmacological blockade, we identified that β-ARs within the BLA are necessary for the anxiety-like component of this behavior. These data provide a critical framework for understanding the downstream influence of the LC-NE system in the BLA as it relates to anxiety-like behavioral states.</p><p>The BLA is a crucial component in the neural circuitry of negative affective behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Davis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Davidson, 2002</xref>).

NE is increased in the BLA following stressful events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Galvez et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hatfield et al., 1999</xref>). The BLA receives noradrenergic input from the LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Asan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fallon et al., 1978</xref>) as well the <italic>Hoxb1</italic><sup>+</sup> neuronal populations in the lower brainstem and NTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Robertson et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the LC input being less dense than other NE input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Plummer et al., 2015</xref>), here we directly show that molecularly-defined <italic>Th</italic><sup>+</sup> positive fibers from the LC release catecholamines into the amygdala and alter behavior. Previous studies have demonstrated that noradrenergic tonic cell firing in the LC increases following stressful stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abercrombie and Jacobs, 1987a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">1987b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aston-Jones et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mana and Grace, 1997</xref>). We now demonstrate that selective activation of <italic>Th+</italic> LC terminals from these neurons modulates BLA neuronal activity in vivo. Despite a diversity of recorded responses, these findings align with prior studies suggesting neurons that increase firing to LC-BLA photostimulation have a higher probability of being BLA projection neurons, while those that decrease have a higher probability of being BLA interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Likhtik et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, it seems that it is reasonable that LC-BLA modulation might be selectively increasing activity of BLA projection neurons, though further studies using phototagging or imaging BLA neurons is required. Though it is well established that activation of β-ARs increases BLA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buffalari and Grace, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pu et al., 2009</xref>), we cannot conclude that this is the only mechanism by which LC-BLA fibers modulate BLA activity. Indeed, it is likely that the diversity of neuronal responses we observed are mediated through different receptors systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buffalari and Grace, 2007</xref>) and/or local or distal polysynaptic recurrent circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wolff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rosenkranz and Grace, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">1999</xref>). Furthermore, while we do not know the genetic identity or projection targets of the BLA neurons from which we recorded, it is possible that NE serves to preferentially shift BLA activity in neurons that favor anxiety-like behavior (i.e. those that project to the ventral hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, or central amygdala) rather those that favor positive affect and anxiolysis (i.e. projections to the nucleus accumbens and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Stuber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tye et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Namburi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beyeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Felix-Ortiz and Tye, 2014</xref>). We attempted to begin to address this question using a retrograde labeling strategy combined with immunohistochemistry for cFos. Our results suggest that there is selective modulation of BLA projections neurons. The combined retrograde labeling and photostimulation studies indicate that, cFos, a secondary marker for neuronal excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Madabhushi et al., 2015</xref>), is selectively increased in the CeA- and vHPC-projecting BLA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, our recent reports demonstrate that increasing the activity of CaMKII+ BLA neurons via chemogenetic or optogenetic activation of Gαs-signaling also produces an anxiogenic-like state, suggesting that excitatory cells possibly mediate the LC-BLA noradrenergic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Siuda et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">2016</xref>). However, further work will be necessary to understand the cell-type and projection-specific relationship between LC-NE modulation of BLA activity and its ability to drive negative affective behavior through downstream circuits and receptor systems.</p><p>Additionally, we show that photostimulation at the site of LC terminals in the BLA conditions aversive behavior. However, it remains to be seen whether this conditioned aversive behavior is mediated locally in the BLA by NE. This effect may could be due to factors outside of the BLA and distinct from NE release such as antidromic activity at the LC cell bodies or from prolonged changes to LC circuit activity elsewhere that result from long-term, repeated optogenetic stimulation. However, a similar photostimulation paradigm increases anxiety-like behavior that is blocked by local antagonism of β-ARs in the BLA. It is well established that prolonged NE release in the BLA modulates memory storage through β-AR-mediated cAMP production and this effect, in turn, is regulated by α<sub>1</sub>-AR and α<sub>2</sub>-AR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Galvez et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hatfield et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liang et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ferry and McGaugh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ferry et al., 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">1999b</xref>). In particular, many groups have shown noradrenergic influence in fear-related memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sears et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roozendaal et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Debiec and Ledoux, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Garrido Zinn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Skelly et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings support these prior works while offering new insight into how this circuitry might acutely modulate negative affect. The observation that the LC-BLA circuitry carries an intrinsically negative valence suggests that this circuit can natively promote negative affect, rather than merely enhancing memory. However, it is possible that without explicit memory cues, our photostimulation paradigm conditions an aversion via recruitment of many other neurotransmitter systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brioni et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Marsicano et al., 2002</xref>). This might not be the case in the presence of a positive cue or reward where the LC-BLA projection may still simply enhance the memory. Further studies will be necessary to fully evaluate the implications of the apparent negative affect promoted by exogenous stimulation of this circuit. While there is some concern that photostimulation of <italic>Th</italic><sup>IRES-Cre</sup>::LC-BLA:ChR2 fibers could cause backpropagating action potentials to LC-NE cell bodies resulting in NE release elsewhere in the brain for the conditioned place aversion, the observation that the anxiety-like phenotype can be blocked with local β-AR antagonism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) suggests there is some degree of circuit isolation in our study. Additionally, the observation that this stimulation does not replicate all of the behavioral phenotypes of cell body activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCall et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; i.e. no RTPA) further supports this interpretation. However, we cannot definitively conclude that the observed CPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>) is mediated through the same postsynaptic mechanism (i.e. β-AR activation) in the BLA as the anxiety-like phenotype. To this point, we recently demonstrated that Gαs signaling (the same signaling mechanism that β-AR activates) in CaMKIIα+ BLA neurons is sufficient for anxiogenesis, without driving either a real-time or conditioned place aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Siuda et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">2016</xref>). Additionally, throughout these experiments we have not directly addressed any potential confounds that arise from long-term expression of exogenous opsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Miyashita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ferenczi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Warden et al., 2012</xref>). Instead, our behavioral controls (eYFP-expression with photostimulation) are aimed at controlling spurious effects of exogenous protein expression, heating, and light delivery to the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>). Together with our work at LC-NE cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCall et al., 2015</xref>), these studies and the current findings suggest that LC neurons with fibers in the BLA are capable of conditioning aversion, though possibly through other brain regions and possibly independent of β-AR activation.</p><p>The lack of a real-time place aversion is a particularly interesting observation. We previously demonstrated the real-time place aversion elicited by LC-NE cell body activation to be dependent on α<sub>1</sub>-AR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCall et al., 2015</xref>). Together these results suggest that both the anatomical substrate and receptor system responsible for this behavior is distinct from the efferent LC-NE processes responsible for noradrenergic mediated anxiety-like behavior. Furthermore, there are important distinctions between the RTPA and the CPA assays. RTPA is essentially an instrumental conditioning paradigm that relies on operant learning of the subject as it engages the environment, while CPA is a passive, classical conditioning paradigm that possibly recruit distinct brain circuitry during the learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Day and Carelli, 2007</xref>). Another consideration is the longer time course of NE transmission and receptor activation compared to fast-acting, small molecule neurotransmitters, such as γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Otis and Mody, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Isaacson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zoli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Szapiro and Barbour, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agnati et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Palij and Stamford, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Courtney and Ford, 2014</xref>).

With activation of adrenergic receptors, these effects may have slower time dynamics than what is necessary for the place-dependent operant conditioning scheme – despite what we observed through cell body activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCall et al., 2015</xref>). It is well known, for example, that β-AR signaling through cAMP-gated calcium channels that will likely increase firing acutely, but that they also signal through Arrestin-mediated transduction. The latter can lead to long-term changes in gene and protein expression in addition to changes synaptic plasticity and neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Siuda et al., 2015a</xref>). All of these molecular considerations may also play a key role in the behavior we observed. While numerous potential circuit-based targets exist, it seems possible that NE projections to the mesolimbic dopamine system have the potential to mediate instrumental learning including real-time aversive behaviors. The LC sends functional projections to the dopaminergic system and numerous groups have demonstrated bidirectional control of real-time place preference and aversion behaviors within this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Siuda et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lammel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Stamatakis and Stuber, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">van Zessen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Isingrini et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our results here and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Siuda et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">2016</xref>) demonstrate that LC-NE downstream influence on negative affective behaviors is an elaborate and complex system likely involving many different postsynaptic receptor systems and anatomical projection targets. Importantly, the LC projection to the BLA is a clear functional efferent target for LC-mediated anxiety-like behavior. These findings have broad implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of anxiety and other negative affective disorders and suggest that further study of these noradrenergic circuits and signaling pathways should greatly advance our current understanding of related psychopathologies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult (25–35 g) male C57BL/6J (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link>) and <italic>Th</italic><sup>IRES-Cre</sup> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_EM:00254">IMSR_EM:00254</ext-link>) backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice were group-housed, given access to food and water ad libitum and maintained on a 12 hr:12 hr light:dark cycle.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Kay M Tye (Reviewer #2).</p><p>As you see from the reviews below, all reviewers are enthusiastic about the topic and findings, and each has raised a number of recommendations for revision. After discussion among all three reviewers, we would like to invite you to submit a revised manuscript that can satisfactorily address the following:</p><p>1) We feel that the in vivo recording data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> need to be significantly strengthened. Specifically, &quot;n&quot; should be increased to have more examples of up- or down-modulated BLA neurons. It will be ideal if in these experiments you can learn more about the recorded cells' other properties, such as their response to natural stimuli and modulations by propranolol, but we do not hold these as essential for the acceptance for a revised manuscript.</p><p>2) We would also request that you perform the propranolol experiment in the aversion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which will strengthen your claim that the effect on aversion is mediated by LC-NE neuron projection to BLA rather than via antidromic stimulation elsewhere. If this additional data cannot be obtained, you should significantly tone down the claim that aversion is related to LC-NE modulation of BLA, including in the title.</p><p>3) We believe that most of the other critiques can be addressed by further analyses of existing data, and by textual revisions. You should try to address these as thoroughly as possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>McCall et al. characterized the action of locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) neurons at one of their numerous target sites: the basolateral amygdala (BLA), in the context of anxiety and aversion. They confirmed previous findings that LC-NE neurons project and arborize axons at BLA, showed that photoactivation of ChR2-expressing LC-NE neurons resulted in NE release at BLA as measured by fast scan cyclic voltammetry, characterized firing pattern changes of BLA neurons in response to photostimulation of LC-NE neurons using in vivo recording, found that terminal stimulation of LC-NE fibers at BLA caused conditioned (but not real time) place aversion and enhanced anxiety-like behaviors, and showed that the anxiety-like behaviors can be suppressed by application of propranolol, an antagonist of β-adrenergic receptor.</p><p>Overall this is a nice and timely set of experiments addressing an important question: how do LC-NE neurons affect the physiology and function of a specific target area, in this case BLA that is well known for its function in regulating emotion and anxiety. Some of the experiments and analyses could go further.</p><p>1) The in vivo recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) of BLA neurons in response to photostimulation of LC-NE neurons is perhaps the least satisfactory experiment. I will start with a few questions about the description. There were 20 cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, but only 18 were further analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> (and onwards?). What were the selection criteria? How was &quot;latency&quot; measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>) for cells that had no change in firing rate? Do <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L and 3M</xref> contain new cells (legend for 3M says n=10), or a subset of cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>? Again, how are these cells selected?</p><p>Given the clear heterogeneity of response, it will be more satisfying if the authors have some more knowledge about these cells-for example are there any signatures that distinguish three types of neurons in the PCA analysis? Do they respond differently to natural stimuli? Do they respond differently to propranolol, which will provide a nice link to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>? Increasing N is desirable as the examples are only 4 and 2 for neurons whose firing rate is up- or down-modulated by LC-NE neuron photostimulation.</p><p>2) Given the broad projection patterns of LC-NE neurons, the behavioral effect of LC-NE photostimulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> could in principle be due to antidromic effects in other target areas. The propranolol effect caused by local application in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> supports a BLA local action. The propranolol experiment should be extended to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Overall, I was delighted to read this interesting and important manuscript. I have relatively minor comments.</p><p>I found it intriguing that the authors observed such heterogeneous responses to LC-BLA photostimulation and wonder if the differences in responses of BLA neurons to NE is related to either a) their projection target, b) cell type (projection or interneuron) or c) their role during anxiety-related behaviors. This is beyond the scope of the current manuscript and I do not expect the authors to respond to this query with further experiments, but if the authors have any other data regarding basal spike rate, waveform, peak firing rates, burst patterns or activity during anxiety behaviors it would be nice to see. The authors must have the firing profile data already, and just need to analyze and display this.</p><p>The Authors state that &quot;Downstream and independent of this projection, recent studies have demonstrated that direct activation of both basolateral amygdala (BLA) cell bodies or their projections is both anxiogenic and socially aversive&quot; and should consider adding the following papers to the references already listed: Felix-Ortiz, Neuron, 2013; Felix-Ortiz, J Neurosci, 2014; Felix-Ortiz, Neuroscience, 2015. These citations should also be added to the references following the sentence &quot;Furthermore, while we do not know the genetic identity or projection targets of the BLA neurons from which we recorded, it is possible that NE serves to preferentially shift BLA activity in neurons that favor anxiety-like behavior (i.e. those that project to the ventral hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, or central amygdala) rather those that favor positive affect and anxiolysis (i.e. projections to the nucleus accumbens and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis)&quot;.</p><p>The finding that LC-BLA inputs drive conditioned place aversion potentially place previous studies concluding that NE in the BLA contributes to fear memory formation/storage. The authors should discuss this body of research and clearly address how their data may challenge this existing notion. Specifically, the finding that this circuit is intrinsically of negative valence may actually provide an alternative explanation for a number of results previously thought to support a role in memory formation (associated with fear). The authors discuss these results as being consistent, though, it's not clear to me that this is the case.</p><p>It was curious that they were not able to produce real-time place aversion but were able to observe conditioned place aversion. The authors interpret this as an issue of the involvement of long-term memory. An alternative interpretation would be that this effect is specific to Pavlovian and not instrumental conditioning. Real-time place aversion is explicitly different in that the animal must enter the paired side of the chamber to receive photostimulation. Thus, a number of other issues may also be involved. First, this is essentially an instrumental conditioning task, as the photostimulation is contingent on animal behavior. Second, this may be related to the lingering effects of NE (as the authors hint at, but don't directly discuss).</p><p>The appropriate control for the propranolol experiment would be a saline/vehicle injection (both in combination with ChR2 stimulation), as well as a light-off condition wherein ChR2 is still expressed. ChR2 expression can (with long-term expression) change basal behavior even in the absence of light (see Warden et al., Nature, 2012). It seems as if they may have done this based on the supplementary figure, but the main text was confusing. Please clarify.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, what is above the ventricle? There is some retrograde labeling from the BLA that is TH-. Also, it is hard to see if this exists in D, but it seems to. Finally, some quantification of the TH overlap with cre-dependent fluorophore expression should be included. Fibers in BLA are scarcely visible in 1L, I am surprised this level of expression was sufficient to evoke behavioral responses – was this image representative?</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, the firing rate appears to be dropping prior to photostimulation – which makes it unclear whether the effect we are observing is actually related to the optogenetic manipulation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Major conclusions of paper:</p><p>McCall et al. combine in vivo optogenetics, physiology, pharmacology, and behavior, as well as FSCV, to characterize a specific sub-circuit of the extensive LC-NE system. Their experiments identify novel examples of heterogeneity within the LC→ BLA circuit, substantially build on existing work in the field, and have important implications for understanding how NE modulates anxiety/aversion. While interesting, I felt that some of their conclusions regarding specificity within this circuit were not experimentally demonstrated as strong as they could be, but hopefully, this can be addressed during revision. I also had some technical questions regarding experiments for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>Main concerns:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>:</p><p>1) Sample size seems low for statistical analysis (4 cells in increased firing group, 2 cells in decreased group).</p><p>2) I was confused by 3C. Is each dot a cell? How do they correspond to the pie chart in 3D?</p><p>3) It says in the Materials and methods that injections were unilateral, but according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> legend, data collection was from &quot;4 hemispheres from 2 animals&quot;. Almost all LC projections to forebrain are ipsilateral (though I'm not sure about projections to BLA), so it doesn't seem possible that both hemispheres could be used for these experiments if only one LC was injected.</p><p>4) I'm unsure if the statistical comparisons are appropriate; i.e. – pre-sorting of the &quot;increased&quot; and &quot;decreased&quot; cells based on average firing.</p><p>5) It would be nice to expand on the identity of the NE-responding BLA neurons. What if adrenergic inhibitors are applied to the BLA during their optrode recordings? How does this affect the heterogeneous NE-mediated activity they observed? Alternatively, could CRACM-style experiments be performed in slice, where recordings are performed in BLA neurons when ChR2-expressing LC fibers are stimulated? This could provide higher resolution for the relative size of these different NE-responding populations, as well as their identity (via post-recording cell fill and immunolabeling?)</p><p>Regarding optogenetic stimulation of fibers/related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: The authors find that stim. of BLA→ LC fibers produces negative association over time, which isn't present in real-time place aversion. But is it known if avoidance association is specific to the BLA→LC projection? It also seems possible that chronic activation of LC terminals could cause a change in LC cell body activity, and thus broadly affect the LC-NE circuit. This is mentioned in the Discussion, but maybe it's possible to experimentally address this concern. For instance, does local infusion of an adrenergic receptor antagonist into the BLA during or after conditioning block the avoidance (similar to the experiment done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18247.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>As you see from the reviews below, all reviewers are enthusiastic about the topic and findings, and each has raised a number of recommendations for revision.

Due to the above cited consideration on mouse number we were unable to perform all of the suggested experiments, however we were able to more than double the n of the original submission and perform the requested expanded analyses on this larger data set. Notably, this doubling preserved the ratio of up- and down-modulated cells almost exactly as the smaller n. We also examined more properties of the existing and newly acquired cells, including sorting them by baseline firing rate, determining the similarity of the waveforms within each group, and quantifying their bursting properties. In the case of sorting the neurons by baseline firing, we can now observe that up-modulated cells have a lower baseline firing rate than down-modulated cells. This finding suggests that it may be more likely that these up-modulated cells are BLA projection neurons, rather than interneurons (Likhtik et al., Journal of Neurophysiology, 2006).

We have taken two approaches to addressing these concerns. First, we added a new experiment and figure to the manuscript attempting to address, as a first pass, whether BLA neurons that increase in activity following LC-BLA photostimulation are segregated by projection target. To do so, we retrogradely labeled BLA neurons with a fluorophore-tagged Cholera Toxin B in either the ventral hippocampus, central amygdala, or nucleus accumbens, stimulated LC-BLA fibers, and observed co-localization between the CTB label and the presence of cfos, a secondary marker for neuronal activation. These studies indicate a bias towards activation of BLA neurons that project to ventral hippocampus and central amygdala, rather than the nucleus accumbens. While these experiments suggest that LC-BLA biases activation towards these projection targets that are known to promote anxiety-like behavior, much more work will be necessary in subsequent studies to clearly elucidate the intricacies of these tri-synaptic circuits. In addition to these new experiments, we have also added more recordings (as discussed elsewhere) and replotted our findings based on the baseline firing profile of these neurons, their average waveform, and we have quantified their bursting properties by group as well. As stated previously, the sorting the neurons by baseline firing demonstrates that cells that increase in response to the photostimulation have a lower baseline firing rate than down-modulated cells. This finding suggests that it may be more likely that these up-modulated cells are BLA projection neurons, rather than interneurons (Likhtik et al., Journal of Neurophysiology, 2006). However, this is only a likelihood and further experiments would be necessary to fully draw this conclusion.

The authors discuss these results as being consistent, though, it's not clear to me that this is the case.</italic> </p><p>This interpretation is an important consideration we did not highlight it clearly enough in our original submission. We have altered the text to provide more detail on the existing body of research as well as elaborating on our intended interpretation. The new text reads: “It is well established that prolonged NE release in the BLA modulates memory storage through β-AR-mediated cAMP production and this effect, in turn, is regulated by α<sub>1</sub>-AR and α<sub>2</sub>-AR activity (Debiec and Ledoux, 2004; Galves, Mesches and McGaugh, 1996; Madabhushi et al., 2015; Liang, McGaugh and Yao, 1990; Ferry and McGaugh, 2008; Ferry, Roozendaal and McGaugh, 1999). […] Further studies will be necessary to fully evaluate the implications of the apparent negative affect promoted by exogenous stimulation of this circuit.”</p><p><italic>It was curious that they were not able to produce real-time place aversion but were able to observe conditioned place aversion. The authors interpret this as an issue of the involvement of long-term memory. An alternative interpretation would be that this effect is specific to Pavlovian and not instrumental conditioning. Real-time place aversion is explicitly different in that the animal must enter the paired side of the chamber to receive photostimulation. Thus, a number of other issues may also be involved. First, this is essentially an instrumental conditioning task, as the photostimulation is contingent on animal behavior. Second, this may be related to the lingering effects of NE (as the authors hint at, but don't directly discuss).</italic> </p><p>These are importantalternative considerations and we have integrated them into the Discussion as such: “Furthermore, there are important distinctions between the RTPA and the CPA assays. […] All of these molecular considerations may also play a key role in the behavior we observed.”</p><p><italic>The appropriate control for the propranolol experiment would be a saline/vehicle injection (both in combination with ChR2 stimulation), as well as a light-off condition wherein ChR2 is still expressed. ChR2 expression can (with long-term expression) change basal behavior even in the absence of light (see Warden et al., Nature, 2012). It seems as if they may have done this based on the supplementary figure, but the main text was confusing. Please clarify.</italic> </p><p>We apologize that this was not clearer in the initial submission. The EZM experiment had four groups eYFP+Vehicle, ChR2+Vehicle, eYFP+Propranolol, and ChR2+ Propranolol. This approach allows comparisons to detect a change evoked from photostimulation (eYFP+Vehicle vs. ChR2+Vehicle) as well as an effect from the pharmacological treatment (ChR2+Vehicle vs. ChR2+ Propranolol) while controlling for any effects of the antagonist independent of photostimulation (eYFP+Propranolol vs. ChR2+ Propranolol). We have revised the Results section to more clearly state these details, it now reads: “To do so we implanted a combined fiber-optic fluid cannula into the BLA and delivered either an artificial cerebrospinal fluid vehicle or the non-selective β-AR antagonist, Propranolol (1 µg)(Sears et al., 2013; Roozendaal et al., 2006; Buffalari and Grace, 2009; Buffalari and Grace, 2007), prior to photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). […] Importantly, when we locally antagonized β-ARs directly in the BLA prior to photostimulation, anxiogenesis was completely blocked in ChR2<sup>+</sup> animals with no effect on eYFP-expressing, propranolol controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).”</p><p>Furthermore, we do agree that controls for the long-term expression of ChR2 are important, however we were unfortunately unable to incorporate these experiments into this submission due to limited animal numbers. We have addressed this limitation now in the Discussion, stating: “Additionally, throughout these experiments we have not directly addressed any potential confounds that arise from long-term expression of exogenous opsins (Galves, Mesches and McGaugh, 1996; Hatfield, Spanis and McGaugh, 1999; Likhtik et al., 2006). Instead, our behavioral controls (eYFP-expression with photostimulation) are aimed at controlling spurious effects of exogenous protein expression, heating, and light delivery to the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">68</xref>).”</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, what is above the ventricle? There is some retrograde labeling from the BLA that is TH-. Also, it is hard to see if this exists in D, but it seems to.</italic> </p><p>It seems as though the initial image/labeling on the image caused confusion. There is nothing above the ventricle (labeled 4V on image). However, there is retrograde labeling to TH- cells that are dorsal and ventral to the LC itself (top right of the image in 1B). These cells are likely part of the medial parabrachial nucleus which have previously identified projections to the BLA (Saper &amp; Loewy, Brain Research, 1980). We have made a note regarding this labeling in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend.</p><p><italic>Finally, some quantification of the TH overlap with cre-dependent fluorophore expression should be included.</italic> </p><p>We agree that using any Cre-driver line for cell-type selective modulation should be well documented for its selectivity. For this concern, we point the reviewer to our previous manuscript where we indeed included a detailed description of this overlap for noradrenergic, DBH<sup>+</sup> cells. In particular, the data presented in Figures S2C, 5E &amp; S5A of McCall et al., Neuron, 2015 directly addresses this question by comparing viral expression to dopamine β hydroxylase (DBH) staining with essentially 100% of Cre-dependent viral expression overlapping with DBH<sup>+</sup> cells. We therefore felt it was redundant to do this again.</p><p><italic>Fibers in BLA are scarcely visible in 1L, I am surprised this level of expression was sufficient to evoke behavioral responses – was this image representative?</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this attention to detail by the reviewer. The images used throughout the manuscript were selected to be representative of what is typically seen. We have included the data from the Allen Institute (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) to support these observations as well. We see similar expression in the BLA as has been observed elsewhere (e.g. Plummer et al., Development, 2015). We agree that it is remarkable that such diffuse innervation has meaningful behavioral effects, but believe this to be a characteristic feature of the noradrenergic system through its known volume transmission properties (e.g. Courtney &amp; Ford, Journal of Neuroscience, 2014). A further important consideration for neuromodulation, acting via metabotropic receptors is that density of inputs, fluorescence, or fiber labeling do not necessarily predict how well coupling amplification can happen after a GPCR is activated. For example, in many cases a receptor pool of say 100 receptors, only needs to be occupied by 10% by norepinephrine to have a maximal possible effect on a neuronal response. This concept, termed ‘spare receptors’ is because of large amplification that happens after the G-protein coupling event, cAMP generation, and channel modulations. So, while we appreciate this is a visually weak input, there are numerous other examples in both the central and peripheral nervous system where modulatory inputs (including by NE) by visualization alone look weak, yet these fibers carry and amplify robust messages that dramatically effect behavior and circuits. This is also as an aside, why interpreting viral tracing density visually as a measure of function can be a confound in some cases.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, the firing rate appears to be dropping prior to photostimulation – which makes it unclear whether the effect we are observing is actually related to the optogenetic manipulation.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this observation by the reviewer, with additional recordings we no longer see this ‘anticipatory’ decrease in firing. We do note, however, that while the photostimulation-induced increase in firing returns to baseline quickly following the end of the photostimulation, the suppression of firing appears to be maintained long after stimulation ends.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>Major conclusions of paper:</italic> </p><p><italic>McCall et al. combine in vivo optogenetics, physiology, pharmacology, and behavior, as well as FSCV, to characterize a specific sub-circuit of the extensive LC-NE system. Their experiments identify novel examples of heterogeneity within the LC→ BLA circuit, substantially build on existing work in the field, and have important implications for understanding how NE modulates anxiety/aversion. While interesting, I felt that some of their conclusions regarding specificity within this circuit were not experimentally demonstrated as strong as they could be, but hopefully, this can be addressed during revision. I also had some technical questions regarding experiments for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this positive assessment of our work and hope that you will find this revised manuscript a stronger contribution to the field.</p><p><italic>Main concerns:</italic> </p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Sample size seems low for statistical analysis (4 cells in increased firing group, 2 cells in decreased group).</italic> </p><p>We appreciate concerns that the initial data set was too limited. We were able to now more than double the n of the original submission and perform the requested expanded analyses on this data. Notably, this doubling preserved the ratio of increasing and decreasing cells almost exactly as the smaller n.</p><p><italic>2) I was confused by 3C. Is each dot a cell? How do they correspond to the pie chart in 3D?</italic></p><p>We apologize for any confusion as originally presented. We have altered the figure to connect the dots from pre- and during stimulation in 3C. For clarity, we have also segregated the cells into increasing, decreasing, and static and have presented these in separate graphs in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. We hope this expanded view is clearer.</p><p><italic>3) It says in the Materials and methods that injections were unilateral, but according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> legend, data collection was from &quot;4 hemispheres from 2 animals&quot;. Almost all LC projections to forebrain are ipsilateral (though I'm not sure about projections to BLA), so it doesn't seem possible that both hemispheres could be used for these experiments if only one LC was injected.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this attention to detail and apologize for the minor error in reporting. All animals were injected unilaterally except for the two used for single unit electrophysiology the initial submission. The new animals recorded and reported in this submission were all injected unilaterally and recorded from the ipsilateral BLA. We have noted these two exceptions in the Materials and methods, stating: “For locus coeruleus terminal studies, 500-1000 nl of AAV5-DIO-ChR2 or AAV5-DIO-eYFP was injected unilaterally (with the exception of two animals for the single-unit electrophysiology experiments that were bilateral) into the locus coeruleus at stereotaxic coordinates from bregma: -5.45 mm anterior-posterior (AP), ± 1.25 mm medial-lateral (ML), -3.65 mm dorsal-ventral (DV).”</p><p><italic>4) I'm unsure if the statistical comparisons are appropriate; i.e. – pre-sorting of the &quot;increased&quot; and &quot;decreased&quot; cells based on average firing.</italic> </p><p>We agree that statistical comparisons based on pre-sorted groups are inappropriate. Based on editorial comments from a presubmission inquiry, we removed any direct statistical comparison based on the firing rate of neurons (the feature used to classify the cells). Instead we employed the z-score method that we (Jennings et al., Nature, 2013) and others (e.g. Wolff et al., Nature, 2014) have used previously to identify gross changes in neuronal activity. The inclusion of statistics for the basal frequency measure is still appropriate as this feature was not part the classification scheme and the descriptive statistics for latencies remain for informative purposes. All other statistics in this figure and its supplement are done on the whole sample without any pre-classification.</p><p><italic>5) It would be nice to expand on the identity of the NE-responding BLA neurons. What if adrenergic inhibitors are applied to the BLA during their optrode recordings? How does this affect the heterogeneous NE-mediated activity they observed? Alternatively, could CRACM-style experiments be performed in slice, where recordings are performed in BLA neurons when ChR2-expressing LC fibers are stimulated? This could provide higher resolution for the relative size of these different NE-responding populations, as well as their identity (via post-recording cell fill and immunolabeling?)</italic> </p><p>We appreciated these elegant suggestions to improve our work. Unfortunately, most of these suggestions were outside of the scope of what was possible for this study given the struggles we had with animal breeding. While the adrenergic inhibitors would be an important addition to this story, the practical limitations of recording in anesthetized mice meant that we would need many fold more animals than we had available after exhausting all possible sources/supplies. With the pressing need to increase our n for the recording experiments, we focused efforts on acquiring that new data with the hopes of following up with adrenergic compounds, however, we were unable to add sufficient numbers of recordings with the pharmacological treatments, so no conclusion could be made and these are not included in the manuscript. We do, however, believe that the new figure detailing LC-BLA photostimulation-induced increases in cfos to be a first step in answering some of the concerns raised here. While it lacks the temporal precision that would be provided by the suggested CRACM-style slice recordings, the new experiment suggests that there is projection selectivity in the modulation of BLA activity by the LC. Future work will endeavor to answer these questions more completely.</p><p><italic>Regarding optogenetic stimulation of fibers/related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: The authors find that stim. of BLA→ LC fibers produces negative association over time, which isn't present in real-time place aversion. But is it known if avoidance association is specific to the BLA→LC projection? It also seems possible that chronic activation of LC terminals could cause a change in LC cell body activity, and thus broadly affect the LC-NE circuit. This is mentioned in the Discussion, but maybe it's possible to experimentally address this concern. For instance, does local infusion of an adrenergic receptor antagonist into the BLA during or after conditioning block the avoidance (similar to the experiment done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>)?</italic> </p><p>As previously discussed, we agree with the reviewer that this is a critical experiment for the interpretation of the aversion experiments. Unfortunately, we were not able to secure sufficient TH-IRES-Cre mice on a reasonable timeline to complete these experiments. Instead, we have taken every effort to tone down our conclusions throughout the paper regarding the experiments in (the original) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and have removed aversion from the title of the paper, focusing instead on the observed anxiety-like behaviors. Future experiments (including those to eliminate the confounding effect of potential backpropagating action potentials) will be necessary to determine the precise role of LC-NE fibers in the BLA for aversive behaviors.</p></body></sub-article></article>
