This three-dimensional exoskeleton specifies shape and protects the cell from osmotic rupture. For cells to grow they must enlarge this covalently closed macromolecule and this requires both the synthesis of new material and hydrolysis of the PG meshwork to allow for its expansion. How the cell maintains the appropriate levels of these potentially autolytic enzymes remains unclear. Here, we report that the WalR-WalK (WalRK) two-component signaling pathway functions in the homeostatic control of the cell wall hydrolases required for expansion of the PG during growth.</p><p>The WalRK two-component system (TCS) was discovered over two decades ago and is among the most broadly conserved TCS in Firmicutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fabret and Hoch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubrac et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takada et al., 2018</xref>). WalK (also referred to as YycG, VicK, or MicA) is a membrane-anchored sensor kinase and WalR (also called YycF, VicR, or MicB) is a DNA binding response regulator of the OmpR family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fabret and Hoch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubrac et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dubrac and Msadek, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Okajima et al., 2008</xref>). In most bacteria that encode this TCS, two additional genes, <italic>walH</italic> (<italic>yycH</italic>) and <italic>walI</italic> (<italic>yycI</italic>), reside in an operon with them. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, WalH and WalI are negative regulators of the WalK sensor kinase and the three integral membrane proteins assemble into a multimeric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Szurmant et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Szurmant et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szurmant et al., 2008</xref>). The WalRK system is essential in most Firmicutes, making it an attractive antibiotic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrett and Hoch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gotoh et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly, the WalRK pathway has been extensively studied in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> as well as several important Gram-positive pathogens. In all cases where it has been examined, the WalR regulon contains genes encoding cell wall hydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bisicchia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn and Burne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubrac et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, cells engineered to constitutively express a subset of these enzymes can bypass the essentiality of the signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delaune et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takada et al., 2018</xref>). These findings have led to the view that the essential role of WalRK is to coordinate cell wall metabolism with growth. However, despite two decades of research, what the WalK sensor kinases senses and how this pathway functions in cell wall homeostasis have remained mysterious.</p><p>In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, phosphorylated WalR (WalR ~P) controls the synthesis of several cell wall hydrolases; among them are two enzymes (CwlO and LytE) that are critical for cell wall elongation. Cells lacking either PG hydrolase are viable but depletion of one in the absence of the other causes a cessation of growth followed by lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bisicchia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hashimoto et al., 2012</xref>). Both enzymes are D,L-endopeptidases and cleave the peptide bond between the second (γ-D-Glu) and third (mDAP) amino acid in the stem peptide of PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ishikawa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamaguchi et al., 2004</xref>). CwlO is controlled by a membrane complex composed of the non-canonical ABC transporter FtsEX and two integral membrane proteins SweC and SweD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meisner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Domínguez-Cuevas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunet et al., 2019</xref>). LytE is a secreted enzyme with LysM domains that direct it to the lateral cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Margot et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ishikawa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buist et al., 2008</xref>). How the level and activity of these essential elongation hydrolases are regulated remains incompletely understood. Here, we report that the WalK sensor kinase monitors the activity of CwlO and LytE by sensing the cleavage products generated by them. In response, WalK controls WalR-dependent changes in the expression and activity of these enzymes. Thus, this essential two component system functions in the homeostatic control of PG hydrolysis required for growth. This represents the first homeostatic pathway for cell wall hydrolysis in bacteria and we propose that cell wall remodeling in related Gram-positive pathogens is subject to similar regulatory control.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LytE levels increase in the absence of CwlO maintaining cell envelope integrity</title><p>In the course of characterizing LytE protein levels in various mutant backgrounds, we discovered that LytE levels increase approximately 2-fold in the absence of CwlO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine whether this increase was due to changes in <italic>lytE</italic> transcription, we fused the <italic>lytE</italic> promoter to <italic>lacZ</italic> and compared ß-galactosidase activity in wild-type and cells lacking CwlO. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, transcription from the P<italic><sub>lytE</sub></italic> promoter increased ~2 fold in the ∆<italic>cwlO</italic> mutant. A similar increase in P<italic><sub>lytE</sub></italic> transcription was observed in cells lacking the FtsEX complex, which is required for CwlO activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meisner et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, a point mutation in the Walker A motif in FtsE, predicted to impair ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meisner et al., 2013</xref>) but not CwlO association with FtsX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunet et al., 2019</xref>) also resulted in increased <italic>lytE</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). From these experiments we conclude that cells lacking CwlO activity increase expression of <italic>lytE</italic>. We also observed a modest but reproducible increase in <italic>lytE</italic> transcription in cells lacking LytE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> increases <italic>lytE</italic> expression in response to reduction in D,L-endopeptidase activity in general.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>B. <italic>subtilis</italic> increases <italic>lytE</italic> expression in the absence of CwlO activity to maintain cell envelope integrity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of LytE produced under the control of its native promoter or under IPTG control.

First, we determined the inducer concentration that resulted in LytE levels equivalent to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and then examined the cells by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). As reported previously, cells lacking <italic>cwlO</italic> were shorter and fatter than wild-type and these morphological phenotypes were largely homogenous throughout the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hashimoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meisner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunet et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, based on cytoplasmic mCherry fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and propidium iodide staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), the ∆<italic>cwlO</italic> mutant cells had intact membranes. By contrast, cells lacking <italic>cwlO</italic> in which LytE was artificially maintained at wild-type levels had heterogeneous morphologies with &gt;20% lysis or membrane permeability defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results indicate that the increase in LytE levels allows the ∆<italic>cwlO</italic> mutant to maintain membrane integrity and a homogenous morphology. Thus, these data suggest that cells lacking CwlO compensate for the reduction in D,L-endopeptidase activity by increasing expression of a second D,L-endopeptidase, LytE.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>B. subtilis</italic> modulates <italic>lytE</italic> transcription in response to changes in D,L-endopeptidase activity</title><p>The experiments described above indicate that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> increases <italic>lytE</italic> expression in the absence of CwlO activity.

These studies formed the basis of the prevailing model for WalRK function in which WalK signaling and WalR-dependent expression of cell wall hydrolases are linked to growth via the divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fukushima et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubrac et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fukushima et al., 2011</xref>).

Our findings that WalK responds to changes in PG hydrolases that act along the lateral cell wall appear inconsistent with a model in which WalK is only active at the septum. To address this discrepancy, we investigated whether the WalRK pathway could respond to changes in D,L-endopeptidase activity in cells lacking a divisome.</p><p>To prevent divisome assembly, we took advantage of the FtsZ inhibitor MciZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Handler et al., 2008</xref>).

However, this pathway can also rapidly reduce D,L-endopeptidase activity when it gets too high. The <italic>iseA</italic> gene, which is repressed by WalR ~P, encodes a secreted inhibitor of D,L-endopeptidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bisicchia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Salzberg and Helmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamamoto et al., 2008</xref>). It was given its name (<underline>i</underline>nhibitor of <underline>c</underline>ell <underline>s</underline>eparation <underline>A</underline>) because of its ability to inhibit cell separation D,L-endopeptidases when over-expressed on a multi-copy plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamamoto et al., 2008</xref>). However, we have found that LytE is likely to be the primary target of IseA. Specifically, we found that the levels of IseA needed to inhibit LytE had no impact on cell separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Furthermore, we have also found that CwlO has a half-life of ~7 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Accordingly, when D,L-endopeptidase activity is too high, a drop in WalRK signaling not only causes a reduction in <italic>lytE</italic> and <italic>cwlO</italic> transcription, but also inhibition of LytE activity via de-repression of <italic>iseA</italic> and a reduction in CwlO levels through degradation or shedding of the enzyme into the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, the WalRK signaling pathway is able to adjust the levels and activity of CwlO and LytE on the time-scale of a cell cycle to maintain homeostatic control of these essential enzymes during growth.</p><p>Previous work on the WalRK signaling pathway led to the model that WalK localization to the septal ring, in the absence of its negative regulators WalH and WalI, couples its activity to growth via the divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fukushima et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubrac et al., 2008a</xref>). Support for this model comes from experiments in which depletion of FtsZ or other divisome components results in a decrease in <italic>yocH</italic> mRNA levels and an increase in <italic>pdaC</italic> mRNA levels, suggesting that WalK-dependent phosphorylation of WalR requires an intact divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fukushima et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fukushima et al., 2011</xref>). One caveat of these experiments is that <italic>yocH</italic> and <italic>pdaC</italic> transcript levels were monitored 3 hr after depletion of the divisome components, raising the possibility that the reduction in WalR activity could be indirect. We note that we did not detect changes in P<italic><sub>iseA</sub></italic>- and P<italic><sub>yocH</sub></italic>-directed Venus fluorescence after inhibiting FtsZ for 70–90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, RT-PCR is likely to be more sensitive than our fluorescence-based assay. It is therefore possible that WalRK functions in the homeostatic control of the elongation hydrolases as described here, and separately acts at the divisome to boost CwlO and LytE levels during cytokinesis in anticipation of cell wall growth following division. Time-lapse microscopy in microfluidic devices like the mother machine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) will enable a direct test of this model in the future.</p><p>We have demonstrated that the soluble cleavage products generated by D,L-endopeptidase-digestion can inhibit WalK signaling and could therefore function as allosteric inhibitors of the kinase. Although the specific cleavage product that inhibits WalK is currently unknown, we favor the idea that the cross-linked tetra- and/or penta-peptides liberated by cleavage of peptide crosslinks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) are the WalK ligand because cleavage of PG crossbridges is required for expansion of the PG meshwork during growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bisicchia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meisner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hashimoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hashimoto et al., 2018</xref>). To generate these products, both γ-D-Glu-mDAP bonds must be cleaved in the peptide crossbridge. Concerted cleavage of identical bonds in peptide crosslinks has been proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wong et al., 2015</xref>), however it has not been rigorously tested. Alternatively, it is also possible that di- or tri-peptides released upon cleavage of un-cross-linked stem peptides or even short glycan strands with attached di-peptides could serve as the signal. Future experiments will be directed at defining the specific cleavage product that is sensed by WalK and ultimately the ligand-binding site in the sensor domain.</p><p>As indicated above, our data are most consistent with a model in which WalK is inhibited when it binds its signal and active when un-liganded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Specifically, we showed that D,L-endopeptidase cleavage products cause de-repression of P<italic><sub>iseA</sub></italic>, indicative of low levels of WalR ~P and low WalK kinase activity. Reciprocally, we found that depletion of CwlO, and therefore low concentrations of cleavage products, leads to high P<italic><sub>yocH</sub></italic> transcription, indicative of high levels of WalR ~P and high WalK kinase activity. Another, closely related, two-component system in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is the PhoR-PhoP system, involved in sensing and responding to phosphate limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seki et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Botella et al., 2014</xref>). The PhoP response regulator activates genes involved in phosphate scavenging and inhibits the synthesis of the phosphate-rich surface polymers called wall teichoic acid (WTA). Interestingly, work from the Devine lab suggests that the sensor kinase PhoR is active when un-liganded and inhibited when bound by intermediates in the WTA biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Botella et al., 2014</xref>). In this case, the signal is thought to be sensed by the intracellular PAS domain of PhoR. Nonetheless, it is interesting that in both cases these kinases appear to be regulated by allosteric inhibition.</p><p>Cell growth requires an intimate balance between cell wall synthesis and its hydrolysis. The homeostatic control pathway we have defined here ensures that exponentially growing cells maintain a defined amount of D,L-endopeptidase activity for cell wall elongation. However, under different growth conditions, for example entry into stationary phase, the cell is likely to require different levels of hydrolase activity. We propose that the cell could adapt by modulating the homeostatic ‘set point’ of the WalRK signaling pathway. This set point is likely determined by the levels of the WalK-WalH-WalI sensor kinase complex; the affinity of WalK for its putative allosteric inhibitor; and the activities of the histidine kinase and response regulator. A link between one or more of these determinants and PG synthesis could ensure coordination. Since the <italic>wal</italic> operon is not under auto-regulatory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fabret and Hoch, 1998</xref>), altering the set point is unlikely to occur through changes in the levels in the WalK-WalH-WalI complex. Instead, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> could modulate WalK's affinity for D,L-endopeptidase cleavage products or adjust WalK kinase activity or WalR-dependent transcription. For example, the conserved extracellular domains of WalH and WalI could function in modulating ligand affinity in response to an extracellular signal generated during PG synthesis, or in response to changes in the cell envelope itself. Similarly, the conserved intracellular PAS domain of WalK could alter kinase activity in response to a cytoplasmic signal. For example, this domain could sense intermediates in the PG precursor (lipid II) pathway, analogous to the signal sensed by the PhoR PAS domain. Finally, WalR activity is known to be modulated by PrkC-dependent phosphorylation during entry into stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Libby et al., 2015</xref>), which is thought to respond to extracellular muropeptides. By changing the homeostatic set point for hydrolase activity, extracellular signals could directly coordinate hydrolase activity with PG synthesis while the intracellular signal could link hydrolase activity to flux through the precursor synthesis pathway. Identifying these potential allosteric modulators and defining how they impact the homeostatic control of LytE and CwlO are important challenges for the future.</p><p>The WalRK two-component system is the most broadly conserved TCS in the Firmicutes and can be found in important human pathogens including <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubrac et al., 2008a</xref>). In most cases, this pathway is essential and, in the organisms in which it has been investigated, the WalR regulon contains cell wall hydrolases although not necessarily D,L-endopeptidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dubrac and Msadek, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bisicchia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn and Burne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delaune et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, as is the case with <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takada et al., 2018</xref>), the essentiality of this pathway can be bypassed by engineering these bacteria to express a subset of the PG hydrolytic enzymes in the WalR regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delaune et al., 2011</xref>). Based on these similarities, we hypothesize that the WalRK pathway functions in homeostatic control of cell wall hydrolysis in these pathogens and uses distinct cleavage products to monitor PG hydrolase activity.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the WalK sensor kinases in <italic>Streptococci</italic> and <italic>Lactococci</italic> lack an extracellular sCache domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lange et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubrac et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, if there is homeostatic control of cell wall hydrolases in these bacteria they must use a different sensing mechanism or employ a distinct signaling pathway. Intriguingly, the StkP serine/theronine kinase in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> has been implicated in modulating cell wall hydrolysis and has been suggested to function in concert with WalRK pathway in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fleurie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stamsås et al., 2017</xref>). Analysis of the WalK signaling in diverse Gram-positive pathogens will establish the similarities and differences in the regulatory logic we have uncovered here. Finally, the cleavage products of the PG hydrolases in the WalR regulons could potently inhibit WalK signaling and therefore offer the potential for therapeutic development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains, plasmids, and routine growth conditions</title><p>All <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> strains were derived from the prototrophic strain PY79 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Youngman et al., 1983</xref>).

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>In this study, the authors show that in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, cell wall remodeling acts upstream of a regulatory feedback loop that adjusts cell wall homeostasis on the time scale of the cell cycle. In this process, activation of the WalK kinase occurs when D,L-endopeptidase activity is low, leading to increased expression of endopeptidase-encoding genes. On the contrary, at high D,L-endopeptidase activity, the subsequent accumulation of cell wall cleavage products inhibits the kinase and therefore endopeptidase gene expression is shut down. The uncovered regulatory logic is an important step toward understanding of essential WalRK-dependent regulations in other firmicutes including important human pathogens. Conserved themes but also variations are to be expected.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Homeostatic control of cell wall hydrolysis by the WalRK two-component signaling pathway in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tâm Mignot as Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hendrik Szurmant (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The WalRK two-component signal transduction system is a widely studied pathway, due to its requirement for cell viability in a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria. This manuscript demonstrates nicely that the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> version of this system adjust its activity in response to the activity of specific autolysins. In turn the genes for these autolysins are under transcriptional control of the WalRK system, thus providing evidence of a homeostatic feedback control system and adding a significant piece to the puzzle. The data is further suggestive that a peptidoglycan cleavage product serves as an inhibitor of WalK kinase activity.</p><p>The reviewers only have editorial concerns that require text adjustments prior to publication:</p><p>1) One concern with the current manuscript is a lack of reconciliation of the model in Figure 9 with previous studies that demonstrated that WalK is primarily located at the septum in actively growing <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells. As the authors point out in the subsection “The WalK sensor kinase responds to changes in D,L-endopeptidase activity in the absence of cell division”, WalK is responsive to autolysin activity when FtsZ is inhibited. Certainly it appears that a previous model based on available data at the time was not entirely correct. In this model it was suggested that WalK is active during rapid growth via its location at the septum and inactive under non-growing conditions while in complex with WalHI at the lateral cell wall. The authors here clearly show that WalHI-complexed WalK at the lateral cell wall can be activated by lack of CwlO or LytE activity. Nonetheless, the data that showed WalK localized to the septum is solid and so are published data that show that WalK is responsive (less active) when various cell division proteins are depleted. Interestingly, a soluble fragment of WalK that excludes the extra-cytoplasmic PAS domain and TM helices of WalK maintained its septum localization. Assays suggested that a cytoplasmic PAS domain was essential for this localization. It thus seems plausible that WalK might have two different sensing roles depending on localization, and perhaps mediated by different input domains. Figure 9 nicely summarizes the authors data and is easy to understand to the non-expert reader and it could thus be left as such. But the authors should include a discussion that integrates their new findings with data from previous studies. Similarly, the text in the subsection “The WalK sensor kinase responds to changes in D,L-endopeptidase activity in the absence of cell division” could be amended to not seem as dismissive of previous results.</p><p>2) In the Abstract the authors very definitively state that it is the cleavage products that are sensed by the WalK kinase. In the main text they are a little bit more careful with this statement, which I think is adequate. The statement should also be toned down a bit in the Abstract as well.</p><p>3) In the first paragraph of the subsection “LytE levels increase in the absence of CwlO maintaining cell envelope integrity”, authors describe a modest but reproducible effect. Could the authors include a statistical test?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52088.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The reviewers only have editorial concerns that require text adjustments prior to publication:</p><p>1) One concern with the current manuscript is a lack of reconciliation of the model in Figure 9 with previous studies that demonstrated that WalK is primarily located at the septum in actively growing B. subtilis cells.
