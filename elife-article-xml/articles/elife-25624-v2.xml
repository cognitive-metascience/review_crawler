of the highly effective antibacterials, β-lactams. Nonetheless, β-lactams showed mycobactericidal activity in combination with β-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanate (Clav). However, the mechanistic aspects of how <italic>Mtb</italic> responds to β-lactams such as Amoxicillin in combination with Clav (referred as Augmentin [AG]) are not clear. Here, we identified cytoplasmic redox potential and intracellular redox sensor, WhiB4, as key determinants of mycobacterial resistance against AG. Using computer-based, biochemical, redox-biosensor, and genetic strategies, we uncovered a functional linkage between specific determinants of β-lactam resistance (e.g. β-lactamase) and redox potential in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We also describe the role of WhiB4 in coordinating the activity of β-lactamase in a redox-dependent manner to tolerate AG. Disruption of WhiB4 enhances AG tolerance, whereas overexpression potentiates AG activity against drug-resistant <italic>Mtb</italic>. Our findings suggest that AG can be exploited to diminish drug-resistance in <italic>Mtb</italic> through redox-based interventions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25624.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25624.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25624.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A bacterium called <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> causes tuberculosis in humans. Multiple antibiotics are available to treat this infection, yet around one million people still die from tuberculosis each year. One of the reasons that the number of deaths is so high is because many <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> cells have become resistant to these drugs. Therefore, new drug treatments are urgently needed to tackle the disease.</p><p>When cells are under stress – for example, when a bacterial cell is exposed to an antibiotic – they can increase the production of chemicals known as reactive oxygen species. These chemicals are vital to many processes in cells, but if their levels get too high they can kill cells by damaging DNA and other molecules. To prevent this damage, bacterial cells produce molecules, such as mycothiol, to neutralize the excess reactive oxygen species.</p><p>A therapy called Augmentin is used to fight many different types of bacterial infection. It combines an antibiotic known as amoxicillin with another drug that blocks the activity of a bacterial enzyme responsible for breaking down amoxicillin-like drugs. Augmentin can also kill <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> cells, but it was not clear exactly how it works, or how the bacteria might be able to develop resistance to this treatment. Here, Mishra et al. combined a computational technique known as network analysis with experiments to study the affect of Augmentin on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><p>The experiments reveal that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> cells can develop resistance to Augmentin by increasing the production of an enzyme that breaks down the antibiotic and by neutralizing reactive oxygen species with help of mycothiol. Augmentin treatment can decrease the production of a protein called WhiB4 in the bacteria. This protein is involved in detecting when cells are stressed and regulates the levels of both mycothiol and the enzyme that breaks down the antibiotic. Increasing the production of this protein made the bacterial cells more susceptible to Augmentin treatment by decreasing the levels of active mycothiol and reducing the production of the enzyme that breaks down the antibiotic drug.</p><p>These findings suggest that Augmentin could be more effective against drug-resistant tuberculosis and other bacterial infections if it is combined with a drug that can alter the levels of reactive oxygen species inside bacterial cells. The next step is to search for new molecules that may be able to perform such a role.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25624.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25624.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic></kwd><kwd>Mycothiol</kwd><kwd>drug tolerance</kwd><kwd>Amoxicillin-Clavulanate</kwd><kwd>Peptidoglycan</kwd><kwd>persistence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR5020/MED/29/1454/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT-DBT/500034-Z-09-Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Intrinsic tolerance of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> toward the world's most successful antibacterials, β-lactams, is dependent on cytoplasmic redox potential and an intracellular redox-sensor WhiB4.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb)</italic> displays tolerance to several clinically important antibacterials such as aminoglycosides and β-lactams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flores et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morris et al., 2005</xref>). Innate resistance of <italic>Mtb</italic> toward β-lactams is likely to be due to the presence of a broad-spectrum Ambler class A β-lactamase (BlaC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flores et al., 2005b</xref>). Other physiological mechanisms such as cell envelope permeability, induction of drug efflux pumps, and variations in peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthetic enzymes may also play a role in the β-lactam-resistance of <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lun et al., 2014</xref>). The Ambler class A β-lactamases are mostly susceptible to inhibition by clavulanate (Clav), sulbactam (Sub), and tazobactam (Taz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurz et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, intrinsic resistance of <italic>Mtb</italic> toward β-lactams can be overcome by combining β-lactams with Clav (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chambers et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hugonnet et al., 2009</xref>). The combined amoxicillin (Amox) and Clav preparation, referred to as Augmentin (AG), was not only active against <italic>Mtb </italic>in vitro, but also had significant early bactericidal activity in patients with drug-resistant TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chambers et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cynamon and Palmer, 1983</xref>). Furthermore, a combination of meropenem and Clav showed significant bactericidal activity against drug-resistant strains of <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hugonnet et al., 2009</xref>). In view of this, there is an imminent need to investigate the mechanisms of action of β-lactams in combination with Clav against <italic>Mtb</italic>, and the potential development of resistance by the pathogen against this combination.</p><p>In other bacteria, β-lactams directly interact with enzymes involved in PG synthesis. This is likely to result in killing of the pathogen through multiple mechanisms, including the induction of autolysin pathway, holin:antiholin pathway, DNA damage, and alterations in physiology (e.g. TCA cycle and oxidative stress) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tomasz, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rice et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kohanski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lobritz et al., 2015</xref>). The complex effects of β-lactams on both PG biosynthesis and other processes indicate that the response to β-lactams could be mediated either through direct sensing of β-lactam molecules or by their effects on bacterial physiology. In <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> a transmembrane protease (BlaR1) senses β-lactam concentrations by direct binding through an extracellular domain, which activates its intra-cytoplasmic proteolytic domain resulting in cleavage of the β-lactamase repressor, BlaI, and induction of β-lactamase expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gregory et al., 1997</xref>). It has been shown that <italic>Mtb</italic> expresses a homolog of BlaR1 (encoded by Rv1845c, <italic>blaR</italic>), which modulates the activity of BlaC by regulating the BlaI repressor in a manner analogous to <italic>S. aureus</italic> BlaR1-BlaI couple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sala et al., 2009</xref>). However, BlaR orthologues in all mycobacterial species lack the extracellular sensor domain involved in binding with β-lactams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sala et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that mechanisms of antibiotic sensing and BlaC regulation are likely to be distinct in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Furthermore, how β-lactams influence mycobacterial physiology (e.g. redox balance and primary metabolism) remains unknown. Therefore, insights on how the presence of β-lactams is conveyed in <italic>Mtb</italic> to activate appropriate adaptation response are key to combating resistance and developing novel therapies.</p><p>In this work, we generated a system-scale understanding of how AG affects mycobacterial physiology. Exploiting a range of technologies, we explained mechanistically that the efficacy of AG is partly dependent upon the redox physiology of <italic>Mtb</italic>. Furthermore, we have rationally described the role of a redox-responsive transcription factor, WhiB4, in regulating the tolerance of <italic>Mtb</italic> to AG during infection. Our study demonstrates how <italic>Mtb</italic> alters its redox physiology in response to AG and identifies a major mycobacterial antioxidant, mycothiol (MSH), and WhiB4 as major contributors to β-lactam tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Network analysis revealed modulation of cell wall processes in response to AG in <italic>Mtb</italic></title><p>To assess the response of <italic>Mtb</italic> toward β-lactam and β-lactamase inhibitor combination(s), we analyzed the transcriptome of mycobacterial cells exposed to AG. We observed that 100 µg/ml of Amox in combination with 8 µg/ml of Clav (10X MIC of AG) arrested bacterial growth at 6 hr and killing was observed only after 12 hr post-exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>-Inset). Therefore, expression changes at a pre-lethal phase (i.e. 6-hr post -exposure) can reveal significant insights into <italic>Mtb</italic> pathways involved in AG tolerance.</p><p>A total of 481 genes were induced (≥2 fold; p value ≤ 0.05) and 461 were repressed (≥2 fold; p value ≤ 0.05) in wt <italic>Mtb</italic> upon AG-treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">supplementary file 1A</xref>). Although these results are important, the transcriptome only provides a snapshot of the mechanisms exploited by <italic>Mtb</italic> for AG tolerance. To generate a system-scale understanding, computational approaches that combine condition-specific expression data with general protein interaction data are frequently utilized to construct dynamic and stress response networks (see Appendix 1 for detailed explanation). Therefore, we further generated the AG response network by combining microarray data with the protein-protein interaction (PPI) map of <italic>Mtb</italic>. To construct this map, we first created a comprehensive PPI of <italic>Mtb</italic> using information from experimentally validated and published interactions (see Materials and methods) and integrated microarray data with the PPI to generate the AG response network. In the network, a node represents a protein whose weight is based on a weighting function that captures the variation in the expression level of the corresponding gene due to drug exposure. An edge represents an interaction between two nodes, which are also weighted by a function that captures the node weights of both nodes forming an edge, as a relative importance of all edges in the network. A full description of the mathematical equations and algorithms used to generate the AG response network is beyond the scope of this study, we encourage readers to refer our original papers for detailed methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sambarey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sambaturu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Padiadpu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">supplementary file 1B</xref> represent the top 1% nodes, which cover a total of 806 genes, connected through 1096 interactions to form a well-connected AG response network of <italic>Mtb</italic>. Genes belonging to diverse functional classes such as intermediary metabolism, cell wall, lipid metabolism, virulence, and information pathways are featured in the response network. In line with cell surface targeting activity of β–lactams, the cumulative node weight (CNW) of genes belonging to cell-wall-related processes, including PG biosynthesis, was the highest (CNW = 30616361.02) amongst the classes affected by AG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, nodes belonging to ‘intermediary metabolism and respiration’ were also significantly enriched in response to AG (CNW = 20716788.92; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating a downstream effect of target-specific interactions of AG on fundamental metabolic processes in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Further analysis revealed that several mediators (e.g. <italic>sigE</italic>, <italic>sigB, mprAB,</italic> and <italic>dnaK</italic>) of cell envelope stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bretl et al., 2014</xref>) function as major hub nodes and form-interconnected networks of genes important for maintaining cell wall integrity in response to AG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Accordingly, expression data showed induction of genes involved in PG biosynthesis, β-lactamase regulation (<italic>blaR-blaI</italic>), and cell envelope homeostasis in response to AG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, two other mechanisms involved in tolerance toward β-lactams that is outer membrane permeability (mycolic acid biogenesis [<italic>kasA, kasB,</italic> and <italic>fabD</italic>] and <italic>omp</italic>) and drug efflux pumps (<italic>efpA, Rv1819c</italic> and <italic>uppP</italic>) were also induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">supplementary file 1A</xref>).

We compared gene expression changes displayed by MSH and EGT mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saini et al., 2016</xref>) with the AG transcriptome. Approximately 60% of genes regulated by MSH and EGT also displayed altered expression in response to AG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating overlapping roles of MSH and EGT in tolerating oxidative stress associated with AG treatment in <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saini et al., 2016</xref>).

Since, NADH redox cofactor is central to metabolism and respiration, we first measured NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio of <italic>Mtb</italic> cells exposed to 10X MIC of AG at various time points post-treatment. At pre-lethal stage (6 hr post-treatment), we did not observe any change in NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, a significant elevation of NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio was detected 24 hr post-treatment, which coincides with AG-induced killing in <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We subsequently determined accumulation of ROS by staining with an oxidant-sensitive fluorescent dye; 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) in <italic>Mtb</italic> cells treated with AG (10X MIC) for 3 hr and 6 hr. Early time points were considered for ROS measurements to disregard the possibility of death-mediated increase in ROS upon AG treatment. A consistent increase (~3-fold increase) in DCFDA fluorescence was observed at both time points as compared to untreated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Under aerobic conditions, ROS is mainly generated through univalent reduction of O<sub>2</sub> by reduced metals, flavins, and quinones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Imlay, 2013</xref>), which mainly generates superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>−•</sup>). Therefore, we determined O<sub>2</sub><sup>−•</sup> production using a well-established and freely cell-permeable O<sub>2</sub><sup>−•</sup> indicator, dihydroethidium (DHE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kalyanaraman et al., 2014</xref>). It is known that DHE specifically reacts with O<sub>2</sub><sup>−•</sup> to release fluorescent product 2-hydroxyethidium (2-OH-E<sup>+</sup>), which can be conveniently detected by HPLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kalyanaraman et al., 2014</xref>). The reaction of DHE with other oxidants produces ethidium (E<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tyagi et al., 2015</xref>). Due to biosafety challenges associated with a BSL3 category pathogen such as <italic>Mtb</italic> for HPLC, we measured O<sub>2</sub><sup>−•</sup> levels inside the related but nonpathogenic <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG upon AG challenge. BCG cells were treated with AG (10X MIC) for 3 hr and 6 hr, followed by DHE staining and HPLC. We found that BCG cells treated with AG generate peaks corresponding to O<sub>2</sub><sup>−•</sup> (2-OH-E<sup>+</sup>) and other ROS (E<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The intensity of peaks was significantly higher at 6 hr post-treatment as compared to untreated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

We further validated the contribution of MSH in tolerating AG by measuring the sensitivity of <italic>Msm</italic> lacking MSH-disulphide reductase (Mtr) activity (<italic>MsmΔmtr</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holsclaw et al., 2011</xref>) and MSH-depleted (<italic>MsmΔmshD</italic>) strain toward Amox and AG.

Alongside MSH, other prominent oxidative stress defense mechanisms include the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> detoxifying enzyme, catalase (KatG), and NADPH-dependent thioredoxin (TRX) system. The extra-cytoplasmic sigma factor, SigH, is known to regulate several components of the TRX system in mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raman et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, we assessed the inhibition of Msm strains lacking KatG (<italic>MsmΔkatG</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Padiadpu et al., 2016</xref>) and SigH (<italic>MsmΔsigH</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandes et al., 1999</xref>) by Amox and AG.

Since <italic>whiB4</italic> expression is uniformly repressed by β-lactams (e.g. meropenem and AG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lun et al., 2014</xref>) and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chawla et al., 2012</xref>), WhiB4 appears to be critical in the β-lactam-induced oxidative stress response in <italic>Mtb</italic>.

Microarray data indicated higher expression of genes known to be involved in tolerance to β-lactams in <italic>MtbΔwhiB4</italic>.

Since WhiB4 bind to its own promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chawla et al., 2012</xref>), we confirmed that oxidized apo-WhiB4 binds to its promoter in concentrations comparable to that required for binding <italic>blaC</italic> and <italic>blaR</italic> upstream sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). We also performed competition assays using <italic>blaC</italic> and <italic>blaR</italic> upstream sequences as positive controls, while promoter fragment of <italic>Rv0986</italic> was utilized as a negative control. We found that 100-fold molar excess of <italic>blaC</italic> and <italic>blaR</italic> DNA fragments completely prevented apo-WhiB4 binding. However, the same concentration of an unlabeled <italic>Rv0986</italic> promoter fragment was inefficient to out-compete apo-WhiB4 association with <italic>blaC</italic> and <italic>blaR</italic> DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we performed in vitro transcription assays using a highly sensitive <italic>Msm</italic> RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing stoichiometric concentrations of principal Sigma factor, SigA (RNAP-σ<sup>A</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chawla et al., 2012</xref>) and determined the consequence of WhiB4 on <italic>blaC</italic> transcript. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, addition of oxidized apo-WhiB4 noticeably inhibited transcription from <italic>blaC</italic> promoter, whereas reduced apo-WhiB4 restored normal levels of <italic>blaC</italic> transcript. Lastly, we directly measured BlaC activity in the cell-free extracts derived from wt <italic>Mtb</italic>, <italic>MtbΔwhiB4</italic>, and <italic>whiB4-OE</italic> strains using a chromogenic β-lactam nitrocefin as a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flores et al., 2005b</xref>). Cell-free extracts of <italic>MtbΔwhiB4</italic> possessed ~70% higher and <italic>whiB4-OE</italic> showed ~30% reduced nitrocefin hydrolysis as compared to wt <italic>Mtb</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). We have earlier shown that WhiB4 predominantly exists in an oxidized apo-form upon overexpression inside mycobacteria during aerobic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chawla et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, decreased BlaC activity upon WhiB4 overexpression is most likely a consequence of oxidized apo-WhiB4-mediated repression of <italic>blaC in vivo</italic>. To clarify the physiological relevance of redox- and <italic>whiB4</italic>-dependent transcription of <italic>blaC</italic>, we shifted the internal redox balance of <italic>whiB4-OE</italic> using a cell permeable thiol-oxidant, diamide (5 mM), or a thiol-reductant, DTT (5 mM), and measured nitrocefin hydrolysis by cell-free extracts. We have previously reported that treatment with 5 mM diamide or DTT did not adversely affect growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Singh et al., 2009</xref>). However, treatment with DTT significantly reduced disulfide-linked oligomers of oxidized apo-WhiB4 to regenerate WhiB4 thiols in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chawla et al., 2012</xref>). Pretreatment of <italic>whiB4-OE</italic> with DTT largely restored BlaC activity to <italic>MtbΔwhiB4</italic> levels, whereas diamide did not lead to further decrease in BlaC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Effective reduction of disulfides in oxidized apo-WhiB4 by DTT may have led to loss of WhiB4 mediated DNA binding and transcriptional repression, thereby causing elevated <italic>blaC</italic> expression and activity in <italic>whiB4-OE</italic>. Taken together, these results led us to conclude that WhiB4 regulates β-lactamase expression and activity in a redox-dependent manner.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25624.023</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Regulation of β-lactamase by WhiB4 in a redox-dependent manner.</title><p>Oxidized (WhiB4-SS) and reduced (WhiB4-SH) forms of apo-WhiB4 were prepared.

Poor half-life of AG in mice makes it challenging to assess the efficacy of AG in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rullas et al., 2015</xref>). However, AG induces a marginal (~0.5 log reduction) killing of <italic>Mtb</italic> in an acute model for TB infection in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Solapure et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we compared bacillary load of <italic>Mtb</italic> strains in the lungs of mice during acute infection (see Materials and methods). Approximately 10<sup>4</sup> bacterial cells were implanted into the lungs of BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>) and at 3 days post-infection mice were treated with AG (200 mg/kg body weight of Amox and 50 mg/kg body weight of Clav) twice a day for 2 and 4 weeks. Bacterial numbers were determined in the infected lungs upon treatment. At 3 days post-infection, bacillary load was comparable between <italic>Mtb</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). At 2 and 4 weeks post-treatment, wt <italic>Mtb</italic> exhibited ~7-fold reduction in bacillary load than untreated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). Overexpression of WhiB4 resulted in ~4- and~38-fold decline in CFU at 2 and 4 weeks, post-treatment, as compared to untreated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). In contrast, <italic>MtbΔwhiB4</italic> either displayed an increase (~8-fold) or maintained a comparable bacillary load at 2 or 4 weeks post-treatment, respectively, relative to untreated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). Lastly, we overexpressed WhiB4 in the MYC 431 XDR strain (431/<italic>whiB4</italic>-OE) and examined AG efficacy in mice as described earlier. As expected, WhiB4 overexpression increased the sensitivity of MYC 431 toward AG treatment at 4 weeks post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>). We documented that WhiB4 overexpression significantly affects the survival of <italic>Mtb in vivo</italic>, an outcome that is most likely due to WhiB4-directed repression of the antioxidant systems and β-lactamase. In conclusion, our results suggest that WhiB4 plays a central role in coordinating <italic>Mtb</italic> tolerance to AG.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We revealed a redox-based mechanism underlying tolerance to a β-lactam and β-lactamase inhibitor combination, which is actively considered to treat drug-resistant <italic>Mtb</italic> infections. Importantly, these findings should be viewed in light of recent studies debating the contribution of antibiotic-induced redox perturbations in antibiotic action and tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kohanski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Foti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brynildsen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu and Imlay, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keren et al., 2013</xref>). We have shown how the primary targets of antibiotics (e.g. PG biogenesis and β-lactamase) and their secondary consequences (redox stress and metabolic perturbations) are functionally associated with each other through a redox-sensitive transcription factor, WhiB4, in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Considering the fact that drug-resistance in <italic>Mtb</italic> is a global burden, our results showing that WhiB4-mediated changes in redox potential of <italic>Mtb</italic> can potentiate killing of clinical drug-resistant forms of <italic>Mtb</italic> by AG are novel and unique. We identified the internal redox potential of <italic>Mtb</italic> as a crucial determinant of mycobacterial sensitivity to AG, and demonstrated the central role of WhiB4 in maintaining redox balance and regulating gene expression. Down-regulation of TCA cycle genes and up-regulation of the glyoxylate cycle in response to AG are consistent with the reports of elevated tolerance to diverse bactericidal antibiotics, including β-lactams, in bacteria with diminished fluxes through the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kohanski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nguyen et al., 2011</xref>). In concurrence with this, metabolomic profiling of <italic>Mtb</italic> in response to other anti-TB drugs elegantly showed that tolerance is accompanied with reduced TCA cycle activity and elevated fluxes through the glyoxylate shunt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nandakumar et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic> exhibits tolerance to antibiotics during non-replicating persistence in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baek et al., 2011</xref>). Under these conditions, drug tolerance was accompanied by a redirection of respiration from the energetically efficient route (e.g. NADH dehydrogenase I) to the less energy efficient course (e.g. NDH, CydAB oxidase), and any interference with this respiratory-switch over (e.g. CydAB mutation) leads to resensitization of mycobacteria to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). This seems to be a unifying theme underlying tolerance to conventional as well as the newly discovered anti-TB drugs bedaquiline (BDQ) and Q203 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lamprecht et al., 2016</xref>). In support of this, we found that exposure of <italic>Mtb</italic> to AG elicited a transcriptional signature that indicated a shift from the energy efficient respiration to the energetically less favored pathways, as evidenced by a significant induction of <italic>ndh</italic> and <italic>cydAB</italic> transcripts and a down-regulation of <italic>nuo</italic>, <italic>cydbc1</italic>, and <italic>atp A-H</italic>. In bacteria, including <italic>Mtb</italic>, cytochrome <italic>bd</italic> oxidase also displays catalase and/or quinol oxidase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Attar et al., 2016</xref>), which confers protection against oxidative stress and nitrosative stress. On this basis, upregulation of cytochrome <italic>bd</italic> oxidase in response to AG is indicative of oxidative stress in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Bactericidal antibiotics, including β-lactams, have been consistently shown to produce ROS as a maladaptive consequence of primary drug-target interaction on TCA cycle and respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kohanski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lobritz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dwyer et al., 2014</xref>). While this proposal has been repeatedly questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu and Imlay, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keren et al., 2013</xref>), it is strongly reinforced by multiple independent studies demonstrating that tolerance to antibiotics is linked to the bacterial ability to nullify antibiotic-triggered ROS toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nguyen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang and Zhao, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gusarov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shatalin et al., 2011</xref>). We confirmed that AG stimulates oxidative stress in <italic>Mtb</italic> in vitro and during infection. However, in contrast to other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kohanski et al., 2007</xref>), oxidative stress was not associated with a breakdown of the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis, likely reflecting efficient ETC fluxes through NDH and cytochrome <italic>bd</italic> oxidase. In <italic>Mtb</italic>, rerouting of electron fluxes through cytochrome <italic>bd</italic> oxidase increases oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lamprecht et al., 2016</xref>), which can trigger O<sub>2</sub><sup>−•</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation by univalent reduction of O<sub>2</sub> by the metal, flavin, and quinone containing cofactors of the respiratory enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Imlay, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2013</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that intramycobacterial antioxidant buffer, MSH, protects <italic>Mtb</italic> from small molecule endogenous superoxide generators and ROS-generated by vitamin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tyagi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vilchèze et al., 2013</xref>). Specific to AG, we found that anti-mycobactericidal activity is greatly potentiated in MSH-deficient mycobacterial strains, whereas a MSH overexpressing strain displayed tolerance. This is all consistent with the generation of ROS and MSH as key regulatory mechanisms underlying AG tolerance.</p><p>Studies indicated the importance of a broader range of physiological programs such as altered metabolic state and oxidative stress as contributory factors in antibiotic resistance. However, it is not clear if specific regulatory mediators exist which can assess physiological changes to regulate both primary drug targets and secondary consequences of drug-target interactions to functionally coordinate tolerance. Mechanisms of drug tolerance are either controlled by global changes in bacterial physiology by ppGpp or toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harms et al., 2016</xref>). Further, regulatory systems such as SoxRS in other bacteria and WhiB7 in <italic>Mtb</italic> facilitate physiological changes required for formation of drug-tolerant persisters without specifically affecting the expression of direct targets of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morris et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aly et al., 2015</xref>).

While several possibilities including the involvement of serine/threonine protein kinases (PknA/PknB) containing β-lactam interacting PASTA domains are suggested to regulate BlaR-BlaI activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sala et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mir et al., 2011</xref>), our findings implicate internal redox balance and WhiB4 in responding to β-lactams. We detected that oxidized apo-WhiB4 binds and represses the expression of BlaR and BlaC, whereas reduction reversed this effect. Loss of WhiB4 derepresses BlaR and stimulates the expression and activity of BlaC, possibly via BlaR-mediated cleavage of the repressor of <italic>blaC</italic> (i.e. BlaI). In addition to <italic>blaC</italic>, BlaI also binds to the promoters of genes encoding cytochrome <italic>bd</italic> oxidase and ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sala et al., 2009</xref>), both of which showed higher expression in <italic>MtbΔwhiB4</italic>. Altogether it indicates that regulatory function of BlaI is dependent upon the ability of WhiB4 to coordinate <italic>blaR</italic> expression in response to redox changes associated with β-lactam exposure. Our findings indicate a possible regulatory loop between the electron transport chain and β-lactam-induced oxidative stress where WhiB4/BlaI/BlaR may act as an important link between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The biogenesis of PG is an energy requiring process and the cell wall damage caused by β-lactam antibiotics can perturb membrane function thereby affecting respiration, ATP generation, and redox balance. All these events can cause metabolic paralysis leading to inhibition of PG biogenesis and death. Supporting this notion, a recent study on the mechanisms of β-lactam toxicity showed that β-lactams cause metabolic instability due to activation of a futile cycle of PG biogenesis and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, tolerance to β-lactams would require active cooperation between mechanisms to maintain metabolic function, redox balance and β-lactamase activity, which are partly regulated by WhiB4 in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Under unstressed conditions, uncontrolled expression of genes such as <italic>blaC</italic> and <italic>cydAB</italic> is prevented by WhiB4-mediated DNA binding and repression of the <italic>blaR-blaI</italic> locus. This is possible since the WhiB4 Fe-S cluster is uniquely sensitive to oxygen and a fraction of WhiB4 exists in the apo-oxidized form inside aerobically growing <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chawla et al., 2012</xref>). Since oxidized apo-WhiB4 is known to repress its own expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chawla et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Mtb</italic> can down-regulate the expression of <italic>whiB4</italic> by elevating the levels of oxidized apo-WhiB4 in response to oxidative stress caused by β-lactams. The down-regulation of WhiB4 can reduce its negative influence on gene expression, necessary to adjust the expression of <italic>blaI, blaR</italic>, and <italic>blaC</italic> as well as genes involved in maintaining respiration and redox balance to neutralize β-lactam toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Our data confirmed this by demonstrating consistent repression of <italic>whiB4</italic> expression by AG treatment, oxidative stress, and upon MSH loss (in <italic>MtbΔmshA</italic>). The down-regulation of <italic>whiB4</italic> in <italic>MtbΔmshA</italic> is most likely a compensatory strategy to tolerate AG in the absence of MSH, albeit unsuccessfully, indicating that both WhiB4 and MSH are together required to tolerate β-lactam antibiotics in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Furthermore, induction of <italic>mshA</italic> in <italic>MtbΔwhiB4</italic> in response to AG indicates a redox-regulatory loop between WhiB4 and MSH to tolerate oxidative and antibiotic stress in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Lastly, considering that WhiB4 might affect gene expression by altering nucleoid architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chawla et al., 2012</xref>), the exact details of how WhiB4 regulates global gene expression is a part of an ongoing study. Data from this genome-scale DNA binding study (ChIP-seq) indicate that WhiB4 binds largely in a non-specific fashion to the <italic>Mtb</italic> chromosome with a particular preference to GC-rich regions including an intergenic region of <italic>blaI-blaR</italic> (&gt;70% GC-rich) (manuscript in preparation).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25624.028</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model showing redox basis of AG tolerance in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</title><p>Cell wall damage caused by AG can perturb the membrane integrity thereby affecting respiratory chain, redox balance, and ATP generation. All of this results in metabolic instability and AG-induced killing. To tolerate AG, <italic>Mtb</italic> redirects respiration from the energetically efficient route (e.g. NDH1, CyBC1) to the energetically poor one (e.g. NDH2, CyBD), and carbon metabolism from the TCA cycle to glyoxylate, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Rerouting of electron flux through CyBD can trigger generation of ROS (O<sub>2</sub><sup>−•</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) by univalent reduction of O<sub>2</sub> via metal-, flavin-, and quinone-containing respiratory enzymes. The intramycobacterial redox buffer, MSH, detoxifies ROS to protect <italic>Mtb</italic> from AG. The oxidative shift in <italic>E<sub>MSH</sub></italic> of <italic>Mtb</italic> in response to AG serves as a cue to calibrate the expression of β-lactamase, PG enzymes, carbon metabolism, antioxidants, and alternate respiration via WhiB4. Under native conditions, O<sub>2</sub>-induced loss of WhiB4 Fe-S cluster generates oxidized apo-WhiB4, which binds and represses the expression of <italic>blaR</italic> and <italic>blaC</italic>. Reduction of oxidized apo-WhiB4 disulfides reversed this effect. Down-regulation of <italic>whiB4</italic> in response to AG derepresses <italic>blaR</italic> and stimulates expression of <italic>blaC</italic> directly and/or indirectly via BlaR-mediated cleavage of the <italic>blaC</italic> repressor (i.e. BlaI) to induce AG tolerance. Accumulation of oxidized apo-WhiB4 upon overexpression led to hyper-repression of BlaC activity and oxidative shift in <italic>E<sub>MSH</sub></italic> to potentiate mycobactericidal activity of AG. Since genes associated with alternate-respiration (e.g. CyBD) and energy metabolism (e.g. ATP synthase) are also regulated by BlaI, our results suggest cross-talk between WhiB4 and BlaI pathways resulting in AG tolerance of <italic>Mtb</italic>. Altogether, WhiB4 couples the changes in the redox physiology of <italic>Mtb</italic> triggered by AG to the expression of genes involved in antibiotic tolerance and redox homeostasis.

For measurements, cells were treated with 10 mM N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 5 min at room temperature (RT) followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min at RT. After washing three times with 1X PBS, bacilli were analyzed using BD FACS Verse Flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The biosensor response was measured by analyzing the ratio at a fixed emission (510/10 nm) after excitation at 405 and 488 nm as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhaskar et al., 2014</xref>). Data were analyzed using the FACSuite software. For measuring intramycobacterial <italic>E<sub>MSH</sub></italic> during infection, THP-1 cells were treated with 15 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 20 hr to differentiate them into macrophages. Differentiated cells were then allowed to rest for 2 days, to ensure a resting phenotype before infection. PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were infected with <italic>Mtb</italic> strains expressing Mrx1-roGFP2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 for 4 hr at 37°C. After 4 hr of infection, cells were washed with pre-warmed RPMI and amikacin treatment (0.2 mg/ml for 2 hr) was given to remove extracellular bacteria. Subsequently cells were washed and resuspended in fresh RPMI media containing various concentrations of Amox (12.5, 25, 50, and 100 µg/ml of Amox) and Clav (8 µg/ml) for 6, 12, 24, and 36 hr. At the indicated time points, infected macrophages were treated with NEM/PFA, washed with 1X PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Padiadpu et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Survival Assay upon AG treatment in vitro and during infection</title><p><italic>Mtb</italic> strains were grown aerobically to OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4, followed by treatment with various concentrations of AG. At defined time-points post-exposure, cells were serially diluted and plated on OADC-7H11 agar medium for enumerating CFUs. To determine the effect of AG during infection, ~20,000 THP-1 cells (PMA differentiated) were infected with wt <italic>Mtb</italic> in a 96-well plate (MOI:10) as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Padiadpu et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, THP-1 monocytes were treated with 15 ng/ml of PMA for 20 hr to differentiate them into macrophages. Differentiated cells were then allowed to rest for 2 days and infected with <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv expressing Mrx1-roGFP2 at a MOI of 10 for 4 hr at 37°C. After 4 hr of infection, cells were washed with pre-warmed RPMI and amikacin treatment (0.2 mg/ml for 2 hr) was given to remove extracellular bacteria. Subsequently, cells were washed, fresh RPMI media was added and infected macrophages were exposed to AG (100 µg/ml of Amox and 8 µg/ml of Clav). At various time points, macrophages were lysed using 0.06% SDS-7H9 medium and released bacteria were serially diluted and plated on OADC-7H11 agar medium for CFU determination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Vancomycin-BODIPY staining</title><p>The pattern of nascent PG synthesis was observed by fluorescent staining as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thanky et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic> strains were grown to exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> 0.6) in 7H9 medium. 1 ml of culture was incubated with 1 µg/ml Vancomycin-BODIPY (BODIPY FL Vancomycin) for 16 hr under standard growth conditions. Cells were pelleted to remove excess stain and fixed with PFA. After washing with 1X PBS, culture aliquots (20 µl) were spread on slides and allowed to air dry. The bacterial cells were visualized for BODIPY FL Vancomycin fluorescence (excitation at 560 nm and emission at 590 nm) in a Leica TCS Sp5 confocal microscope under a 63X oil immersion objective. Staining pattern of more than 150 cells was observed for each strain and cell length was measured using Image J software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Aerosol infection of mice</title><p>For the acute model of infection, BALB/c mice were infected by aerosol with 10,000 bacilli per mouse with the <italic>Mtb H37Rv</italic>, <italic>Mtb∆whiB4, whiB4-OE,</italic> MYC 431, and MYC 431/<italic>whiB4-OE</italic> strains as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Solapure et al., 2013</xref>). For assured over-expression of WhiB4, doxycycline (1 mg/ml in 5% sucrose solution) was supplied in drinking water. Dosages of Amox and Clav were maintained at 200 mg/kg of body weight and as 50 mg/kg of body weight, respectively, and the drugs were administered orally twice a day. At specific time points, mice were sacrificed and their lungs were removed and processed for investigation of bacillary load. CFUs were determined by plating appropriate serial dilutions on 7H11(supplemented with OADC) plates. Colonies were observed and counted after 3–4 weeks of incubation at 37°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism software (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>).

AG-response network of <italic>Mtb</italic></title><p>To assess the response of <italic>Mtb</italic> towards β-lactam and β-lactamase inhibitor combination(s), we generated transcriptome of <italic>Mtb</italic> upon exposure to AG. Transcriptomic analyses provide genome-wide insights into the variations in gene expression in a given sample with respect to its reference condition. Whereas it gives a general idea of the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their broad functional categories, it does not discriminate between genes linked to the condition directly or indirectly and those that are not. Thus it is not helpful in obtaining mechanistic insights into condition-specific variations. Stochasticity is a commonly observed feature in gene expression variations and hence typically there are a large number of genes that do not correlate directly with the specific condition of a given sample. A further complexity arises as even among those DEGs correlated to the given condition, it is difficult to distinguish between genes that cooperate with each other to result in a coherent response versus those that are variations explored by the cell to overcome any stress that the cells may be exposed to in the given condition. Further, while deciding which gene is differentially expressed, for practical reasons, a rather arbitrary cut-off, such as a fold change of 1.5–2.0 folds, is chosen and all those below the cut-off that may still be significant are lost. These limitations can be overcome by using a molecular networks approach that harness the power of computational approaches to combine condition-specific expression data with general PPI map to construct dynamic and stress response networks.</p><p>We have previously established a methodology for mapping transcriptome data onto the PPI network and mining the network to identify sets of nodes that form connected sets, or in other words, sub-networks that are most varied in the a given condition with respect to its reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sambarey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sambaturu et al., 2016</xref>). This is analogous to identifying where the major differences are in a city’s traffic pattern at two different time points. Only those DEGs that show significant alteration in their neighborhoods are picked in the top-ranked sub-networks and hence the method is very useful in identifying the few hubs from which many other variations could emanate in the network. It must be noted that DEGs are not always directly connected with each other. Instead, there are a number of bridging nodes, some of which are constitutively expressed, and connect DEGs, leading to trails or paths that mediate flow of some sort of signal. Altogether, combining global expression profile of <italic>Mtb</italic> in response to AG with the PPI revealed both putative signal(s) and pathways activated in response to AG exposure.</p></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="article-commentary" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25624.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kana</surname><given-names>Bavesh D</given-names></name><role>Reviewing editor</role><aff><institution>University of the Witwatersrand</institution>, <country>South Africa</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Philip Cole (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Bavesh D Kana (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Carl Nathan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors attempt to describe the role of the redox sensor, WhiB4, in mediating the transcriptional and metabolic response of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> to combinatorial treatment with Amoxicillin and a β-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanate. These agents were administered in the clinically familiar form of Augmentin (AG). The authors start their exposition by describing the transcriptional response of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to AG, combined with some in silico network analysis, and describe several transcriptional changes that suggest perturbations in peptidoglycan (PG) biogenesis, β-lactamase regulation, membrane permeability and efflux pumps. Further interrogation of these responses suggested changes in carbon metabolism and respiration, including differential expression of genes in the TCA cycle and various components of the electron transport chain. The authors also identify a set of responses that point to changes in redox physiology. They further explore these redox-associated changes by interrogating gene expression in AG-exposed mutant strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> defective in Msh (mycothiol) and Egt (ergothioniene), key regulators in redox balance. Next, they demonstrate that AG exposure induces redox stress in the form of dysregulated NADH/NAD ratios and the accumulation of reactive oxygen intermediates. Quenching of reactive oxygen species rescues AG-mediated killing. Developing this further, the authors use an MSH-specific redox reporter and demonstrate that oxidative stress accumulated in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> when treated with AG in axenic culture and in macrophages. To substantiate these effects, the authors next turn to study the effects of AG treatment in a strain defective for MSH and show that this leads to a differential tolerance of AG-mediated killing effects. Thereafter, the authors study the transcriptional response to AG in a WhiB4 defective strain and report substantively increased expression of genes involved in β-lactam tolerance and PG biosynthesis, the latter confirmed by changes in the spatial localization of PG biosynthesis in the WhiB4 mutant. Using different approaches, the authors then demonstrate that WhiB4 is able to regulate β-lactamase expression in a redox-dependent manner and that loss thereof, affects the inherent susceptibility of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to AG, a notion they further explore and confirm in mice. The authors conclude that WhiB4 may act as a novel regulator of β-lactamase expression, an effect which is sensed through perturbations in oxidative-phosphorylation when <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is challenged with AG.</p><p>The manuscript reports a substantive body of carefully conducted experiments and opens up new avenues of investigation regards β-lactam treatment of TB disease. However, it in its current form, there are several shortfalls that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A substantive amount of interpretative power is placed on transcriptional analysis when bacteria are exposed to 10X MIC of AG. Under these conditions, it is not surprising that with nascent damage to peptidoglycan, the organism's ability to maintain a proton gradient, ATP generation and a reductive intracellular state will be highly compromised. As such, the high concentration of drug used can obfuscate the underlying biology. To validate their observations, the authors are requested to repeat their transcriptional analysis at 1X and 5X the MIC of AG. Under these conditions, transcriptional changes reflecting those seen at 10X MIC would validate their observations.</p><p>2) As bacteria are being treated with a cell wall inhibitor, growth and death should be monitored by CFU. Changes in cell shape can be misleading when monitoring by OD. The authors are requested to conduct CFU analysis in all cases where killing/survival was measured by OD.</p><p>3) EMSA assays need a cold-competitive DNA control.</p><p>4) In the Materials and methods section, the sentence, &quot;Various concentrations of AG were added immediately after infection and at various time points macrophages were….&quot; is somewhat concerning.

As it currently stands, it is very dense, does not flow well and is hence not suitable for the broad readership base of <italic>eLife</italic>. For some guidance, the network analysis and transcriptional data reported in the main body are complicated and difficult to follow.

Although our results show that exposure to 10X MIC of AG does not exert lethality at 6 h post-treatment [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>-Inset; revised manuscript], we completely agree that high concentrations of AG can adversely affect <italic>Mtb</italic>’s physiology to complicate interpretation of drug-specific effects on gene expression. Therefore, it is very important to validate these observations at lower concentrations of AG. To specifically address this concern, we repeated microarray experiments by exposing <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb</italic>) to 1X and 5X MIC of AG for 6 h and 12 h, post-treatment (GEO accession number GSE93091). We first confirmed that exposure to 1X and 5X MIC of AG does not compromise the viability of <italic>Mtb</italic> at 6 h and 12 h post-treatment by enumerating colony-forming units (CFUs) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>-Inset; revised manuscript]. Further, microarray data revealed that a relatively small number of genes were differentially regulated at 1X and 5X MIC as compared to 10X MIC of AG [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>; revised manuscript]. However, similar to our earlier observations with 10X MIC, exposure to 1X and 5X MIC of AG increased expression of genes associated with PG biogenesis, β-lactamase regulation, cell envelope stress, antioxidant systems, alternate respiration, central carbon metabolism (CCM), and efflux pumps [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>; revised manuscript].</p><p>Therefore, expression changes at various concentrations of AG are in reasonable agreement with each other. Finally, microarray data was validated by performing qRT-PCR on a few genes highly deregulated upon treatment with 1X, 5X, and 10X MIC of AG [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, revised manuscript]. These results are incorporated in the revised manuscript (subsection “AG affects pathways associated with central carbon metabolism (CCM), respiration, and redox balance”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) As bacteria are being treated with a cell wall inhibitor, growth and death should be monitored by CFU. Changes in cell shape can be misleading when monitoring by OD. The authors are requested to conduct CFU analysis in all cases where killing/survival was measured by OD.</italic></p><p><italic>3) EMSA assays need a cold-competitive DNA control.</italic></p><p>This is an excellent suggestion and we appreciate this recommendation. Accordingly, we performed competition assays using <italic>blaC</italic> and <italic>blaR</italic> upstream sequences as positive controls, while promoter fragment of an unrelated gene <italic>Rv0986</italic> was utilized as a negative control.</p><p>First, we performed competition assays using 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200-fold molar excess of <italic>blaC</italic> and <italic>blaR</italic> DNA fragments. We found that 100-fold molar excess of <italic>blaC</italic> and <italic>blaR</italic> fragments completely prevented WhiB4 binding. However, the same concentration of an unlabeled <italic>Rv0986</italic> promoter fragment was inefficient to out-compete WhiB4 association with <italic>blaC</italic> and <italic>blaR</italic> DNA fragments [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>; revised manuscript]. These results are included in the revised manuscript and we thank the reviewers for these helpful suggestions.</p><p><italic>4) In the Materials and methods section, the sentence, &quot;Various concentrations of AG were added immediately after infection and at various time points macrophages were….&quot; is somewhat concerning. If this is the way the experiment was done, how did the authors confirm that infection was indeed established?</italic></p><p>We apologize for not adequately explaining the technical details of this experiment. These are now included in the <italic>Materials and methods</italic> section of the manuscript. To determine the effect of AG during infection, PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were infected with wt <italic>Mtb</italic> at a multiplicity of infection of 10 (MOI:10) to triplicate wells. Infection was allowed to establish by incubating macrophages for 4 h at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. At 4 h post-infection, macrophages were washed and resuspended in RPMI medium containing 200 µg/ml amikacin for 2 h to remove extracellular bacteria. Macrophages were then washed to remove amikacin and infection was confirmed by lysing macrophages using 0.06% SDS and enumerating released bacteria by serial dilution and plating on 7H11-OADC plates. At this point, infected macrophages were resuspended in fresh RPMI medium containing various concentrations of AG. At various time points post-exposure to AG, macrophages were lysed and released bacteria were serially diluted and plated on 7H11-OADC agar medium for CFU determination. We thank the reviewer for this comment.</p><p><italic>5) The manuscript requires substantive editorial overhauling.

Based on the reviewer’s suggestions, we have made significant changes in the manuscript to simplify complex data and to clearly explain key findings in the main manuscript. The changes are as outlined below:</p><p>i) Network analysis is clearly described in the revised manuscript. Detailed explanation and methodology used for network construction is provided in the Materials and Methods section of the revised manuscript].</p><p>ii) The sub-networks, which are related to the central theme of the manuscript such as cell wall processes and intermediary metabolism/respiration, are described in the main body of the manuscript. Relevant high quality images of sub-networks along with explanatory legends are provided in the supplementary information [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; revised manuscript].</p><p>iii) We also agree with the suggestion to model key findings of our manuscript as a visually appealing model. Therefore, in the revised manuscript we have summarized our findings to provide a model showing redox basis of AG tolerance in <italic>Mtb</italic> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; revised manuscript].</p><p>iv) As suggested, mouse data is represented as a time course[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; revised manuscript]. For better clarity two graphs have been made. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref> shows CFU data of wt <italic>Mtb, MtbΔwhiB4, whiB4-comp</italic>, and <italic>whiB4-OE</italic> strains, whereas <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref> displays data obtained for the XDR strains <italic>MYC 431</italic> and <italic>431/whiB4-OE</italic>.</p><p>v) We have made efforts to clearly write our findings with an easy to follow rationale along with experimental details. Specifically, we removed unnecessary and complicated information to revamp some portions of Introduction, Results, and Discussion. Particularly, results pertaining to NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> measurements, <italic>E<sub>MSH</sub></italic> measurements, growth phenotypes of various redox-altered mutants, and β-lactamase regulation by WhiB4 are now explained in a lucid and concise manner. Importantly, data generated from the new experiments are summarized in simple terms in a few sentences in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
