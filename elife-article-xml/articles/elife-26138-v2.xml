PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and changes in the level of protein kinase mediated phosphorylation following activation of various G protein coupled receptors. We now show that the activity of TRPM3 expressed in mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons is inhibited by agonists of the G<sub>i</sub>-coupled µ opioid, GABA-B and NPY receptors. These agonist effects are mediated by direct inhibition of TRPM3 by Gβγ subunits, rather than by a canonical cAMP mediated mechanism. The activity of TRPM3 in DRG neurons is also negatively modulated by tonic, constitutive GPCR activity as TRPM3 responses can be potentiated by GPCR inverse agonists. GPCR regulation of TRPM3 is also seen in vivo where G<sub>i/o</sub> GPCRs agonists inhibited and inverse agonists potentiated TRPM3 mediated nociceptive behavioural responses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26138.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26138.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26138.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>TRPM3 belongs to a family of channel proteins that allow sodium and calcium ions to enter cells by forming pores in cell membranes. TRPM3 is found on the cell membranes of nerve cells; when ions flow into the nerves through the TRPM3 pores it triggers an electrical impulse. TRPM3 is responsible for helping us to detect heat, and mice without this protein find it difficult to sense painfully hot temperatures. Mice lacking TRPM3 also respond to other kinds of pain differently. Normally, a mouse with an injured paw becomes more sensitive to warm and hot temperatures, but this does not happen in mice that do not have TRPM3.</p><p>When activated, other proteins called G-protein coupled receptors (or GPCRs for short) can make some members of this family of channel proteins more or less likely to open their pore. This in turn increases or decreases the flow of ions through the pore, respectively. Yet it was not clear if GPCRs also affect TRPM3 channels on the membranes of nerve cells.</p><p>Quallo et al. have now discovered that “switching on” different GPCR proteins in sensory nerve cells from mice greatly reduces the flow of calcium ions though TRPM3 channels. The experiments made use of two pain-killing drugs, namely morphine and baclofen, and a molecule called neuropeptide Y to activate different GPCRs.</p><p>GPCRs interact with a group of small proteins called G-proteins that, when activated by the receptor, split into two subunits, known as the α subunit and the βγ subunit. Once detached these subunits are free to act as messengers and interact with other proteins in the cell membrane. Quallo et al. found that TRPM3 is one of a small group of proteins that interact with the βγ subunits of the G-protein, which can explain how “switching on” GPCRs reduces the activity of TRPM3. Two independent studies by Dembla, Behrendt et al. and Badheka, Yudin et al. also report similar findings.</p><p>There is currently a need to find more effective treatments for people suffering from long-term pain conditions and it has become clear that TRPM3 channels are involved in sensing both pain and temperature. These new findings show that drugs already used in the treatment of pain can dramatically change how TRPM3 works. These results might help scientists to find drugs that work in a similar way to dial down the activity of TRPM3 and to combat pain. Though first it will be important to confirm these new findings in human nerve cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26138.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26138.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>TRP channels</kwd><kwd>ion channels</kwd><kwd>GPCR</kwd><kwd>sensory neuron</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>DRG</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/L010747/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bevan</surname><given-names>Stuart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TRPM3 inhibition is identified as a novel mechanism for G-protein βγ subunit signalling.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteins encoded by the TRPM3 gene form non-selective cation channels which are widely expressed in mammalian tissues. The discovery that TRPM3 can be activated by the endogenous neurosteroid pregnenolone sulphate (PS), has facilitated the study of this widely-expressed TRP channel and PS has been utilised as a pharmacological tool for channel characterisation and as a probe for TRPM3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>). TRPM3 is expressed in peripheral sensory neurons where it acts as a heat sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>). Activation of TRPM3 channels in vivo has been shown to evoke nociceptive behaviours and mice without functional TRPM3 channels exhibit altered temperature preferences, compromised behavioural responses to noxious heat and fail to develop heat hyperalgesia associated with inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>There have been relatively few studies of the mechanisms which regulate or sensitise TRPM3. Many TRP channels are regulated by signalling pathways associated with activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). For example, activation of both Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub>- coupled receptors can sensitise the heat sensitive nociceptor TRPV1 through protein kinase-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bevan et al., 2014</xref>). Like other TRP channels, TRPM3 can be regulated by phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) and other phosphoinositides as loss or hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> leads to a reduction in TRPM3 activity that can be restored by application of exogenous PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badheka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tóth et al., 2015</xref>). These findings suggest that TRPM3 activity can be regulated downstream of activation of G<sub>q</sub> coupled GPCRs. A human TRPM3 variant with a short carboxyl terminus was found to be insensitive to stimulation of G<sub>q</sub>-coupled muscarinic receptors or histamine H1 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grimm et al., 2003</xref>). However, another human splice variant, TRPM3a, was shown to be activated by muscarinic receptor stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that individual genetic variants can be differentially regulated. Units of the G protein itself can directly interact with channel structures to modulate ion channel activity. Indeed activation of Gα<sub>q</sub>-linked receptors inhibits TRPM8 via a direct action of the Gα<sub>q</sub> subunit with the TRPM8 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) and TRPM1 is inhibited by interactions with either Gα or Gβγ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this study we have examined the effects of GPCR activation on the function of endogenously expressed TRPM3 channels in isolated DRG neurons from mice and investigated if activation of G<sub>i/o</sub> coupled GPCRs can modulate TRPM3 mediated nociceptive responses in vivo. For these experiments we have studied three different receptors (opioid, GABA<sub>B</sub> and neuropeptide Y) which are known to modulate sensory neuron activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levine and Taiwo, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schuler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). We have also examined the underlying mechanism in CHO and HEK293 cells exogenously expressing TRPM3. Our results demonstrate that activation of these GPCRs inhibits TRPM3 activity in DRG neurons by a Gβγ mediated mechanism and inhibits PS-evoked nociceptive responses in mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Morphine, Baclofen and PYY inhibit TRPM3 mediated PS-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses</title><p>Opioids remain one of the best known and most effective treatments for pain, and G<sub>i/o</sub> coupled GPCRs for opioid ligands are expressed on sensory neurons where receptor activation inhibits voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stein et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, to determine if activation of G<sub>i/o</sub> GPCRs can modulate natively expressed TRPM3 channels, we first examined the effects of the prototypical opioid receptor agonist, morphine.</p><p>We used two consecutive applications of a submaximal concentration of pregnenolone sulphate (PS, 20 µM,) to investigate the effect of morphine on TRPM3-mediated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-responses in isolated DRG neurons. This concentration of PS typically activates about 30% of cells in DRG cultures. The first application of PS was used to identify TRPM3 expressing neurons and the second to assess the effects of pharmacological treatments. We refer to the response amplitude of the second PS challenge as R (relative % response). In control experiments, the second PS challenge evoked [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-responses (R) that were 63 ± 2% of the first PS response amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Naloxone (1 µM) inhibited the effect of morphine (10 µM) completely, since the relative amplitude (R) produced by the second PS challenge in the presence of morphine plus naloxone was 73 ± 3% (p&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), very similar to untreated control neurons (R = 64 ± 3%). Thus morphine inhibits TRPM3 by activating an opioid receptor present on DRG neurons.</p><p>The involvement of G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins was investigated using pertussis toxin (PTX), which inhibits the coupling of G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins to their cognate GPCRs by catalysing ADP-ribosylation of the Gα<sub>i/o</sub> subunits. Incubation with PTX (200 ng/ml, for ~2 ½ −18 hr) significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of morphine in a large proportion of the neurons (morphine: R = 16 ± 2%; morphine +PTX: R = 46 ± 2%, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). These findings indicate that activation of a sensory-neuron expressed opioid receptor and subsequent Gα<sub>i/o</sub> protein signalling is able to modulate the activity of TRPM3 channels. Opioid receptors, like many other types of GPCRs, may possess constitutive, agonist independent activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rosenbaum et al., 2009</xref>). We tested whether such tonic receptor activity modulates the activity of endogenously expressed TRPM3 in DRG neurons, using two consecutive challenges of a low concentration of PS (5 µM) that evoked [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-responses in only a small percentage of neurons. In experiments where cells were exposed to naloxone during the second PS challenge the number of responding neurons increased significantly (p&lt;0.001, Fisher’s) from 3.6% (n = 36/999) to 9% (90/999, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). In contrast, the number of PS responders fell from 3.5% (n = 40/1153) to 1.8% (n = 21/1153) in control experiments. These findings indicate that constitutive activity of opioid receptors exerts a tonic inhibition of TRPM3 in DRG neurons.</p><p>We used patch-clamp recordings to confirm that the observed opioid receptor mediated inhibition of PS-evoked [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-responses is associated with a corresponding inhibition of TRPM3 currents in DRG neurons. TRPM3 currents have a marked outward rectification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>) and we therefore studied neurons at a holding potential of +40 mV. Application of PS (50 µM) rapidly evoked membrane currents in a subset of isolated DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Subsequent introduction of morphine (10 µM) in the continued presence of PS produced a rapid, near-complete and reversible inhibition of the PS-evoked current. We next examined the effect of morphine on PS-evoked currents in CHO cells co-expressing TRPM3 and the µ opioid receptor. PS evoked large currents that were reversibly inhibited by co-application of morphine (inhibition 89 ± 4%, n = 9). Examination of the current-voltage relationships before and during PS application and in the presence of morphine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>) showed that the response to PS was greatly inhibited by morphine at all voltages studied.</p><p>Morphine is a non-selective opioid receptor agonist and DRG neurons express all three naloxone-sensitive opioid receptor subtypes (µ, δ and κ). We examined the effects of sub-type selective opioid receptor agonists on PS-evoked [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses of DRG neurons, to determine which receptor subtype is important for morphine-induced inhibition of TRPM3. Treatment with the selective κ opioid receptor agonist U50488 (20 nM), did not inhibit PS-induced responses and instead produced a modest, but significant increase (U50488: R = 72 ± 3%; control: R = 57 ± 3%, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The δ opioid receptor agonist SB205607 (20 nM) was without effect (SB205607: R = 52 ± 3%; p&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), whereas the μ opioid receptor agonist DAMGO (20 nM) significantly inhibited PS-evoked [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-responses to an extent similar to that previously observed with morphine (DAMGO: R = 18 ± 2%, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). These findings indicate that morphine predominantly inhibits TRPM3 by activating μ opioid receptors and suggest a high degree of co-expression of μ opioid receptors and TRPM3. These results are in keeping with earlier observations of μ (but not δ) opioid receptor expression in heat nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scherrer et al., 2009</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26138.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Activation of μ-opioid receptors inhibits TRPM3.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Effect of the selective μ opioid receptor agonist DAMGO, δ opioid receptor agonist SB205607 and κ opioid receptor agonist U50488 (each at 20 nM) on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-responses evoked by PS (20 µM, second application, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for protocol). *p&lt;0.05, ***p&lt;0.001; Kruskal-Wallis (control, n = 152; DAMGO, n = 184; SB205607, n = 200; U50488, n = 140).

The Y1 receptor is predominantly expressed in small diameter neurons whereas the Y2 receptor is largely expressed in medium and large diameter neurons. We examined whether activation of NPY receptors by the agonist peptide YY (PYY) was able to modulate neuronal TRPM3 [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-responses. Similarly to the effects of morphine and baclofen, application of 100 nM PYY reduced the PS-evoked [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses, and in 57% (n = 123/217) of neurons abolished the evoked increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (R &lt; 5%). The relative amplitude of the second PS-evoked [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses was reduced from 66 ± 3% in control experiments to 11 ± 1% in the presence of PYY (p&lt;0.001). Like opioid receptors, Y2 receptors have been reported to possess constitutive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2000</xref>) and we therefore examined whether tonic Y2 receptor activity modulates TRPM3. In experiments where we challenged neurons with two consecutive applications of a low concentration of PS (5 µM), treatment with the selective Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE 0246 (10µM) significantly (p&lt;0.05, Fisher’s) increased the number of responding neurons from 1.1% (n = 5/450) to 4.2% (19/450; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). In contrast, the number of PS responders fell from 3.4% (n = 15/440) to 1.8% (n = 8/440) in control experiments with two applications of 5 µM PS. These findings indicate that constitutive activity of Y2 receptors can exert a tonic inhibition of TRPM3.</p><p>To examine whether opioids, baclofen and PYY target distinct populations of TRPM3-expressing neurons, neurons were sequentially exposed to morphine (10 µM), baclofen (100 µM) and PYY (100 nM) and challenged with PS (20 µM) in the presence and absence of these drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f–h</xref>). A large proportion of PS-sensitive neurons (43%, n = 91/210) were inhibited (response amplitude &lt;15% of first PS response amplitude) by all three agonists. A population of neurons was inhibited by morphine and baclofen but not PYY (7%, n = 14/210) and a slightly larger percentage of neurons was inhibited by morphine and PYY but not baclofen (13%, n = 27/210). Moreover, 10% (n = 21/210) of neurons were inhibited by baclofen and PYY but not morphine. Small populations of neurons were inhibited by just one agonist (morphine, 7%, n = 15/210; baclofen, 4%, n = 9/210; PYY, 4%, n = 9/210) and a subpopulation of neurons were not inhibited by any of the agonists (15%, n = 31/210). These findings, which are illustrated schematically in the Venn diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>), indicate that morphine, baclofen and PYY target overlapping populations of TRPM3-expressing neurons.</p><p>Additional experiments demonstrated that not all G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled receptors are able to effectively modulate TRPM3 activity. L-AP4 (5 µM) activation of group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGLUR<sub>4/6/7/8</sub>), which are expressed by DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlton and Hargett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Govea et al., 2012</xref>), had no significant effect on PS-evoked [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>I</sub> responses (R = 69 ± 3%, n = 100) compared to control (R = 61 ± 7%, n = 20; p&gt;0.05, Mann-Whitney U test).

The CB1 receptor agonist WIN 55212–2 (1 µM) slightly but significantly reduced the amplitude of PS evoked [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses (R = 51 ± 3%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) compared to control (R = 62 ± 2%; p&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). This finding suggested that application of WIN 55212–2 inhibited PS-evoked responses in some but not in all DRG neurons. This was confirmed when DRG neurons were challenged with 3 applications of 20 µM PS with 1 µM WIN 552212–2 present before and during the second application and 1 µM WIN 55212–2 plus 0.5 µM AM251 (a CB1 receptor antagonist) present during the third PS application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). This experimental protocol allowed for detection of neurons whose PS evoked responses were inhibited by WIN 55212–2, and were restored when a CB1 antagonist (AM251) was co-applied with WIN 55212–2. In many DRG neurons, WIN 55212–2 had no obvious inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, top), but a small percentage of neurons (5%, n = 8/156) showed an AM251-reversible WIN 552212–2 inhibition of the PS response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, bottom). In view of the minor effect of CB1 receptor activation on DRG TRPM3 PS responses, we repeated the experiments in TRPM3 CHO cells transiently transfected with the CB1 receptor. As not all cells expressed CB1 after transfection, we compared the population responses to two consecutive PS applications. PS responses to the two PS applications were relatively stable in control cells not transfected with CB1, whereas WIN 552212–2 inhibited the PS responses in a sub-population of CB1 transfected cells. Furthermore, the second PS response of CB1 transfected cells was augmented by AM251 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,d</xref>). These results suggest that CB1 receptors can regulate TRPM3 but that there is either little co-expression of TRPM3 and CB1 in DRG neurons or ineffective coupling.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26138.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>CB1 activation can inhibit TRPM3 channels.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Effect of CB1 receptor agonist WIN 55212–2 (1 µM) on DRG [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-responses evoked by PS (20 µM, second application). ***p&lt;0.001; Mann-Whitney U test (control, n = 213; WIN 55212–2, n = 218).

As these ligands augmented TRPM3 activity in DRG neurons in vitro, we examined if they would increase the nociceptive effects of TRPM3 agonists. For these studies we used intraplantar injection of PS alone, which evoked relatively mild behavioural responses.

Studies of TRPM3 have been facilitated by the discovery of PS and the synthetic compound CIM0216 as TRPM3 agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Held et al., 2015</xref>) that can be used to probe the functions and characteristics of TRPM3, and we have utilised these compounds to investigate the regulation of TRPM3 channels by GPCR ligands. Like other TRP channels, TRPM3 activity is regulated by intracellular PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and other phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badheka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tóth et al., 2015</xref>) but otherwise little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the activity of this channel. Other sensory neuron TRP channels, notably TRPV1 and TRPA1, are regulated downstream of GPCR signalling by mechanisms that involve either G<sub>q</sub> activation, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis and protein kinase C or G<sub>s</sub> activation leading to protein kinase A mediated phosphorylation. These and other phosphorylation pathways are important regulatory mechanisms for TRP channels particularly in inflammatory conditions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veldhuis et al., 2015</xref> for review). Activation of the G<sub>i</sub> coupled µ opioid receptor is a potent analgesic mechanism in sensory systems and opioid agonists such as morphine can inhibit TRPV1 activity by reducing phosphorylation levels; however, this is evident only when TRPV1 is sensitized via the cAMP-PKA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Endres-Becker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vetter et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2008</xref>). This latter observation is consistent with our observation that morphine has little or no inhibitory effect on capsaicin evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses when desensitization is blocked by cyclosporin.</p><p>Our results demonstrate for the first time that agonists acting at several G<sub>i</sub> coupled GPCRs (µ opioid, GABA-B and NPY receptors) exert an inhibitory effect on TRPM3 activation in DRG neurons. This inhibitory effect was PTX-sensitive demonstrating a G<sub>i/o</sub> protein involvement. The inhibition was not, however, mediated by the canonical Gα subunit/adenylate cyclase pathway as the inhibitory effect was not abrogated by either application of the Gα subunit inhibitor NF023 or by providing a membrane permeable cAMP analogue that is well known to activate PKA. Instead, our results indicate that the TRPM3 inhibition is mediated by Gβγ subunits. The Gα<sub>i</sub> inhibitor NF023, which inhibits Gα<sub>i</sub> subunit interactions with effector molecules, was without effect when dialysed into cells at 100 µM which is higher than its IC<sub>50</sub> value (~300–400 nM). However, Gα subunits bind to effector molecules with picomolar to nanomolar affinities and the effectiveness of NF023 will depend on its relative binding affinity for Gα<sub>i</sub> compared to that of the effector molecules. We therefore cannot be certain that NF023 effectively inhibits Gα<sub>i</sub> signalling even at the concentration used. In contrast, we have clear evidence for a role for Gβγ subunits.</p><p>The inhibitory effects of morphine on TRPM3 were reversed by gallein, which is generally considered to be a specific inhibitor of Gβγ signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin and Smrcka, 2011</xref>), although we cannot exclude a non-Gβγ ‘off target’ effect. Critically, we found that PS evoked currents were inhibited by direct application of purified Gβγ subunits to either whole cells or excised inside-out membrane patches, without concomitant activation of Gα<sub>i</sub> or G-protein-coupled receptors. The effect of the Gβγ subunits was lost after heat inactivation indicating that proteins in the sample were responsible for the inhibitory activity. Our findings are therefore consistent with activation of a µ opioid receptor and an action of Gβγ subunits to inhibit TRPM3. A direct interaction between the released Gβγ subunits and TRPM3 is likely as found for some other ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elbrønd-Bek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veldhuis et al., 2015</xref>). Gβγ subunits can, however, activate other molecules such as phospholipase C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rebecchi and Pentyala, 2000</xref>), and such an action would hydrolyse PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and reduce TRPM3 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badheka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tóth et al., 2015</xref>). Inhibition of TRPM3 activity could therefore be due to a Gβγ/PLCmediated loss of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels are not maintained in isolated membrane patches and decline rapidly especially in the absence of Mg-ATP, which is required for phosphoinositide kinase mediated generation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zakharian et al., 2011</xref>). This loss of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, accounts for the greatly reduced TRPM3 channel activity previously reported in excised membrane patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badheka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tóth et al., 2015</xref>). In our excised inside-out patch experiments, recordings were made minutes after excision into Mg-ATP free solution, which will deplete PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and no further run down of channel activity was noted during the recordings. The finding that Gβγ subunits exerted a robust inhibitory effect on TRPM3 currents in membrane patches in these conditions suggests that the Gβγ inhibition does not involve PLC mediated hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Such a conclusion is further supported by the observations in DRG Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments where, in contrast to TRPM3, TRPV1 responses were not affected by morphine. As the activities of both channels are modulated by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badheka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2013</xref>), the differential, strong inhibition of TRPM3 cannot be explained by PLC activation and a reduction in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Direct effects of G protein subunits on ion channel functions have been well studied for P/Q- and N-type voltage gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dolphin, 2003</xref>) and Kir channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dascal, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamada et al., 1998</xref>). In contrast, there is relatively little knowledge of direct G protein subunit - TRP channel interactions. TRPM1 channels are inhibited by activation of G<sub>o</sub>–linked GPCRs and the available evidence is consistent with regulation by interactions direct between TRPM1 and both Gαο and Gβγ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Devi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koike et al., 2010</xref>). In other studies, TRPM8 was shown to be inhibited by an interaction with Gα<sub>q</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li and Zhang, 2013</xref>) while TRPA1 activation following stimulation of MrgprA3 receptors in DRG neurons was inhibited by gallein and phosducin, consistent with a Gβγ mediated mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>). TRP channel regulation by direct G protein subunit interactions is therefore emerging as an important and novel mechanistic concept.</p><p>DRG neurons showed differential sensitivity to activation of different GPCRs. The TRPM3 responses in many neurons were inhibited by more than one GPCR agonist consistent with expression of multiple GPCRs in these neurons. Presumably the inhibition pattern reflects the distribution and expression levels of the different GPCRs. However, not all G<sub>i/o</sub> GPCR agonists inhibited TRPM3. The group III mGluR agonist, L-AP4, and agonists at δ- and κ-opioid receptors did not significantly inhibit TRPM3 responses although there is good evidence for their expression in DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scherrer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlton and Hargett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Govea et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Honsek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). In part this could be explained by lack of TRPM3-GPCR co-expression in individual DRG neurons. For example, δ-opioid receptors are expressed by about 15% of, mainly larger diameter, DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scherrer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bardoni et al., 2014</xref>) although there is evidence for some co-expression of μ- and δ-opioid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Devi et al., 2013</xref>), There is also likely to be an overlap in expression of G<sub>i/o</sub> –coupled metabotropic glutamate GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlton and Hargett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Govea et al., 2012</xref>) with the small-medium diameter DRG neurons that express TRPM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>). A significant inhibition of TRPM3 responses would therefore be expected in some DRG neurons, as seen for CB1 receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Veress et al., 2013</xref>). The effect of CB1 receptor activation in DRG neurons was restricted to a small number of neurons, although our experiments with heterologously expressed TRPM3 and CB1 indicated that CB1 receptor activity can regulate TRPM3. It is possible that specific macromolecular assemblies are required for the efficient interaction between types of GPCRs and TRPM3 and that δ- and κ-opioid and mGluR receptors do not contribute to these complexes, and that CB1 receptors are variably coupled in DRG neurons. The pronounced inhibition of TRPM3 by µ-opioid receptor activation is interesting as this receptor sub-type is expressed in mice in heat sensitive DRG neurons (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scherrer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Honsek et al., 2015</xref>) and may be functionally relevant for opioid control of heat sensation.</p><p>An interesting additional finding was that while both baclofen and PYY robustly inhibited TRPM3 responses in a substantial percentage of DRG neurons, this inhibitory effect was only partially reversed by gallein. In contrast, gallein strongly reversed the inhibitory effect of morphine on TRPM3. This finding raises the possibility that G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled GPCRs can regulate TRPM3 via several signalling pathways.</p><p>In addition to demonstrating GPCR agonist induced inhibition of TRPM3, our in vitro studies have revealed that inverse agonists that act at µ-opioid and NPY receptors (naloxone and BIIE0246) can potentiate TRPM3 mediated responses. These findings are consistent with the concept that constitutive activity of µ-opioid and NPY receptors provides a level of tonic inhibition of TRPM3. A potentiating effect of these ligands was also noted in vivo, where they potentiated the behavioural effects of local intraplantar injection of PS. This result could reflect an inhibition of constitutive GPCR activity, as suggested by the in vitro findings, or inhibition of endogenous GPCR agonists produced in the tissues. Intraplantar administration of morphine, baclofen or PYY inhibited the strong nociceptive behavioural responses evoked by combined local application of PS and CIM0216. Such a peripheral anti-nociceptive action could be due to an action that inhibits action potential transmission, perhaps by activation of voltage gated potassium channels. However, morphine did not inhibit TRPV1-mediated, capsaicin-evoked pain responses so a general inhibitory action of morphine on the transmission of nociceptive signals can be ruled out. The inhibition of TRPM3-mediated nociceptive responses by the GPCR agonists can therefore be correlated to TRPM3 inhibition. Our results demonstrate that GPCR modulation of TRPM3 occurs in vivo and that the effects are localized to the regions of sensory nerve terminals rather than systemic effects operating at the level of the spinal cord or higher centres in the nociception pathway.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that TRPM3 in sensory neurons is subject to G<sub>i/o</sub> GPCR regulation via a Gβγ subunit action. Activation of µ-opioid and GABA-B receptors are important analgesic mechanisms that operate both peripherally and centrally, including actions on the central terminals of sensory nerves in the spinal dorsal horn. Given the co-expression of TRPM3 and these GPCRs in nociceptive sensory neurons and the emerging role of TRPM3 in nociception, our findings highlight the importance of determining the role of TRPM3 in pathophysiological pain conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>DRG neurons were prepared from adult male or female C57Bl/6J mice using methods described previously<sup>48</sup>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Voets (Reviewer #1); László Csanády (Reviewer #2); and Alexander Chesler (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript is one of three that reports exciting new findings on the mechanism of inhibition of TRPM3 channel activity in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons by stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Although all three manuscripts received favorable reviews, the essential revisions will require different amounts of time to address, and we encourage the authors to coordinate submission of their revised manuscripts.</p><p>The general conclusion of this manuscript is that TRPM3 channel currents are directly inhibited by G-β-γ subunits released upon stimulation of various GPCRs coupled to heterotrimeric Gi/o proteins, and this inhibition is independent of any effects on cAMP concentrations. The majority of experiments reflect Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging on dissociated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, except for a few whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, and some behavioral experiments in live animals. This study was less mechanistically oriented than the companion submissions by two other groups, and some conclusions rely on faith in generally accepted phenomena. These include the potential effects on PIP2 levels that are not directly addressed (the assumption is that those remain unaffected by the Gi/o pathway), and the involvement of G-α is excluded simply based on the lack of effect of a known G-α inhibitor. On the other hand, the results of this study complement those of the co-submissions in several ways:</p><p>i) TRPM3 inhibition through a different subset of GPCRs present in DRG neurons is investigated here. Stimulation of opioid μ,GABA-B, neuropeptide Y, and cannabinoid CB1 receptors are shown to inhibit TRPM3 currents in subpopulations of DRG neurons.</p><p>ii) Stimulation of submaximally activated TRPM3 channels by inverse agonists of either opioid μ or NPY receptors suggests some tonic inhibition of TRPM3 currents by constitutive activity of these GPCRs (or perhaps the presence of low levels of endogenous ligands). The relevance of this tonic inhibition is also demonstrated through in vivo experiments that show increased sensitivity to TRPM3 agonist-induced pain in the presence of opioid μ or NPY receptor blockers.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) What is missing in this manuscript is an indication of the selectivity of the receptor activation towards TRPM3-dependent pain signals. To correlate the reduced pain response in the presence of morphine or baclofen to the inhibition of TRPM3 function, it is essential to show that other TRPM3-independent pain responses are not affected. This would involve demonstration that neuronal calcium signals and pain evoked by e.g. capsaicin or mechanical stimuli are not affected by these agonists.</p><p>2) This study would be greatly strengthened if the authors showed that activation of one of their GPCRs could inhibit TRPM3 currents in HEK cells. It would also be good to demonstrate that G-β/γ applied to inside out patches can inhibit TRPM3 to strengthen the claim of a direct interaction with the channel. It is also not clear what the control condition is for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G-H</xref>, but ideally it would be boiled GBG protein.</p><p>3) To fully evaluate the quality and robustness of calcium imaging data it is helpful to have representative images as well as traces. This would allow the reader to appreciate the density and health of the cells and neurons as well as the robustness of the responses. Also, glia vs. neurons in the culture should not be highlighted. Absence of KCl response is a poor proxy for glial identification – if this is the only criteria, then calling those cells KCl-negative cells is more appropriate.</p><p>4) The scatter of data used to generate bar graphs is unclear. These should be included on all summary plots throughout the manuscript to provide a better sense of the effect size and variability. The number of tested cells is quite low for the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F-H</xref>, so it is unclear how significant and representative the derived percentages are. The authors should also provide information on how many neurons responded to PS and what percentage of them are inhibited by Gi/o agonists?</p><p>5) There are no positive controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Since these are all negative findings, it is difficult for the reader to appreciate how well the pharmacological manipulations are working.</p><p>6) Gallein is known to inhibit other targets, the short comings of this drug should at least be discussed, and it would be ideal if orthogonal approaches to interfere with GBG signaling were added to strengthen the findings (such as PTX or BARK-ct).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26138.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) What is missing in this manuscript is an indication of the selectivity of the receptor activation towards TRPM3-dependent pain signals.

This would involve demonstration that neuronal calcium signals and pain evoked by e.g. capsaicin or mechanical stimuli are not affected by these agonists.</italic> </p><p>We have added experiments examining the effects of morphine on capsaicin-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in DRG neurons and capsaicin-evoked pain responses in vivo. For the former experiments we used conditions where TRPV1 desensitization was greatly reduced by the presence of cyclosporin to inhibit calcineurin. Under these conditions, morphine did not inhibit TRPV1 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In vivo, morphine did not affect the nocifensive, behavioural responses (licking/flinching) evoked by local intraplantar injection of capsaicin (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). The inhibitory effect of morphine on licking/flinching evoked by the TRPM3 agonists therefore correlates with inhibition of TRPM3 activity rather than a general inhibition of sensory neuron responses.</p><p><italic>2) This study would be greatly strengthened if the authors showed that activation of one of their GPCRs could inhibit TRPM3 currents in HEK cells. It would also be good to demonstrate that G-β/γ applied to inside out patches can inhibit TRPM3 to strengthen the claim of a direct interaction with the channel.

These results complement the whole cell experiments in the original submission. G-β/γ subunits inhibited CIM0216 currents in the excised membrane patches by ~50% similar to the inhibition noted in whole cell experiments. As a control we used heat inactivated (boiled) G-β/γ subunits as suggested. The latter had no inhibitory effect on the CIM0216 evoked currents in inside-out membrane patches.</p><p><italic>3) To fully evaluate the quality and robustness of calcium imaging data it is helpful to have representative images as well as traces. This would allow the reader to appreciate the density and health of the cells and neurons as well as the robustness of the responses. Also, glia vs. neurons in the culture should not be highlighted. Absence of KCl response is a poor proxy for glial identification – if this is the only criteria, then calling those cells KCl<sup>-</sup>negative cells is more appropriate.</italic> </p><p>We have added representative images of the cells and Fura-2 fluorescence signals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> to provide the requested information on the density of cells in the preparation. The term glia was not used in the original manuscript and we made no comment about non-neuronal cells. We do not believe that there are any non-neuronal cells in our preparation that will respond to a high K<sup>+</sup> solution with a robust increase in intracellular calcium concentration. However, we have replaced the term ‘neuron’ with ‘cells’ in many places as a positive response to the reviewers’ comment.</p><p><italic>4) The scatter of data used to generate bar graphs is unclear. These should be included on all summary plots throughout the manuscript to provide a better sense of the effect size and variability. The number of tested cells is quite low for the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F-H</xref>, so it is unclear how significant and representative the derived percentages are. The authors should also provide information on how many neurons responded to PS and what percentage of them are inhibited by Gi/o agonists?</italic> </p><p>We have replaced the bar graphs with box and whisker plots and show all data points for all experiments. Data from additional experiments have now been added to the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F-H</xref> data set increasing the number of PS-/KCl-responsive cells to 210. We believe that this gives a more accurate account of the percentages of cells affected by the various agonists. The results are also now summarized in Venn diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) There are no positive controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Since these are all negative findings, it is difficult for the reader to appreciate how well the pharmacological manipulations are working.</italic> </p><p>The ability of 8-bromo-cAMP to stimulate PKA has been well established in numerous published experiments and one of the authors has published showing that it affects histamine evoked DRG Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses at the concentration used in the current experiment (Nicolson TA, Foster AF, Bevan S, Richards CD. 2007 Prostaglandin E2 sensitizes primary sensory neurons to histamine. Neuroscience. 150:22-30). We have not therefore added experimental data on the ability of this compound to stimulate cAMP pathways.</p><p>We acknowledge that the action of NF023 in experiments in the original submission was questionable as the compound was applied to intact cells in calcium imaging experiments. Although the compound has been reported to affect intact cells, we believe that it will not cross the plasma membrane easily. We have therefore now included experiments where it is included in the pipette solution at a high concentration (100µM) in whole cell recordings experiments on TRPM3-expressing CHO cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This concentration of NF023 is higher than its reported IC50 value (300-400nM). The compound had no effect on morphine inhibition. In the absence of a direct positive control for the activity of the compound we have added a caveat about interpretation of the negative result and state in the Discussion ‘We therefore cannot be certain that NF023 effectively inhibits Gαi signalling even at the concentration used.’</p><p><italic>6) Gallein is known to inhibit other targets, the short comings of this drug should at least be discussed, and it would be ideal if orthogonal approaches to interfere with GBG signaling were added to strengthen the findings (such as PTX or BARK-ct).</italic></p><p>Experiments showing that PTX inhibits the effect of morphine were included in the study. We have made the wording slightly more prominent to emphasize this.</p><p>We have also added a caveat that gallein could have ‘off target’ non-G-β/γ subunit effects. This comment could probably be applied to almost any inhibitor used. We could not find published data that gallein inhibited other targets other than those where the effects were interpreted as being via a G-β/γ pathway. We would appreciate any information from the reviewers on this point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
