A new pathway controlling PP2A activity in mitosis has been recently described. This pathway includes the Greatwall (GWL) kinase and its substrates endosulfines. At mitotic entry, GWL is activated and phosphorylates endosulfines that then bind and inhibit PP2A. We analysed whether GWL overexpression could participate in cancer development. We show that GWL overexpression promotes cell transformation and increases invasive capacities of cells through hyperphosphorylation of the oncogenic kinase AKT. Interestingly, AKT hyperphosphorylation induced by GWL is independent of endosulfines. Rather, GWL induces GSK3 kinase dephosphorylation in its inhibitory sites and subsequent SCF-dependent degradation of the PHLPP phosphatase responsible for AKT dephosphorylation. In line with its oncogenic activity, we find that GWL is often overexpressed in human colorectal tumoral tissues. Thus, GWL is a human oncoprotein that promotes the hyperactivation of AKT via the degradation of its phosphatase, PHLPP, in human malignancies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10115.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10115.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10115.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In order to form a tumour, cancer cells have to overcome the controls that normally prevent cells from dividing too often. These controls include an enzyme called PP2A, which inhibits cell division by regulating the activity of other proteins. In a normal cell, PP2A may be temporarily deactivated from time to time to enable the cell to divide. However, PP2A is permanently deactivated in many cancer cells, which allows these cells to divide many times in quick succession.</p><p>A protein called Greatwall is involved in deactivating PP2A in healthy cells, but it was not clear whether increases in Greatwall activity can promote the formation of tumours. Here, Vera et al. use a variety of cell biology techniques to address this question. The experiments show that increasing the amount of Greatwall in human and mouse cells can promote some of the transformations needed for these cells to become cancerous. Also, Greatwall increases the growth of tumours in mice. These effects are caused by the over-activation of a protein called AKT, which is already known to promote the formation of many cancers.</p><p>Vera et al. show that Greatwall regulates AKT activity using a different pathway to how it influences PP2A activity. Further experiments revealed that many human tumours, especially those from patients with colon cancer, produce excessive amounts of Greatwall protein. Together, these findings show that Greatwall can promote the development of cancer. A future challenge is to understand how this works and to find out whether high levels of Greatwall are a common feature of other human cancers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10115.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10115.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Greatwall</kwd><kwd>Akt</kwd><kwd>PHLPP</kwd><kwd>oncogene</kwd><kwd>PP2A</kwd><kwd>cell invasion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-BLAN-1207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castro</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPF20111223514</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vera</surname><given-names>Jorge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LNCC LORCA 2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lorca</surname><given-names>Thierry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Greatwall is a new oncogene that induces AKT hyperphosphorylation by promoting the degradation of the phosphatase PHLPP.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Greatwall (GWL) kinase was originally identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> where it was first proposed to be involved in the control of mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yu, 2004</xref>). Biochemical experiments in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts demonstrated that during mitosis GWL is required to inhibit the protein phosphatase 2A complexed to B55 regulatory subunit (PP2AB55), a phosphatase that dephosphorylates cyclinB-cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castilho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vigneron et al., 2009</xref>). However, PP2AB55 inhibition by GWL is not direct, but through phosphorylation of the two endosulfines ARPP19 and ENSA that once phosphorylated bind and inhibit PP2AB55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gharbi-Ayachi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mochida et al., 2010</xref>). The mammalian orthologue of GWL, originally named Microtubule-Associated Serine Threonine Kinase Like (MASTL), is also involved in the control of mitotic division. <italic>MASTL</italic> silencing in human cells and knockout in mice increase PP2AB55 activation and decrease phosphorylation of cyclinB-CDK1 substrates leading to important mitotic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez-Fernandez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgess et al., 2010</xref>). GWL kinase activity is tightly regulated during mitotic division by phosphorylation at the C terminus and the T-loop domains, possibly by cyclinB-CDK1 and the <italic>Xenopus</italic> orthologue of the Polo-like kinase (PLX1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blake-Hodek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vigneron et al., 2011</xref>). Unlike the regulation of its kinase activity, nothing is known about the mechanisms controlling GWL protein levels.</p><p>PP2A is one of the main serine-threonine phosphatases involved in the control of multiple cellular signalling pathways in mammalian cells. This holoenzyme comprises three subunits: a catalytic subunit (PP2AC, or C subunit), a scaffolding subunit (PP2AA, or A subunit) and a regulatory subunit (PP2AB, or B subunit) that is responsible for substrate specificity. This assembly complexity is crucial for PP2A large substrate repertoire and wide diversity of physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janssens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Virshup and Shenolikar, 2009</xref>). Several PP2A holoenzymes are considered to be tumour suppressors and are functionally inactivated in cancer. Loss of activity of distinct PP2A holocomplexes mediates oncogenesis by activating different signalling pathways, including the kinases AKT and mitotic-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrabi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 2006</xref>). Particularly, PP2AB55 deregulation has been observed in breast, prostate, and colon cancers. Moreover, deletions in <italic>PPP2R2A</italic> (gene encoding B55α isoform) are frequently detected in prostate and breast tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Curtis et al., 2012</xref>) and the promoter silencing of <italic>PPP2R2B</italic> (gene encoding B55β isoform) has been found in colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yasutis et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Several oncogenic pathways are regulated by B55. The B55α subunit participates in the regulation of the RAS-RAF-MAPK signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ory et al., 2003</xref>) and controls MAPK signalling via direct dephosphorylation of the inhibitory phosphorylation site (Ser<sup>259</sup>) of RAF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2005</xref>). In FL5.12 pro-lymphoid cells, PP2AB55α directly associates with AKT and promotes dephosphorylation of AKT-activating residue (Thr<sup>308</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kuo et al., 2008</xref>). B55β binds to phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and modulates its activity towards MYC phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tan et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, B55γ can negatively regulate c-Src activity through dephosphorylation of Ser12, a residue required for c-Jun N-terminal <italic>Kinase</italic> (JNK) activation by c-Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eichhorn et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>As GWL-dependent phosphorylation of ARPP19 and ENSA promotes their binding to and inhibition of PP2AB55, we analysed whether GWL participates in cell transformation and cancer development through inhibition of PP2AB55 tumour suppressor activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GWL overexpression promotes transformation of immortalised mammary gland cells and primary human fibroblast</title><p>We asked whether GWL overexpression could promote transformation of immortalised non-transformed mammary gland cells. To this aim, we stably overexpressed pMXs-based constructs encoding wild type (WT), hyperactive kinase (K72M) or kinase dead (G44S) GWL or with empty vector (CT) into MCF10A cells, and we compared their proliferative and transforming capacities to those observed in MCF10A overexpressing the V12Ras oncogene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Stably overexpressed V12Ras and WT and K72M GWL forms are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. The levels of these three ectopic proteins are similar, although we often observed a lower expression of the hyperactive form of GWL. Increased expression of WT and K72M GWL forms significantly raised cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), reduced cell contact inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and promoted anchorage independent-cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) compared to control cells (CT), although in a lesser extent than V12Ras overexpression. Interestingly, overexpression of G44S GWL induced cell death probably by acting as a dominant negative since when the levels of WT GWL were increased concomitantly with those of a G44S GWL no effect on cell viability was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar results were obtained in NIH3T3.

Overexpression of WT GWL did not overtly affect the cell phenotype. Conversely, overexpression of K72M GWL led to accumulation of cells with a double DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, FACs profile) and cell senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, β-galactosidase staining), a characteristic feature of activated oncogene overexpression in cultured primary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lowe et al., 2004</xref>). As it has been reported that human fibroblast transformation by some oncogenes, such as Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Land et al., 1983</xref>), requires cell immortalisation and inhibition of the p53 pathway, we then overexpressed WT and K72M GWL in human fibroblasts immortalised by overexpression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and SV40 large T antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As expected, accumulation of cells with double DNA content arrest was no longer observed in K72M GWL overexpressing cells. Moreover, proliferation of fibroblasts expressing WT or K72M GWL strongly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) to levels comparable to those induced by the V12-Ras oncogene and anchorage-independent growth was promoted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), demonstrating that GWL has transforming capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>GWL overexpression is involved in the invasive behaviour of colon and mammary tumour cell lines</title><p>Based on these results, we first decided to investigate the role of GWL in the aggressive behaviour of breast cell lines. We chose MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231-D3H2LN (D3H2LN) breast cancer cell lines. These cells present similar genetic background (D3H2LN coming from MDA-MB-231 cells) but different metastatic potential (D3H2LN: high metastatic clone of MDA-MB-231 selected by subcutaneous mouse xenograft). As expected, D3H2LN cells presented increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion than MDA-MB-231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, CT versus D3H2LN). Interestingly, the former cells also displayed higher GWL expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> upper panels). To test whether the different invasive behaviour of these cell lines could be mediated by GWL overexpression, we stably overexpressed WT, K72M, and G44S GWL in MDA-MB-231 cells (displaying low endogenous GWL levels and metastatic capacity) and knocked down GWL by shRNA in D3H2LN cells (presenting high endogenous GWL levels and metastatic capacity). Overexpression of WT and particularly K72M GWL in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly increased cell proliferation, invasion, and migration to reach similar levels than D3H2LN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Conversely, unlike its negative effect on cell viability in NIH3T3 and MCF10A cells, overexpression of G44S GWL did not affect cell behaviour in MDA-MB-231 cells probably due to the fact that they display higher endogenous GWL levels.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10115.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>GWL overexpression is involved in the invasive behaviour of mammary tumour cell lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with empty pMXs vector (CT) or with plasmids coding for the indicated GWL proteins.

Our results show a decrease of the phosphorylation of the inhibitory sites of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) (S9/S21) in both GWL overexpressing MDA-MB-231 and SW480 cells as well as an increase of the phosphorylation of AKT on S473. Moreover, AKT phosphorylation on S473 was significantly reduced in <italic>GWL</italic> knockdown D3H2LN and SW620 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). No difference in AKT phosphorylation at T308 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We confirmed the effect of GWL on AKT phosphorylation at S473 by Western blot analysis in these cells and in NIH3T3, HeLa, MCF10A cells, and primary human fibroblasts. AKT phosphorylation on S473 was significantly increased in all these cell lines when WT or K72M GWL were overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), whereas no effect was observed when the kinase dead form was used. Conversely, S473 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in SW620 and D3H2LN cells that stably express the <italic>GWL</italic> shRNA compared to cells expressing SH LUC. These results suggest that GWL overexpression could promote the oncogenic properties of these cells by increasing AKT phosphorylation at S473.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of the AKT inhibitor VIII on proliferation, migration, and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells and on anchorage-independent cell growth of MCF10A cells. First, by performing a dose-response analysis, we found that 1 μM was the highest dose of inhibitor that did not significantly affect cell proliferation in parental MDA-MB-231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Then, we assessed the effect of this dose on phosphorylation on S473 of AKT, cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and anchorage-independent growth in cells overexpressing WT GWL or an empty pMXs vector (CT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). As expected, 1 μM of AKT inhibitor did not have any effect in MDA-MB231 control cells. Conversely, in GWL overexpressing cells AKT phosphorylation was reduced and cell proliferation, invasion, and migration significantly decreased to levels close or equal to those observed in controls. Moreover, inhibitor VIII also strongly reduced the capacity of GWL-overexpressing MCF10A cells to grow in soft agar. We obtained similar results in SW480 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and confirmed them with another AKT inhibitor (MK2206) in MDA-MB-231 and MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, we did not observe any effect on S473 AKT phosphorylation or cell proliferation in MDA-MB-231 GWL overexpressed cells when other kinase controlling cell proliferation such as MEK was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10115.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>GWL activation promotes increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through AKT phosphorylation at S473.</title><p>(<bold>A-C</bold>) MDA-MB-231 cells that stably overexpress GWL or not (CT) were plated and 4 hr later supplemented with a medium containing 1 μM of the AKT Inhibitor VIII.

Previous results from our laboratory showed that GWL inhibits PP2AB55 through phosphorylation of its inhibitors ARPP19 and ENSA at mitotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gharbi-Ayachi et al., 2010</xref>). We thus tested whether GWL induced AKT phosphorylation at S473 through ARPP19/ENSA-dependent inhibition of PP2AB55 by stably overexpressing ARPP19 and ENSA (WT and the respective S62A and S67A mutants that cannot be phosphorylated by GWL) in MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Cell proliferation was increased following WT ARPP19 overexpression, although significantly less than following overexpression of WT or K72M GWL. Conversely, proliferation was not affected by overexpression of S62A ARPP19, indicating that increased proliferation induced by WT ARPP19 overexpression is dependent on the binding and inhibition of PP2AB55. No change in cell proliferation was observed upon overexpression of WT or S67A ENSA. Moreover, none of these proteins had any effect on AKT phosphorylation at S473, supporting the hypothesis that AKT activation upon GWL overexpression is not mediated by ARPP19/ENSA-dependent PP2AB55 inhibition.</p><p>We finally tested the putative role of PP2AB55 and PP2AB56 in GWL-induced AKT phosphorylation at S473 by transiently expressing B55 or B56 in control or GWL-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Overexpression of B55 and B56 promoted a significant drop of cell proliferation in both control and GWL-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells without decreasing AKT phosphorylation on S473. This indicates that inhibition of these two phosphatases is not involved in GWL-induced AKT phosphorylation on S473.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>AKT phosphorylation on S473 induced by GWL overexpression is due to a decrease of PHLPP protein levels</title><p>PHLPP is the phosphatase responsible for AKT dephosphorylation on S473 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brognard et al., 2007</xref>). As our data suggest that induction of AKT phosphorylation on S473 by GWL overexpression is the result of decreased dephosphorylation of this site, we tested whether GWL modulate PHLPP protein levels. First, we evaluated endogenous PHLPP in MDA-MB-231, MCF10A and SW480 cells that overexpress WT or the indicated mutants of GWL, ARPP19 or ENSA and in D3H2LN and SW620 treated with control (shLUC) or a GWL shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). PHLPP levels were significantly decreased in MDA-MB-231 cells and were completely undetectable in MCF10A and SW480 cells overexpressing WT or K72M GWL, whereas no effect on the endogenous levels of this phosphatase was observed when either WT or mutant ARPP19 and ENSA were overexpressed. On the contrary, the knockdown of GWL promoted an increase of the levels of this phosphatase. Analysis of PHLPP protein levels in GWL-overexpressing or control MCF10A cells transiently transfected with PHLPP at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hr after addition of cycloheximide indicated that GWL overexpression strongly promoted PHLPP proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). It has been previously reported that PHLPP levels are regulated by a GSK3-dependent phosphorylation of this protein in four different sites followed by SKP1-Cullin-Fbox-βTrCP (SCF-βTrCP)-mediated ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2009</xref>). In order to check whether PHLPP proteolysis induced in GWL overexpressed cells is proteasome dependent, we added the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to the culture media. Under these conditions, PHLPP was accumulated in both CT and GWL overexpressing MCF10A cells, although the accumulation observed in CT cells was far below the one induced in GWL overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We next checked whether this degradation is ubiquitin-dependent. To answer this question we overexpressed a mutant of PHLPP in which the four sites (S847, T851, S867 and S869) phosphorylated by GSK3 were substituted by alanines (PHLPP–S/T4A). This mutant cannot be ubiquitinated by the SCF-βTrCP and is not degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2009</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, PHLPP–S/T4A levels were maintained in both CT and GWL-overexpressing MCF10A cells treated with cycloheximide indicating that GWL overexpression promotes SCF-βTrCP-dependent ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of PHLPP.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10115.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>AKT phosphorylation at S473 in GWL-overexpressing cells is due to increased ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation of PHLPP.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) The levels of endogenous PHLPP and β-tubulin (loading control) were assessed by Western blotting in the indicated cell lines overexpressing GWL (WT and K72M) or not (CT) or the WT or mutant forms of ARPP19 or ENSA and in D3H2LN and SW620 cells treated with a control or a GWL shRNA. (<bold><bold>B</bold></bold>) MCF10A cells that overexpress GWL or the empty vector pMXs (CT) were transiently transfected with PHLPP and 24 hr later supplemented with 40 μg/ml of cycloheximide (CHX) and recovered at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 hr after CHX treatment to check PHLPP levels by Western blotting using anti-PHLPP antibodies.

As phosphorylation of the inhibitory sites of GSK3 is reduced in GWL-overexpressing MDA-MB-231, SW480, and MCF10A cells and increased in D3H2LN and SW620 GWL knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), we tested whether GSK3 inhibition could affect PHLPP levels in GWL-overexpressing cells. As expected, PHLPP protein level was reduced in GWL-overexpressing cells compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, GWL and CT, 0 μM). However, addition of a GSK3 inhibitor (from 2.5 to 10 μM) increased in a dose-dependent manner PHLPP levels in GWL-overexpressing cells but not in control cells. This suggests that PHLPP level reduction in GWL-overexpressing cells is the consequence of increased GSK3 activity that leads to PHLPP ubiquitination and degradation.</p><p>Finally, if AKT hyperactivation in GWL-overexpressing cells is the result of a loss of PHLPP, the ectopic overexpression of this phosphatase should reduce proliferation, invasion and anchorage-independent cell growth in GWL overexpressing cells to levels close to those observed in control cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> show the PHLPP levels present in CT and GWL MCF10A overexpressed cells 24 hr after transient overexpression.

Quantitative analyses confirmed this result, revealing that GWL median intensity fluorescence was increased by 25.6% in the TT samples compared to the NT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).

Our results demonstrate that GWL can promote cell transformation, proliferation and migration/invasion, but independently from the ARPP19/ENSA-PP2AB55 pathway, the only known GWL pathway.</p><p>We show that GWL overexpression promotes cell transformation in two different immortalised cell lines (NIH3T3 and MCF10A). Moreover, like most oncogenes, GWL overexpression induced the senescence checkpoint in primary human fibroblasts and promoted cell proliferation and anchorage-independent cell growth in human fibroblast with high levels of hTERT and large-T antigen of SV40. Besides this cell transforming effect, GWL also promoted the aggressive behaviour of cancer cells. Specifically, GWL increased in a dose-dependent manner the migratory and invasive properties of two colon and two breast cancer cell lines with a similar genetic background. Accordingly, <italic>GWL</italic> knockdown in more aggressive breast and colon cell lines (D3H2LN and SW620 cells, respectively) decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion to levels comparable to those observed in less metastatic cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and SW480). The opposite effect was observed when GWL was overexpressed in the less metastatic cell lines. Finally, we show that GWL levels modulate tumour growth in vivo as well (three-fold increase of tumour size in tumours derived from cancer cells overexpressing GWL and two-fold decrease in tumours obtained from cancer cells in which <italic>GWL</italic> was silenced compared to controls).</p><p>Our study also reveals that the effect of GWL overexpression on cell proliferation, migration and invasion is mostly induced by AKT activation through the phosphorylation of its activating residue S473. Accordingly, S473 phosphorylation was observed in all analysed GWL overexpressing cell lines and AKT inhibition blunted the effects of GWL overexpression.</p><p>However, GWL does not phosphorylate S473 of AKT directly or indirectly by increasing mTORC2 kinase activity because Rictor knockdown had no effect on S473 phosphorylation level in GWL-overexpressing cells. These results indicate that phosphorylation of S473/AKT could be due to an inhibition of the phosphatase(s) responsible for its dephosphorylation. Our findings clearly demonstrate that AKT phosphorylation on S473 is not mediated by inhibition of PP2AB56 or of PP2AB55 through ARPP19/ENSA phosphorylation. Instead, they support the hypothesis that GWL overexpression stimulates the degradation of PHLPP, the phosphatase responsible for AKT dephosphorylation on S473 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2005</xref>). PHLPP levels were significantly reduced in all GWL overexpressing cell lines due to increased ubiquitin and proteasome-dependent degradation. Moreover, PHLPP overexpression completely reversed the phenotype induced by GWL overexpression. To be targeted for proteosomal degradation, PHLPP is first phosphorylated by GSK3 and then ubiquitinated by SCF-βTrCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2009</xref>). We observed a decrease of the phosphorylation levels of the GSK3 inhibitory residues S9/S21 upon GWL overexpression, suggesting that the lower PHLPP levels in GWL overexpressing cells are the result of GSK3 hyperactivation. Accordingly GSK3 inhibition induced a dramatic increase of PHLPP levels in GWL-overexpressing MCF10A cells, whereas no effect was observed in control cells.</p><p>This is the first work showing that GWL has additional roles besides ARPP19/ENSA phosphorylation and PP2AB55 inhibition. Our results suggest that GWL phosphorylates another protein(s) to promote GSK3 activation through dephosphorylation of its inhibitory sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This would result in PHLPP ubiquitination and degradation and in the subsequent increase of AKT phosphorylation on S473 that confers to this protein robust transforming and metastatic capacities. However, the molecular mechanisms by which GWL promotes dephosphorylation of the inhibitory sites of GSK3 need to be further elucidated. In this line, it is known that AKT promotes phosphorylation of GSK3 in S9/S21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2009</xref>), however, GWL overexpressed cells display a hyperactivated AKT but a S9/S21 dephosphorylated GSK3. One possible explanation for this counterintuitive physiological situation is that GWL would mediate dephosphorylation of the inhibitory sites of GSK3 by promoting the hyperactivation of the phosphatase responsible of this dephosphorylation. This would move the balance between phosphorylation of these sites by AKT and dephosphorylation by the phosphatase regulated by GWL towards dephosphorylated and activated GSK3.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10115.025</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model showing the mechanisms by which GWL overexpression promotes AKT hyperphosphorylation and hyperactivation in human cells.</title><p>Black arrows represent pathways favoured by GWL overexpression.Grey arrows represent disfavoured pathways in GWL overexpressed cells.

Most abundant mutations in cancer are frameshifts at positions K390 and K462 (4%), followed by missense mutations (S684L, S715L, S716L or G359D from 2–1%) although the latter ones are mostly distributed in the T-loop insert, in which changes in amino acid sequence do not affect GWL activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vigneron et al., 2011</xref>). Melanomas are the tumour pathologies in which GWL mutations have been most frequently detected (18%) followed by esophageal cancer (15%) and ovarian cancer (9%), however again, most GWL mutations detected in these cancers concern non-coding mutations or mutations at the T-loop fragment. No gain activity mutants have been described so far.

We observed increased GWL levels in most of the tested transformed cell lines and in 56% of the CRC samples analysed. Interestingly, GWL was overexpressed at all tumour stages, suggesting that GWL could be used as a marker of oncogenic transformation. Indeed, our results show that GWL overexpression is enough to promote cell transformation in immortalised and in primary cells, a feature only displayed by powerful oncogenes, such as v-Ras. Besides its transforming capacity, GWL also confers robust invasive capacities to transformed cells. However, the finding that GWL levels are high from early tumour stages indicates that this kinase does not directly participate in metastasis formation/progression, but may instead facilitate the invasive process.</p><p>As far as we know GWL is the first oncogenic mitotic protein with transforming and invasive properties and the overexpression of which directly induces cell transformation in immortalised cells.</p><p>In summary, GWL expression level is increased in many transformed cells and in tumours at all stages. Moreover, it displays robust oncogenic and invasive capacities through a novel oncogenic signalling pathway that involves AKT, a major node in the crosstalk of tumour pathways.

We used GST-ENSA protein as a positive control. Thirty minutes later reactions were stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer and analysed by SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylation of PHLPP or GST-ENSA by GWL was subsequently determined by autoradiography.</p><p>When the activity of the different GWL forms was measured in the corresponding stable cell line, a volume of cell extract corresponding to 400 μg of total protein was used. Immunoprecipitation was then performed as for PHLPP in vitro phosphorylation assays except that anti-GWL antibodies instead of anti-HA were used. 1/5 of the immunoprecipitate was used to measure the levels of the different GWL forms and the rest was used for in vitro phosphorylation as for PHLPP using His-ARPP19 protein as a substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cell invasion, migration and proliferation</title><p>Invasion of MDA-MB-231, D3H2LN and NIH3T3 cells was tested as previously described )<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sanz-Moreno et al., 2008</xref>). Briefly, 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml were suspended in 2 mg/ml of serum-free liquid rat-tail collagen I (Becton Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France) and 100 μl/well were dispensed in black 96-well ViewPlates (PerkinElmer) coated with 0.2% BSA in DMEM supplemented with 1 μl of Fluorobeads (Molecular Probe, Thermo Fisher). Plates were centrifuged at 300 <italic>g for 5 min</italic> and incubated at 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After collagen polymerisation, 2% foetal calf serum (FCS) was added on top of the collagen. Forty-eight hours later, cells were fixed with 20% paraformaldehyde in PBS supplemented with 1 μg/ml Hoechst. Plates were then scanned in a Cellomics ArrayScan VTI HCS Reader (Thermo Scientific, Thermo Fisher) and cells located at 25–50 μm from the bottom were counted.</p><p>Migration of MDA-MB-231, D3H2LN and NIH3T3 cells was tested by using wound-healing assays. Cells were seeded in 35 mm culture-insert microdishes (Ibidi, Nanterre, France) until confluence. Inserts were then removed and cells were followed by time-lapse microscopy (Invers1 Zeiss Axiovert 200M) for 24 hr. Bright-field images were taken every 30 min. The area without cells between the cell surfaces was calculated for each frame and the covered surface between the initial and the current frame was quantified and represented. Finally, the trendline equation was extrapolated and the covered surface (μm<sup>2</sup>) per minute calculated.</p><p>For SW480 and SW620 cells, migration and invasion assays were performed in Boyden chambers (BD Bioscience) using 80,000 cells in the presence of 100 μL Matrigel (0.5 mg/mL; BD Bioscience) for invasion assays. Cells were fixed and stained 24 hr later in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS with 1 μg/ml Hoechst and the number of cells present in the lower site of the filter counted with an Inverse1 Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope.</p><p>For cell proliferation assays, Hek-293t, NIH3T3 and HeLa cells were seeded in 35-mm 6-well plates (10<sup>5</sup> cells/well). Cells were then counted with an Automated Cell Counter (Countess, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher).</p><p>For cell proliferation assays, SW480, SW620, MDA-MB-231, D3H2LN, MCF10A cells and human fibroblasts were seeded at an initial density of 4000 cells per dish in 96-well dishes. At the indicated time points, cells were stained with crystal violet and the DNA content of attached cells was determined by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm.</p><p>To inhibit AKT during cell proliferation, invasion and migration assays, the AKT Inhibitor VIII (Millipore-Calbiochem) or MK2206 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany ) was added to the culture medium 4 hr after plating cells and was replaced every two days. AKT phosphorylation on S473 was measured 24 hr after inhibitor treatment. Cell proliferation was measured in cells containing AKT inhibitor at the indicated times. Cell migration and invasion in SW480 and MDA-MB-231 was measured 24 hr after inhibitor addition. Cell invasion in MDA-MB-231 was recorded 48 hr after inhibitor addition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cell contact inhibition</title><p>NIH3T3 and MCF10A cells overexpressing WT or mutant GWL were seeded in 60 mm plates and maintained in culture medium supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum (NIH3T3 cells) or 2% horse serum (MCF10A cells) for 2 to 3 weeks until foci were evident.

For all samples, ethical approval was obtained from the appropriate committees. Cases were then centralised in the Biological Resources Centre of Bergonie Institute, which has received the agreement from the French authorities to deliver samples for scientific research (AC-2008-12). TMA was made from tissue biopsies of 80 patients with primary colorectal carcinoma operated and treated at the Bergonie Institute (Bordeaux, France) between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2004. Patients and tumours characteristics are detailed in Soubeyran et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Soubeyran et al., 2011</xref>). Only 76 of the 80 patients of this TMA were included in this study due to loss of the normal tissue samples of four patients.</p><p>For each patient, a piece of tumour and normal mucosa were collected, fixed in Holland Bouin’s fluid and stored as paraffin-embedded tissue samples. For TMA construction, 0.6 mm diameter tissue cores were extracted from these blocks and assembled in the recipient paraffin block using a tissue arrayer (Beecher Instruments Tissue Arrayer, NJ). The array was designed to contain three cores of tumour tissue placed alongside a core of matched healthy mucosa. Once completed, 5 μm sections were cut from the array, placed on glass slides and deparaffinised in toluene. After heat–induced proteolytic epitope retrieval in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0), slides were incubated with an anti-human GWL primary antibody at room temperature (RT) for 1 hr, washed in PBS thrice and then incubated with an Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) at RT for 1 hr. Nuclei were stained with 1 μg/mL DAPI solution in the dark for 15 min. Slides were finally dehydrated and mounted in Fluoromount–G. Image acquisition and quantitative analyses were performed using the Icys Research Imaging cytometer (Compucyte, MA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henriksen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pozarowski et al., 2013</xref>). Once acquired, fluorescent signals were quantified by applying a phantom (=pseudocells) segmentation. GWL fluorescent signal was evaluated in areas delimited for each spot by DAPI staining and plotted as histograms, from which median intensity values were extracted. These median intensities were then reported in a scatter dot plot to compare GWL expression level in normal and tumour tissue. Data were computed and analysed using Excel and GraphPad.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Plasmids and antibodies</title><p>Plasmids and antibodies are specified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data SD2-data">Supplementary files 1, 2</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. A Sirvent for the generous gift of the pSR-shRictor; V.

Your article has been favorably reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Charles Sawyers as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper investigates the role of the mitosis-regulatory kinase Greatwall (GWL) in tumorigenesis. Overexpression of GWL is shown to stimulate the proliferation of different immortalized cell lines and to induce cell transformation as well as enhanced migration and invasion. Conversely, GWL downregulation impairs the tumorigenic properties of two cancer cell lines. Importantly, the tumor-promoting activity of GWL appears to be independent of ARPP19 and ENSA, two key substrates of GWL in the regulation of mitosis, but instead correlates with the phosphorylation of AKT on Ser473. The authors present a number of experiments supporting that GWL tumorigenic effects are mediated by AKT and that GWL-induced degradation of the phosphatase PHLPP may account for its ability to activate AKT. GWL is also shown to be overexpressed in some colorectal tumors.</p><p>This is a very interesting paper illustrating a new function for GWL, which is mostly based on good quality data. The authors also present evidence for the upregulation of GWL in human tumors consistent with the pro-tumorigenic role proposed here.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> are repetitive and can easily be reduced to 2 illustrations. Some parts of the illustrations could be moved to the supplementary section. The text should be reduced accordingly.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> is confusing and can be dropped since only the AKT pathway is further explored. It suffices to mention that an altered AKT-S473 phosphorylation came out of an antibody array.</p><p>3) Figure 6—figure supplement 4: The MEK inhibitor U0126 is normally used at concentrations of 10-50 uM; it seems unlikely that 10 nM U0126 suffices to inhibit the ERK1/2 pathway. Unless the inhibition is confirmed, it is not correct to conclude that MEK inhibition does not affect the proliferation of GWL overexpressing 231 cells.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, testing the possible direct phosphorylation of AKT by GWL. This is an important experiment but the negative result presented is not convincing. The Coomassie staining shows that there is much less AKT protein than the ARPP19 positive control. The in vitro phosphorylation should be repeated using the same amount of AKT and ARPP19 proteins, preferably over a range of concentrations to rule the possibility that AKT could be phosphorylated by GWL less efficiently than ARPP19. This would still not completely rule out a direct phosphorylation, but it would certainly make the evidence more convincing.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Greatwall promotes cell transformation by hyperactivating AKT in human malignancies&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.
