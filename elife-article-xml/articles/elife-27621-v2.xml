The neural mechanisms that lead to the formation of discrete episodes from the stream of neural activity patterns representing ongoing experience are unknown. To investigate these mechanisms, we recorded neural activity in the rat hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, structures critical for memory processes. We show that during spatial navigation, hippocampal CA1 place cells maintain a continuous spatial representation across different states of motion (movement and immobility). In contrast, during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), when representations of experience are transiently reactivated from memory, movement- and immobility-associated activity patterns are most often reactivated separately. Concurrently, distinct hippocampal reactivations of movement- or immobility-associated representations are accompanied by distinct modulation patterns in prefrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate a continuous representation of ongoing experience can be separated into independently reactivated memory representations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>sharp wave-ripple</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1MH105174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Jai Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Kay</surname><given-names>Kenneth</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Daniel F</given-names></name><name><surname>Sosa</surname><given-names>Marielena</given-names></name><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Jason E</given-names></name><name><surname>Frank</surname><given-names>Loren M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Jai Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005595</institution-id><institution>University of California</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LF-12-237680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frank</surname><given-names>Loren M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Jai Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Kay</surname><given-names>Kenneth</given-names></name><name><surname>Frank</surname><given-names>Loren M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH097084</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frank</surname><given-names>Loren M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During awake Sharp wave-ripple memory reactivation, hippocampal-cortical representations for movement- versus immobility-associated experiences are reactivated separately.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to recall past experience is a fundamental cognitive function shared across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crystal, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tulving, 1972</xref>). Our recollections often correspond to meaningful sections or episodes taken from the continuous stream of information that was available during ongoing experience. When human subjects are asked to recall content from continuous film or written narratives with multiple themes, recall accuracy for content within each theme is independent of content from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Black and Bower, 1979</xref>) and when provided with a cue, recalled information is more likely to come from the same theme than from different themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boltz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezzyat and Davachi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zwaan, 1996</xref>). How ongoing and continuous representations of experience are transformed into discrete memory representations remains unclear.</p><p>The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) maintain neural representations correlated with both ongoing experience and memory. During ongoing experience, the hippocampus encodes information about current spatial location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilson and McNaughton, 1993</xref>) and PFC maintains information about other variables including those related to task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Euston et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jung et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pratt and Mizumori, 2001</xref>). Location specific activity in the hippocampus is interrupted intermittently by sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events, during which hippocampal activity transiently switches to expressing representations corresponding to episodes of past experience or potential future scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">BuzsÃ¡ki, 2015</xref>). Hippocampal SWRs are also accompanied by coordinated changes in activity patterns in PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jadhav et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Logothetis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peyrache et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Remondes and Wilson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), which reflect a coherent reinstatement of stored representations of experience. Thus, a comparison of the content of reinstated representations during SWRs with representations of ongoing experience provides an opportunity to infer how aspects of experience are maintained in memory.</p><p>To date, examination of the content of hippocampal SWR reactivation has focused exclusively on representations of experience associated with movement. These reinstated activity patterns correspond to representations of trajectories through space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Csicsvari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diba and BuzsÃ¡ki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foster and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jackson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karlsson and Frank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu and Foster, 2014</xref>). Representation of movement trajectories that span parts or the entire environment can be reinstated through single or multiple concatenated SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu and Foster, 2014</xref>), consistent with the expression of memories for experiences that begin at one location and end at another.</p><p>Recently, hippocampal spatial coding during periods of immobility has also been identified. Location specific activity of a subset of place cells, predominantly found in CA2 but also in CA1 and CA3, persists when an animal stops. The activity of these cells is coupled to a distinct hippocampal network pattern (N-waves) not observed during movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kay et al., 2016</xref>). The distinct behavioral and neural correlates of movement- and immobility-associated experiences raise the intriguing possibility that these experiences may represent behaviorally relevant episodes that are processed differently to form distinct memory representations.</p><p>However, the reactivation of representations for immobility-associated experiences during SWRs has not yet been characterized in the hippocampus. Thus, we do not know whether immobility-associated spatial representations are reliably reactivated during the awake state. We also do not know whether such reactivations, if they exist, engage brain regions outside the hippocampus.</p><p>Since movement and immobility are fundamental features of ongoing experience, we investigated the relationship between representations of ongoing experience and memory reactivation corresponding to behavioral episodes associated with movement or immobility. We recorded activity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and in PFC, both of which play critical roles in memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Euston et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moscovitch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spellman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Winocur and Moscovitch, 1990</xref>). We identified CA1 spatial representations associated with both movement and immobility and found they overlapped in time, forming a temporally continuous spatial representation of experience on the time scale of seconds. We also found immobility-associated representations are reactivated during awake SWRs. Despite the continuity of movement and immobility spatial representations, the reactivation of these representations occurred predominantly during distinct sets of SWR events. The distinction between reactivated movement- versus immobility-associated representations was also observed in the modulation of PFC activity during SWRs, consistent with a coordinated reactivation of representations associated with experience during different states of motion. Lastly, we note that the independent reactivation of movement- and immobility-associated representations could arise from a Hebbian mechanism that separates continuous representations based on the proportion of non-coincident firing between the activity of two cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O'Neill et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of CA1 place cells participating in spatial representations during movement and immobility</title><p>We trained rats to perform a novel foraging task or a spatial alternation task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) and recorded neural activity in dorsal CA1 and PFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We used two different tasks to examine properties of neural activity that are shared across environments with different spatial topology and task rules. In both tasks, the animals transitioned between periods of movement (travelling between reward locations) and immobility (consuming reward) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The animals spent similar amounts of time during movement compared with immobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>) and transitioned between these states of motion every 6â7 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>We first identified CA1 units participating in ongoing hippocampal spatial encoding during movement and immobility. Since immobility occurred predominantly during periods when the animals were at reward well locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), we began by selecting units that had mean firing rates greater than 3 Hz, excluding activity during SWRs, at one or more reward well locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâC</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4A</xref>).

We then asked whether their firing properties were consistent with spatial coding during immobility. We compared the properties of these cells with other CA1 units that did not fire at above 3 Hz at reward locations but that were active (&gt;200 spikes across all sessions in a day) elsewhere in the environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1EâF</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4BâE</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27621.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spatial activity of CA1 place cells during movement and immobility.</title><p>(<bold>A-C</bold>) Firing properties of 4 simultaneously recorded CA1 place cells from the foraging task.

However, it is unknown whether transitions between movement and immobility spatial representations are smooth or abrupt. This transition could occur smoothly during transitions between movement and immobility, where the ramp down of MAP activity overlaps with the ramp up of IAP activity when animals arrive at a reward location and vice versa during departure. This would result in an overlap between the spiking of MAPs and IAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Alternatively, the transition between MAP and IAP activity could be abrupt, similar to fast switches in spatial representations between consecutive theta cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jezek et al., 2011</xref>). In this case, MAP spatial representations would be replaced by IAP spatial representations and vice versa, resulting in no overlap between MAP and IAP spiking in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

We first calculated spike autocorrelations for IAPs and MAPs during the movement and immobility transition periods around the time of reward well location entry and exit. For IAP and MAP spikes that occurred when the animal was moving (speedÂ &gt;4 cm/s), we found peaks in the autocorrelation consistent with entrainment to theta oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref> left panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">1D</xref> right panel).

Our results indicate that this same pattern of coactivity is present for MAP-IAP pairs, where MAPs and IAPs can be active within individual theta cycles during transitions between immobility and movement. On the finer timescale of a theta cycle, most MAP-IAP pairs had offsets in peak cross-correlationÂ of up to half a theta cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1EâF</xref>), which was correlated with the separation of spiking activity on a longer time scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1GâJ</xref>).

At the same time, we also note that that IAP activity continued for many seconds during immobility, a period when MAPs were largely silent.

This indicates that representations of locations associated with immobility are reactivated individually rather than simultaneously. Further, for IAP pairs with place fields at the same well location, there was strong SWR coactivity during events that occurred away from the cellsâ place fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that non-local immobility spatial representations are reactivated at the ensemble level during SWRs.</p><p>We then asked whether movement and immobilityÂ spatial representations are reactivated together or individually. Strikingly, there was a clear separation between the reactivation of MAPs and IAPs. We first counted the number of SWRs that contained only MAPs (MAP-SWRs), only IAPs (IAP-SWRs) or a combination of both (MAP and IAP-SWRs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The large majority of SWRs contained either only MAPs (nÂ =Â 12881, 67%) or only IAPs (nÂ =Â 5009, 26%). Only a small fraction of events contained both MAPs and IAPs (nÂ =Â 1311, 7%). Based on the probability of either MAPs or IAPs participating individually in a SWR, the observed number of MAP and IAP SWRs was significantly less than expected (expected nÂ =Â 4671, 24%, actual vs. expected p&lt;0.0001, Chi squared test, d.f.Â =Â 1). This indicates MAP and IAPs are significantly less likely to participate in the same reactivation event than expected by chance.</p><p>A pairwise analysis confirmed the largely independent reactivation of MAPs and IAPs during SWRs. Previous examinations of coactivity for MAPs have demonstrated that whether a pair of place cells participates in a SWR is related to the amount of coactivity in time outside of SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O'Neill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Singer and Frank, 2009</xref>). To control for the effect of temporal separation in activity during theÂ task on coactivity during SWRs, we selected pairs of place cells that were coactive within a behaviorally relevant duration, which corresponds to a pair of cells having a cross-correlation peak within 3.3 s (half the duration of a typical bout of movement and immobility, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref> column 3). This selection ensures we are only comparing place cells that were active within similar intervals of time during the task. The coactivity distribution shows MAP-IAP pairs had significantly lower levels of SWR coactivity than MAP-MAP or IAP-IAP pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>).

We chose not use distance between place field peaks as a way to select cell pairs for the SWR coactivity analysis dueÂ to the geometry of our task environments. We reasoned that in environments that restrict the animalâs movement to linear trajectories, such as a linear track, distance between place field peaks is more likely to be directly related to whether a pair of place cells will be reactivated together since the animal is forced to traverse the cellsâ place fields sequentially. However, our foraging task has a spatial geometry with multiple intersections. Place cells with nearby place fields may not necessarily be visited sequentially depending the route choice of the animal.

We analyzed data from animals performing the foraging task, where we simultaneously recorded neurons from the hippocampus and PFC. From an initial set of 712 PFC units, we selected units that were actively engaged in the task (mean firing rateÂ &gt;1 Hz during either periods of immobility or movement or both) and were recorded during behavioral sessions where we could identify both MAP- and IAP-SWRs. We then examined the activity of these units (nÂ =Â 112) during MAP- and IAP-SWRs, which comprise the majority of SWR events.</p><p>We foundÂ ~63% of these PFC units (70/112) showed significant modulation during one or both types of SWRs. This percentage is almost twice the amount we reported previously without knowledge of different SWR types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jadhav et al., 2016</xref>), which suggests that IAP-SWRs engage a set of SWR-modulated PFC units that were not observed before. Importantly, the patterns of modulation were qualitatively different depending on the type of SWR. Many PFC units showed excitation during one type of SWR and either no change in activity or inhibition during the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâB</xref>), which was unexpected and had not been previously demonstrated. Others showed inhibition during both types of SWRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jadhav et al., 2016</xref>). To quantify these differences in activity across the SWR types, we expressed the degree of change in the firing rate of individual PFC units as a pair of activity modulation indices, one for MAP-SWRs and the other for IAP-SWRs. An analysis of the distribution of these indices for significantly modulated cells showed that on a population level, the majority of PFC units had modulation indices corresponding to three main groups: excitation during IAP-SWRs (PFC IAP-SWR<sup>+</sup>), excitation during MAP-SWRs (PFC MAP-SWR<sup>+</sup>), or inhibition during either or both types of SWRs (PFC IAP/MAP-SWR<sup>â</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5DâF</xref>).

Specifically, PFC IAP-SWR<sup>+</sup> units were most active at the onset of immobility and show spiking patterns most similar to CA1 IAPs. PFC MAP-SWR<sup>+</sup> cells were most active during movement before reward well entry and show spiking patterns most similar to CA1 MAPs. In contrast, PFC IAP/MAP-SWR<sup>-</sup> cells tended to show a gradual increase in spiking after reward well entry, a pattern different than that of IAPs or MAPs in CA1. Although the 3 PFC IAP- and MAP-SWR<sup>+</sup> units showed firing properties more similar to MAP-SWR<sup>+</sup>, we hesitate to draw conclusions about their firing properties given the scarcity of this group and the lack of strong modulation to either SWR type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Correspondence between spiking activity during SWRs and during ongoing experience was also seen when we examined patterns of spiking coactivity, which is a complementary measure of coactivity in time independent of task events such as reward well entry. We computed PFC-CA1 cell pair spike cross-correlations for all spikes outside of SWRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and found that PFC IAP-SWR<sup>+</sup> cells were more coactive with CA1 IAPs than CA1 MAPs. Conversely, PFC MAP-SWR<sup>+</sup> cells were more coactive with CA1 MAPs than CA1 IAPs. PFC IAP/MAP-SWR<sup>-</sup> cells were least coactive with either type of CA1 place cell. These effects couldÂ not be explained by differences in spatial or temporal proximity of spiking between different PFC cell pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>) but were consistent with the pattern of coordinated activity between PFC and CA1 outside of SWRs being preserved in the network and reactivated during SWRs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found CA1 place cells active during movement or immobility form a continuous spatial representation of ongoing experience. Despite this continuity,Â ~93% of SWR reactivation events contained either movement or immobility-associatedÂ spatial representations but not a mixture of the two. Thus, the hippocampus can express distinct reactivation of events even when those events are represented continuously in time during ongoing experience. The distinction between movement and immobility reactivations was found also in PFC, where modulation of PFC activity during SWRs distinguishes between movement- and immobility-associated content in the hippocampus. PFC modulation during SWRs was correlated with their activity pattern outside of SWRs during the task. This demonstrates the engagement of the hippocampal-cortical network during reactivation of both immobility- and movement-associated representations.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A continuous spatial representation in CA1</title><p>We found that CA1 maintained a continuous spatial representation across different behavioral states. During the transition period between movement and immobility, the spiking of MAPs (cells that participate in movement related spatial representations) and IAPs (cells that participate in immobility related spatial representations) overlapped in time on the time scale of seconds. Interestingly, although IAPs were predominantly active during immobility when the theta oscillation is typically absent, they showed theta modulation during the higher speeds during the transition period, suggesting IAP entrainment to both theta and N-waves.</p><p>When an animal remains immobile, its experience continues in time but does not change in spatial location. In the hippocampus, activity consistent with representations of elapsed time have been found, where âtime cellsâ tile time while an animal remains immobile during a waiting period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacDonald et al., 2011</xref>). In our tasks the animal was not required to explicitly time or anticipate the length of immobility periods at reward well locations but was instead allowed to initiate movement bouts voluntarily. This could perhaps explain the lack of sequential activity among IAPs when we examined the firing patterns of multiple IAPs aligned to the onset of immobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, it is possible that ensembles of IAPs may be recruited to form temporally patterned activity in tasks that require keeping track of information over time during immobility.</p><p>The IAPs we describe here share similar properties to N-wave coupled cells that participate in immobility spatial coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kay et al., 2016</xref>) or have spatially selective activity during immobile waiting periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McKenzie et al., 2013</xref>). They are distinct from previously described CA1 units that are active near goal locations, which have been proposed to represent learned expectation of reward at specific locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gothard et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hok et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobayashi et al., 2003</xref>). First, in both of our tasks, the animal could obtain reward at multiple locations. If IAPs represented reward expectation in our tasks, we would expect their activity to be associated with multiple locations where reward was expected. That was not the case: we found that IAPs tended to be spatially selective for one location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Secondly, the spikes of IAPs occurred mostly when the animal was immobile and their activity spanned less space compared with MAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâE</xref>), which indicates the main spatially selective activity for IAPs was restricted to periods of immobility. This contrasts with previously described goal-related place cells that have dominant place fields away from the goal location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hok et al., 2007</xref>). Lastly, the foraging task involved multiple changes in spatial reward contingency, where the locations of rewards shifted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). If IAPs encoded learned spatial reward expectation, IAP activity should follow changes in reward location, which has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gothard et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kobayashi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobayashi et al., 2003</xref>). Again, we found IAP activity remained stable and did not shift to newly rewarded locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). Thus, IAPs are functionally distinct from previously described goal-related firing in CA1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Distinct reactivation of immobility-associated representations</title><p>Our results show that SWR reactivation of immobility-associated representations is largely distinct from reactivations of movement-associated representations, despite the smooth transitions between these representations during behavior. Previous studies have classified SWRs into distinct classes based on unique LFP signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramirez-Villegas et al., 2015</xref>) and showed that information extracted from the LFP can be used to predict the content of trajectory replay events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taxidis et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with those observations, we found SWRs reactivating immobility-associated experiences tended to be shorter in duration and lower in amplitude than SWRs reactivating movement-associated experiences. Given the durations of SWRs are correlated with the spatial extent of reactivated spatial representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>), the difference in durations of SWRs reactivating movement- or immobility-associated experiences is consistent with the spatial coverage of their respective ongoing representations.</p><p>We also found SWRs containing immobility representations were accompanied by concurrent and coordinated changes in the activity of subsets of PFC neurons. The PFC units that showed excitation during IAP-SWRs also showed similar firing coactivity to CA1 IAPs outside of SWRs during the task, with a peak in activity immediately upon reward well entry. Therefore, a subset of SWRs marks the coordinated reinstatement of multimodal representations of immobility-associated experiences across different brain areas. Our results establish that there are distinct, largely mutually exclusive classes of SWRs that reinstate hippocampal and PFC representations associated with experience during different behavioral states.</p><p>The highly selective PFC modulation patterns thatÂ accompany reactivated hippocampal representations of either movement- or immobility-associated experiences suggest this distinction has important roles that extend beyond the hippocampus. Movement and immobility related modulation patterns in PFC during SWRs may reflect the concurrent reactivation of non-spatial aspects of experience associated with immobility, such as representations of actions and their consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Euston et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sul et al., 2010</xref>). These reactivations may be required for local PFC processes that strengthen specific cortical representations of experience in memory or may reflect access to locally stored information for computations involved in planning upcoming choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu and Frank, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The independent reactivation of movement- and immobility-associated representations could also reflect the distinct roles of these experiences for guiding future choices. For rodents, exploratory behavior is characterized by alternating bouts of movement and immobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Whishaw and Kolb, 2005</xref>), which are associated with distinct experiences. Navigational planning represents one of the many challenges faced by foraging animals. In natural environments with complex terrains and spatial topologies, behaviorally significant locations are distributed in space and can be reached by many paths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calhoun, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Telle, 1966</xref>). Memory of experience during movement may assist in selecting routes to specific locations of interest in the environment. An animal may need memories of experiences that occurred at these locations to choose what to do once it is there. Thus, distinct memories for immobility-associated experiences may provide context and guide decisions specific to certain locations in order to obtain reward or avoid punishment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A Hebbian mechanism for separating movement and immobility representations</title><p>What mechanism could underlie the independent reactivation of movement and immobility spatial representations despite the smooth transition during ongoing experience? Previous work has demonstrated that the temporal spiking patterns of place cells during movement are predictive of their association during subsequent SWR reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O'Neill et al., 2008</xref>). These results suggested a model where coincident spiking between a pair of place cells, most likely in upstream area CA3 where there are extensive local recurrent collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MacVicar and Dudek, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miles and Wong, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">1986</xref>), strengthens their association, thereby linking individual place fields for joint reactivation during subsequent SWRs. At the same time, non-coincident spiking of place cells with place fields that are separated in space and time would decrease the strength of their association, reducing the likelihood that they will be incorporated into the same reactivated representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27621.030</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A Hebbian mechanism for discretizing continuous representations of experience.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of PFC and CA1 activity around reward well entry and exit.

This difference was due to IAP activity that continues for many seconds during immobility, which lead to a greater number of non-coincident spikes between MAP and IAP pairs and could weaken their association. In contrast, during immobility, groups of IAPs that have local place fields were active, which would drive increased association between pairs of IAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). As a result, we expect increases in association within ensembles of MAPs and within ensembles IAPs, but less strengthening or even weakening of association between MAPs and IAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7AâB</xref>).</p><p>A prediction of this hypothesis is that during SWR reactivation events, which reflect associations formed between place cells during ongoing experience, we will see a predominance of events with either MAPs or IAPs but not both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, top). A less frequently observed type of SWRs will include both types of place cells, where reactivation events would have an initiation bias for the immobility representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, middle). Least likely are reactivations where the immobility-associated representations are sandwiched between two movement representations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, bottom). Our data is consistent with all these predictions. We saw the majority of SWRs contained either MAPs or IAPs. In the minority of SWRs with both MAPs and IAPs, we found IAPs tended to spike earlier in SWRs compared with MAPs, which is consistent with locations of immobility being found mostly at the start rather than distributed within putative trajectory reactivation events. We are also unaware of any reports of reactivation events that contain representations of a trajectory that leads to a location of immobility followed by a trajectory that leads away from the location.</p><p>More broadly, we suggest this Hebbian mechanism could support the transformation of adjacent periods of ongoing experience into separate memories. Findings from human studies suggest the division of experience into episodes is an ongoing cognitive process that is shared across species. Humans can reliably report boundaries that separate perceived events and episodes in ongoing experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Newtson, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zacks et al., 2001b</xref>) and brain activity shows marked changes in activity coinciding with progression across these perceived boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Speer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sridharan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Whitney et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zacks et al., 2001a</xref>). We suggest temporally adjacent events represented by the activity of cells with receptive fields that also overlap in time, on the scale of seconds, may become unique representations if the number of spikes that overlap, within small time intervals, during the transition between the two events are small compared with the overall number of spikes fired individually during each event. This could then lead to the creation of separate episodes of experience in memory.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Eleven male Long Evans rats (500â700 g, 4â9 months old) were used for these studies.

The raw CA1 LFP was referenced to an electrode in corpus callosum and then filtered (150â250 Hz) to isolate the SWR band. The SWR envelope was then obtained using the Hilbert transform and then smoothed by convolving with a Gaussian kernel (ÏÂ =Â 4 ms). A consensus SWR envelope was calculated by taking the median of the envelopes across all available tetrodes. Only days where at least three tetrodes were in or near the CA1 cell layer were used for the analysis.</p><p>Standard methods for identifying SWRs involve setting a fixed detection threshold for events (e.g. 3 SD above mean) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diba and BuzsÃ¡ki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jackson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karlsson and Frank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee and Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O'Neill et al., 2006</xref>). We noted that this method could yield somewhat different sets of events across days because the characteristics of the consensus envelope can be variable across animals, days and behavior states. Thus, using a fixed detection threshold to define SWRs could include spurious events on days with higher noise level and exclude genuine events on days with a lower noise level. Furthermore, this cutoff is typically arbitrary, therefore prompting us to develop a more principled approach to distinguish events from noise.</p><p>To avoid the problem of arbitrary thresholds and differences in noise distributions across days, we developed a SWR identification approach that defines a threshold based on the distribution of the consensus envelope power for a given day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We first normalized the consensus envelope power to times during immobility (speedÂ &lt;4 cm/s). We assumed that the full distribution of the envelope power was the result of a lower power noise component and a higher power signal component that contributes to the long tail. We approximated the noise distribution by finding the mode for the histogrammed consensus envelope power and creating a symmetric distribution by mirroring the histogram below the peak around the mode. We then used a cutoff (99.99th percentile) in envelope power based on this empirically estimated noise distribution as the detection threshold for SWRs. This method allowed us to capture the distinct noise distributions for immobility periods for each day. SWRs were then detected when the power of the consensus envelope exceeded the detection threshold for a minimum of 20 ms. The starts and ends of the events were set to times when the envelope power returns to the mean.

The proportion of all SWR events where both cells were firing was the observed coactivity. The expected coactivity was calculated by permuting the participation of each cell across all SWRs. This was performed 5000 times and to generate a distributionÂ ofÂ the expected proportion of SWRs with both cells active. The observed proportion was converted to a z-score by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the expected distribution. This method takes into account the differences in SWR participation for each cell in the pair.</p><p>We chose this method to examine the content of SWRs instead of trajectory decoding methods because the latter enriches for SWRs that contain multiple place cells and decode to trajectories matching predefined templates, which often only consists of place cells with activity during movement (e.g. MAPs). However, SWRs that do not meet these criteria, either with too few participating place cells or do not decode to a meaningful trajectory, are classified as non-replay events and excluded from further analysis. The pairwise coactivity method captures structured SWR activity that has been related to activity during recent experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O'Neill et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Singer and Frank, 2009</xref>) but does not impose conditions that select for certain types of content.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Spectrograms</title><p>We used the Chronux toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mitra and Bokil, 2008</xref>) (chronux.org) to calculate spectral power. The broadband CA1 LFP was referenced to ground. The spectrogram was calculated in 100 ms sliding windows with a 10 ms step size and normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation from all times during the session. We then calculated the mean from all 500 ms windows centered on the start each SWR. To quantify the spectral power for SWRs, we calculated the mean spectral power for the first 100 ms after the onset of each SWR. We then compared the mean power between 150â250 Hz in this window.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>PFC SWR modulation index</title><p>The modulation index is the change in firing during SWRs relative to the surrounding mean firing rate and is calculated for each cell and each type of SWR as:</p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mtext>Â </mml:mtext><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mtext>Â </mml:mtext><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mstyle></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> where <italic>I<sub>SWR</sub></italic> is the SWR modulation index, <italic>r<sub>SWR</sub></italic> is mean firing rate during SWRs and <italic>r<sub>1s window</sub></italic> is the mean firing rate in the 1 s window centered on SWRs.

For a given type of SWR, we first generated a perievent time histogram (PETH) for all events aligned to the start of SWRs for the observed data. We then generated a control dataset by circularly permuting the spike times for each SWR event, such that all spikes around one SWR event were circularly shifted by the same amount but this amount varied between SWR events. From this control dataset we then generated a PETH. This was repeated 1000 times. Next we calculated the squared deviation of the observed PETH from the mean of the 1000 control PETHs for the average duration of SWRs for the given type of SWR. We then compared the squared deviation of each of the 1000 control PETHs to the mean of all 1000 control PETHs. The significance value was the fraction of 1000 control PETH deviations that are larger than the observed PETH deviation.</p><p>As a control to evaluate the difference in PFC activity changes during IAP- and MAP-SWRs, the identity of the SWR was permuted before recalculating the SWR modulation index. As a control for the difference in duration between IAP- and MAP-SWRs, SWR events forÂ each PFC cell were resampled to match the duration distribution of IAP- and MAP-SWR groups before recalculating the SWR modulation index.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>PFC cell classification</title><p>For each PFC unit, we calculated its SWR modulation index for each type of SWR. For the PFC units that showed significant modulation to either type of SWR, we classified them into 4 groups based on the following criteria: significant excitation only during IAP-SWRs (units showing IAP-SWR<sup>+</sup> MAP-SWR<sup>â</sup> or IAP-SWR<sup>+</sup> MAP-SWR<sup>n.s.</sup>), significant excitation only during MAP-SWRs (MAP-SWR<sup>+</sup> IAP-SWR<sup>â</sup> or MAP-SWR<sup>+</sup> IAP-SWR<sup>n.s.</sup>), significant inhibition during either or both IAP/MAP-SWRs (MAP-SWR<sup>n.s.</sup> IAP-SWR<sup>â</sup>, MAP-SWR<sup>â</sup> IAP-SWR<sup>n.s.</sup> or MAP-SWR<sup>-</sup> IAP-SWR<sup>â</sup>) and significant excitation during both IAP/MAP-SWRs (IAP-SWR<sup>+</sup> MAP-SWR<sup>+</sup>). The expected number of units for each of the 4 groups was calculated under the assumption that the 70 PFC units are randomly distributed among the possible combinations of modulation significance (nÂ =Â 8, listed in brackets). For example, the expected number of units with significant excitation only during IAP-SWRs, which has two possible combinations of modulation significance, is 18 (2 Ã 70/8). The significance of the difference between observed and expected values was calculated with a Binomial test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>PFC and CA1 spiking activity</title><p>PFC and CA1 spiking was aligned to reward well entry, as measured by an infrared beam break at the reward well.

The spiking pattern similarity index for each PFC cell group was defined as the pairwise difference between the spike pattern correlation to CA1 IAPs and MAPs. This is an indication of whether the spiking pattern of a PFC cell group is more similar to the spiking of IAPs (&gt;0) or MAPs (&lt;0).</p><p>Cross-correlations between CA1-PFC unit pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) were calculated in 100 ms bins with a window of 20 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perkel et al., 1967</xref>). For each pair, the cross-correlation was normalized by subtracting the mean and then dividing by the standard deviation of all bins in the 20 s period. This normalization method preserves the shape of the cross-correlation and allows for comparison across cell pairs.</p><p>The spiking coincidence measure for each PFC group was defined as the pairwise difference between the IAP and MAP spike cross-correlation values in a 100 ms time bin centered at 0 s lag.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Jozsef Csicsvari (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the results concerning replay of immobility-related place cell firing and related prefrontal activity are potentially interesting and significant. However, they also identify some significant issues concerning whether the results are specific to the IAP/MAP distinction you make, or have a more general explanation that would be consistent with previous findings. These issues would need to be addressed in a revised manuscript, see below for details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors record place cells active during mobility (MAPs) and those active during immobility at reward locations (IAPs). They find a smooth transition between these types of cells when the animal enters or leaves a reward location.</p><p>The main findings concern 'reactivation events' during immobility and sharp-wave/ripples (SWRs), in that both types of cell are reactivated, but seemingly reactivation events are unlikely to contain both IAPs and MAPs. A second finding is that the patterns of firing of neurons in PFC are different during IAP versus MAP-related SWRs.</p><p>The paper is presented as showing that mobility and immobility-related events are reactivated separately, with the implication that different behavioral states are treated separately when forming and reactivating memories.</p><p>As I read the paper several basic questions came to mind that needed to be resolved before the results could be interpreted or evaluated properly (particularly Qs 1 and 2 below). These may be answered within the paper, but if so not in such an obvious way that I could tell.</p><p>1) Given that reactivation of firing during SWRs is most commonly thought of in terms of 'replay' of experience, and such 'replay events' correspond to experiential trajectories, one would expect the probability of reactivation of a pair of cells to depend on the spatial proximity of their firing fields. Does the IAP/MAP separation effect here simply reflect the increased spatial proximity of the firing fields of cells that fire during a run to a reward or at the reward location relative to mixed pairs across both populations (i.e. nothing to do with behavioral state, which just happens to be confounded with spatial proximity)? To answer this question requires plots of probability of co-reactivation versus the spatial distance between firing fields for all three types of pairs (MAP-MAP, MAP-IAP, IAP-IAP).</p><p>2) Given that reactivation of firing during SWRs is most commonly thought of in terms of 'replay' of experience, and such 'replay events' correspond to experiential trajectories, one would expect the probability of reactivation of a pair of cells to depend on the temporal proximity of their firing during experience. Does the IAP/MAP separation effect here simply reflect the increased temporal proximity of the firing of cells that fire during a run to a reward or at the reward location relative to mixed pairs across both populations (i.e. nothing to do with behavioral state, which just happens to be confounded with temporal proximity)? To answer this question requires plots of probability of co-reactivation versus the temporal distance between firing during behavior (e.g. assessed by cross correlogram peaks) for all three types of pairs (MAP-MAP, MAP-IAP, IAP-IAP).</p><p>3) Same as Q1 but for the separation in PFC firing patterns (is it just a spatial proximity effect?)</p><p>4) Same as Q2 but for the separation in PFC firing patterns (is it just a temporal proximity effect?)</p><p>5) Are IAPs different to place cells that happen to fire at a specific reward location?</p><p>6) Do IAP reactivation events control for the firing of IAPs due to being immobile at the reward location? And does IAP definition control for firing that happens during SWRs?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Yu et al. describes a study investigating reactivation patterns of place cells associated with immobility (IAP, first described by Kay et al. (2016)) and those associated with mobility (MAP). The authors find the two cell types are active in distinct SWRs and the degree of co-activity is less than one would expect by chance. Further, in a different experiment the authors find PFC activity is coordinated with CA1 activity during reactivations, such that distinct sets of PFC cells are recruited by IAP and MAP SWRs. Finally, the authors explain the separation of mobility and immobility representations can be accounted for by a Hebbian mechanism. This work represents an advance to our nascent understanding of place cells associated with immobility. However, I have some reservations about the methods used to highlight differences between IAP and MAPs and the overall novelty of the findings.</p><p>1) The authors define IAPs and MAPs based on the animals' location â cells active at the reward wells are IAPs and cells active elsewhere are MAPs. They seek to address whether a transition from a mobility representation to an immobility representation occurs smoothly or abruptly, using pair-wise cross-correlations, and find evidence for a smooth transition. My only issue with this result is that it has to be largely influenced by the parameters used. Namely, the IAPs, although they fire mostly during immobility, they also fire during movement; the opposite is true for MAPs. Thus, the authors are inclined to find a smooth transition.</p><p>2) Differences in SWR power and duration could be explained by number of cells/spikes active in IAP and MAP SWRs. Have the authors tried to control for this? Given there are much fewer IAPs than MAPs I assume there are fewer cells/spikes active in IAP SWRs.</p><p>3) The modulation of PFC neurons by SWRs is basically a replication of the Jadhav et al. (2016) study showing coordinated reactivation between PFC and CA1. Showing PFC neurons are differentially recruited by IAP and MAP SWRs could just be explained by co-activity during tasks and that reactivations are recruited by CA1 (as indicated by Jadhav et al).</p><p>4) The section on the Hebbian mechanism which could account for the described representational segregation can go into the Discussion, or be combined with the previous section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> be included as a supplement. It doesn't show a result, but rather is a mechanistic description of the effect.</p><p>5) Is there any temporal structure to IAP and MAP SWRs? i.e. to IAP SWRs immediately precede/follow MAP SWRs? This would support the claim that IAPs are involved in replay of experiences. Presumably, MAP SWRs reactivate trajectories on the tracks, and each trajectory is flanked by a period of immobility. Thus, one might expect to observe this structure in the SWRs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript shows that CA1 cells that fire preferentially in a place-related manner during immobility (IAP) tend to fire together during sharp wave ripples (SWR) as well that occur during exploration. Moreover, in some SWRs place cells fire preferentially together while in other SWRs IAP cells are co-active together. In the prefrontal cortex some cells preferentially increase their firing with place cell firing-related SWRs whereas, other prefrontal cell may fire with IAP-associated SWRs. The work is important: it examined the reactivation properties of IAPs and its link to prefrontal activity. I have one concern that I am sure the authors can address.</p><p>1) It has not been tested whether IAP-associated SWRs exist in significant numbers that express a location other than the current location of the animal. It was shown that IAPs encoding similar locations co-fire together stronger during SWRs than those encoding different locations. It was also shown that IAPs that encode a location different from the current location of the animal exhibit correlated firing with IAP-SWRs overall. These two findings indicate but does not directly show that IAP-associated SWRs exist that on the assembly level encode a location other than the current location of the animal. This would be important to show otherwise one may not be able to refer to these events as reactivation. SWRs may just reflect the high frequency leakage of intense spiking in some periods when IAPs encoding the current location transiently increase their firing. Such processes may just reflect sensory-driven encoding of the location of the animal with transient synchronization, not reactivation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Distinct hippocampal-cortical memory representations for experiences associated with movement versus immobility&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

These may be answered within the paper, but if so not in such an obvious way that I could tell.</italic> </p><p>We thank reviewer #1 for raising important issues to improve our manuscript. We have edited the text to address the controls proposed.</p><p><italic>1) Given that reactivation of firing during SWRs is most commonly thought of in terms of 'replay' of experience, and such 'replay events' correspond to experiential trajectories, one would expect the probability of reactivation of a pair of cells to depend on the spatial proximity of their firing fields. Does the IAP/MAP separation effect here simply reflect the increased spatial proximity of the firing fields of cells that fire during a run to a reward or at the reward location relative to mixed pairs across both populations (i.e. nothing to do with behavioral state, which just happens to be confounded with spatial proximity)? To answer this question requires plots of probability of co-reactivation versus the spatial distance between firing fields for all three types of pairs (MAP-MAP, MAP-IAP, IAP-IAP).</italic> </p><p>We agree with reviewer #1 that place field spatial proximity is related to coactivity between place cells during SWRs. We therefore added scatter plots of distance between place field peaks for each cell pair and their SWR coactivity as well as binned quantifications of the values for small distance separations for each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). These results are consistent with previous findings, where place cells with place fields further apart in space are less coactive during SWRs than those with nearby place fields.</p><p>Critically, as shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>, SWR coactivity for IAP-MAP pairs was significantly lower than for matched MAP-MAP pairs across a wide range of place field peak distances. We show the boxplots for place field centers &lt;0.5m apart in panel C. These findings demonstrate that spatial proximity cannot fully account for the IAP/MAP SWR separation effect.</p><p>We also note that because our environment geometry allows travel on multiple paths between the same locations, place field peak distance could in principle be dissociated from the time between spikes of pairs of cells. Thus, temporal proximity, which reviewer #1 has also suggested, is likely to be more important when comparing SWR coactivity in our tasks.</p><p><italic>2) Given that reactivation of firing during SWRs is most commonly thought of in terms of 'replay' of experience, and such 'replay events' correspond to experiential trajectories, one would expect the probability of reactivation of a pair of cells to depend on the temporal proximity of their firing during experience. Does the IAP/MAP separation effect here simply reflect the increased temporal proximity of the firing of cells that fire during a run to a reward or at the reward location relative to mixed pairs across both populations (i.e. nothing to do with behavioral state, which just happens to be confounded with temporal proximity)? To answer this question requires plots of probability of co-reactivation versus the temporal distance between firing during behavior (e.g. assessed by cross correlogram peaks) for all three types of pairs (MAP-MAP, MAP-IAP, IAP-IAP).</italic> </p><p>We entirely agree that temporal proximity of spiking is a critical determinant of SWR coactivity, and indeed the cartoon model we present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> makes that point. Proximity alone cannot explain our findings, however. To make that clear, we added scatter plots to show the offset to the peak of the cross-correlation within a 20s window and the SWR coactivity for each cell pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As expected, and consistent with a role for temporal proximity, we saw cells that are active closer in time are more likely to be coactive during SWRs.</p><p>At the same time, when we matched pairs for temporal proximity, we found that the SWR coactivity for IAP-MAP pairs was lower compared with MAP-MAP pairs across a range of offset times. Here we note that this difference was significant for offsets &gt; 1 second but was not for offsets of less than 1 second. This small group of MAP-IAP pairs with small offsets in cross-correlation peaks likely accounts for associations between MAP-IAPs that contribute to the small number of joint MAP-IAP SWRs. This is consistent with our proposed model where the amount of temporal overlap in spiking between two cells relative to all spikes from each cell, rather than the absolute temporal offset between all spikes, affects their association. We should emphasize, however, that the highly significant differences for larger offsets demonstrates that temporal offset between spiking alone cannot fully account for the IAP/MAP separation effect. We now clarify this point in the last paragraph of the subsection âSeparate reactivation of immobility-associated spatial representationsâ.</p><p><italic>3) Same as Q1 but for the separation in PFC firing patterns (is it just a spatial proximity effect?)</italic> </p><p><italic>4) Same as Q2 but for the separation in PFC firing patterns (is it just a temporal proximity effect?)</italic> </p><p>Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) Are IAPs different to place cells that happen to fire at a specific reward location?</italic> </p><p>IAPs are similar to place cells that happen to fire at specific reward locations. In our case we cannot determine whether IAPs encode only location or location of reward, but we note that previous work from our laboratory (Kay et al. 2016) demonstrated that cells that showed place specific activity during immobility were also active at locations where no reward was delivered. Thus, we suggest IAPs are place cells that participate in representations for specific locations where the animal remains immobile, which in our task corresponds to specific locations where reward is delivered. To explain this in detail we included a section in the Discussion focusing on similarities and differences between IAPs and previously described goal or reward related activity in the hippocampus.</p><p>âThe IAPs we describe here share similar properties to N-wave coupled cells that participate in immobility spatial coding (Kay et al., 2016) or have spatially selective activity during immobile waiting periods (McKenzie et al., 2013). [â¦] This contrasts with previously described goal-related place cells that have dominant place fields away from the goal location (Hok et al., 2007).â</p><p><italic>6) Do IAP reactivation events control for the firing of IAPs due to being immobile at the reward location? And does IAP definition control for firing that happens during SWRs?</italic> </p><p>This is an important question. We first note that the cross-correlation of IAP spiking with SWR event occurring within the place field of the IAP (in field SWRs), showed a significant increase in SWR aligned firing compared with baseline control, where the times of spiking were randomly shifted by Â± 0-500ms (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). This means that the spiking during SWRs cannot be accounted for simply by the in-field firing of the IAP cell.</p><p>The question, then, is how to âcontrolâ for the place field activity. For example, as the reviewer is perhaps suggesting, it is possible that the firing during the SWR is best understood as a combination of place field input and SWR-related reactivation. Alternatively, it could be that IAP activity during these SWRs represents a switch to a different network state where local place field activity has at most a minor effect on spiking. There are a number of reasons to think that the second of these two possibilities (that SWRs occur during a different network state) is the most likely. First, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>, there are decreases in firing rate relative to the place field baseline at the beginning and end of the SWR period, suggesting that a simple addition of place field activity and SWR excitation cannot explain the results. Second, we previously described CA2 immobility spatial coding cells that become transiently inhibited during SWRs (Kay et al., 2016), again suggesting that SWRs are momentary interruptions in the ongoing network state.</p><p>Those arguments aside, our SWR coactivity measure takes into account any baseline spiking during SWRs since the coactivity is normalized to both cellsâ expected probability of spiking during SWRs, which is determined by repeated permutation of SWR identity to estimate âchanceâ coactivity (please see subsection âSWR coactivityâ in the Methods).</p><p>While we cannot rule out a local spatial input as a contributor to SWR spiking, our results suggest this potential input cannot account for the magnitude of firing we observed and our analytical methods accounts for this baseline level of activation in any case.</p><p>To address the converse issue, we defined IAPs based on firing rates during immobility but only for times outside of SWRs (please see subsection âCell selectionâ in Methods), thus spiking during SWRs does not contribute to the definition of IAPs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[â¦] This work represents an advance to our nascent understanding of place cells associated with immobility. However, I have some reservations about the methods used to highlight differences between IAP and MAPs and the overall novelty of the findings.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors define IAPs and MAPs based on the animals' location â cells active at the reward wells are IAPs and cells active elsewhere are MAPs. They seek to address whether a transition from a mobility representation to an immobility representation occurs smoothly or abruptly, using pair-wise cross-correlations, and find evidence for a smooth transition. My only issue with this result is that it has to be largely influenced by the parameters used. Namely, the IAPs, although they fire mostly during immobility, they also fire during movement; the opposite is true for MAPs. Thus, the authors are inclined to find a smooth transition.</italic> </p><p>First, we feel it is important to emphasize that in our previous description of cells with place specific activity during immobility (Kay et al., 2016), we focused on periods where animals had been immobile for &gt;2 seconds. Thus, it was possible that these cells were only active only during sustained immobility, and that their activity did not, in fact, overlap in time with the activity of movement-associated place cells. Alternatively, it was conceivable that we would see a very abrupt transition given that spatial representations expressed in the hippocampus on the time scale of theta can switch dramatically between consecutive theta cycles (Jezek et al., 2011). We have now clarified this possibility in the text:</p><p>âHowever, it is unknown whether transitions between movement and immobility spatial representations are smooth or abrupt. [â¦] In this case, MAP spatial representations would be replaced by IAP spatial representations and vice versa, resulting in no overlap between MAP and IAP spiking in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).â</p><p>We thus had to examine the activity of these neurons without an explicit cutoff that excluded transitional times. When we did so, we found that cells that were most active during immobility could also be active during periods immediately preceding and following bouts of movement, which did not have to be the case. While this may seem obvious in retrospect, the results could have been different and these analyses were necessary to determine the temporal structure of IAP and MAP activity during the transition periods.</p><p><italic>2) Differences in SWR power and duration could be explained by number of cells/spikes active in IAP and MAP SWRs. Have the authors tried to control for this? Given there are much fewer IAPs than MAPs I assume there are fewer cells/spikes active in IAP SWRs.</italic> </p><p>We entirely agree with reviewer #2 that the number of spikes affects the length and amplitude of SWRs. Our aim was to highlight that IAP-SWRs are smaller in amplitude and shorter in duration than MAP-SWRs or IAP and MAP -SWRs. This was the unexpected finding and we want to emphasize that in past work smaller amplitude SWRs were typically discarded from analysis. To clarify this point we have now added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref> showing the mean cell and spike number during SWRs.</p><p><italic>3) The modulation of PFC neurons by SWRs is basically a replication of the Jadhav et al. (2016) study showing coordinated reactivation between PFC and CA1. Showing PFC neurons are differentially recruited by IAP and MAP SWRs could just be explained by co-activity during tasks and that reactivations are recruited by CA1 (as indicated by Jadhav et al).</italic> </p><p>Here we think that we did not explain the differences between these findings and our previous work sufficiently. Our aim was not to replicate the finding of Jadhav et al., but to use those findings, which indicate PFC and hippocampal activity are coordinated, to further validate the existence of specific reactivations of representations associated with immobility across both structures.</p><p>In particular, our findings provide three main advances from this previous work:</p><p>A) PFC cells show contrasting modulation directions associated with different reactivated hippocampal representations.</p><p>Jadhav et al. found a subset of cells showed excitation while others showed inhibition during SWRs. This suggested PFC cells show stereotyped changes, either excitation or inhibition, during SWRs. This was based the modulation to all SWRs, without classifying their content.</p><p>In the current study, we show that activity of single PFC cells is differentially modulated around IAP- and MAP-SWRs. The most striking and key finding is that modulation of some PFC cells distinguishes between hippocampal immobility and movement reactivations by showing contrasting modulation directions. This is consistent with our previous work, but it is an unexpected pattern of change during SWRs. This finding is also novel in the context of other published results in rodent PFC (Remondes and Wilson, 2015; Siapas and Wilson, 1998; Wang and Ikemoto, 2016; Wierzynski et al., 2009). In all of these studies, PFC modulation during SWRs was examined for all SWRs without knowledge of potentially different SWR representations (IAP- or MAP-SWRs).</p><p>B) SWR related changes in PFC distinguish between movement and immobility associated hippocampal reactivations.</p><p>Jadhav et al. only examined coordination with CA1 activity using times when the animal was moving (speed &gt;5cm/s). The findings of that paper indicated that positive speed-correlated PFC cells, or movement associated representations, were excited during SWRs while negative speed-correlated PFC cells, or immobility associated representations, were inhibited.</p><p>Our findings go beyond Jadhav et al. to identify a unique subset of PFC cells that show excitation during IAP-SWRs but not MAP-SWRs. This indicates immobility associated representations in PFC can also be reactivated during SWRs. There was no way to identify these two categories from Jadhav et al. and thus no way to conclude whether or how movement and immobility associated PFC representations might be reactivated during SWRs.</p><p>Furthermore, transient excitation of PFC activity during SWRs that is associated with the reinstatement of representations is selective to one type of SWR. We found significantly fewer PFC cells that show excitation during both types of SWRs. This result demonstrates movement and immobility associated PFC representations are distinct, since very few PFC cells participate in the reinstate of both representations. Additionally, this reaffirms the distinction between movement and immobility SWRs that we found in the hippocampus and this distinction is also preserved in PFC.</p><p>C) The patterns of SWR related changes in PFC are consistent with their ongoing non-SWR activity and coordination with CA1.</p><p>Jadhav et al. characterized the relationship between PFC-CA1 coordination during SWRs and outside of SWRs but only with respect to periods of movement. This was done by limiting spiking data to times when the animal was moving &gt;5cm/s or when hippocampal theta was prominent. This was carried out for both SWR inhibited and excited PFC cells. This filtering of the data precludes any direct statements about PFC-CA1 activity for immobility associated representations. Our current work extends this finding to immobility periods and also goes beyond Jadhav et al. in another important way: we identified a specific group of cells that are inhibited during both immobility and movement SWRs and found that these cells show a pattern of ongoing activity during the task that does not overlap strongly with either IAPs or MAPs in the hippocampus. While this is certainly broadly consistent with our previous demonstration of coordinated reactivation across structures, the separate reactivation of immobility and movement related representations and the concomitant suppression of this distinct type of activity cannot be derived directly from our previous findings.</p><p><italic>4) The section on the Hebbian mechanism which could account for the described representational segregation can go into the Discussion, or be combined with the previous section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> be included as a supplement. It doesn't show a result, but rather is a mechanistic description of the effect.</italic> </p><p>We agree and have moved this to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>5) Is there any temporal structure to IAP and MAP SWRs? i.e. to IAP SWRs immediately precede/follow MAP SWRs? This would support the claim that IAPs are involved in replay of experiences. Presumably, MAP SWRs reactivate trajectories on the tracks, and each trajectory is flanked by a period of immobility. Thus, one might expect to observe this structure in the SWRs.</italic> </p><p>We calculated the cross-correlation between MAP-SWRs and IAP-SWRs but we do not find any strong relationship between the timing of MAP-SWRs and IAP-SWRs (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4âfigure supplement 6</xref>). However, in SWRs that contain both IAPs and MAPs, we found IAPs generally spike earlier than MAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and subsection âDistinct properties for SWRs involving movement and immobility representationsâ, last paragraph) while controlling for the duration of SWRs. This suggests although MAP-SWRs and IAP-SWRs are independent events, joint events are likely to reactivate trajectory representations originating from a location of immobility represented by IAPs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[â¦] I have one concern that I am sure the authors can address.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) It has not been tested whether IAP-associated SWRs exist in significant numbers that express a location other than the current location of the animal. It was shown that IAPs encoding similar locations co-fire together stronger during SWRs than those encoding different locations. It was also shown that IAPs that encode a location different from the current location of the animal exhibit correlated firing with IAP-SWRs overall. These two findings indicate but does not directly show that IAP-associated SWRs exist that on the assembly level encode a location other than the current location of the animal. This would be important to show otherwise one may not be able to refer to these events as reactivation. SWRs may just reflect the high frequency leakage of intense spiking in some periods when IAPs encoding the current location transiently increase their firing. Such processes may just reflect sensory-driven encoding of the location of the animal with transient synchronization, not reactivation.</italic> </p><p>We thank reviewer #3 for this insightful suggestion. For IAP pairs that are active at the same well location, we calculated their SWR coactivity during SWRs away from the well location where the IAPs were most active (not in field SWRs). The coactivity of IAP pairs during SWRs away from the current location of the animal is not significantly different from all SWRs, both of which are significantly higher than IAP pairs active at different locations (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). This suggests IAP pairs encoding similar locations are coactive during non-local SWRs to reactivate non-local immobility location representations.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>There is a single outstanding issue from reviewer 2 which remains to be addressed:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors have shown IAP SWRs have fewer cells and spikes active in them than MAP SWRs.
