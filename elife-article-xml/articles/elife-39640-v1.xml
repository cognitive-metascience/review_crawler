shear forces and propagate a response across a tissue is unknown. We found that applying exogenous shear at the midline of an epithelium induced a local, short-term deformation near the shear plane, and a long-term collective oscillatory movement across the epithelium that spread from the shear-plane and gradually dampened. Inhibiting actomyosin contraction or E-cadherin <italic>trans</italic>-cell adhesion blocked oscillations, whereas stabilizing actin filaments prolonged oscillations. Combining these data with a model of epithelium mechanics supports a mechanism involving the generation of a shear-induced mechanical event at the shear plane which is then relayed across the epithelium by actomyosin contraction linked through E-cadherin. This causes an imbalance of forces in the epithelium, which is gradually dissipated through oscillatory cell movements and actin filament turnover to restore the force balance across the epithelium.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MDCK</kwd><kwd>epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>cell mechanics</kwd><kwd>tissue mechanics</kwd><kwd>microfabrication</kwd><kwd>collective cell behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32CM007276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>Miguel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM118064</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>William James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CMMI 1662431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>William James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell movement toward and away from the midline of an epithelium over tens of hours are caused by spontaneous or externally-applied shear forces to eliminate force imbalances within the tissue.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanical forces play important roles at the single-cell and multicellular levels in tissue biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farge, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoffman et al., 2011</xref>), including in the regulation of cell shape and movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aegerter-Wilmsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Legoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clément et al., 2017</xref>), cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campinho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Streichan et al., 2014</xref>), cell-division orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">di Pietro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gloerich et al., 2017</xref>), and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aragona et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benham-Pyle et al., 2015</xref>). In general, these effects have been studied by observing the generation of cellular traction forces, or by applying external tensile forces to whole cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mukundan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Simmons et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tambe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zaritsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Micoulet et al., 2005</xref>). While a few studies have estimated the shear forces between cells from observations of cellular tractions ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tambe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zaritsky et al., 2015</xref>), none have perturbed a tissue with direct application of shear loading.</p><p>In-plane shear forces exist within any solid material under load, such as between groups of cells in tissues under applied or intrinsic forces. These forces are distinct from shear stresses applied by laminar liquid flow on top of cells that mimic the vasculature. Tissues spontaneously generate internal shear forces to maintain an external force balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Prost et al., 2015</xref>), and biopolymer networks have been observed to pull inward when sheared on a rheometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janmey et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In-plane shear forces are thought to affect the collective behavior of migrating cells in epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tambe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zaritsky et al., 2015</xref>). For example, the ridges that appear in the epithelial tissue forming the pupal <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing have been attributed to shear forces arising during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Etournay et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, shear forces between migrating cells of the prechordal plate in the zebrafish embryo and cells of the neurectoderm determine the position of the neural anlage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smutny et al., 2017</xref>). These studies suggest that local shear forces between groups of cells are important contributors to global effects in tissue motility and organ patterning. However, how local in-plane shear forces are spread throughout a tissue, which is important for understanding collective tissue behavior, is not understood in part because of the difficulty in applying direct and localized in-plane shear within a tissue.</p><p>In order to close this gap, here we examined epithelial mechanics after we applied in-plane shear with a novel silicon device. We determined that in-plane shear produces local deformations that are propagated into a global migratory response that distributes and dissipates forces through oscillations. Confined epithelia, similar to embryos or tumors, have been shown to oscillate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deforet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kocgozlu et al., 2016</xref>), but the mechanism driving these oscillations is unknown. Such oscillatory behavior may be important as an intrinsic collective cellular process that follows a shear-induced force imbalance, enabling the probing and maintenance of tension homeostasis within a developing tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We designed and deployed a new silicon device (adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mukundan and Pruitt, 2009</xref>]) to apply localized shear to an epithelium while simultaneously observing cell movements and measuring forces across the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>; Materials and methods). We fabricated devices from single crystal silicon-on-insulator wafers because silicon does not change elasticity over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hopcroft et al., 2010</xref>). The device consisted of two parallel 1000 μm x 250 μm suspended planks, one for force actuation and the other for force sensing. Moving the actuation plank applied 100 μm of shear (resulting in about one radian average cellular shear strain in cells near the mid-plane) at the midline of a Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cell monolayer cultured across the surface of both planks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; Materials and methods). We generated kymographs of cell movements using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), from which we mapped cell movements in the x- and y-directions relative to shear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; Materials and methods).

The spring-suspended, sensing plank was used to infer force. Four folded flexures were used to provide stability and force sensing for each actuator and each sensor in the shear direction, respectively (2017 IEEE. Reprinted, with permission, from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sadeghipour et al., 2017</xref>)).

This inward movement was expected because biopolymer networks develop an inward normal stress under applied shear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janmey et al., 2007</xref>). In our live epithelium, cells reversed y-direction movements at 7, 11, and 15 hr after shear with decreasing velocity magnitude: they behaved as a damped oscillator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>), with cells furthest from the shear-plane exhibiting the most movement in the y-direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Thus, inward/outward y-direction oscillations within the epithelium primarily represented collective cell movements rather than changes in individual cell morphology.

While these elements are largely sufficient for modeling normal viscoelastic materials and living materials over short time scales, they do not capture the long-term behavior of active, living materials. The MDCK epithelium in our study behaved as a damped oscillator over tens of hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E,H and I</xref>). Therefore, we inferred that an additional mechanical element was required to capture the time required for mechanical signals to pass through the epithelium, and for the epithelium to generate forces and respond. The addition of a mechanical signal storage and relay element called an <italic>inerter</italic>, placed in parallel with the viscoelastic components captured these damped oscillations over tens of hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The size of the inerter is inversely proportional to the rate of mechanical signal transduction within the epithelium (80–100 μm/h in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Addition of blebbistatin before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>) or after shear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) inhibited all y-direction oscillatory cell movements, even after washout. Consistent with deformation of a passive material, x-direction cell movements in the 2–3 cell layer deformation zone still occurred after treatment with blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), although the amount of cell movement was less than in the +Shear condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>).

In our mechanical model, this faster force relaxation time corresponds to decreased damping (c), and the inverse relationship between the size of the inerter and the rate of mechanical signal propagation leads to a much larger inerter value (b) than in the +Shear condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

In one phase, x-direction movements and deformations in 2–3 cell layers adjacent to the shear-plane are independent of the organization and contraction of the actin cytoskeleton, and E-cadherin <italic>trans</italic>-cell adhesion. These movements last several minutes, and do not oscillate except when actin dynamics are disrupted. In another phase, y-direction cell movements in the epithelium behave as a damped oscillator, requiring actomyosin contraction, actin filament dynamics, and E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion; these movements persist for tens of hours.</p><p>Based upon our simulations and experimental data, we suggest that transient local deformation of 2–3 cell layers adjacent to the shear-plane generates a mechanical event that is relayed across the epithelium over tens of hours. Cell movements at the shear-plane may induce tension on E-cadherin in cells adjacent to the deformation zone, and tension on E-cadherin increases actomyosin contraction and cell stiffening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borghi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buckley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">le Duc et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that the mechanical event from the deformed cells is transmitted throughout the epithelium via direct coupling of actomyosin contraction and E-cadherin cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borghi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buckley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">le Duc et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yonemura et al., 2010</xref>). Note that a temporary (1 h) loss of actomyosin contraction blocked long-term (24 h) y-direction cell oscillations even though actomyosin contraction was re-established after blebbistatin washout (+Blebb; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These data indicate that with the loss of actomyosin contractility, the generated mechanical signal dissipated, which enabled the epithelium to immediately reach a new external force balance. We suggest that dissipation of the mechanical signal under the -Shear and +Shear conditions occurred through oscillatory cell movements over &gt;15 h, which gradually damped global cell movements as a new external force balance was reached.</p><p>The longer force relaxation time constant for cells treated with jasplakinolide showed that damping was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) because of the longer, stable actin filaments that formed in the presence of jaspakinolide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Extrapolating from our experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, Experiment) beyond the period of observation indicates that oscillations would have persisted for approximately 80 h after shear. Jasplakinolide stabilizes and increases actin filament length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bubb et al., 1994</xref>), which could generate a more viscous actin network that causes the epithelium to act like a material with longer polymeric chains and high damping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). This change in physical characteristics may also explain why oscillations occurred in the x- as well as the y- direction after jasplakinolide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>). Thus, normal actin filament dynamics and turnover may be required for oscillation damping and dissipation of the mechanical signal generated by shear, which are required to reach a new force balance.</p><p>We can rule out the possibility that changes in cell density over the time of the experiment affected the response of the epithelium to shear. We detected little or no cell extrusion of dead cells (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), and the amount of cell division was similar under all experimental conditions with or without shear (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">7</xref>). Furthermore, the cell density was between 6,000–10,000 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>, due to temporary local variations, regardless of the application of shear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4vs</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>), and either in the presence of blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) or jasplakinolide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest a mechanism for the spontaneous oscillation of confined epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deforet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kocgozlu et al., 2016</xref>), which are important model systems for embryo development and tumor progression. Spontaneously generated shear forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Prost et al., 2015</xref>) in these epithelia produce a normal stress towards the shear plane, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janmey et al., 2007</xref>). These researchers posited that their results were relevant to the study of biological tissues and, indeed, may be applicable to our work because of the short time scales associated with reaching peak force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E, L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref>). These spontaneously generated shears lead to a force imbalance that is eliminated through the inward/outward oscillation of the epithelium. Here, we reconstituted a similar imbalance by applying a larger external shear force to the epithelium (+Shear), which led to a response similar in type but larger in magnitude to the condition where no external shear force was applied (-Shear). This new understanding was made possible by the ability to apply a localized and quantifiable shear force.</p><p>In summary, our novel device and results answer the question of how local shear on cells induces global changes in multicellular organization. Using an intrinsic mechanical signal storage and relay element, we capture the generation of forces by local shear in active, living tissue, and how this signal is propagated and eventually dissipated through oscillatory cell movements. Mechanistically, a force imbalance is generated through local deformation of a few cells by shear. The sensing and restoration of this force imbalance requires tension developed by actomyosin contraction linked to E-cadherin cell-cell adhesion. Our results provide new insights into the mechanical basis of collective cell movement in tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and stable cell lines</title><p>Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) type GII cells stably expressing E-cadherin:DsRed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Troxell et al., 2000</xref>) or truncated E-cadherin (T151, under control of a doxycycline-repressible promoter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Troxell et al., 2000</xref>) were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) low-glucose (200 mg/L) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (MDCK Ecad:DsRed) or tetracycline-free FBS (Clonetech, 631106) (T151), 250 μg/mL G418, and 1 g/L sodium bicarbonate, penicillin (30 μg/mL), kanamycin (1 mg/mL), and streptomycin (30 μg/mL).

Your article has been reviewed by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor and three reviewers.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This timely and intriguing manuscript addresses the response of epithelial sheets to shear forces. The authors show that oscillations in cell movements and actin turnover are used to respond to shear forces and return to equilibrium. The authors have conceived innovative and unique technology to explore the phenomenon and use a combination of experiments and theory to analyze the effect of shear on epithelial monolayers. Overall the manuscript is clearly and well written and the experimental data is of good quality and convincing. The reviewers agreed that the manuscript will be broadly of interest to several fields and the data acquired in this study are novel, unique, and are of high quality.</p><p>However, the reviewers agreed that are some issues that still need resolved and clarified. These include justification for key experimental parameters, further justification for physical interpretation of the data, key biological controls, and improved statistical analyses.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors base their model, which is at the heart of the study, on the assumption that the viscoelastic properties of the monolayer are not altered by shear (k is constant). Along these lines, in the simulations the oscillations appear more sustained and higher amplitude than in the actual experiments, which could be an indirect indication that the monolayer changes its mechanical response to shear, leading to non-linear dissipation of the oscillations. The authors should quantify the mechanical properties of the monolayer during the response to shear using direct or indirect methods (AFM, traction force etc., depending on what is compatible with their setup) to justify this assumption.</p><p>2) The role of E-cadherin is interesting, but the authors statement that the mechanism involves induction of tension on E-cadherin has not been sufficiently explored. The authors could look using IF at the α-18 epitope accessibility and vinculin recruitment as indirect but straight forward readouts of tension, or alternatively use laser ablation to quantify tension over junctions. Is the distribution of E-cadherin changes and does it display anisotropy in respect to the direction of shear?</p><p>3) The role of actin remodeling remains vague, and the statement on the role of actin at the end of the abstract appears too strong given that it is based on just the jasplakinolide experiment. Additional experiments should be performed to clarify this and justify the conclusion. Are there changes in the organization of the F-actin cytoskeleton? More x-linking, fiber elongation? What happens to myosin II activity over time and where is the myosin activity localized, is it at junctions. Does myosin activity oscillate?</p><p>4) The reviewers had concerns about the large shear forces and how they affect the cells. The authors should analyze whether cell adhesion, shapes or rearrangements are observed in response to shear, the experiments should be repeated at a lower shear strain amplitude to ensure that the data can be interpreted as a purely mechanical phenomena or other explanations of the data should be provided.</p><p>Additionally, is cell death/damage induced by the large shears? Evaluation of a live/dead cell stain could alleviate concerns that cell death is occurring. Similarly, the use of non-permeable cell dyes could be used to discern if micro-tears are forming in the cell membranes at the shear plane. Both of these control experiments should be performed to assess the affects of the shear strain on cell health in the MEMS device.</p><p>5) The asymmetric cell oscillations (being larger in y than in x, the shear direction) is understandable for the application of shear. However, the explanation for asymmetric oscillations for unsheared cells observed in Figure 1H-K is unclear. In particular, what is the origin of the symmetry breaking cue? Is this due to the different sizes of the x- and y-axes in the MEMS device? If square MEMS devices were used would asymmetric oscillations be observed? The authors claim the oscillations are governed by actin dynamics. Are the actomyosin networks of the cells asymmetrical in terms of their dynamics or distribution even in the absence of shear?</p><p>Currently, the observation of the oscillatory motions in both unsheared and shear conditions is interpreted as due to similar mechanisms, but different in amplitude due to differences in the amplitude of the applied shear. However, how the &quot;intrinsic forces&quot; and the applied force have similar directionality is unclear. The similarities of the oscillations in sheared and control conditions could be coincidental due to geometrical constraints of the MEMS device or other issues. In general, further analysis and explanation of the origin of intrinsic oscillations, and their relation to the shear-induced oscillations needs to be added to the manuscript. This could include the experiments suggested in this comment or other experiments deemed more pertinent by the authors.</p><p>6) There are a variety of mechanical models and/or physical systems used to explain the various aspects of the epithelia. At various times, the cell layer is considered analogous to a semi-flexible polymer network (work of Janmey), an active gel (work of Prost), and a mechanical circuit. These descriptions are not all compatible. For instance, comparing a cell layer to a semi-flexible polymer network is problematic, as this ignores the active nature of the cells as well as the presence of cell-cell contacts. The comparison to Janmey's work demonstrating the negative normal stresses is particularly problematic because of key microstructural and time scale differences between the systems. The origin of the negative normal stresses in Janmey's work is due to a non-symmetric force extension curve of an individual semi-flexible polymer. If the force-extension curves of cells exhibit a similar asymmetry is not known to this reviewer. Also, the responses observed in Janmey's work occurred within seconds, here the maximal &quot;stresses&quot; in the epithelial occur within hours. This suggests that the observations in this manuscript are due to other mechanisms, likely related to cell migration. If the authors wish to continue using the analogy to Janmey's work, they should demonstrate that cells display the negative normal deformations without active processes to match the conditions in Janmey's work. The easiest way to due to this is through ATP-depletion, but this will likely have substantial biological consequences. The mechanical circuit model, with the inclusion of the inverter, is a novel addition to the field and very interesting. Alternatively, the authors could choose to focus on this model, providing greater explanation of the physical interpretation of the inerter in terms mechanosensitive signaling and remove some the discussion of the polymer physics / active matter.</p><p>7) The mechanical circuits have a key time scale of 8 hours. This is a very long time-scale to be associated with actin filament dynamics in living cells, where actin turnover is usually quite high. Jasplak is also known to be a potent anti-proliferation agent. This suggest that cell division could play a key role is dissipate stress in this system. Experiments where cell proliferation is inhibited should be performed to demonstrate or exclude the role of cell division in the dissipation of stresses in the system.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39640.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors base their model, which is at the heart of the study, on the assumption that the viscoelastic properties of the monolayer are not altered by shear (k is constant).

We do not observe such statistically significant change in the period of oscillations with or without shear (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1C).</p><p>Second, the cells on this device are placed on suspended micro-fabricated silicone planks, and the device has been integrated with an upright Leica microscope. None of the common stiffness measurement tools, including those mentioned by the reviewer (e.g., AFM, traction force, etc.) are compatible with this setup.</p><p>Finally, we have presented the simplest mechanical model that reasonably matches the mechanical behavior of the cell monolayer by placing all elastic behavior into a single spring, all damping behavior into a single damper, and all mechanical signal storage and relay behavior into a single inerter. The addition of more springs, dampers and inerters in parallel or in series might refine the model but at the expense of increasing complexity. Moreover, such refinements would not alter our conclusion that a storage and relay element (inerter) is required to model monolayer behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The role of E-cadherin is interesting, but the authors statement that the mechanism involves induction of tension on E-cadherin has not been sufficiently explored. The authors could look using IF at the α-18 epitope accessibility and vinculin recruitment as indirect but straight forward readouts of tension, or alternatively use laser ablation to quantify tension over junctions. Is the distribution of E-cadherin changes and does it display anisotropy in respect to the direction of shear?</p></disp-quote><p>The role of E-cadherin in transmitting tension across cell-cell junctions has been well established (for example, Borghi et al., Yonemura et al., De Rooji et al.). However, instead of indirect methods for assessing whether there was tension on E-cadherin (alpha-18 epitope accessibility, or vinculin recruitment), we wanted to test directly whether tension on E-cadherin specifically <underline>was required</underline> for the observed oscillatory effects of shear on the cell monolayer. We used a well-characterized MDCK line that expresses a mutant E-cadherin that lacks the extracellular domain (T151), but also lacks endogenous E-cadherin. In T151 cells the tension on E-cadherin is necessarily zero, but cytoplasmic binding partners are retained, and other cell-cell junctions are preserved. Strikingly, we found that shear-induced oscillatory movements of cells completely disappeared. Since other cell-cell junctions are present in T151 cells, we can conclude that shear-induced tension transmission between cells in the monolayer is through E-cadherin. Staining for vinculin, for example, would not provide this critical information. Finally, we examined the localization of E-cadherin-RFP in cells and did not find any change in localization upon or during strain. Finally, the device has been integrated with an upright Leica microscope, and it is not possible to quantify tension over junctions with laser ablation. We will provide high magnification images of the cell-cell junctions as a supplementary figure in a revised manuscript to show no change in the localization of E-cadherin due to shear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The role of actin remodeling remains vague, and the statement on the role of actin at the end of the abstract appears too strong given that it is based on just the jasplakinolide experiment.

What happens to myosin II activity over time and where is the myosin activity localized, is it at junctions. Does myosin activity oscillate?</p></disp-quote><p>Our conclusion is based on the work of others reporting that jasplakinolide reduces actin depolymerization and increases actin filament length (Bubb et al., 1994). Determining the proper concentration of jasplakinolide is important, so that cell death is not induced but actin dynamics and organization are affected. This can be dependent on cell type and thus we chose 200 nM based on prior work of (Moore et al., 2014). They too used an epithelial cell type treated with 200 nM jasplakinolide and found that this led to a large immobilization of the F-actin network on the lateral sides of cell-cell junctions. We confirmed F-actin reorganization in our cells through IF. Moore et al. proposed that these large F-actin structures could lead to increased tension, as also reported by (Wu et al., 2014). Our work indicates that changes in epithelial <underline>mechanics</underline> may be altered by changes in the organization (dynamics, polymer length) of the F-actin cytoskeleton. Notably, (Kim et al., 2016) showed that such material would have high damping and, according to our mechanical model, changing that alone simulates the effects observed in sheared jasplakinolide-treated cells. Finally, determining structural changes of F-actin in cells treated with jasplakinolide is complex, particularly in the context of “cross-linking and fiber elongation” suggested by the reviewer, neither of which can be directly measured by imaging methods available on this device.</p><p>While we agree that analysis of myosin II localization could be interesting, our goal was to test whether actomyosin activity was required for shear-induced oscillatory movements of cells. Our analysis using blebbistatin shows directly that actomyosin activity is required; localization of myosin II would not enhance or change the conclusions from this direct experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The reviewers had concerns about the large shear forces and how they affect the cells.

However, we also reported that cells at the shear plane did change shape immediately after shear (Figure 1). We agree that this can be stated more directly in the text, and we can provide images of cells in the shear zone before and after shear at a higher magnification. As for cell adhesion and rearrangements, cells retain their neighbors throughout the experiment and any new cell adhesions are formed normally between divided cells and their neighbors. We will provide this information as a supplementary figure in the revised manuscript.</p><p>The cell monolayer does not rupture upon shear and throughout the shear experiments.

However, the explanation for asymmetric oscillations for unsheared cells observed in Figure 1H-K is unclear. In particular, what is the origin of the symmetry breaking cue? Is this due to the different sizes of the x- and y-axes in the MEMS device? If square MEMS devices were used would asymmetric oscillations be observed? The authors claim the oscillations are governed by actin dynamics. Are the actomyosin networks of the cells asymmetrical in terms of their dynamics or distribution even in the absence of shear?</p><p>Currently, the observation of the oscillatory motions in both unsheared and shear conditions is interpreted as due to similar mechanisms, but different in amplitude due to differences in the amplitude of the applied shear. However, how the &quot;intrinsic forces&quot; and the applied force have similar directionality is unclear. The similarities of the oscillations in sheared and control conditions could be coincidental due to geometrical constraints of the MEMS device or other issues. In general, further analysis and explanation of the origin of intrinsic oscillations, and their relation to the shear-induced oscillations needs to be added to the manuscript. This could include the experiments suggested in this comment or other experiments deemed more pertinent by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>(Kocgozlu et al., 2016) and (Deforet et al., 2014) used MDCK cells cultured on circular patterns, and found that the cells underwent periods of spontaneous oscillations in direct proportion to the pattern diameter. Significantly, on patterns with a diameter of 500 μm (the same as the combined width of the two planks in our shear device) they observed intrinsic oscillations with a period of ~8 h which we also observed. Neither Kocgozlu et al., Deforet et al., nor we know the origin of spontaneous oscillations in cell monolayers; a speculation is that the oscillations result from the spontaneous shear forces in the monolayer (Prost et al., 2015) where these spontaneous shear forces create tension forces pointing inwards (Janmey et al., 2007) that lead to long-term inward/outward oscillations. We will modify the text in the manuscript to emphasize this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There are a variety of mechanical models and/or physical systems used to explain the various aspects of the epithelia. At various times, the cell layer is considered analogous to a semi-flexible polymer network (work of Janmey), an active gel (work of Prost), and a mechanical circuit. These descriptions are not all compatible. For instance, comparing a cell layer to a semi-flexible polymer network is problematic, as this ignores the active nature of the cells as well as the presence of cell-cell contacts. The comparison to Janmey's work demonstrating the negative normal stresses is particularly problematic because of key microstructural and time scale differences between the systems. The origin of the negative normal stresses in Janmey's work is due to a non-symmetric force extension curve of an individual semi-flexible polymer. If the force-extension curves of cells exhibit a similar asymmetry is not known to this reviewer. Also, the responses observed in Janmey's work occurred within seconds, here the maximal &quot;stresses&quot; in the epithelial occur within hours. This suggests that the observations in this manuscript are due to other mechanisms, likely related to cell migration. If the authors's wish to continue using the analogy to Janmey's work, they should demonstrate that cells display the negative normal deformations without active processes to match the conditions in Janmey's work. The easiest way to due to this is through ATP-depletion, but this will likely have substantial biological consequences. The mechanical circuit model, with the inclusion of the inverter, is a novel addition to the field and very interesting. Alternatively, the authors could choose to focus on this model, providing greater explanation of the physical interpretation of the inerter in terms mechanosensitive signaling and remove some the discussion of the polymer physics / active matter.</p></disp-quote><p>We sought to place our work in the context of previous studies by others. The various models and mechanisms that the reviewer notes have been ways for different groups to study the effects of mechanical perturbations on biological materials – all of which necessarily simplify the physical world. Janmey et al., clearly state that their results are applicable to living biological tissues, including the movement of organelles within cells and the effects of blood pressure on vascular tissues. We have taken care to benefit from Janmey’s work and other papers in very specific instances where the assumptions are applicable, and not in a disorganized or overly broad way. In the context of the work by Prost, we simply make the point that the physics of an active gel leads to a spontaneous shear term. When combined with the work of Janmey, the normal stress resulting from this spontaneous shear is why we observe cell oscillations even when a shear force is not actively applied.</p><p>Epithelial migration “average velocity” and not “stress” that peaks 45 minutes after shear. As shown in Figure 2A, Figure 3E, Figure 3L, and Figure 4E, the measured force peaks immediately after shear, and the units of the x-axis on these plots is minutes not hours. We can update the text to further clarify this point. At these short times scales, which are too fast for active processes to take place, the work of Janmey is quite relevant. As we note, some time is required for the mechanical signal about the shear to pass through the epithelium and lead to the peak velocity.</p><p>We note that the addition of the inerter helped us understand the long time-scales we observed in our data, and the work from Janmey and Prost gave insights on force imbalances that are caused by shear in the monolayer in the short term. Together our work reveals a unique mechanical mechanism of how tissues relay and dissipate force imbalances, which requires it to be active, and is affected when actin polymer length is increased. We will modify the text to emphasize assumptions and conditions that allowed us to benefit from their conclusions.</p><p>Finally, given the volume of medium, the small number of cells and the length of the experiment we believe that ATP depletion is extremely unlikely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The mechanical circuits have a key time scale of 8 hours. This is a very long time-scale to be associated with actin filament dynamics in living cells, where actin turnover is usually quite high. Jasplak is also known to be a potent anti-proliferation agent. This suggest that cell division could play a key role is dissipate stress in this system. Experiments where cell proliferation is inhibited should be performed to demonstrate or exclude the role of cell division in the dissipation of stresses in the system.</p></disp-quote><p>We observe cell divisions throughout the course of all experiments, including those with jasplakinolide. Therefore, any differences in the behavior must result from the treatments, which were different, and not cell division, which was present under all conditions.</p><p>To exclude the role of cell divisions in the dissipation of stresses in this system we will provide cell density plots from the existing data of drug treated cells.
