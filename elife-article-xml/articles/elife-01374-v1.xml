(‘biorientation’) prior to their segregation during mitosis. Biorientation relies on the correction of erroneous attachments by the aurora B kinase, which destabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments that lack tension. Incorrect attachments are also avoided because sister kinetochores are intrinsically biased towards capture by microtubules from opposite poles. Here, we show that shugoshin acts as a pericentromeric adaptor that plays dual roles in biorientation in budding yeast. Shugoshin maintains the aurora B kinase at kinetochores that lack tension, thereby engaging the error correction machinery. Shugoshin also recruits the chromosome-organizing complex, condensin, to the pericentromere. Pericentromeric condensin biases sister kinetochores towards capture by microtubules from opposite poles. Our findings uncover the molecular basis of the bias to sister kinetochore capture and expose shugoshin as a pericentromeric hub controlling chromosome biorientation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01374.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01374.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01374.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a cell divides to create two new daughter cells, it must produce a copy of each of its chromosomes.

These proteins are found in a region called the pericentromere, which surrounds the area on the chromosomes that the microtubules attach to, but the details of their involvement in biorientation are not fully understood. Now Verzijlbergen et al. have exploited sophisticated genetic techniques in yeast to explore how shugoshin proteins work.</p><p>These experiments showed that the shugoshin protein helps to recruit condensin—a protein that keeps the DNA organized within the chromosome—to the pericentromere to assist with biorientation. It also keeps aurora B kinase—one of the enzymes that helps to correct errors during cell division—in the pericentromere when a microtubule attaches to the wrong chromosome. These results help us understand how a ‘hub’ in the pericentromere ensures biorientation. The next challenge will be to understand how this hub is disassembled after biorientation to allow error-free cell division to proceed. As shugoshins have been found to be damaged in some cancers, understanding the workings of this hub could also shed new light on how they contribute to disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01374.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01374.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>biorientation</kwd><kwd>shugoshin</kwd><kwd>condensin</kwd><kwd>aurora B</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>[090903], [084229], [077707], [092076], [091020]</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verzijlbergen</surname><given-names>Kitty F</given-names></name><name><surname>Nerusheva</surname><given-names>Olga O</given-names></name><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Kerr</surname><given-names>Alastair</given-names></name><name><surname>Clift</surname><given-names>Dean</given-names></name><name><surname>de Lima Alves</surname><given-names>Flavia</given-names></name><name><surname>Rappsilber</surname><given-names>Juri</given-names></name><name><surname>Marston</surname><given-names>Adele L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verzijlbergen</surname><given-names>Kitty F</given-names></name><name><surname>Marston</surname><given-names>Adele L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Scottish Universities Life Sciences Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marston</surname><given-names>Adele L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Darwin Trust of Edinburgh</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nerusheva</surname><given-names>Olga O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Shugoshin proteins help to align chromosomes so that copies of the same chromosome attach to microtubules from opposite poles during cell division.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis relies on the capture of newly duplicated sister chromatids by microtubules emanating from opposite poles. This is possible because on each chromosome a multi-subunit kinetochore assembles on a region of DNA, known as a centromere, to mediate attachment to microtubules. The proper attachment of sister kinetochores to opposite poles, called biorientation, generates tension owing to sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tanaka, 2010</xref>). Sister kinetochores are inherently biased towards capture by microtubules from opposite poles, yet how this is achieved is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Indjeian and Murray, 2007</xref>). Kinetochore geometry is thought to position microtubule binding sites in a ‘back-to-back’ orientation during mitosis and this has been hypothesized to contribute to biorientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hauf and Watanabe, 2004</xref>). Where erroneous tension-less attachments do occur, they are destabilized by the aurora B kinase, providing a further opportunity for biorientation to be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tanaka, 2010</xref>). Shugoshin proteins are localized to the region surrounding the centromere, known as the pericentromere, and have a conserved, yet poorly understood, function in biorientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Indjeian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kiburz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutiérrez-Caballero et al., 2012</xref>). In fission yeast, frogs, and human cells, shugoshins enable biorientation, at least in part, through recruitment of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC) containing aurora B to the pericentromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kawashima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vanoosthuyse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kelly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsukahara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamagishi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rivera et al., 2012</xref>). Shugoshins also have a more defined role in protecting pericentromeric cohesin from premature loss during meiosis and mammalian mitosis; a function attributed to the recruitment of a specific form of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to the pericentromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kitajima et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marston et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rabitsch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Riedel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Though fundamental for accurate chromosome segregation, the role of shugoshin in biorientation has remained unclear. Budding yeast has a single shugoshin, Sgo1, which protects pericentromeric cohesin during meiosis but does not regulate cohesion during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kitajima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marston et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Indjeian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kiburz et al., 2008</xref>). We have exploited this system to investigate the sister kinetochore biorientation function of Sgo1, independently of effects on cohesion. Our analysis leads us to the unanticipated discovery that shugoshin collaborates with the chromosome-organising complex, condensin, in chromosome biorientation. Moreover, we provide the first molecular insight into how sister kinetochores are biased towards capture by microtubules from opposite, rather than the same, pole.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Shugoshin is important for chromosome biorientation</title><p>To investigate the role of Sgo1 in biorientation we analyzed <italic>sgo1</italic> null cells (<italic>sgo1Δ)</italic> together with three missense mutants: <italic>sgo1-100, sgo1-700</italic> and <italic>sgo1-3A.</italic> The <italic>sgo1-3A</italic> mutant was engineered to disrupt the binding site for PP2A-Rts1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2009</xref>) whereas <italic>sgo1-100</italic> and <italic>sgo1-700</italic> were isolated in a screen due to their inability to sense a lack of tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Indjeian et al., 2005</xref>).

We compared the ability of these Sgo1 mutants to establish bipolar attachments at metaphase after entering the cell cycle in the absence of microtubules. We used strains with spindle pole bodies (SPBs) labeled with tdTomato (<italic>SPC42-</italic>tdTomato), the centromere of chromosome IV labeled with GFP (<italic>CEN4-</italic>GFP) and with <italic>CDC20</italic> under control of the methionione-repressible promoter (<italic>pMET-CDC20</italic>), to enable metaphase arrest by addition of methionine. All strains were released from a G1 arrest into nocodazole- and methionine-containing medium to depolymerize microtubules and induce a metaphase arrest before nocodazole was washed out to allow metaphase spindle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Under these conditions, initial kinetochore-microtubule attachments are frequently erroneous because they occur before spindle pole bodies have migrated apart, leading to a strong reliance on the error correction process driven by Aurora B.

Consistent with this idea, proper Brn1 association with the centromere in mitosis requires both the Scc2 protein that is required for cohesin loading onto chromosomes and subunits of the kinetochore (Iml3/Chl4) that target Scc2 to centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernius et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D′Ambrosio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), However, unlike in fission yeast, the monopolin subunit Lrs4 is not required for Brn1 association with the centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brito et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).

The molecular basis of the bias towards sister kinetochore biorientation has therefore remained unknown. If our hypothesis that condensin creates a preferred pericentromeric framework upon which the error correction machinery can act is correct, we reasoned that condensin could also impose a bias on kinetochores to biorient. When SPBs are allowed to separate before microtubules attach to sister kinetochores, they tend to biorient normally, even when error correction is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Indjeian and Murray, 2007</xref>). To test the requirement of shugoshin and condensin for sister kinetochore bias, we allowed cells to progress from G1 into the cell cycle for 1.5 hr to allow SPB separation, before treating the cells with nocodazole for 30 min. Subsequently, nocodazole was washed out and we simultaneously began filming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We recorded the percentage of cells with separated SPBs at the start of filming that separated <italic>CEN4-GFP</italic> foci at least once during the observation period (approximately 30 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3 media4">Videos 3 and 4</xref>).

To explore the relationship between shugoshin and its binding partners further, we asked whether the Sgo1-100, Sgo1-700 and Sgo1-3A proteins retain their interaction with condensin. We found that Sgo1-700 failed to associate with Brn1, whereas Sgo1-100 and Sgo1-3A retained Brn1 association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).

Sgo1 enables error correction by retention of Ipl1 (aurora B) at the centromere. Sgo1 separately recruits condensin to the pericentromere, which both imposes a bias on sister kinetochores to biorient and enables effective error correction.</p><p>Our findings provide the first molecular explanation for the bias to sister kinetochore biorientation. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Indjeian and Murray (2007)</xref> demonstrated the existence of a bias to sister kinetochore biorientation in the <italic>sgo1-100</italic> mutant, which is defective in the error correction process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Indjeian et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with this study, we confirmed that the <italic>sgo1-100</italic> mutant retains this bias to sister kinetochore biorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>). Through analysis of both the <italic>sgo1-700</italic> and <italic>sgo1Δ</italic> mutants we have, nevertheless uncovered a role for Sgo1 in biasing sister kinetochores towards biorientation. Moreover, our data provide a molecular explanation for the loss of sister kinetochore bias in <italic>sgo1-700</italic> and <italic>sgo1Δ</italic> cells: that is the inability to associate with and recruit condensin to centromeres. In contrast, <italic>sgo1-100</italic> and <italic>sgo1-3A</italic> cells, which can enable condensin recruitment to centromeres are proficient in the bias to sister kinetochore biorientation.</p><p>Condensin is a cohesin-related complex that can form a ring-like structure and has been proposed to organize chromosomes by bringing distant chromosomal sequences together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cuylen and Haering, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cuylen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirano, 2012</xref>). The mechanism by which condensin is loaded onto and subsequently maintained on chromosomes is largely unknown. Here, we have identified shugoshin as an important determinant of condensin association with the pericentromere. Indeed, the pericentromeres and rDNA appear to be the predominant, if not the only sites of condensin association with chromosomes in mitosis. Our findings have also suggested a hierarchy of assembly at the pericentromere. In contrast to the idea that the Scc2/4 cohesin-loader complex loads condensin directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D’Ambrosio et al., 2006</xref>), we propose that Scc2/4 indirectly affects condensin localization through loading cohesin, which we show is required for the pericentromeric association of Sgo1. In support of this idea, only cohesin and not condensin subunits were identified in Scc2/4 immunoprecipiates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernius et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, since Shugoshin relies on cohesin for its association with the pericentromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kiburz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamagishi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), the importance of cohesin in defining kinetochore geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sakuno et al., 2009</xref>) could be to enable proper condensin association with chromosomes by recruiting shugoshin to the pericentromere. How might condensin shape a favorable pericentromeric geometry? While the molecular function of condensin is not well understood, condensin is known to alter the structural properties of centromeres that affect their dynamic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ribeiro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stephens et al., 2011</xref>). We propose that condensin organizes the pericentromeric chromatin to provide a structural integrity to the pericentromere that enables it to adopt a ‘back-to-back’ geometry that orients sister kinetochores in opposite directions, thereby favoring their biorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Although our data indicate that condensin is important to increase the efficiency of biorientation, we do not believe that it is essential for this process in budding yeast, provided that error correction machinery is intact. However, budding yeast centromeres are relatively simple and only a single microtubule contacts each kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Winey et al., 1995</xref>) increasing the probability that correct attachments can be made by chance. This is not the case for organisms with more complex centromeres where it is likely that kinetochore geometry plays a major role in ensuring sister kinetochore biorientation is achieved.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01374.030</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model for dual role of Sgo1 in biorientation is shown.</title><p>Shugoshin ensures sister kinetochore biorientation through two mechanisms. First, early in the cell cycle, shugoshin mediates the enrichment of condensin within the pericentromere. We propose that condensin enables the pericentromere to adopt a geometry that favors the capture of sister kinetochores by microtubules from opposite poles, thereby biasing them to biorient. Second, shugoshin maintains aurora B at the pericentromere for those kinetochores that fail to biorient and come under tension. Aurora B destabillizes these tension-less attachments, thereby providing a further chance to for sister kinetochores to make the appropriate, tension-generating attachments. We suggest that condensin facilitates this ‘error correction’ process by conferring a rigid structure to the pericentromere upon which aurora B can act.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01374.030">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01374.030</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01374-fig10-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>In addition to influencing pericentromeric structure through condensin, shugoshins also confer distinct properties to pericentromeric cohesin through PP2A, both in meiosis and mammalian mitosis, as well as influence kinetochore–microtubule interactions through aurora B.

The region of chrXII containing rDNA (451400 bp to 490600 bp) was removed and studied separately using bedtools (version v2.16.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). As this region is highly repetitive and contained a high density of reads, duplicate reads were not removed for this analysis as it would not be possible to differentiate duplicate reads from independent fragments. All data shown are normalized to the number of mapped reads per million total mapped reads [RPM]. Total mapped reads were calculated after any processing was done for rDNA or duplicate read removal.</p><p>During the amplification step prior to sequencing, multiple identical reads will be generated. Due to the low yield of total DNA precipitating with Brn1-6HA in <italic>sgo1Δ</italic> cells, we were concerned that the small number of precipitating sequences would be biased for amplification. To avoid this problem, we removed PCR replicates from our analysis. However, since this would also remove bona fide identical sequences from our dataset, we simultaneously analyzed the data with these reads present and compared the two data sets where all 16 centromeres were considered together. To do this, 100 bp windows were examined that extended 25 kb in each direction of every centromere, and a local maximum of the number of mapped reads was taken. The comparison of this data with and without PCR replicates included can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> (unfiltered data) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> (PCR replicates removed). Both approaches led to very similar conclusions, therefore for all other data presented we used the unfiltered data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>TAP pulldowns and mass spectrometry</title><p>To grow cells for purification of Sgo1 from cycling cells, 4 L of YPDA culture were inoculated to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.2 and grown at room temperature for 6 hr. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 μM of dithiobis(succunimidylpropionate) (DSP; Proteochem, Loves Park, IL) crosslinker for 30 min at room temperature before cell pellets were drop-frozen in liquid nitrogen as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernius et al.

Alpha factor was washed out and cells were released from the G1 arrest into rich medium containing methionine and nocodazole (YPDA + Met + NOC) plus the appropriate drugs (NAPP1, NAA). Methionine represses <italic>pMET-CDC20</italic> expression, resulting in a metaphase arrest and nocodazole depolymerizes microtubules. After 3 hr, a sample was extracted (t = 0) and nocodazole was washed out by filtering in the presence of methionine and cultures were released into YPDA + Met to allow spindles to reform while maintaining the metaphase arrest. Samples were taken at 20 min intervals. Samples were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, before washing in PBS and resuspending in DAPI for microscopy. Samples with two separated SPC42-tdTomato foci were scored as containing one or two <italic>CEN4-GFP</italic> foci. Typically 200, and at least 100, cells were scored for each timepoint.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Microfluidics and image analysis</title><p>For live cell imaging, cells were loaded onto the Onix Microfluidic Perfusion system (CellAsic, Hayward, CA) and visualized using a Deltavision Elite (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) coupled to a Cascade 2 EMCCD camera with temperature control to 30°C.

In brief, yeast are selected from a reference DIC image taken at each time point. The yeast are automatically thresholded and the centre pixel from each red and green spot is then calculated. The distances between the spots can then be calculated and the measurements output to a text file for analysis using microsoft excel.

Cells were released in the chamber into medium containing nocodazole (to depolymerize microtubules) and methionine (to deplete <italic>CDC20</italic> and induce a metaphase arrest) for 30 min. The addition of nocodazole to G1 cells prevents SPB separation because this requires microtubules. Therefore, under these conditions, microtubules do not separate which leads to a high rate of monoorientation once microtubules are allowed to reform. This leads to a strong reliance on the error correction machinery to establish biorientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Indjeian and Murray, 2007</xref>). After 30 min, nocodazole was washed out, all the time maintaining the <italic>CDC20</italic> arrest by inclusion of methionine in the media.

The ‘switching rate’ was calculated by dividing the number of times a cell alternated between one and two <italic>CEN4-GFP</italic> foci by the total time in which two SPB foci were consecutively visible. The average switching rate was determined for all cells in which two SPB foci were detected for at least four consecutive frames.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study the authors have investigated how sister kinetochores in budding yeast are biased towards biorientation. The authors have found that the Shuoshin protein (Sgo1) is important to promote biorientation through two mechanisms: through binding to the chromosome passenger complex, and through a newly identified association with the condensin complex. The authors show that Sgo1 is able to recruit condensin to centromeres or to ectopic sites. The authors identify a mutation in Sgo1 that perturbs binding to condensin and that this association is important for subsequent biorientation. The authors conclude that condensin is required to form a rigid back-to-back structure such that sister kinetochores are biased towards microtubule capture from opposite spindle poles.</p><p>Overall this is an interesting study that reveals new insights into how budding yeast chromosomes biorent, and uncover a new role for condensin in centromere and kinetochore behaviour.</p><p>There are, however, a number of substantive concerns that preclude publication in its present form. In particular, the conclusion that condensin recruitment alters kinetochore geometry to promote orientation towards opposite poles requires further supporting evidence. Moreover, the authors themselves do not appear to be certain whether there is a direct link between Sgo1 and condensin recruitment. They argue that Sgo1 is sufficient for condensin targeting to the pericentromere by over-expressing Sgo1 and measuring Brn1 accumulation. However, they previously state that Sgo1's effect on condensin is indirect, mediated through Scc2/4 (cohesin). There are also concerns regarding the validity of the approach the authors use to measure bi-orientation and the presentation of the ChIP analyses. The latter prevents a critical evaluation of the data quality and missing information will need to be added.</p><p>Concerns to be addressed:</p><p>1) The evidence for a direct interaction between Sgo1 and condensin is limited. Only a small number (especially considering the large size of all five condensin subunits) of condensin peptides can be identified in the mass-spec analysis of Sgo1 purifications. In fact, the highest scoring condensin subunit (by numbers of found peptides; Ycg1) ranks number 137 in the list of proteins identified (see supplemental Excel file). Moreover, only a minute fraction of condensin (less than 0.01%? See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3 D and E</xref>) can be detected by Western blotting in Sgo1 immunoprecipitations. Since both Sgo1 and condensin are enriched at centromeres, it is very likely that a small amount of condensin co-precipitates with Sgo1 because both proteins are bound to the same stretch of chromatin. In addition, the authors add amine-reactive crosslinkers to the cell extracts in both experiments (a fact they should mention at least in the figure legends and not only in the methods section), which will result in the formation of protein-chromatin crosslinks. The authors will need to repeat the pull-down experiments after DNase digestion and in the absence of crosslinker in order to rule out these concerns.</p><p>A second argument for a role of Sgo1 in condensin loading is that centromeric condensin levels increase upon Sgo1 overexpression. The increase in condensin binding could, however, result from the delay in anaphase onset caused by Sgo1 overexpression. Would condensin levels remain unchanged if anaphase onset were delayed by other means?</p><p>Ectopic recruitment of condensin by Sgo1 fused to TetR seems rather inefficient, with a two-fold enrichment (and considerable variation?). The authors should at least test whether ectopic recruitment can be measured at both sides of the TetO repeats. Yet a much better test whether condensin recruitment by Sgo1 is significant would be to employ the TetO-TetR approach to tether to centromeres an Sgo1 mutant that can otherwise not bind (e.g., Sgo1-100 or Sgo1-700) and assay whether this restores condensin levels and chromosome bi-orientation.</p><p>An explanation for the altered binding profiles of condensin measured by ChIP-seq might be changes in cohesin accumulation at centromeres in the Sgo1 mutants. The authors need to check by ChIP-qPCR (and ideally also ChIP-seq) whether cohesin levels at centromeres are affected in the Sgo1 mutant.</p><p>2) The authors monitor the splitting of a sister centromere pair as a measure for sister chromatid bi-orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig5">Figures 1A-C,F, 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>). The reduction of sister centromere splitting observed in the Sgo1 and condensin mutants could, however, equally well result from an increase in centromeric sister chromatid cohesion. An increase in centromeric cohesion would prevent splitting of bi-oriented sister chromatids.</p><p>One possibility to distinguish whether chromatid pairs have attached to spindle microtubules from only one spindle pole or whether chromatids have bi-oriented but their centromeres cannot separate would be to score centromere-spindle pole body (SPB) distances in the live cell microscopy assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B-F</xref>). If centromeres were bi-oriented but merely failed to split, they should be positioned at equal distances to both SPBs. If sister centromeres failed to bi-orient, they should frequently be found close to one SPB. Alternatively, the authors could release cells from the Cdc20 arrest and allow them to enter anaphase, then score whether sister centromeres segregate to one pole or to opposite poles (see Indjeian and Murray, CurBiol 2007).</p><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6 and 7</xref> show a mild, real defect in biorientation but don't specifically address the of kineteochore geometry. The authors should either perform further experiments to support their hypothesis or confine their “geometric bias” to speculation in the Discussion.</p><p>3) Most of the graphs that represent the results from ChIP-qPCR experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig5 fig7">Figures 1A, E, 2C, D, 5G, 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 3</xref>) lack information that is essential to evaluate the data. What do the column plots represent? Do they show mean values, and if yes, from how many PCR runs and how many independent immunoprecipitation experiments? What do the error bars represent? The legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D-F</xref> is missing completely.</p><p>Taking into account the possible variability between individual ChIP-qPCR experiments, careful statistical analysis will be required to evaluate the significance of the observed differences. For example, the values measured at CEN4 for the same wild-type strain (AM3513) in two independent Ipl1 HA-ChIP experiments vary 4-fold (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C and D</xref>), calling into question whether the 2-fold reduction in ChIP signals in the Sgo1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) is significant. Similarly, the ChIP signal at CEN4 measured for the Sgo1-100 mutant in G1 phase is more than 2-fold higher than the signal for wildtype Sgo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Is the 4-fold increase in Sgo1 ChIP signals during mitosis (e.g., 2-fold when compared to the Sgo1-100 mutant) then still significant?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01374.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The evidence for a direct interaction between Sgo1 and condensin is limited.

In fact, the highest scoring condensin subunit (by numbers of found peptides; Ycg1) ranks number 137 in the list of proteins identified (see supplemental Excel file)</italic>.</p><p>The Excel file submitted with the original manuscript was unsorted and did not take the contaminant proteins that also co-purify with the “no tag” control into account. When contaminants are taken into account, the condensin subunits rank number 8 and 26 in the list of proteins identified, in cycling and arrested cells, respectively. We have revised the file with the list of proteins sorted to exclude contaminant proteins.</p><p><italic>Moreover, only a minute fraction of condensin (less than 0.01%? See</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figures 3 D and E</italic></xref><italic>) can be detected by Western blotting in Sgo1 immunoprecipitations. Since both Sgo1 and condensin are enriched at centromeres, it is very likely that a small amount of condensin co-precipitates with Sgo1 because both proteins are bound to the same stretch of chromatin. In addition, the authors add amine-reactive crosslinkers to the cell extracts in both experiments (a fact they should mention at least in the figure legends and not only in the methods section), which will result in the formation of protein-chromatin crosslinks. The authors will need to repeat the pull-down experiments after DNase digestion and in the absence of crosslinker in order to rule out these concerns</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important point. We performed the experiment suggested by the reviewers and found that the amount of the Ycs4 condensin subunit co-purifying with Sgo1 was independent of treatment with cross-linker or DNase. This shows that the interaction between Sgo1 and condensin is not dependent on DNA. This data is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>. We agree that the amount of condensin that purifies with Sgo1 is a small fraction of the total cellular condensin. However, this is expected as our Brn1 ChIP-Seq showed that the bulk of condensin is associated with the rDNA and would not be expected to bind to Sgo1.</p><p><italic>A second argument for a role of Sgo1 in condensin loading is that centromeric condensin levels increase upon Sgo1 overexpression. The increase in condensin binding could, however, result from the delay in anaphase onset caused by Sgo1 overexpression. Would condensin levels remain unchanged if anaphase onset were delayed by other means</italic>?</p><p>To exclude the possibility that Brn1’s chromosomal enrichment in <italic>SGO1-</italic>overexpressing cells was a consequence of the metaphase arrest caused by high levels of Sgo1, we overexpressed <italic>SGO1</italic> in cells arrested in mitosis by treatment with nocodazole. Measurement of Brn1 association with two centromeric sites and a pericentromeric site by ChIP-qPCR showed that <italic>SGO1</italic> overexpression also increased Brn1 levels in cells arrested in mitosis, arguing against the idea that the centromeric enrichment of Brn1 is solely due to the cell cycle block caused by <italic>SGO1</italic> overexpression. This data is presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref> in the revised version.</p><p><italic>Ectopic recruitment of condensin by Sgo1 fused to TetR seems rather inefficient, with a two-fold enrichment (and considerable variation?). The authors should at least test whether ectopic recruitment can be measured at both sides of the TetO repeats. Yet a much better test whether condensin recruitment by Sgo1 is significant would be to employ the TetO-TetR approach to tether to centromeres an Sgo1 mutant that can otherwise not bind (e.g., Sgo1-100 or Sgo1-700) and assay whether this restores condensin levels and chromosome bi-orientation</italic>.</p><p>In the original manuscript, we used a primer set ∼800 bp to the left of the <italic>tetO</italic> repeats. Following sonication during the ChIP protocol, the majority of fragments are much shorter than this (in the range of ∼200 bp), so a primer set at this distance is expected to only inefficiently detect proteins recruited to the <italic>tetO</italic> repeats themselves. As suggested by the reviewers, we have now analyzed a site on the other side of the <italic>tetO</italic> repeats which is much closer (∼50bp) to the tethering site. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, F</xref> in the revised manuscript, both Brn1 (condensin) and Rts1 (PP2A) are efficiently recruited to this site, and Ipl1 (CPC) less so. This result now provides compelling evidence for the direct recruitment of condensin by Sgo1.</p><p>As further suggested by the reviewers, we also tethered the Sgo1-100, Sgo1-700 and Sgo1-3A proteins to the centromere in a strain that otherwise lacks <italic>SGO1</italic>. As we showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, normally, both Sgo1-100 and Sgo1-700 fail to be maintained on centromeres. However, Sgo1-100 can bind condensin, whereas Sgo1-700 cannot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This finding is recapitulated in the tethering experiment. Only Sgo1-100 and not Sgo1-700 is capable of recruiting Brn1 (condensin) to the tethering site. As expected, tethered Sgo1-3A, which localizes to centromeres and associates with condensin is also able to recruit condensin to the tethering site. This data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>. Together with the finding that only the <italic>sgo1-700</italic> mutant loses the bias to sister kinetochore biorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>), this provides strong evidence that Sgo1 biases sister kinetochores for biorientation through condensin recruitment.</p><p>We also tested the ability of the tethered Sgo1 proteins to rescue sister kinetochore biorientation after treating an unsynchronous population with nocodazole and examining segregation of the chromosome to which Sgo1-TetR-GFP is tethered in anaphase cells after nocodazole washout. Similar to the assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig7">Figures 1C and 7B</xref>, accurate segregation in this assay would require the activity of the error correction machinery. As expected, due to the impaired ability of all Sgo1 mutant proteins to maintain Ipl1 association with the centromere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>) only tethered wild type Sgo1 was able to partially rescue the segregation of the chromosome to which it was tethered (chromosome IV; shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref>). For technical reasons (both <italic>SGO1-tetR-GFP</italic> and <italic>tetR-tdTomato</italic> are integrated into the same genomic locus), it was necessary to perform this experiment in diploid cells and therefore we cannot presently test the ability of these tethered constructs to retain sister kinetochore bias (we cannot easily arrest and release the cells from G1 as they are not sensitive to mating pheromone). Moreover, other unpublished findings in the lab have suggested that the dynamicity of Sgo1 on centromeres is key to its regulation and important for accurate segregation so it is likely that Sgo1 tethering affects its function. Indeed, even tethered wild type Sgo1-tetR-GFP is not fully able to rescue the mis-segregation of chromosome IV in our experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref>). Nevertheless, our demonstration of a lack of sister kinetochore bias in the <italic>sgo1-700</italic> mutant, which cannot bind condensin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) or recruit it to centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) provides compelling evidence that the Sgo1-condensin interact is critical in biasing sister kinetochores to biorient.</p><p><italic>An explanation for the altered binding profiles of condensin measured by ChIP-seq might be changes in cohesin accumulation at centromeres in the Sgo1 mutants. The authors need to check by ChIP-qPCR (and ideally also ChIP-seq) whether cohesin levels at centromeres are affected in the Sgo1 mutant</italic>.</p><p>We performed both these experiments and the data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and associated figure supplements. Cohesin association with chromosomes is indistinguishable in wild type and <italic>sgo1</italic>? cells.</p><p>Overall, we feel our study now argues strongly for a direct role of Sgo1 in condensin recruitment to the pericentromere.</p><p><italic>2) The authors monitor the splitting of a sister centromere pair as a measure for sister chromatid bi-orientation (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig5"><italic>Figures 1A-C,F, 5A</italic></xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2"><italic>Figure 3–figure supplement 2</italic></xref><italic>). The reduction of sister centromere splitting observed in the Sgo1 and condensin mutants could, however, equally well result from an increase in centromeric sister chromatid cohesion. An increase in centromeric cohesion would prevent splitting of bi-oriented sister chromatids</italic>.</p><p><italic>One possibility to distinguish whether chromatid pairs have attached to spindle microtubules from only one spindle pole or whether chromatids have bi-oriented but their centromeres cannot separate would be to score centromere-spindle pole body (SPB) distances in the live cell microscopy assay (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figures 5B-F</italic></xref><italic>). If centromeres were bi-oriented but merely failed to split, they should be positioned at equal distances to both SPBs. If sister centromeres failed to bi-orient, they should frequently be found close to one SPB. Alternatively, the authors could release cells from the Cdc20 arrest and allow them to enter anaphase, then score whether sister centromeres segregate to one pole or to opposite poles (see Indjeian and Murray, CurBiol 2007)</italic>.</p><p>As mentioned above and below, we have obtained no evidence that Sgo1 affects cohesion in budding yeast mitosis. Importantly, the distance between separated sister centromeres in <italic>sgo1</italic>? and <italic>YCS5-aid</italic> cells is not significantly different to that of wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This is strong evidence that cohesion is not affected in these cells and that the decreased frequency of sister centromere is due to defective sister-kinetochore biorientation. Furthermore, as suggested by the reviewers, we measured the distance from <italic>CEN4-GFP</italic> foci to the nearest SPB, in <italic>sgo1</italic>?, <italic>YCS5-aid</italic> and <italic>ipl1-as</italic> cells with a single <italic>CEN4-GFP</italic> focus after nocodazole washout (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref>). Taking the median <italic>CEN4-SPB</italic> distance for wild type as the typical distance, we scored the percentage of cells with shorter or longer distances in each case. In all three mutants, the fraction of cells with a <italic>CEN4-SPB</italic> shorter than the wild type median was increased, indicating that unpaired sister centromeres tend to reside closer to the SPB, supporting the idea that chromosomes fail to align in the centre of the spindle, as expected when biorientation fails. This effect was less pronounced in the condensin mutant, but this is expected as this has a milder biorientation defect overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, Ipl1 is localized in <italic>YCS5-aid</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>) and the error correction process is partially functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>The mis-segregation of chromosomes following release from nocodazole treatment into anaphase is well established to occur in <italic>sgo1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernius and Hardwick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Indjeian and Murray, 2007</xref>) and we have recapitulated these findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref>, using tethered <italic>sgo1</italic> alleles. However, similar experiments with condensin mutants are difficult to interpret as condensin is critical for chromosome arm segregation in anaphase (Renshaw et al., Dev Cell 2010). The situation is further complicated by the fact that due to the partial functionality of the error correction machinery in condensin mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), condensin is unlikely to be essential for sister kinetochore biorientation, but rather provide a bias that facilitates sister kinetochore capture and efficient error correction. Analysis of the <italic>sgo1-700</italic> mutant that fails to associate with condensin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) provides strong evidence that Sgo1 promotes the bias to sister kinetochore biorientation through condensin recruitment.</p><p><italic>The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7"><italic>Figures 6 and 7</italic></xref> <italic>show a mild, real defect in biorientation but don't specifically address the of kineteochore geometry. The authors should either perform further experiments to support their hypothesis or confine their “geometric bias” to speculation in the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that condensin mutants show a biorientation defect. We also agree that direct evidence for a role of condensin in kinetochore geometry is lacking. We have therefore restricted our references to a possible role in geometry to speculation.</p><p><italic>3) Most of the graphs that represent the results from ChIP-qPCR experiments (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig5 fig7"><italic>Figures 1A, E, 2C, D, 5G, 7C</italic></xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3"><italic>Figure 5–figure supplement 3</italic></xref><italic>) lack information that is essential to evaluate the data. What do the column plots represent? Do they show mean values, and if yes, from how many PCR runs and how many independent immunoprecipitation experiments? What do the error bars represent? The legend for</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figures 4D-F</italic></xref> <italic>is missing completely</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for this oversight. We have now included a more detailed description of the procedures used in the Materials and methods and detailed figure legends throughout, explaining how each experiment was carried out, the procedures used to process the data and the meaning of the figures presented. As detailed in the figure legends, the vast majority of ChIP-qPCR experiments show mean values of three independent repeats. qPCR was always performed in triplicate (this information is now included in the Materials and methods). The number of independent immunoprecipitation experiments is given in the figure legends (typically 3). Error bars represent standard error. The exception to this are time course experiments where the day-to-day variability of cell cycle progression means data from different days cannot be combined usefully. Here, experiments are repeated, typically 3 times in total, and a representative experiment is shown. Overall, the pattern does not vary, though the absolute values at each timepoint can.</p><p><italic>Taking into account the possible variability between individual ChIP-qPCR experiments, careful statistical analysis will be required to evaluate the significance of the observed differences. For example, the values measured at CEN4 for the same wild-type strain (AM3513) in two independent Ipl1 HA-ChIP experiments vary 4-fold (compare</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figures 2C and D</italic></xref><italic>), calling into question whether the 2-fold reduction in ChIP signals in the Sgo1 mutants (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref><italic>) is significant. Similarly, the ChIP signal at CEN4 measured for the Sgo1-100 mutant in G1 phase is more than 2-fold higher than the signal for wildtype Sgo1 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref><italic>). Is the 4-fold increase in Sgo1 ChIP signals during mitosis (e.g., 2-fold when compared to the Sgo1-100 mutant) then still significant</italic>?</p><p>Again, we apologize: these discrepancies are due to our failure to provide adequate figure legends describing the procedures used to obtain the data and can all be accounted for by different growth conditions. In particular, the ChIP-qPCR signals obtained in experiments where nocodazole was directly added to cycling cells are typically much higher than experiments where cells were first arrested in G1 before being released into nocodazole. The fraction of cells that were approaching, or in, mitosis at the time of nocodazole will spend a much greater time in mitosis, where our proteins of interest are presumably continually recruited, thereby accounting for these differences. Of course, repeats are carried out using exactly the same conditions, with all strains within one repeat grown and processed on the same day, allowing direct comparison for those conditions. Specifically, for the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> in the old version (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), cells were first arrested in G1 before release into nocodazole (this was to allow Sgo1-aid degradation in a single cell cycle), whereas cells for the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> in the old version (now 3E) were arrested directly in nocodazole. The difference between the levels of Sgo1 and <italic>Sgo1-100</italic> mutant proteins is likely due to slight changes in the timing of alpha factor release in the handling of these cultures (see above about the interpretation of time course experiments). The main point of these experiments was to show that residual association to centromeres occurs even though it is not maintained in nocodazole-arrested cells. We do not think it is appropriate to take any further interpretation based on the absolute values from these experiments as due to the inherent variability of time course experiments; to do so would require exquisitely controlled conditions and much more closely spaced sampling.</p></body></sub-article></article>
