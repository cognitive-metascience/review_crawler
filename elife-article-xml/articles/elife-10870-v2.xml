Here, we show that dramatic shifts in large open-chromatin domain (super-enhancer) landscapes underlie these differences and reflect tumor microenvironment. By in vivo super-enhancer and transcriptional profiling, we uncover a dynamic cancer-specific epigenetic network selectively enriched for binding motifs of a transcription factor cohort expressed in squamous cell carcinoma SCs (SCC-SCs).

Malignant progression requires these genes, whose knockdown severely impairs tumor growth and prohibits progression from benign papillomas to SCCs.

Of these, cells known as cancer stem cells can form new tumours and drive the growth and spread of the cancer around the body. A central question is how cancer stem cells differ from healthy adult stem cells. Recent evidence suggests that, in addition to having genetic mutations, cancer stem cells live in a very different environment to other cells within the tumour. This 'microenvironment'also has a major impact on how these cells behave compared to normal stem cells. Together, the genetic and environmental differences profoundly change the way genes are expressed in the cancer cells.</p><p>In 2013, a group of researchers identified regions of DNA called super-enhancers. These regions are long stretches of DNA that proteins called transcription factors can interact with to coordinate the expression of nearby genes to alter the production of certain proteins. Super-enhancers contain several transcription factor-binding sites that are close to each other with the different sites being associated with transcription factors that are only active in specific types of cells. Furthermore, super-enhancers are often self-regulatory, meaning that the binding of transcription factors to a super-enhancer can lead to an increase in the expression of the genes that encode the same transcription factors.</p><p>Yang, Schramek et al. have now identified the super-enhancers in a skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma and showed that they differ dramatically from the super-enhancers of normal skin stem cells. Their experiments show that the active super-enhancers in cancer stem cells are associated with a very different set of genes that are highly and often specifically expressed in cancer stem cells. In the cancer stem cells, a transcription factor called ETS2 binds to the super-enhancers and reprograms the expression of genes to promote the development of cancer. Yang, Schramek et al. also show that over-active ETS2 is a major driver of squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore, ETS2 also increases the expression of genes that cause inflammation and promote the growth of cancers.</p><p>Yang, Schramek et al.’s findings reveal a new regulatory network that governs the expression of genes involved in cancer. Furthermore, the experiments show that high levels of ETS2 are linked with poor outcomes for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, which is one of the most life-threatening cancers world-wide. In the future, these findings might lead to the development of new therapies to treat these cancers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10870.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10870.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>skin squamous cell carcinomas</kwd><kwd>Super-enhancer profiling</kwd><kwd>ETS family transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AR-31737</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuchs</surname><given-names>Elaine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuchs</surname><given-names>Elaine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000793/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schramek</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Anderson Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Adam</surname><given-names>Rene C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004093</institution-id><institution>Kwanjeong Educational Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Hanseul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003194</institution-id><institution>New York Stem Cell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#CO29559</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuchs</surname><given-names>Elaine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transcription factors of the ETS family govern a cohort of key cancer-associated regulators of malignancy in squamous cell carcinomas.</meta-value> </custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem cells (SCs) have the capacity to self-renew and to generate and repair tissues. Advances in genome technologies provide the means to not only comprehensively analyze transcriptional profiles of SCs but also map their epigenetic landscape on a global level. Studies on cultured embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have shown that a special set of large open-chromatin domains, so-called super-enhancers (SEs), control expression of genes important to ESC behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parker et al., 2013</xref>). Like typical enhancers (TEs), SEs bind with Mediator, a complex that brings promoter and enhancer together to activate transcription. However, SEs differ from TEs by their exceptional size (often &gt;15kb) and by their high density of acetylation of histone H3 at the lysine 27 position (H3K27ac), which characterizes active chromatin.</p><p>Studies on a variety of tissue cell lines have shown that another key feature of SEs is a high density of sequence motifs for cell stage-specific transcription factors (TFs). This allows for their cooperative binding, thereby rendering SE-regulated genes particularly sensitive to the key TF cohort. Moreover, the genes encoding lineage-specific TFs often themselves harbor SEs resulting in a stable feed-forward loop to fuel and maintain the lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lovén et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chapuy et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Mice devote much of their tissue-generating energy to making hair follicles (HFs), each of which possesses a compartment of multipotent SCs that fuel HF regeneration and hair growth. Additionally, hair regeneration is governed by cyclical bouts of SC activity where HFs are either at rest (telogen) or actively regenerating (anagen). The ability to purify large quantities of SCs directly from their native microenvironment (‘niche’) makes the HF one of the few systems where in vivo chromatin dynamics can be studied in an adult tissue SC population. Such studies on purified HF-SCs show that although their TFs are largely distinct from those of ESCs, many of the basic features of SEs are displayed by HF-SCs in their native tissue niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Studies on SC populations isolated from adult tissues have also yielded new insights into SE dynamics. Notably, most of the master regulators of HF-SCs bind within smaller chromatin domains (&lt;3 kb) of SEs termed ‘epicenters’, which are also enriched for Mediator and for H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, epicenters cloned from HF-SC SEs can drive proper developmental-specific and hair cycling-specific behavior of a GFP reporter, underscoring the functional relevance of these chromatin domains in lineage-specific gene expression.</p><p>Perhaps, most intriguing is that even though HF-SCs still possess stemness outside their native niche, for example in culture or in wound-repair, they change their SE landscape dramatically. Mechanistically, this plasticity of remodeling can be traced to a dramatic reduction of HF-SC TFs, resulting in a decommissioning of most in vivo SEs with a new set of SEs gained in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2015</xref>). In a related study on tissue macrophages, it was shown that when these immune cells invade different tissues and are faced with new microenvironments, they too display markedly distinct chromatin landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gosselin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lavin et al., 2014</xref>). Together, these findings underscore the importance of the microenvironment in governing chromatin dynamics. For SCs, this feature is particularly relevant, since they reside in specific niches, and receive signals from multiple different surrounding cells to guide their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scadden, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lane et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morrison and Scadden, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schofield, 1978</xref>).</p><p>Cancer can be viewed as a disease of lost cell identity. The cellular origin of tumor-initiating, so-called ‘cancer SCs’ may be a result of arresting SC maturation or of dedifferentiation of a progenitor lineage, endowing the incipient tumor cell with the potential to self-renew and fuel the cancer. Although largely limited to studies on self-renewing cancer cell lines in vitro and their normal whole tissue (e.g. MCF7 breast cancer cell line and mammary epithelium), increasing evidence underscores the importance of SEs in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lovén et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chapuy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chipumuro et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies suggest that the transcriptional profile and behavior of tumor-initiating SCs are highly sensitive to their tumor-microenvironment, which is markedly distinct from that of their normal counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Plaks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oshimori et al., 2015</xref>). This makes it tempting to speculate that the SE profile of tumor-initiating SCs in vivo may be substantially different from that of normal tissue SCs. If so, SE profiling could provide an avenue for identifying the special set of cancer SC TFs that drive tumor progression. This knowledge could greatly accelerate the convergence of basic science and clinical translation into therapeutics and diagnostics that cripple oncogenic behavior.</p><p>Here, we specifically test this hypothesis, focusing on skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which is one of the most common and rapidly rising cancers world-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rogers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jemal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trakatelli et al., 2007</xref>). More broadly, SCCs can also arise in lung, breast, esophagus, cervix, and oral tissues of the head and neck, where they are associated with high risk of metastasis and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trakatelli et al., 2007</xref>). Using SE and transcriptional profiling, we first define the SE chromatin landscape and its gene expression program within the tumor-initiating SC population of skin SCCs and show that SE-associated genes constitute a signature that specifically associates with cancer-vulnerability genes, some of which correlate with poor survival among human SCC patients. Given that HF-SCs are an established origin of these cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lapouge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">White et al., 2011</xref>), we conduct comparative analyses and show that SCC-SC SEs are distinct from SEs found in HF-SCs and also from rapidly proliferating short-term progeny of HF-SCs. We show that SCC-SEs are enriched for sequence motifs of a unique set of TF families, whose members are themselves regulated by SEs. Most importantly, we show by gain and loss of function and by associated chromatin landscaping, that these factors are essential for driving the chromatin dynamics that define the malignant state and govern tumor maintenance and survival.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The SEs of SCC stem cells in vivo differ dramatically from their normal counterparts</title><p>To explore the in vivo importance of SEs in tumor-initiating cancer SCs, we first set up a reliable and reproducible SCC allograft model. The vast majority of chemically induced SCCs in mice have mutations in <italic>Hras, Kras</italic> or Rras2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nassar et al., 2015</xref>), and HRas<sup>G12V</sup> alone is sufficient to induce formation of benign tumors (papillomas) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). HRas<sup>G12V</sup> in combination with loss of TGFβ receptor II (TGFβRII) results in invasive SCCs, which can metastasize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guasch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bian et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore purified primary keratinocytes from skin of newborn mice harboring a conditional <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> allele (<italic>Tgfbr2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) encoding a key transmembrane receptor for TGFβ signaling, and infected them with a non-integrating adenovirus expressing a Cre-GFP recombinase. After fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), purified cells were then stably transduced with an integrating retrovirus expressing HRas<sup>G12V</sup> (strategy outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>As expected, transduced cells showed increased Ras/MAPK signaling and abrogated TGFβ/SMAD signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Upon intradermal injection into <italic>Nude</italic> mice, they efficiently formed SCC tumors, typified by hyperproliferation, pyknotic nuclei, a discontinuous basement membrane and signs of invasion into the surrounding stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). With this system, tumor-initiation and progression were highly reproducible.</p><p>Irrespective of whether chemically or genetically induced, tumor-initiating SCs of SCCs reside at the tumor-stroma interface and are highly enriched for integrins α6 and β1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oshimori et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maston et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dowen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lapouge et al., 2012</xref>). To profile the SEs of SCC-SCs, we therefore employed FACS to purify the GFP<sup>high</sup>α6-integrin<sup>high</sup>β1-integrin<sup>high</sup> population from <italic>Tgfbr2-</italic>null HRas<sup>G12V</sup>-oncogenic skin SCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schober and Fuchs, 2011</xref>). We then took advantage of the fact that when chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is carried out for Mediator 1, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac, they generate highly overlapping patterns within SEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2015</xref>). Using H3K27ac as our paradigm, we performed ChIP-seq and delineated the SEs of our purified SCC-SCs. Independent biological replicates showed a high degree of similarity (Pearson correlation coefficient of genome-wide read densities r&gt;0.89; representative example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), so the replicate data were subsequently combined and processed to maximize the comprehensiveness of our SE analysis.</p><p>H3K27ac peaks resided within promoters (± 2 kb of annotated genes) (43%) and distal elements, considered enhancers (57%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). A small fraction (13%) of all enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), were in close proximity (&lt;12.5 kb apart) and highly enriched with H3K27ac; they formed ~350 unusually large (median size &gt;20 kb) distal elements, thereby fulfilling the criteria for ‘SEs' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>).

This was not attributable merely to the difference in proliferative status, as the SE landscape of SCC-SCs was also distinct from that of rapidly proliferative, short-lived HF-SC progeny (transit-amplifying cells, TACs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SCC-SC SEs associate with genes that are highly upregulated in cancer</title><p>Enhancers control adjacent genes by looping to their promoters, with most of these interactions occurring within &lt;50 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maston et al., 2006</xref>). More than 80% of SEs can be accurately assigned to their target genes by applying proximity criterion and RNA-seq expression data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dowen et al., 2014</xref>). Most of the remaining ambiguities arise from situations where more than one active gene resides within the vicinity of SEs for a particular cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dowen et al., 2014</xref>). These can largely be resolved by extending comparative ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses to multiple lineage stages for a particular cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, after conducting RNA-seq analysis on the GFP<sup>high</sup>α6<sup>high</sup>β1<sup>high</sup> SCC-SC population, we assigned SE-associated genes on the basis of 1) their proximity to an SCC-SC SE; 2) their active transcription in SCC-SCs; and 3) their strict correlation between expression pattern and the presence of their putative SE not only in SCC-SCs but also in HF-SCs and transit-amplifying progeny.</p><p>On the basis of this analysis, we readily assigned 340 genes to the 350 SEs found in SCC-SC chromatin, as 10 genes appeared to be controlled by more than one SE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The cohort of SE-associated genes included a number of oncogenes such as <italic>Myc</italic>, and also genes associated with SCCs, for example <italic>Cd44</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Overall, 15% of the SCC-SEs completely lacked H3K27ac signals in HF-SCs, while 22% of the HF-SEs were silenced in SCC-SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Notably, the master transcriptional regulators of HF-SCs were largely decommissioned in SCC-SCs, while new transcriptional regulators were activated. Based on RNA-seq analysis, the genes associated with SCC-specific SEs displayed the highest increases in expression between HF and SCC-SCs, while genes associated with HF-specific SEs showed the greatest decline in expression in SCC-SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Sixty-four per cent of SCC SE-associated genes were still expressed in HF-SCs but had lost their SE and acquired a TE. In many cases, these enhancer dynamics had significant consequences, since the overall expression levels (FPKM) of SE-associated genes were higher than those of TE-associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E and F</xref>), in agreement with previous findings for cultured ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>).

Moreover, the morphologies and corresponding biomarkers of resulting cell masses were also dramatically changed in ELK3-deficient tumors.

To test this hypothesis, we engineered a phosphomimetic T72D version of ETS2, thus bypassing the need for HRas/MAPK to make this modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foulds et al., 2004</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O'Neill et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brunner et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rebay and Rubin, 1995</xref>). Since ETS2 is also expressed in normal skin progenitors, we added a Myc-tag to monitor protein expression. Finally, we used a tetracycline regulatory element (TRE) to induce protein expression, and packaged the transgene in a lentivirus that also harbored a constitutively active H2B-RFP. When tested in transduced primary keratinocytes in vitro, expression of phosphomimetic T72D and wild-type ETS2 was markedly upregulated upon Doxycycline administration, where proteins, expressed at comparable levels, could be readily detected by ETS2 and Myc-antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p> <p>With these controls, we then proceeded to inject the high titer lentivirus into the amniotic sacs of E9.5 K14-rtTA mouse embryos in utero.

Being visible, skin SCCs are typically treated early and mortality is low. However, SCCs can also arise in the lung, breast, esophagus, cervix, and head and neck, where they are associated with high risk of metastasis and drug resistance. Understanding the molecular complexities that underlie the tumor-initiating SCs within SCC cancers is therefore of paramount importance in developing new and improved diagnostic and therapeutic tools to establish new treatments.</p><p>Like HF-SCs and EpiSCs from which SCC-SCs can derive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lapouge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">White et al., 2011</xref>), SCC-SCs are integrin-rich and reside at the interface with their surrounding stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schober and Fuchs, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lapouge et al., 2012</xref>). However, the gene expression program of these malignant SCs is markedly divergent from their normal skin counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schober and Fuchs, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lapouge et al., 2012</xref>). Despite this knowledge, little was known about the master transcriptional regulatory network and the chromatin dynamics that underlie these dramatically different programs of gene expression in SCC-SCs versus normal SCs.</p><p>We profiled the SEs of SCC-SCs and compared them to their wild-type counterparts in order to gain a better understanding of the epigenetic rewiring that might be associated with SCC transcription. Since the chromatin landscape in general, and SEs in particular, are highly sensitive to their microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lavin et al., 2014</xref>), it was essential to carry out our experiments on SCC-SCs purified directly from the tumor, that is, in their native niche at the tumor-stroma interface.</p><p>In previous studies on SCs in which chromatin landscapes regulated by master regulators have been mapped, ChIP-seq analysis of the known master TFs has preceded subsequent SE analysis. Thus, with cultured ESCs, ChIP-seq for the established pluripotency regulators SOX2, OCT4, NANOG, and KLF4, was already available when ensuing SE analyses revealed that the pluripotency factors bind within these open chromatin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dowen et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly for HF-SCs that were purified directly from skin, in vivoChIP-seq analyses had been performed on NFATc1, TCF3/4, SOX9, and LHX2, before subsequent H3K27ac ChIP-seq analysis revealed that these master regulators bind within the HF-SC-specific epicenters of these large open chromatin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>For SCC-SCs, global ChIP-seq chromatin mapping in vivohas not been performed, due to the relative paucity of tumor tissue relative to normal skin. Moreover, the abundance of keratin and resilience of the epidermal plasma membrane poses technical hurdles for newer ATAC-seq methods which can be performed with fewer cell numbers and allow TF mapping for some cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>). Compounding the lack of knowledge on chromatin landscapes of SCC-SCs is the paucity of functional studies on putative transcriptional regulators of these cells, thus far limited to SOX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Siegle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boumahdi et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, in addition to exploring the chromatin landscape of SCC-SCs, a major quest in the present study was to see whether through in vivoH3K27ac-mediated epigenetic analyses of purified SCC-SCs, we might be able to gain new insights into key transcriptional regulators that govern SCC-SC behavior in the context of their native, aberrant SC niche.</p><p>To approach the problem, we identified the TFs whose expression is upregulated in SCC-SCs and which display putative TF binding sites within the epicenters of dense H3K27ac peaks of the majority of SCC-SC-specific SEs. As learned from analyses of ESCs and HF-SCs, an additional frequent, albeit not absolute, feature of SC master regulators is that their genes are often regulated by SEs themselves, thereby establishing a feed-forward loop for maintaining the SC state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2015</xref>). By SE profiling of SCC-SCs, identifying putative binding sites within SCC-SC SE epicenters and RNA-seq, we generated a list of candidates for SE-associated master regulator genes.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that our strategy was successful. First and foremost was the finding that SOX binding sites were present in &gt;70% of all SCC-SC SEs, a feature predicted from SOX2’s functional role in SCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Siegle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boumahdi et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, given the broad importance of AP-1 (FOS and JUN family) members in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eferl and Wagner, 2003</xref>), binding sites for these factors in SCC-SC SEs were notable. Finally, although ETS proteins have not been previously implicated in SCCs, the presence of these sites in nearly 80% of SCC-SC SEs, coupled with the association of <italic>Elk3</italic> and <italic>Ets2</italic> with SEs, begged for functional studies. Indeed, our analyses provide compelling evidence that these factors drive hyperproliferation and SCC progression. Our added finding that high ELK3 and ETS2 expression correlates with poor prognosis in human SCCs fuels the importance of this family of proteins in these cancers.</p><p>The role of ETS proteins is particularly intriguing given that their levels matter not only in tumorigenesis but also in maintaining SCC-SC master regulators. Thus when ETS2 was reduced in SCC-SCs, KLF5 and SOX2 were also absent from the resulting cellular masses, and when constitutively active ETS2 was induced in normal epidermis of juvenile mice, the epidermis acquired marked features of hyperproliferation and invasion, accompanied by upregulation/induction of FOS, JUNB and KLF5 and a shift in SE dynamics from one of normal skin progenitors to one of malignant transformation. When coupled with the fact that <italic>Fos, Junb</italic> and <italic>Klf5</italic> are associated with SCC-SC SEs which contain AP1, ETS and KLF binding motifs, these findings underscore the physiological relevance of these factors not only in SCC oncogenesis but also in orchestrating the chromatin dynamics of SCC-SCs.</p><p>Our results are particularly intriguing in that phosphorylation of ETS2 is known to be regulated by Ras/MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foulds et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O'Neill et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brunner et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rebay and Rubin, 1995</xref>). Indeed, it was recently shown that 86% of all skin SCCs induced by classical chemical carcinogenesis with 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene (DMBA) involve mutations in either HRas or KRas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nassar et al., 2015</xref>), and KRas is markedly upregulated even in SCCs that do not directly involve oncogenic HRas transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schober and Fuchs, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lapouge et al., 2012</xref>). While cell culture experiments have documented important roles for Ras/MAPK-activated ETS proteins in cellular transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Foos et al., 1998</xref>), our findings now lend in vivo relevance to this connection in SCC-SCs.</p><p>Given the well-established links between AP1 family members, Ras/MAPK and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eferl and Wagner, 2003</xref>), the presence of AP1 and ETS motifs in nearly 80% of SCC-SC SEs takes on all the more significance. Interestingly, many of the ETS binding motifs in SCC-SC epicenters are in close proximity with AP-1 motifs. Closely juxtapositioned ETS-AP1 motifs, essential for cooperative binding, have also been observed in a prostate cancer cell line in culture, and notably, they exist within the regulatory regions of several key oncogenes in which the Ras/MAPK pathway is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hollenhorst, 2011</xref>). While the large majority of prostate cancers are adenocarcinoma and not SCCs, these parallels are intriguing and merit further investigation in the future.</p><p>In addition to gaining insights into chromatin dynamics in SCCs, the SE-regulated gene list that we unearth here is rich in important oncogenes. These include not only <italic>Fos, Junb, Ets2,</italic> and <italic>Elk3</italic>, but also <italic>Myc, Src, Mapk6, Map2k2, Cd44,</italic> and <italic>Tgfa.</italic> Also present on this list are HMGA2, RUNX1 and FOXG1, which are critical TFs for self-renewal of SCC-SCs and other cancer models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sgarra et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manoranjan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scheitz et al., 2012</xref>), as well as KLF5, which plays a role in epithelial cell hyper-proliferation under inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sur, 2006</xref>). Moreover, HIF1α is a key regulator of hypoxic response in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilson and Hay, 2011</xref>). Overall, the list of SCC-SC SE-associated genes was rich in important cell signaling genes that promote hyper-proliferation, migration, invasion, inflammation and cancer metabolism. When taken together with our findings that the SEs regulating normal HF-SC master regulators are decommissioned in SCC-SCs, these data expose SEs as chromatin gatekeepers of the cancer SC state.</p><p>In HF-SCs, the SE chromatin landscape is highly sensitive to the SC niche microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2015</xref>). In this regard, the preponderance of SCC-SC SEs associated with inflammatory genes was intriguing since inflammation in the perivascular stroma is a key feature of the SCC microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oshimori et al., 2015</xref>). Inflammatory players can be proangiogenic, growth-promoting or tumor suppressive. In addition, epithelial-derived factors collectively termed as the 'epimmunome' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swamy et al., 2010</xref>) can instruct immune cells, thereby harboring the potential to impinge upon immunocompetence and tumor immunosurveillance. Our discovery that SCC cells express and secrete CXCL1 and CXCL2, appears to be particularly relevant, because this phenomenon turned out to be hardwired through the establishment of SEs. Additionally, CXCL1/2 can signal to the immune system, solidifying their part in the epimmunome. Intriguingly, however, we found that SCC cells also express CXCR2, the cognate receptor for CXCL1/2, thus establishing an autocrine loop to fuel epithelial proliferation. Indeed, when we knocked down <italic>Cxcr2,</italic> tumor growth was severely impaired.</p><p>In summary, we have unearthed many new insights regarding SEs that go beyond mere cancer-specific gene expression. For the first time, we show that in vivo SEs of a cancer SC are markedly distinct from their normal counterparts, and they reflect their dramatically altered microenvironment. We show that SEs controlling the normal SC-TFs are decommissioned in cancer, and that the new SEs drive cooperative auto-regulation of novel master regulators that specify the cancer state. For SCC, this includes an ETS2/ELK3-AP1-SOX2-KLF5 network of which level of ETS family members appears to be critical in regulating SCC SE dynamics and orchestrating expression of a cohort of oncogenic, growth-promoting, and epimmune genes. Of additional relevance are the mutually exclusive H3K27 modifications of SEs and PcG-silencing that provide a powerful two-way switch for the cancer-normal SC balance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse lines</title><p>Female CD1 mice (Charles River, New York, NY) were used for the purification of HF SCs.

Your manuscript has been reviewed by two experts in the field and by a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors (BRE). We have appended the detailed reviews for you at the bottom of this letter.</p><p>As you can see, the reviewers and the BRE member find the study of interest to the journal and are in agreement that the initial profiling of HF-SC's and SCC-SC's for histone modifications are interesting. However, the reviewers unanimously agree that the lack of genome-wide data testing whether the identified transcription factors are actually acting by regulating super enhancers under growth and malignancy conditions has lessened their enthusiasm for the manuscript. We would be interested in a revised study if you have performed these control experiments and have the genome-wide data and the analyses available so that they can be included in a revised manuscript. In this case we, would be happy to consider such a revised manuscript. Otherwise, we feel that the requested studies will take much longer than allowed for a revised submission at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Recently super enhancers have been revealed as critical cis-regulatory elements to maintain cell fate as well as to determine cell lineages. A role of super enhancers in cancer cells has not been well characterized. In this work, Yang and colleagues using squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to interrogate a role of super enhancers in cancer cells. Overall this is an interesting paper with identification of ETS transcript factor family in SCC, which is subject to the regulation by super enhancers. Furthermore, the ETS TF associated super enhancer is highly correlated with development of SCC and is more specific for SCC but not to their &quot;normal&quot; counterpart HF-SCs. This ETS binding super enhancer also induced a positive forward loop of CXCL1/2 with their corresponding receptors, reflecting a feature of tumor microenvironment. Their method of prospecting for genes involved in various disease states using SE's and binding motifs could prove very useful. All these are novel findings. However, their conclusions on the relevance of SE's still require direct evidence.</p><p>Major concern:</p><p>Given the fact that super enhancers are so implied throughout the paper, and indeed even in the title, I find it odd that the chromatin landscape isn't examined even once after any of their treatments. Aside from the initial profiling of HF-SC's and SCC-SC's, neither histone modifications nor occupancy of TFs reported as SE regulators are ever explored. This could have been done after ELK3, ETS2, or CXCR2 knockdown, but instead they rely very heavily on the very tenuous assumption that because they have binding sites, and their genes are regulated by SE's, that any effects of their treatments must directly involve SE's. Given the pleiotropic effects any of these targets could have, relying solely on phenotypic outcome to imply a specific mechanism of action seems odd.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors did a comparison study on super-enhancers in squamous cell carcinoma stem cells and hair follicles stem cells. Based on the bioinformatics analysis on the H3K27ac ChIP-seq data and RNA-seq data, they identified both known and new cancer stem cell specific transcription factors under the super-enhancers. They functionally studied ETS family factors by both knocking down and ORF rescue experiments, and the ETS family factors played significant roles in driving squamous cell carcinoma stem cells. However, there is a lack of solid biological evidence that the ETS factors are actually regulating super-enhancers and that feedback on super-enhancers regulates other factors like <italic>Cxcl1</italic> and <italic>Cxcl2</italic>. Currently, the relationship between supper-enhancer dynamics and ETS family proteins is uncertain.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) The authors performed H3K27ac ChIP-seq analysis on SCC-SC in comparison with the one in HF-SC, and identified cancer stem cell specific SEs and SEs associating genes. To better understand the specificity of super-enhancers in cancer stem cells, the authors should include one more SCC sample control.</p><p>2) In subheading “SE-associated ETS TFs constitute cancer vulnerabilities within SCCs”, the authors wrote: &quot;Our ChIP-seq analyses showed that genes encoding both ELK3 and ETS2 were governed by super-enhancers. Given that both of these TFs are known to bind to ETS sequence motifs, we wondered whether they might both participate in governing super-enhancer dynamics.&quot; But, the follow up experiments are all on the functional study of <italic>Elk3</italic> and <italic>Ets2</italic> in tumorigenesis by knocking down and cDNA rescue, which cannot address the initial question. A correct experiment is <italic>Elk3</italic> ChIP-seq and <italic>Ets3</italic> ChIP-seq. Since the authors also appealed that they cannot perform ChIP-seq on these two factors due to the limitation of cancer tissues, they should change this sentence.</p><p>3) The subtitle &quot;Testing the physiological significance of super-enhancer dynamics in SCCs&quot; was over-claimed, please change it accordingly to the data.</p><p>4) In paragraph two of the subsection “SE-associated ETS TFs constitute cancer vulnerabilities within SCCs”, the authors claimed <italic>Elk3</italic> transcription was knocked down by &gt;90%, while in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> the efficiency is not that high.</p><p>5) Similarly, in the fourth paragraph of the aforementioned section, the authors claimed <italic>Ets2</italic> transcription was knocked down by 80-90%, while, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the efficiency does not appear to be that high either.</p><p>6) In &quot;SE-associated ETS TFs constitute cancer vulnerabilities within SCC&quot;, the authors started from the purpose to explore whether <italic>Elk3</italic> and <italic>Ets2</italic> participate in governing super-enhancer dynamics, but turned out to test the functional significance of them. I would suggest changing the first two sentences to focus more on their function.</p><p>7) The title of the paper concludes that ETS family transcriptional regulators drive chromatin dynamics. However, in the paper, due to the difficulties to profile global chromatin states by ChIP-seq, no direct proof can be found to fully support this conclusion. Without direct evidence to support the major conclusion of the paper it is not of sufficient impact for <italic>eLife</italic>. It should be noted that the existence of a binding motif does not necessarily indicate the binding of a transcription factor. The regulation of the recruitment of transcription factors has been shown by many studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10870.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>Major concern:</italic></p><p><italic>Given the fact that super enhancers are so implied throughout the paper, and indeed even in the title, I find it odd that the chromatin landscape isn't examined even once after any of their treatments.

Most significantly, we carried out in vivo RNA-seq and H3K27ac ChiP-seq experiments on purified skin basal epidermal control progenitors and progenitors following Doxy-induction of skin epidermis to induce a phosphomimetic super-activated form of ETS2, which normally requires oncogenic HRas-MAP kinase for this threonine phosphorylation. Not only does the epidermis transform into an SCC-like state, but at the transcriptional level, many of the genes upregulated in SCC-SCs are now elevated in the ETS skin progenitors. At the level of chromatin landscaping, this not only includes the SE-regulated genes, but in fact these genes now acquire the chromatin remodeling and super-enhancer acquisition that we observed in SCC-SCs. Finally, although the numbers of cells required for ETS ChIP-seq are still prohibitive, as are the numbers of cells for ETS2 knock-down tumors, we were successful in carrying out ETS2 ChiP-qPCR with a number of SE-regulated genes from these cells purified in vivo.</p><p>It is remarkable that the phosphomimetic ETS2 induces a phenotype and an SE profile and expression profile that are not only similar to SCC-SEs, but in addition SE-regulated genes, <italic>Cxcl1, Cxcl2</italic> and <italic>Elk3</italic> ranked among the highest upregulated genes, analogous to what we had seen in SCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Moreover, 50% of the genes found to be upregulated upon ETS superactivation are also upregulated in SCC-SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The entire <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is now new and encompasses these and other exciting data. We thank the reviewer for his/her comments and suggestions.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>Major concerns:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors performed H3K27ac ChIP-seq analysis on SCC-SC in comparison with the one in HF-SC, and identified cancer stem cell specific SEs and SEs associating genes.

We actually <italic>did</italic> perform the CHIP-seq experiments and the analysis in two completely independent experiments. Moreover, every duplicate was a pool of several tumors, which was necessary as we had to FACS-purify 20 million (!) cancer stem cells for a single CHIP experiment. Importantly, the duplicates showed a robust Pearson correlation coefficient of genome-wide read densities of r&gt;0.89 (please see representative example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In fact there was striking reproducibility. We think that once the reviewer appreciates this, he/she will agree that a third sample on collected and sorted 20 million cancer stem cells out of ~120 tumors would not only require considerable time and money but will not add additional data/insights. We’ve now clarified the text.</p><p><italic>2) In subheading “SE-associated ETS TFs constitute cancer vulnerabilities within SCCs”, the authors wrote: &quot;Our ChIP-seq analyses showed that genes encoding both ELK3 and ETS2 were governed by super-enhancers.

A correct experiment is Elk3 ChIP-seq and Ets3 ChIP-seq. Since the authors also appealed that they cannot perform ChIP-seq on these two factors due to the limitation of cancer tissues, they should change this sentence.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, the availability of CSC, which can be isolated from tumors is limiting. However, to answer the question raised by this reviewer, we performed ETS2-CHIP-qPCR in phosphomimetic ETS SCC-SCs in vivo to test whether ETS2 indeed binds to epicenters within SCC-SE. We now show that endogenous ETS2 as well as myc-tagged ETS2 binds to epicenters of SCC-SE including <italic>Cxcl1/2, Ets2</italic> and Il1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Please also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref> and our response to Reviewer #1 main point. We’ve also carried out RNA-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq on purified basal progenitors from the phosphomimetic induced skin epidermis. The results are beautiful and striking.</p><p><italic>3) The subtitle &quot;Testing the physiological significance of super-enhancer dynamics in SCCs&quot; was over-claimed, please change it accordingly to the data.</italic> </p><p>We changed this subheading to “Testing the physiological significance of ETS2 in super-enhancer dynamics” as we now have provided functional data showing that ETS2 is required for maintenance and in sufficient to induce CSC-SE in otherwise normal skin epithelium.</p><p><italic>4) In paragraph two of the subsection “SE-associated ETS TFs constitute cancer vulnerabilities within SCCs”, the authors claimed</italic> Elk3 transcription was knocked down by &gt;90%, while in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> the efficiency is not that high.</p><p>We apologize and have changed it to &gt;70% in the text, although we also now add very nice Western blots to show efficiency.</p><p><italic>5) Similarly, in the fourth paragraph of the aforementioned section, the authors claimed</italic> Ets2 transcription was knocked down by 80-90%, while, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the efficiency does not appear to be that high either.</p><p>We apologize and have changed it to &gt;65% in the text, although we add nice Western Blots to show the efficiency.</p><p><italic>6) In &quot;SE-associated ETS TFs constitute cancer vulnerabilities within SCC&quot;, the authors started from the purpose to explore whether</italic> Elk3 <italic>and</italic> Ets2 <italic>participate in governing super-enhancer dynamics, but turned out to test the functional significance of them. I would suggest changing the first two sentences to focus more on their function.</italic> </p><p>We completely agree and have removed the second sentence: “Given that both of these TFs are known to bind to ETS sequence motifs, we wondered whether they might both participate in governing super-enhancer dynamics. To test this possibility,” and changed it to: “To test their functional relevance, we began by focusing on ELK3…”.</p><p><italic>7) The title of the paper concludes that ETS family transcriptional regulators drive chromatin dynamics. However, in the paper, due to the difficulties to profile global chromatin states by ChIP-seq, no direct proof can be found to fully support this conclusion.

In addition we also added data showing that constitutive-active ETS2 also increased CD11b+ inflammatory cell recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>) – another hall mark of SCC development.</p></body></sub-article></article>
