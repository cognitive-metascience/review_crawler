regulatory mechanism is unclear. We found that <italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice showed choroidal hypoplasia with insufficient vascularization in the dorsal region, although Aldh1a1, an enzyme that synthesizes retinoic acids (RAs), is expressed in the dorsal neural retina, not in the RPE/choroid complex. The level of VEGF in the RPE/choroid was significantly decreased in <italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice, and RA-dependent enhancement of VEGF was observed in primary RPE cells. An RA-deficient diet resulted in dorsal choroidal hypoplasia, and simple RA treatment of <italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>–/–</sup> pregnant females suppressed choroid hypoplasia in their offspring. We also found downregulation of Sox9 in the dorsal neural retina and RPE of <italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice and RPE-specific disruption of Sox9 phenocopied <italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>–/–</sup> choroidal development. These results suggest that RAs produced by Aldh1a1 in the neural retina directs dorsal choroidal vascular development via Sox9 upregulation in the dorsal RPE cells to enhance RPE-derived VEGF secretion.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32358.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The retina is the part at the back of our eyes that detects light and sends this information to our brain. Within the retina is a layered structure containing the light-sensitive cells, known as the neural retina, and another protective layer of cells called the retinal pigment epithelium. A surrounding network of blood vessels, the choroid, keeps the retina healthy by supplying oxygen and nutrients. When the choroid does not work properly, eye disease can result. A common example is age-related macular degeneration, where blood vessels in the choroid either break down or start growing uncontrollably in the wrong places. In both cases, light-sensitive cells are damaged and eventually die. This causes vision loss that worsens over time.</p><p>The choroid forms early in life, within the developing embryo. The retinal pigment epithelium helps the choroid to develop properly by producing a protein, VEGF, which supports the growth of blood vessels. However, it was not clear what signals tell this tissue to start making VEGF in the first place and then to keep making it.</p><p>To address this, Goto et al. looked at eye development in mutant mice that lack an enzyme called Aldh1a1. This enzyme’s role is to make a molecule called retinoic acid, which is known to be vital for many biological processes including the growth and development of embryos. Aldh1a1 is not made in the choroid of normal mice, just in the neural retina. Yet the choroid in the mutant mice without Aldh1a1 still grew fewer blood vessels than normal. Their retinal pigment epithelium also produced less VEGF and had lower levels of a protein called Sox9, which is known to make the gene for VEGF more active.</p><p>Goto et al. went on to show that simply removing retinoic acid from the diet of normal mice produced the same choroid defect as in the mutant mice with no Aldh1a1. Genetically manipulating otherwise normal mice to decrease the levels of Sox9 in the retinal pigment epithelium had a similar effect. In contrast, giving Aldh1a1-deficient mice extra retinoic acid or artificially increasing their levels Sox9 was enough to make the choroid develop normally. These experiments showed that retinoic acid produced in the neural retina directs choroid development by making Sox9 more active, which in turn encourages the retinal pigment epithelium to produce VEGF.</p><p>These findings bring new insights into the molecular signals that control choroid development. In the future, they may also help scientists to better understand why blood vessels in the choroid become abnormal in eye diseases like age-related macular degeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>choroid</kwd><kwd>retinal pigment epithelium</kwd><kwd>retinoic acid</kwd><kwd>Aldh1a1</kwd><kwd>VEGF</kwd><kwd>Sox9</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17bm0204002h0005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Masayo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24687010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Onishi</surname><given-names>Akishi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17K11471</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Onishi</surname><given-names>Akishi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Kato Memorial trust for NAMBYO Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Onishi</surname><given-names>Akishi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neural retina-derived retinoic acids synthesized by Aldh1a1 control choroidal vascular development by regulating RPE-secreted VEGF.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that consists of photoreceptor cells, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and its basement (Bruch’s) membrane. Disorder of the retina causes vision loss. The primary nutrient source for the retina is the choroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bill et al., 1980</xref>), which is a highly vascularized tissue layer surrounding the retina. The choroid consists of three layers: Haller’s layer (large blood vessel layer), Sattler’s layer (medium size blood vessels), and the choriocapillaris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hogan et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nickla and Wallman, 2010</xref>). The choriocapillaris is a unique anastomosed vascular structure with an extraretinal fenestrated capillary bed that lies in a single plane below Bruch’s membrane.</p><p>In the mouse retina, choroidal development begins from embryonic day (E)13.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marneros et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saint-Geniez et al., 2006</xref>). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to be a central regulator of vascular development during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coultas et al., 2005</xref>), and VEGF secreted from RPE cells is indispensable for the vascular development and maintenance of the choroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saint-Geniez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Le et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kurihara et al., 2012</xref>). VEGF expression is enhanced by a number of transcription factors such as hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α), estrogen-related receptor-α (ERRα), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coreceptor 1α (PGC-1α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ziello et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ueta et al., 2012</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism of choroidal vascular development and the regulatory mechanism of VEGF secreted from RPE have not been clarified.</p><p>In the present study, we found that aldehyde dehydrogenase one family, member A1 (<italic>Aldh1a1</italic>) knockout (<italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>–/–</sup>) mice have hypoplasia in the dorsal region of the choroid. Aldh1a1 is an enzyme that synthesizes retinoic acids (RAs) and is expressed in the dorsal neural retina from the embryonic stage, not in the RPE and the choroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Molotkov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>). RAs are essential for biological activities such as reproduction, development, growth, and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rhinn and Dollé, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cunningham and Duester, 2015</xref>). We analyzed choroidal vascular development in <italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice, and demonstrated how Aldh1a1 expressed in the neural retinas in trans enhances VEGF secretion from the RPE to the choroid. We also found that, mechanistically, Sox9 expression in RPE is downstream of the signaling pathway mediated by Aldh1a1 in the neural retina.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Aldh1a1 is preferentially expressed in the dorsal region of the mouse neural retinas, not in the RPE/choroid complex</title><p>It was previously reported that Aldh1a1 is expressed in the dorsal region of embryonic and adult retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McCaffery et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matt et al., 2005</xref>). However, the retinal cell types that express Aldh1a1 have not been precisely identified. Therefore, we performed immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization studies in embryonic and adult mouse retinas.</p><p>At E12.5, Aldh1a1 was localized in the progenitor cells at the dorsal neural retina, and no Aldh1a1 expression was observed in the RPE and choroid complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Aldh1a3, an Aldh1 family enzyme that generates RA, was mainly localized in the ventral region of the retina and RPE. At E17.5, Aldh1a1 expression was observed in the dorsal region and the ventral edge, but no expression was detected in the RPE/choroid complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In adult tissue, in situ hybridization showed that Aldh1a1-positive cells were preferentially localized in the middle of the inner nuclear layer (INL) cells, and had spread to the dorsal region of the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We also observed Aldh1a1-positive cells at the ventral edge of the adult retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Immunohistochemistry of sectioned tissues showed Aldh1a1 colocalized with glutamine synthetase (GS), a marker of Müller glia.

To test this hypothesis, we first evaluated the VEGF level in E17.5 and P24 RPE-choroid complexes by ELISA. VEGF levels in the <italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>–/–</sup> RPE-choroid complex were significantly lower than those in WT eyes at both time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

In the dorsal region of VAD eyes, the vascular density was significantly lower than that in the other regions such as the dorsal and ventral regions of WT and the ventral region of VAD eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Also, RA administration to pregnant <italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice by oral gavage from E10 to E16 significantly suppressed the dorsal choroidal hypoplasia in their offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>).

Here, we could immunohistochemically discriminate choriocapillaris from medium-sized/large blood vessels in Haller’s/Sattler’s layer in mouse eyes and then demonstrated that disruption of <italic>Aldh1a1</italic>, which is predominantly localized in the dorsal neural retina, resulted in choroidal hypoplasia in the dorsal portion of the eyes.</p><p>Previous developmental and electrophysiological analyses of the <italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mouse has shown that the neural retina is apparently normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2003</xref>). By broadening the phenotyping scope, we identified vascular hypoplasia in the dorsal choroid of <italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>–/–</sup> eyes. Aldh1a1 is expressed in dorsal retinal progenitor cells from E10.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matt et al., 2005</xref>), and we observed no Aldh1a1 expression in either RPE cells or choroid in E12.5 and E17.5 mouse eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). CD31-positive endothelial cells and VEGF expression in mouse eyes can be observed in choroid and primitive RPE cells at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saint-Geniez et al., 2006</xref>), and choroidal vascular development is initiated at E11.5 when periocular vessels emerge following formation of the vascular network at around E13.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhao and Overbeek, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marneros et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saint-Geniez et al., 2006</xref>). The requirement for RPE-derived VEGF during embryonic development was reported using RPE-specific <italic>Vegfa</italic>-knockout mice (<italic>Vegf</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup>;<italic>VMD</italic>2-Cre mice), in which Cre expression can be conditionally induced in RPE cells by doxycycline administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le et al., 2008</xref>). Although conditional disruption of <italic>Vegfa</italic> in RPE cells at E10 or E13 resulted in decreased choroidal vascular density, loss of the RPE-produced VEGF after E15 caused no significant defects in the choroidal vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Le et al., 2010</xref>). Together with our demonstration that choroidal VEGF production is downregulated in <italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>–/–</sup> embryos, these data suggest that Aldh1a1 expression during E10 to E13 in trans potentiates VEGF secretion from RPE cells to allow the development of normal choroidal vascularization. In addition, it should be noted that choroidal VEGF level was still reduced at P24 in the <italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice. Considering that severe choriocapillaris vasoconstriction occurs in adult tamoxifen-induced <italic>Vegf</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup>;<italic>VMD</italic>2-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kurihara et al., 2012</xref>), it is possible that Aldh1a1 is also responsible for maintenance of the choriocapillaris.</p><p>We also demonstrated that RAs enhanced VEGF secretion from primary RPE cells and that VAD mice showed choroidal hypoplasia in the dorsal region. Also, RA administration suppressed the choroidal hypoplasia phenotype in <italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice. These results strongly suggest that Aldh1a1-mediated RA is responsible for normal choroidal vascular formation by controlling VEGF secretion from RPE cells. Moreover, we observed downregulation of Sox9 in the dorsal <italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>–/–</sup> eyes. RPE-specific disruption of Sox9 replicated the phenotype of <italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>–/–</sup> eyes, and Sox9 overexpression in the <italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>–/–</sup> RPE cells rescued dorsal choroidal hypoplasia. Considering that in primary RPE cells RA exposure enhances both <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Vegfa</italic> expression and that overexpression and knockdown of Sox9 influences <italic>Vegfa</italic> expression, it is more likely that Aldh1a1-mediated RA production stimulates Sox9 expression in dorsal RPE cells and Sox9 then transactivates the <italic>Vegfa</italic> promoter. Retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) and retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) are expressed in RPE cells at an early embryonic stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mori et al., 2001</xref>). It is plausible that RARα and RXRα enhance Sox9 expression in dorsal RPE cells, although the precise molecular mechanism remains to be investigated.</p><p>We observed interactions between <italic>Aldh1a1</italic>, <italic>Sox9</italic>, and <italic>Vegfa</italic> genes; however, the results raised the question of why VAD mice and RPE-cKO of <italic>Sox9</italic> show choroidal hypoplasia only in the dorsal region because the reduction of vitamin A and Sox9 also occurs in the ventral region. We do not yet have the answer, but one possibility is that ventral choroidal vascular development is governed by a different molecular pathway. For example, Aldh1a3, another RA-producing enzyme in the mouse retina, is expressed in RPE cells from E10.5 to E12.5 and in the ventral neural retina during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matt et al., 2005</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, conditional disruption of <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> in the neural retina (floxed <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> mice crossed with <italic>Pax6</italic>-α-Cre) did not result in either choroidal hypoplasia or loss of pigmentation in the ventral region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that Aldh1a3-mediated RAs from the ventral neural retina are unlikely to affect ventral choroidal development. In addition, we did not observe upregulation of Sox9 in the ventral RPE cells from E12.5 to E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>), suggesting that Sox9 in the ventral RPE cells is unnecessary for ventral choroidal development. Given that mRFP and GFP fluorescent intensity seems different between dorsal and ventral RPEs in Tg-CAG-mRFP<sup>floxed</sup>-<italic>SOX9</italic>-ires-EGFP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), the difference might be the result of different developmental or physiological characteristics.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate a novel role of Aldh1a1 in dorsal choroidal vascular development. The results of the present study strongly suggest that RA production resulting from Aldh1a1 expression in the dorsal neural retina upregulates Sox9 expression in the dorsal RPE cells to enhance RPE-derived VEGF secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In addition, our results suggest that embryonic RA exposure may regulate future dorsal choroidal vessels in the adult. Because vascular hypoplasia could result in hypoxia and impaired nutrient supply, which could affect adjacent RPE and photoreceptor cells, future studies should investigate the degeneration of RPE and photoreceptor cells. For example, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe vision loss in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Jong, 2006</xref>) and is caused by abnormalities of the subfoveal choriocapillaris. <italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and VAD mice would be useful not only to study regional differences in choroidal development and maintenance but also to explore both a risk factor and a potential therapeutic target for AMD, because the RA concentration in the neural retina is affected by various environmental factors such as dietary intake of Vitamin A and light irradiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were conducted with the approval of the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology Ethics Committee (No. AH18-05-23).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor, Jeremy Nathans as the Reviewing Editor and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Jing Chen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>As you will see, all of the reviewers were impressed with the importance of your work, but they also had a number of specific comments.</p><p>I am including the three reviews at the end of this letter, as there are a variety of specific and useful suggestions in them. Most of the comments are focused on greater documentation of the ocular phenotypes. One point that may be more challenging to address in a reasonable time frame is the specificity of the <italic>Tyr</italic>-Cre and <italic>Pax6</italic>-α-Cre lines. This can be done by crossing these Cre lines to a reporter (a nuclear localized reporter might be best). This point is summarized as item 4 in the comments of reviewer #2, which I am reproducing below.</p><p>&quot;One concern relates to the foundations for the mechanistic conclusions of the paper. The model and main interpretations leading to the model are based on genetic manipulations using Cre-lines that the authors claim to be specific, i.e., <italic>Tyr</italic>-Cre, specific for RPE, and <italic>Pax6</italic>-α-Cre, specific for neural retina. However, since the specificities of these are critical for the conclusions of the paper, the authors need to better characterize them. Certainly, these lines have been published before but they were not described in the retina/choroid context. For instance, how specific is the <italic>Tyr</italic>-Cre line to the RPE? Since the choriocapillaris has melanin, it is possible that the manipulations of <italic>Sox9</italic>, either the KO or the overexpression rescue experiment, are not totally RPE-specific. This might affect the authors' interpretations in terms of the mechanism. Note that <italic>Sox9</italic> is also expressed in the choroid (Figure 4). Is <italic>Pax6</italic>-α-Cre expressed in all neural retina?&quot;</p><p>The challenge is made greater because the best design of this experiment would be to cross the Cre lines to reporters in an albino background (to avoid the difficulty of visualizing fluorescent reporters or immunofluorescent staining in heavily pigmented cells, i.e. RPE and choroid).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this study, the authors link neuroretinal <italic>Aldh1a1</italic> to dorsal choroidal vascular development via regulation of RPE synthesis of VEGF. The authors found a compelling phenotype of hypoplasia choroidal with insufficient vascularization in the dorsal region in <italic>Aldh1a1</italic> knockout mice. The authors found that <italic>Aldh1a1</italic>, an enzyme used for retinoic acid synthesis, is localized in the dorsal neuroretina from the very early embryonic stage to adult stage. By using in situ techniques and conditional knockout mice, the authors found that <italic>Aldh1a1</italic>-induced RA in neural retinal directs dorsal choroidal vascularization via RPE-derived VEGF production by increasing <italic>Sox9</italic> expression in RPE. They provide a well-organized and logical set of experiments that provide a viable and interesting mechanism involving retinoic acid and <italic>Sox9</italic> expression in the RPE. The data looks solid, with good quality images. The mechanisms governing choroidal vascular development remain poorly understood, so the current study provides a novel and important advance to the field.</p><p>Although the study is overall very interesting and insightful, one slight weakness is that the manuscript only provides correlation of <italic>Aldh1a1, Sox9</italic>, and VEGF expression, and lacks the mechanistic evidence on how <italic>Aldh1a1</italic> regulates <italic>Sox9</italic> and therefore regulates VEGF expression in RPE cells.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Although <italic>Sox9</italic> has been previously been reported to regulate VEGF expression, experiments showing the expression of VEGF in <italic>Sox9</italic> overexpressing mice and knockout mice would strengthen the conclusion of the manuscript.</p><p>The authors suggest that <italic>Aldh1a1</italic>-derived RA from dorsal neural retina upregulate <italic>Sox9</italic> and then VEGF in RPE. Can vitamin A diet rescue choroidal hyperplasia in <italic>Aldh1a1</italic> knockout mice?</p><p>The vascularized area (%) from both dorsal and ventral choroid should be plotted in Figure 5A and 5B.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper reveals an interesting observation of choroid development in the mouse. By analyzing the <italic>Aldh1a1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice the authors found a peculiar phenotype of choroidal hypoplasia only in the dorsal retina. Interestingly the ventral choroid is not dependent on RA signaling, as <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> conditional KO does not have an effect on choroid development. The authors suggest a model of the mechanism, where RA synthesized by <italic>Aldh1a1</italic> in the dorsal domain of the neural retina induces <italic>Sox9</italic> in the dorsal RPE that ultimately leads to increased secretion of VEGF from RPE, and subsequent regulation of choroid development. These findings contribute to our understanding of choroid development, suggesting that there are differential mechanisms for regulation of choroid development along the dorso-ventral (D/V) axis of the mouse retina.</p><p>1) The phenotype should be thoroughly investigated using comprehensive characterization of the choroid along thDV axis. EM analyses along the D/V axis in WT and <italic>Aldh1a1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> at &quot;critical&quot; domains, such as dorsal, central and ventral, would improve the understanding of these processes.</p><p>2) The authors should do a better job explaining the phenotype in <italic>Aldh1a1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>. How penetrant is the loss of pigmentation phenotype? Why is it patchy? And does it always appear in the same location or does it vary within the dorsal domain? In the retina shown in Figure 1D the unpigmented area seems to expand towards the central domain, outside of the <italic>Aldh1a1</italic> expression region. Is this correct? Are the other phenotypes, i.e., choroid thickness reduction and decrease in vascular area, also patchy or are they observed throughout the whole dorsal region, correlating with the domain of <italic>Aldh1a1</italic> expression? It would be helpful to correlate the appearance of phenotypes with the expression pattern of <italic>Aldh1a1</italic>. Along these lines, it is not clear what the authors think is the most affected layer of the choroid in the <italic>Aldh1a1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>? The Haller's (large), Sattler's (medium) or choriocapillaris?</p><p>3) Due to the homeostatic regulation of RA signaling, the authors should check if the expression of <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> and <italic>Cyp26s</italic> were altered in the <italic>Aldh1a1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and vice-versa.</p><p>4) One concern relates to the foundations for the mechanistic conclusions of the paper. The model and main interpretations leading to the model are based on genetic manipulations using Cre-lines that the authors claim to be specific, i.e., <italic>Tyr</italic>-Cre, specific for RPE, and <italic>Pax6</italic>-α-Cre, specific for neural retina. However, since the specificities of these are critical for the conclusions of the paper, the authors need to better characterize them. Certainly, these lines have been published before but they were not described in the retina/choroid context. For instance, how specific is the <italic>Tyr</italic>-Cre line to the RPE? Since the choriocapillaris has melanin, it is possible that the manipulations of <italic>Sox9</italic>, either the KO or the overexpression rescue experiment, are not totally RPE-specific. This might affect the authors' interpretations in terms of the mechanism. Note that <italic>Sox9</italic> is also expressed in the choroid (Figure 4). Is <italic>Pax6</italic>-α-Cre expressed in all neural retina?</p><p>5) The phenotype in the <italic>Sox9</italic> RPE-conditional KO should be quantified, as in the <italic>Aldh1a1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, by measuring the% of vascular area. Likewise, RPE cell integrity should be assessed as well as the reduced levels of VEGF produced in the RPE-choroid complexes of the <italic>Sox9</italic> RPE-KO. Similarly, the phenotype in the rescue experiment of overexpression of RPE-<italic>Sox9</italic> in the <italic>Aldh1a1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> should be quantified in the same way. It seems that it is only rescued to some extent. And are the secretion levels of VEGF also rescued?</p><p>- The authors claim that endomucin is a specific marker of choriocapillaris (Results subsection “<italic>Aldh1a1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited choroidal hypoplasia in the dorsal region”) but a previous paper shows that expression of endomucin extends to other layers of the choroid (Saint-Geniez et al., 2006). CD31 seems to be more specific to the choriocapillaris than endomucin (Saint-Geniez et al., 2006).</p><p>- At the end of the second paragraph in the Discussion, the authors mentioned that it is &quot;possible that <italic>Adh1a1</italic> is also responsible for maintenance of the choriocapillaris&quot;. Their data on the VAD-diet experiment strongly suggests that indeed this is the case, as the VAD-diet was used starting from P0 and not applied in embryonic stages by feeding the pregnant mice.</p><p>- In the Figure 2 legend (C) mentions &quot;orthogonal images of the Z-stacks (…) showing thin choroid…&quot;. It is actually hard to see the thinning of the choroid on these images.

The authors showed that mice with retinal neuronal deficiency of ALDH1a1 exhibited decreased VEGF and <italic>Sox9</italic> production in RPE (retinal pigment epithelium), and dorsal choroidal hypoplasia, which was phenocopied in mice with RA-deficient diet and also in mutant mice with RPE specific loss of <italic>Sox9</italic>. Based on these findings the authors concluded that neuronal ALDH1a1 affected dorsal choroidal vascular development via influencing retinoic acid-dependent, <italic>Sox9</italic>-mediated VEGF production in RPE. Overall this is a beautiful study that convincingly demonstrated the molecular interaction between retina and RPE via ALDH1a1/RA/<italic>Sox9</italic>/VEGF axis to control dorsal choroidal vascular development, which is of high interest for research in both basic development biology and also eye diseases with choroidal abnormalities such as age-related macular degeneration.

One point that may be more challenging to address in a reasonable time frame is the specificity of the Tyr-Cre and Pax6-α-Cre lines. This can be done by crossing these Cre lines to a reporter (a nuclear localized reporter might be best).

The model and main interpretations leading to the model are based on genetic manipulations using Cre-lines that the authors claim to be specific, i.e., Tyr-Cre, specific for RPE, and Pax6-α-Cre, specific for neural retina. However, since the specificities of these are critical for the conclusions of the paper, the authors need to better characterize them. Certainly, these lines have been published before but they were not described in the retina/choroid context. For instance, how specific is the Tyr-Cre line to the RPE? Since the choriocapillaris has melanin, it is possible that the manipulations of Sox9, either the KO or the overexpression rescue experiment, are not totally RPE-specific. This might affect the authors' interpretations in terms of the mechanism. Note that Sox9 is also expressed in the choroid (Figure 4).

No ISH signals were found in the ONL.</p></body></sub-article></article>
