In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, song is detected by antennal mechanosensory neurons and further processed by second-order aPN1/aLN(al) neurons. However, little is known about the central pathways mediating courtship hearing. In this study, we identified a male-specific pathway for courtship hearing via third-order ventrolateral protocerebrum Projection Neuron 1 (vPN1) neurons and fourth-order pC1 neurons. Genetic inactivation of vPN1 or pC1 disrupts song-induced male-chaining behavior. Calcium imaging reveals that vPN1 responds preferentially to pulse song with long inter-pulse intervals (IPIs), while pC1 responses to pulse song closely match the behavioral chaining responses at different IPIs. Moreover, genetic activation of either vPN1 or pC1 induced courtship chaining, mimicking the behavioral response to song. These results outline the aPN1-vPN1-pC1 pathway as a labeled line for the processing and transformation of courtship song in males.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08477.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08477.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08477.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The seemingly simple fruit fly engages in an intricate courtship ritual before it mates. Male flies use their wings to ‘sing’ a complex song that makes females more willing to mate. The song also encourages nearby males to start courting, and these males may then intervene to compete for the female. Each species of fruit fly has its own song, and it is important for both males and females to detect the right song.</p><p>The sounds of the courtship song are detected by vibration-sensitive neurons on the flies' antennae. These neurons send signals to the fly's brain. But little is known about how this information is then processed, or how information about the song can be integrated with other courtship cues.</p><p>Zhou et al. have now identified a pathway of neurons in male flies that is responsible for hearing the courtship song. This pathway stretches from the antennae to neurons deep within the brain. These neural pathways are different in males and females, suggesting that the two sexes use different circuits of neurons for hearing courtship songs. Zhou et al. then used genetic techniques to show that males need every neuron in this pathway to hear courtship songs.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that stimulating the ‘deep layer’ neurons caused male flies to respond as if they are hearing the courtship song. These neurons are likely to integrate the song with information from other senses and may encode a general signal for arousal.</p><p>These findings now pave the way to deepen our understanding of how information from different senses—for example, courtship songs, visual cues, and pheromones—can be integrated to drive specific behaviors. The next challenge is to explore how species-specific songs are detected and recognized, a goal that has yet to be achieved in any species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08477.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08477.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>courtship</kwd><kwd>courtship song</kwd><kwd>auditory sensation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>Bruce S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Anatomical, behavioral and physiological evidence suggests that the aPN1-vPN1-pC1 pathway serves as a labeled line for the processing and transformation of courtship song in male <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sexual behaviors normally involve the exchange of species-specific social cues, including chemical, visual, and auditory information, that elicit a set of sex-specific behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dulac and Kimchi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manoli et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we are particularly focused on auditory communication, which requires the production and perception of sound signals that are diversified between species and are utilized by both invertebrates and vertebrates to attract female mates during courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murthy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brainard and Doupe, 2013</xref>). <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> males sing a multi-part, species-specific courtship song that is both critical to female receptivity and encourages courtship by nearby males. Although there has been progress in elucidating the circuitry by which these signals are perceived, processed, and integrated with other sensory cues to elicit stereotyped courtship behaviors, there are very significant gaps in our knowledge.</p><p>The neural circuits underlying sexually dimorphic behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are specified by the action of the two terminal genes in the sex determination hierarchy, <italic>fruitless (fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup><italic>)</italic> and <italic>doublesex (dsx)</italic>. <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup> and <italic>dsx</italic> act together to specify sexual behaviors by altering the number, morphology, and physiology of a small subset of CNS (Central Nervous System) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manoli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pavlou and Goodwin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</xref>). <italic>dsx</italic> is expressed in a limited set of neurons within the CNS, as well as in subsets of non-neuronal cells throughout the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rideout et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robinett et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup> is expressed only in neurons, including ∼2% of neurons within the CNS, as well as sensory, motor, and higher-order interneurons, all of which might comprise neural circuits dedicated to sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manoli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stockinger et al., 2005</xref>). This has motivated the proposal that <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup>+ neurons might provide a set of genetically labeled pathways that channel courtship-related sensory information through a dedicated circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manoli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stockinger et al., 2005</xref>). Supporting this view, a <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup>-labeled pathway has been identified that links olfactory reception of a male-specific pheromone to descending neurons that drive motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurtovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kohl et al., 2013</xref>). Despite tantalizing clues, it remains unknown whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> audition is mediated by such dedicated circuits.</p><p>When courting a female, the male vibrates his wing to generate a courtship song consisting of two parts: a rhythmic pulse song with an ∼35-ms inter-pulse interval (IPI) that strongly elicits male courtship behavior as well as female receptivity, as well as a ∼160-Hz sine song that may play a secondary role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shorey, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennet-Clark and Ewing, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arthur et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> species exhibit significant diversity in the IPI of pulse song, and in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, IPIs around ∼35 ms are critical for enhancing the responses to courtship song of both conspecific males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ewing and Bennet-Clark, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennet-Clark, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cowling and Burnet, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>). In females, pulse song induces reduced locomotion (allowing courting males to come closer) and increases their receptivity to mating attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennet-Clark, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schilcher, 1976a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">1976b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rybak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shirangi et al., 2013</xref>).

Although males and females show very different motor output in response to song, significant sexual dimorphisms in the sensory pathway have not been identified.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> receives sound stimuli by vibration of the arista, a feather-like structure protruding from the second segment of the antenna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gopfert and Robert, 2001</xref>). Vibration of the arista activates the mechanosensory neurons of the Johnston's organ of the second antennal segment, which project to the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC) of the central brain where they connect with secondary auditory projection neurons (aPNs), local neurons (aLNs), and the giant fiber neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gopfert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yorozu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Effertz et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tootoonian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lehnert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pezier et al., 2014</xref>). Among a variety of aPNs, only the aPN1 cell type projecting to the wedge of the ventrolateral protocerebrum (WED) is necessary for song responses in either sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tootoonian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>). aPN1 is necessary for both female receptivity and the male song-induced locomotion response, and it shows a response to courtship song that is proportional to pulse rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>). By identifying downstream neurons in this pathway, we hope to identify the sexually dimorphic structure of this critical pathway, as well as elucidate how song is transformed before reaching the central drivers of courtship output.</p><p>One candidate neuronal cluster for central integration of courtship song and other courtship modalities is the set of <italic>dsx</italic>+ pC1 neurons that innervate the lateral protocerebral complex (LPC), a region of dense innervation by both <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup>+ and <italic>dsx</italic>+ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cachero et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rideout et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robinett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). These neurons are activated by courtship stimuli in both sexes, but they drive differential behavioral outputs in each sex. Female pC1 neurons are activated by the male-specific pheromone cVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), while male <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup>+/<italic>dsx</italic>+ P1 neurons (a subset of the <italic>dsx</italic>+ pC1 population) are inhibited by cVA but activated by female pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohatsu et al., 2011</xref>). Female pC1 neurons are also activated by sine and pulse songs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). These observations are consistent with pC1 neurons as a site for multimodal integration of courtship stimuli, but how song information is relayed from aPN1 neurons to the pC1/P1 neurons is unknown.</p><p>Here, we used a large-scale intersectional screen to identify a labeled line of <italic>fru</italic>+ neurons that supports courtship hearing in male flies. This approach identified a critical <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup>+ interneuron type, which we designate as ventrolateral protocerebrum Projection Neuron 1 (vPN1), whose neurites lie in close proximity to those of aPN1 in the WED area. We present several lines of evidence suggesting that vPN1 may represent the third-order auditory neurons. First, anatomical registration of aPN1 and vPN1 suggests axon/dendrite overlap in the WED. Second, genetic inactivation of vPN1 recapitulates the attenuation of male song responses observed for aPN1, while optogenetic activation of vPN1 mimicked pulse song stimuli to induce robust male chaining. Third, GCaMP imaging revealed that both pulse song and sine song elicit strong calcium responses in vPN1 cell bodies and show a preferential response to pulse songs with long IPIs.</p><p>In addition, we found that vPN1 neurons likely target <italic>dsx</italic>+ pC1 neurons directly. Anatomically, vPN1 neurons overlap with pC1 neurons in the LPC region. Physiologically, the tuning curve of the pC1 calcium responses to pulse song IPIs closely matches that of behavioral chaining responses. Behaviorally, silencing pC1 neurons reduced male-chaining behavior in response to pulse song, while pC1 activation is sufficient to induce robust chaining responses. Lastly, simultaneous GCaMP imaging and CsChrimson stimulation reveals that the aPN1-vPN1-pC1 pathway is indeed functionally connected. Taken together, we provide anatomical, behavioral, and physiological evidence that the aPN1-vPN1-pC1 pathway provides a labeled line for processing courtship song in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An intersectional screen identifies <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup>+ second- and third-order auditory neurons</title><p>Motivated by the hypothesis that <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup> labels neurons that detect courtship-relevant sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manoli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stockinger et al., 2005</xref>), we performed an anatomical screen aimed at identifying <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup>+ neurons in the auditory pathway.

In addition, some of the differences between the tuning of vPN1 and pC1 may arise from distinct calcium dynamics in the recording sites for vPN1 (soma) and pC1 (neurites), or from cell-type specific differences in calcium dynamics. Indeed, although our results suggest that song representations may be serially transformed in the ascending auditory pathway, a circuit-level understanding of how local and projection neurons in this pathway shape this response remains to be discovered.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Optogenetic activation of vPN1 or pC1 neurons induced male chaining</title><p>To investigate whether neurogenetic activation of auditory neurons mimics the effects of courtship song presentation in inducing male-chaining behavior, we expressed the red light-sensitive channelrhodopsin CsChrimson in auditory neurons with intersectional drivers and assessed the effects of red light stimulation on groups of male flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>CsChrimson-mediated activation of aPN1 neurons did not induce male-chaining behavior when we tested two independent GAL4 drivers (<italic>R22B11</italic> and <italic>R49F09</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,D</xref>).

While activation of vPN1 induced chaining in an intensity-dependent or frequency-dependent manner, activation of pC1 generated a saturating response in which even the lowest intensity (0.006 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) or the lowest frequency (10 Hz) was able to induce robust chaining through &gt;90% of the testing period. Although it is not feasible to control for the expression strength of the aPN1, vPN1, and pC1 drivers, we suspect that the different dynamics of chaining behavior induced by activating aPN1, vPN1, or pC1 neurons may reflect the intrinsic properties of the cell types and the manner in which courtship song is encoded in these neurons. In particular, we note that the lack of response for aPN1 is consistent with the observation that the stimulus that best activates aPN1 (25 ms IPI) does not induce a strong behavioral response from wild-type flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>As song information flows from peripheral to central brain, the higher-order neurons may represent the socially relevant features of courtship in a simpler manner than in lower neurons, and this may account for the gradient of behavior phenotype we observed when we activate aPN1, vPN1, or pC1, respectively.

To further investigate the directionality of information flow in the aPN1-vPN1-pC1 pathway, we have used DenMark and Syt::GFP for post- and pre-synaptic labeling of vPN1 and pC1 neurons, respectively. The dendrites of vPN1 target the WED region, and vPN1 axonal termini ramify extensively in the LPC region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

Alternatively, it might be that the neurites of vPN1 and pC1 in the LPC region is too diffuse to allow reliable detection of the GRASP signal. The mono-synaptic nature of this circuit is still awaiting a validation from electron microscopy or eletrophysiology methods.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Courtship behavior of <italic>Drosophila</italic> males provides a fundamental model for understanding how species-specific courtship signals may be processed and integrated to drive stereotyped motor outputs.

For example, the male-specific pheromone cVA is processed by a four-neuron pathway extending from sensory neurons through to the ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>). This circuit appears to function as an olfactory labeled line, in that neurons in this circuit are functionally connected and selectively responsive to cVA.</p><p>We focused our efforts here on elucidating the auditory pathway underlying courtship song perception. We have demonstrated that the aPN1-vPN1-pC1 pathway is a labeled line for courtship hearing, by fulfilling four criteria: (1) these neurons are functionally connected; (2) these neurons respond preferentially to courtship song; (3) these neurons are necessary for the behavioral response to courtship song in male flies, and (4) activation of this labeled line provides a fictive stimulus, observable by the chaining response elicited upon CsChrimson activation. Strikingly, this labeled line appears to be specified by the expression of <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup> or <italic>dsx</italic>.</p><p>The auditory labeled line for courtship hearing begins with <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup>-expressing JONs and second-order auditory neurons aPN1/aLN(al) in the AMMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manoli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stockinger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>).

In addition, we have also demonstrated the connectivity, response patterns, necessity, and sufficiency of <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup> vPN1 and pC1 neurons in this pathway, thus, delineating a labeled line of <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup> neurons leading directly from sensory neuron to multimodal integration.</p><p>The inclusion of vPN1 in this pathway is supported by three lines of evidence. First, vPN1 projections extensively overlap with projections extended by aPN1 neurons within WED, and we observe functional connectivity between aPN1 and vPN1. Second, silencing vPN1 reduced pulse song-induced chaining in male flies, while optogenetic activation of vPN1 neurons mimicked a song signal to induce male chaining. Third, GCaMP recordings reveal that vPN1 responds strongly to both pulse song and sine song. We therefore conclude that <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup>+ vPN1 neurons are the third-order neurons mediating courtship hearing.</p><p>vPN1 may provide its output via innervation of the LPC, a region receiving multimodal input that is likely to be a site for multi-sensory integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). This area is heavily innervated by <italic>dsx</italic>+ pC1 neurons, which include most of the male-specific <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup>+ P1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohatsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). While the broader pC1 population is important for both male courtship and female receptivity, the P1 neurons play a critical role in the initiation of male courtship and respond to both male and female pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohatsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). These neurons appear to be the downstream targets of vPN1, based on three lines of evidence. First, the arborizations of pC1 neurons match very closely with the projection of vPN1 neurons in the LPC, and optogenetic activation of vPN1 generates robust activity in pC1. Second, pC1 neurons show calcium responses to pulse song stimuli, with IPI tuning that matches that of the behavioral response. Third, silencing pC1 neurons in male flies almost completely abolishes song-induced chaining, while activation induces robust chaining in the absence of song. We therefore conclude that vPN1 may carry song stimuli to activate pC1, where these stimuli are integrated with other sensory modalities such as pheromonal olfactory and gustatory cues to modulate the courtship level in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the neural circuit we identified suggests that song information flows via a labeled line of <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup> neurons from the antenna to AMMC, to WED, and then to LPC, providing a functional explanation of how pulse song induces male courtship behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>IPI tuning of auditory pathway</title><p>IPI is a key parameter of courtship song that exhibits great variation across <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cowling and Burnet, 1981</xref>). <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> not only produces song with a specific IPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shorey, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennet-Clark and Ewing, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>), but also behaviorally recognizes song with that conspecific IPI in both males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennet-Clark, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>). We have also shown that song-induced male-chaining behavior is most responsive to a 35-ms IPI, although longer IPIs (35–65 ms) are still able to induce robust chaining behavior.</p><p>While <italic>Drosophila</italic> has behavioral preferences toward the conspecific IPI, it has not been clear how IPIs are represented in the nervous system or how the fly discriminates specific IPIs. Our results suggest there is a significant change in pulse song representation across the ascending aPN1-vPN1-pC1 pathway. For aPN1, the GCaMP ∆F/F responses in female flies reflect an integration of pulse rate at IPIs longer than 25 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, vPN1 responses observed here are low-passed and preferentially tuned to longer IPIs. Interestingly, the vPN1 response saturates above ∼35-ms IPI, consistent with the saturating response observed when comparing dendritic and axonal GCaMP signals in aPN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, however, neither the aPN1 nor vPN1 response corresponds well with the behavioral sensitivity to IPI observed in male or female flies.</p><p>In contrast, the IPI sensitivity of pC1 reflects a band-pass response to IPI that closely matches the behavioral sensitivity of the chaining response. Indeed, the correlation between pC1 response and chaining behavior is significantly higher than the correlation observed for vPN1. Thus, while the mechanistic details remain unclear, the IPI sensitivity appropriate for species-appropriate responses is likely to be generated through a multi-stage transformation of song stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Sexual dimorphism of auditory circuits</title><p>Sexual dimorphism at multiple levels in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain may give rise to sex-specific differences in sensory processing and multimodal integration.

However, the pC1 auditory response cannot be easily explained by the dimorphism of vPN1, which responds to pulse song in males but is absent in females. Moreover, the absence of vPN1 in females begs the question of how pC1 receives song information in females. One explanation comes from the observation that vPN1 is a subset of the <italic>fru</italic>+ aSP-k clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cachero et al., 2010</xref>). aSP-k shows arborization in VLP and the LPC ring in both male and females, as well as male-specific innervation of the LPC arch that corresponds with vPN1 morphology.

For each candidate, the predicted 5′ and 3′ PCR products were generated, confirming proper targeting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Functional connectivity</title><p>Male flies 5 to 7 days old were dissected in saline containing: 103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM TES, 8 mM trehalose dihydrate, 10 mM glucose, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, bubbled with carbogen (5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% O<sub>2</sub>). The brain and ventral nerve cord were taken out of the fly and laid on a poly-lysine-coated coverslip. The dissection was realized using the minimum level of illumination possible to avoid spurious activation of CsChrimson. Brains were then continuously perfused in the same saline at 60 ml/hr throughout the experiment. Imaging was done on a two-photon scanning microscope (PrairieTechnologies, Bruker). Excitation wavelength was 920 nm. CsChrimson was excited with 50-Hz trains of 2-ms 590-nm light pulses via a LED shining through the objective. Instantaneous powers measured out of the objective ranged between 50 μW/mm<sup>2</sup> and 700 μW/mm<sup>2</sup>. Experiments usually started with a 50 pulses train at 50 μW/mm<sup>2</sup>. If no response could be seen, the power was raised progressively until a response could be seen or the maximum power was reached. For pharmacology experiments, mecamylamine (50 μM) was administered through the perfusion line for times ranging from 3 to 5 min, followed by a wash period where the perfusion was drug-free again.</p><p>For aPN1 activation/vPN1 recording, <italic>R59C10-LexA::p65/LexAop2-CsChrimson; R72E10-GAL4/UAS-GCaMP6m</italic> flies were used and the cell soma of vPN1 neurons was recorded, as it was the only place where we could confidently identify the vPN1 neurons. For vPN1 activation/pC1 recording, <italic>R72E10-GAL4AD/UAS-CsChrimson; VT9665-GAL4DBD, dsx</italic><sup><italic>LexA</italic></sup><italic>/LexAop2-GCaMP6m</italic> flies were used and the LPC projection of pC1 neurons was imaged.</p><p>In the cases where cell somas were imaged (vPN1 imaging), fluorescence videos were segmented based on average intensity using k-means clustering, following which individual cell bodies were labeled as different region of interests.</p><p>In the cases where LPC projection was imaged, fluorescence videos were segmented by k-means (with 3 clusters) on the individual pixel traces of every run.</p><p>In both cases, ROIs were then cleaned up by an erosion/dilation step.</p><p>ΔF/F were then calculated for each run with F being the average signal before the stimulation. For further analysis, only the most responding ROI was kept.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed with MATLAB software. For the song-induced chaining assay, Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to detect significant differences between TNT and control groups at 80 dB song playback.</p><p>For GCaMP data, ROI selection and peak ΔF/F calculation were done using custom-written code in MATLAB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Source code 2</xref>). Calcium traces were smoothed with a cubic Savitzky-Golay filter. Peak ΔF/F was calculated from ΔF/F = (F<sub>t</sub> − F<sub>b</sub>)/F<sub>b</sub>, where F<sub>t</sub> is the maximum value in the 5-s window following stimulus onset and F<sub>b</sub> is the averaged value in the 1-s window before the stimulus onset.</p><p>Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare vPN1/pC1 responses at 35-ms IPI to those at shorter or longer IPIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5H, 6K</xref>). To normalize responses, each fly's response across IPIs was divided by its maximum response; these responses were subsequently averaged to generate the values presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L–N</xref>. To assess the correlation between calcium responses and chaining behavior with respect to IPI tuning, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient, <italic>r</italic>, between GCaMP and behavioral responses normalized by the maximum response value. The significance of this correlation was established by calculating a bootstrap distribution of correlations between samples with randomly permuted IPIs. The vPN1/behavior correlation was compared to the pC1/behavior correlation via Meng's z test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meng et al., 1992</xref>). The significance of the tuning curve shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref> was calculated using a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Gerald Rubin, Douglas Kim, and Barry Dickson for providing fly lines; Troy Shirangi, Dave Mellert, Kristine Branson, Jue Xie, Yingxue Wang, and members of the Baker lab for helpful discussions; Peter Polidoro for constructing the courtship chamber; Tanya Tabachnik, Steven Sawtelle, Jinyang Liu, Gus Lott, and Dominik Hoffmann for engineering support; Ming Wu and Yoshi Aso for helps with LED setup; the Janelia Research Campus Fly Core for technical assistance; and Alison Howard for administrative support.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mani Ramaswami (Reviewing Editor) and Dan Eberl and Ralph Greenspan (peer reviewers).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript describes a substantial effort to understand the neural pathway underlying the male version of the sexually dimorphic response to courtship song. Zhou et al. identify third and fourth order neurons in the fly brain that respond to courtship song. They beautifully demonstrate the connectivity of the neurons, their responsiveness to sound, and their involvement in male courtship behavior. Strikingly these synaptically connected neurons are both necessary and sufficient to mediate the male response to courtship song. The manuscript is well written, the experiments well executed and the conclusions are appropriate and make an exciting advance to the field. This work parallels another recent publication by the same group looking at the female equivalent pathway.</p><p>Points to be addressed in a revised manuscript:</p><p>1) The conclusion that the neurons are synaptically connected would be strengthened by GRASP experiments. Why are these not attempted or reported? If it is a formal possibility that the connections are indirect, then this should be stated.</p><p>2) The conclusion that vPN1 show low-pass filtering and pC1 neurons show band-pass filtering appears to be based on rather slim data. It could well be true but, particularly given the very weak response of pC1 neurons, is it possible that differences between these two neuronal types could be minor and that there could well be no real transformation of song representation from one to the other? This conclusion should be appropriately strengthened or qualified.</p><p>3) The authors mention that song induced male chaining is most responsive to ∼35ms IPI and that aPN1 integrates the pulse rate and vPN1 is a low pass filter. I couldn't seem to find any data or discussion of aPN1 or other projection neurons being able to integrate pulse rates faster than 35ms IPI.</p><p>4) Why does aPN1 activation not induce chaining behavior, if activation of the downstream neurons do? Is this a technical problem: i.e. not sufficient activation by the Chrimson system? Or is there a more interesting possibility? This should be acknowledged or discussed.</p><p>5) What if it's not vPN1 acting as a low pass filter, but 35ms being the natural limit of the fly auditory system and in turn aPN1 integration? Are there other circuits tuned for higher frequencies? If so, it's worth mentioning. This could potentially argue as another reason for how pC1 in females perceives song information despite lacking the so-called low pass vPN1 filter.</p><p>6) In the second paragraph of the subsection “Song-induced chaining behavior is tuned to conspecific IPIs”, this tuning would be superimposed over the receiver tuning in the JO itself in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Riabinina et al., 2011</xref>, Curr. Biol.).</p><p>7) In the first sentence of the fourth paragraph of the Introduction, the word “perceive” here is incorrect. “Receive” is more appropriate here. In other places in the manuscript the authors correctly use the word “perceive” in the context of decoding the sensory signals.</p><p>8) In the fourth paragraph of the Introduction, upon mention of the projections to AMMC, the authors should mention that the auditory JO neurons also have a direct input to the Giant Fiber.

Why are these not attempted or reported? If it is a formal possibility that the connections are indirect, then this should be stated.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have now conducted GRASP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) and found that reconstituted GFP signals are present between aPN1 and vPN1 neurons but barely detectable between vPN1 and pC1 neurons. One possibility could be that the projections of vPN1 and pC1 neurons in the LPC region are relatively diffuse, posing a great challenge for GRASP detection. We should also note that the <italic>71G01-LexA</italic> driver used for GRASP only labels a small subset of pC1 neurons, while the intersection of <italic>71G01-LexA</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic><sup><italic>GAL4</italic></sup> actually labels a broader group of pC1 neurons. The higher number of pC1 neurons labeled by the intersectional approach is likely due to flip-out of the stop cassette during early developmental time-points that might transiently express<italic>71G01-LexA</italic>. Thus, <italic>71G01-LexA</italic> alone may not label the subset of auditory pC1 neurons that synapse with vPN1 neurons. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that our data do not prove that aPN1-vPN1-pC1 neurons are mono-synaptically connected, and we have carefully revised the text to reflect this.</p><p><italic>2) The conclusion that vPN1 show low-pass filtering and pC1 neurons show band-pass filtering appears to be based on rather slim data. It could well be true but, particularly given the very weak response of pC1 neurons, is it possible that differences between these two neuronal types could be minor and that there could well be no real transformation of song representation from one to the other? This conclusion should be appropriately strengthened or qualified</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for raising these concerns. We now make textual changes to address these concerns.</p><p>First, we've toned down the overall statement regarding IPI transformation between vPN1 and pC1.</p><p>Second, we've changed the heading of the Results sub-section to “Potential transformation of song responses between vPN1 and pC1” to allow the possibility that the GCaMP response may suffer from some artifact.</p><p>Third, we've added a comment on the caveats of calcium imaging to the Results sub-section: “As caveats, however, we note that the slow decay kinetics of GCaMP6m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) may account for some of the observed low-pass properties observed in our vPN1 or pC1 recordings. […] Indeed, although our results suggest that song representations may be serially transformed in the ascending auditory pathway, a circuit-level understanding of how local and projection neurons in this pathway shape this response remains to be discovered.”</p><p><italic>3) The authors mention that song induced male chaining is most responsive to ∼35ms IPI and that aPN1 integrates the pulse rate and vPN1 is a low pass filter. I couldn't seem to find any data or discussion of aPN1 or other projection neurons being able to integrate pulse rates faster than 35ms IPI</italic>.</p><p>The aPN1 response to IPIs was reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>) where <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows that aPN1 response is proportional to pulse rate at IPIs longer than 25 ms. We apologize for this confusion and now cite this paper more clearly when we refer to the aPN1 results. In addition, we now include a template of the aPN1 response in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>) to allow for direct comparison.</p><p><italic>4) Why does aPN1 activation not induce chaining behavior, if activation of the downstream neurons do? Is this a technical problem: i.e. not sufficient activation by the Chrimson system? Or is there a more interesting possibility? This should be acknowledged or discussed.</italic></p><p>We believe that the insufficiency of Chrimson-activated aP1 neurons to induce male chaining is biologically relevant and is not a technical failure of the Chrimson system. The possibility that Chrimson system is not sufficient to activate aPN1 is less likely because we used multiple aPN1 drivers and relatively high LED power for red light stimulation. Moreover, the inability of aPN1 activation to induce male chaining is in line with the previous report that continuous [dTrpA1] activation of aPN1 neurons failed to restore female receptivity to wingless males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our leading hypothesis is that activation of aPN1 does not induce chaining for the reason that aPN1 may not encode song quality as a rate code. Evidence for this includes the observation that the aPN1 GCaMP response is maximal at an IPI (25 ms) that is not optimal to induce a behavioral response (see e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We think it is likely that the early temporal code in JON/aPN1 is transformed into a rate code within vPN1/PC1. While genetic activation is highly effective at evoking behavioral responses from presumably rate-coding neurons, it is insufficient to mimic the structure of temporal coding.</p><p>Moreover, we suspect that courtship song representation at the level of second-order neurons involves multiple neuronal cell types and solely activating aPN1 neurons is not sufficient to mimic a fictive courtship song stimulus. For example, aLN(al) neurons are GABAergic local inter-neurons that innervate AMMC and are behaviorally required for courtship hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>), however, it is still unknown how aLN(al) may communicate with aPN1 to process song signals. Alternatively, given the heterogeneous responses of AMMC-B1/aPN1 neurons to acoustic stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lai et al., 2012</xref>)), an uniform activation of aPN1 neurons may not be appropriate for behavioral induction.</p><p>Currently we favor the hypothesis that as song information flows from peripheral to central brain, the higher-order neurons may represent more salient and socially relevant features of courtship song than lower-order neurons, and this may account for the gradient of behavior phenotype we observed when we activate aPN1, vPN1 or pC1 respectively. We now discuss the behavioral differences upon Chrimson activation as follows:</p><p>“In particular we note that the lack of response for aPN1 is consistent with the observation that the stimulus that best activates aPN1 (25-ms IPI) does not induce a strong behavioral response from wild-type flies. […] This (still theoretical) architecture describes a possible transformation of song representations from a temporal code in aPN1 to a rate code in vPN1 – which is ultimately coupled with other sensory signals to encode overall behavioral arousal in PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>).”</p><p><italic>5) What if it's not vPN1 acting as a low pass filter, but 35ms being the natural limit of the fly auditory system and in turn aPN1 integration? Are there other circuits tuned for higher frequencies? If so, it's worth mentioning. This could potentially argue as another reason for how pC1 in females perceives song information despite lacking the so-called low pass vPN1 filter</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this concern. Pulse songs have two key features: intra-pulse frequency (IPF) and inter-pulse interval (IPI). It was determined with laser doppler vibrometric measurements that the optimal frequency detection for the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>'s antennal ear is ∼147 Hz, and in general the antennal receiver tuning is strongly correlated with the intra-pulse frequency of pulse songs in different <italic>Drosophila</italic> species rather than the inter-pulse interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Riabinina et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, previous study have revealed that the strongest responses in aPN1 arises at 25-ms IPI, well below the peak behavioral activation of 35-ms IPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While it is not possible to quantitatively compare the aPN1 responses in the previous study to vPN1 responses in this study (due to use of different GCaMP reagents and other experimental changes), it does seem clear that aPN1 responses and vPN1 responses are qualitatively different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, it is certainly correct that the mechanism of low-pass filtering for vPN1 need not reside within vPN1, and that we should not attempt to claim this.</p><p>To make this more clear, we have altered the discussion of this result to say “This [vPN1] signal displays low-pass response properties for IPI with a shoulder around 35-ms IPI, and is different from the aPN1 response that responds as a function of pulse rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>).”</p><p><italic>6) In the second paragraph of the subsection “Song-induced chaining behavior is tuned to conspecific IPIs”, this tuning would be superimposed over the receiver tuning in the JO itself in different species (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46"><italic>Riabinina et al., 2011</italic></xref><italic>, Curr. Biol.)</italic>.</p><p>As the authors mentioned before, receiver tuning is correlated with the IPF of conspecific pulse songs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Riabinina et al., 2011</xref>), while IPI tuning is more likely to be implemented by neural circuits in the brain. This possibility is also surmised by Riabinina et al., “if in the acoustic communication system of <italic>Drosophila</italic> it is the brain's prime task to detect conspecific pulse trains by analyzing the intervals between individual pulses, then it should be the ear's prime task to detect the individual pulses in the best possible way.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Riabinina et al., 2011</xref>), and further supported by our finding that IPI tuning of pC1 neurons is correlated with behavioral responses.
