locomotion and endocytosis, membrane-tethered WASP proteins stimulate actin filament nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex. This process generates highly branched arrays of filaments that grow toward the membrane to which they are tethered, a conflict that seemingly would restrict filament growth. Using three-color single-molecule imaging in vitro we revealed how the dynamic associations of Arp2/3 complex with mother filament and WASP are temporally coordinated with initiation of daughter filament growth. We found that WASP proteins dissociated from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex prior to new filament growth. Further, mutations that accelerated release of WASP from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex proportionally accelerated branch formation. These data suggest that while WASP promotes formation of pre-nucleation complexes, filament growth cannot occur until it is triggered by WASP release. This provides a mechanism by which membrane-bound WASP proteins can stimulate network growth without restraining it.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01008.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01008.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01008.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most cells are neither perfect spheres nor amorphous blobs, but instead have characteristic shapes that enable them to carry out specific roles within tissues or organs. These shapes are established by a type of scaffolding, called the cytoskeleton, that gives structure to the cell, and also forms networks over which other proteins, and even organelles, can travel.</p><p>The filaments that make up the cytoskeleton are composed of various proteins, one of which is called actin. Cellular actin filaments can grow by adding new actin molecules, and actin filaments can also have ‘branches’ that fork out from the mother filament. Branches grow out of an assembly of seven proteins known as the Arp2/3 complex, which attaches to the side of the mother filament. Branch growth is triggered by binding to the Arp2/3 complex of an additional protein, WASP, but the sequence of events required to initiate a new branch is not well understood. In particular, WASP is bound to cell membranes; at some point it must detach from the Arp2/3 complex so that the nearness of the membrane does not interfere with the growth of branches. Now, Smith et al. uncover how branch formation is triggered, and define a new role played by WASP in this process.</p><p>It is known that a specific region of the WASP protein called the VCA domain binds to both the Arp2/3 complex and actin. Smith et al. studied how this domain could initiate branch formation, and showed that a pair of VCA domains linked to each other, along with an Arp2/3 complex, could interact jointly with an existing actin filament before a new branch formed. However, new branches did not form unless the VCA-domain pair detached from the actin filament, leaving the Arp2/3 complex behind. Additionally, Smith et al. found that mutant VCA-domain pairs detached from the actin filament at different rates, which then determined the chance that a new branch formed.</p><p>These findings—and those of Helgeson and Nolen published concurrently in <italic>eLife</italic>—suggest that, in cells, two WASP proteins first recruit the Arp2/3 complex to the membrane, and that together they interact with an existing actin filament. The WASP proteins then release the filament, and only then does the Arp2/3 complex initiate the formation of an actin branch. Since the Arp2/3 complex is no longer attached to WASP, subsequent growth of the branch is not physically limited by linkage to the membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01008.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01008.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>TIRF</kwd><kwd>WH2</kwd><kwd>nucleation</kwd><kwd>Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein</kwd><kwd>verprolin homology</kwd><kwd>activation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM43369</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gelles</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosen</surname><given-names>Michael K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1544</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosen</surname><given-names>Michael K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRSEC 0820492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daugherty-Clarke</surname><given-names>Karen</given-names></name><name><surname>Goode</surname><given-names>Bruce L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM56322</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosen</surname><given-names>Michael K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM63691</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goode</surname><given-names>Bruce L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM098143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gelles</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>New insights into the mechanism responsible for the nucleation of branches on networks of actin filaments shed light on a process that is essential for eukaryotic cell motility and endocytosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Control of actin dynamics is essential to many cellular processes, including motility, vesicle trafficking, and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pollard and Cooper, 2009</xref>). The Actin related protein 2/Actin related protein 3 (Arp2/3) complex nucleates new (<italic>daughter</italic>) filaments from the sides of existing (<italic>mother</italic>) filaments in response to activating stimulus from the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pollard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Padrick and Rosen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campellone and Welch, 2010</xref>). Membrane-associated WASP proteins integrate upstream signals and activate Arp2/3 complex in the correct place and time to produce actin structures that perform a variety of cellular functions including motility. The verprolin homology-central-acidic (VCA) domain of WASP family proteins binds to monomeric actin and the Arp2/3 complex, and is both necessary and sufficient for the WASP proteins to stimulate nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Machesky and Insall, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miki and Takenawa, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Machesky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rohatgi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pollard, 2007</xref>).</p><p>VCA acts to promote daughter nucleation by Arp2/3 complex in several ways. VCA engagement promotes a conformational change in Arp2/3 complex that repositions Arp2 and Arp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Robinson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rodal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rouiller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hetrick et al., 2013</xref>). This conformational change is thought to be required to initiate daughter filament growth. Further, the initial monomers of the nucleated filament are delivered by the V region, or WASP homology 2 (WH2) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rohatgi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hertzog et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Irobi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chereau et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Padrick et al., 2011</xref>). However, the Arp2/3-VCA-actin complex is not active on its own; an additional stimulus must be provided by the mother filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mullins et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achard et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, when stimulated by VCA the Arp2/3 complex only nucleates filaments from the sides of existing filaments. This produces branched filament arrays in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mullins et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Machesky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchoin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amann and Pollard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achard et al., 2010</xref>), which resemble the branched networks found in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Svitkina and Borisy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vinzenz et al., 2012</xref>). An additional feature of the system is that simultaneous binding of two VCA peptides to Arp2/3 complex greatly potentiates daughter nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Padrick et al., 2011</xref>). It is likely that WASP oligomerization is a broadly used mechanism of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Padrick et al., 2008</xref>), and a number of cellular factors that dimerize or multimerize WASP have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Padrick and Rosen, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The molecular interactions and structural rearrangements outlined above contribute to VCA acting at more than one step in the nucleation pathway, although the pathway is not fully defined. It is established that VCA stimulates branch formation by accelerating the association of Arp2/3 complex with the mother filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, there is evidence from kinetic analyses that a VCA-dependent ‘activation step’ follows filament binding during nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marchand et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zalevsky et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beltzner and Pollard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). The nature of this step remains unknown but has been hypothesized to arise from conformational changes in the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marchand et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beltzner and Pollard, 2008</xref>). The activation step substantially limits the efficiency of nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>An interesting feature of WASP activation of daughter nucleation is that Arp2/3 complex must associate with membrane bound activators at an early stage in the process and yet be separated from those activators at a subsequent stage. In cells, branched filament networks have their barbed ends directed toward membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Small et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Svitkina and Borisy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vinzenz et al., 2012</xref>). The characteristic geometry of the branches nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex dictates that both mother and daughter filaments grow toward the membrane. However, WASP proteins are linked with activators on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Padrick and Rosen, 2010</xref>), so that VCA-bound Arp2/3 complex should be tethered to the membrane. This tethering creates a steric problem, in that the growing ends of the filaments are held against, and possibly have their growth limited by, the membrane. However, this problem is eventually resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, right). In lamellipodia, VCA-containing WAVE proteins stay associated with the leading edge, while the Arp2/3 complex is distributed throughout the actin mesh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lai et al., 2008</xref>). In both budding and fission yeasts, Arp2/3 complex is separated from membrane-bound activators during endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sirotkin et al., 2005</xref>). Analogously, in propulsive actin ‘comet tails’ Arp2/3 complex is found throughout the tail while its activators stay (largely) associated with the motile bacterium, virus, or vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Welch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Egile et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Loisel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taunton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weisswange et al., 2009</xref>). In vitro, branches are released from the budding yeast WASP family member Las17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2006</xref>). In all of these systems Arp2/3 complex can disengage from the surface attached activator within a short time of the onset of daughter filament growth.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01008.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pathway of Arp2/3 complex mediated actin branch formation activated by WASP protein dimers on the inside surface of a cell membrane, as deduced from previous studies.</title><p>Within the white arrow Arp2/3 complex is activated by VCA, detaches from the membrane and initiates daughter filament elongation.

Previous studies have proposed that VCA may dissociate from Arp2/3 complex prior to initiation of daughter filament growth. The observation that ATP hydrolysis by Arp2 decreases affinity for VCA suggested a possible trigger for dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dayel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dayel and Mullins, 2004</xref>), although hydrolysis was later shown to be dispensable for filament nucleation and to instead control disassembly of the branch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ingerman et al., 2013</xref>). Consideration of biochemical and structural data on WH2-actin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Egile et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Higgs et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hertzog et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Irobi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chereau et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boczkowska et al., 2008</xref>) led to speculation that during Arp2/3-mediated nucleation, the WH2 region of VCA may initially block the barbed end of actin delivered to the Arp2 or Arp3 subunit and thus must move or dissociate prior to daughter filament elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Padrick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hetrick et al., 2013</xref>). However, direct observation of the sequence of molecular events associated with the initiation of daughter filament growth and the release of VCA has been lacking.</p><p>Multi-wavelength single-molecule fluorescence colocalization methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friedman and Gelles, 2012</xref>) are a powerful approach to elucidating the reaction pathways and identifying key regulated steps in processes that involve multiple macromolecular components. Here we used three-color single molecule fluorescence experiments to directly visualize the sequence and rates of the key steps in the pathway through which VCA dimers, Arp2/3 complexes, and actin filaments associate with one another and generate a new actin branch. The work reveals that the activation step in nucleation is likely the release of VCA dimers from the nascent branch, such that VCA dissociation is the trigger for daughter filament growth. The problem of filament growth against a membrane to which it is tethered is therefore solved by a mechanism in which release from the membrane tether is required for filament initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>VCA is released from filament-bound Arp2/3 complex before initiation of daughter filament growth</title><p>To follow the coordination of VCA association with Arp2/3 complex during actin branch formation we labeled each protein with a fluorescent probe and visualized their colocalization dynamics using colocalization single molecule spectroscopy (CoSMoS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friedman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friedman and Gelles, 2012</xref>).

Like other dimeric VCAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Padrick et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), this diVCA construct was able to stimulate the activity of the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’) at low-nanomolar concentrations suitable for single molecule imaging, whereas labeled monomeric VCA constructs did not.</p><p>Using this combination of tagged proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) we directly observed individual Arp2/3 complex and diVCA molecules binding to immobilized actin filaments and nucleating new branches.

In nearly all cases (83 ± 9% S.E., based on 877 Arp2/3 complex observations), Arp2/3 complex and diVCA arrived simultaneously within the experimental time resolution (0.15 s), indicating that diVCA was bound to Arp2/3 complex prior to filament engagement, and that both proteins bound to filaments as a unit (‘Materials and methods’). The sparse labeling of actin and high fluorescence intensity of mother filaments did not permit us to detect the arrival of actin monomers with VCA and Arp2/3 complex. However, under the reaction conditions (5 nM diVCA and 1 μM actin), with a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of diVCA for actin of ∼300 nM (which is only slightly altered by the presence of Arp2/3 complex, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), we expect ∼77% of diVCAs to have at least one actin bound. Thus, most of the diVCA-Arp2/3 complexes observed to bind mother filament should contain actin and thus have all the molecular factors needed for nucleation. We hereafter refer to this filament-bound complex as the ‘nascent branch’, an intermediate in the pathway to daughter filament assembly.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01008.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Rapid release of dimeric VCA from the nascent branch precedes nucleation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Design of an experiment to observe diVCA-activated branch nucleation by Arp2/3 complex on the sides of surface-immobilized actin filaments.

This is consistent with our previous observations that the vast majority of Arp2/3 complex binding events are non-productive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). In nearly all cases (97.3 ± 0.4%, based on 758 nascent branch observations), diVCA and Arp2/3 complex dissociated simultaneously as a unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The on-filament lifetime distributions of diVCA and Arp2/3 complex have identical short (τ<sub>1</sub> and τ<sub>2</sub>) components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> at time &lt;1 s), consistent with the conclusion that the two molecules are released from the filament as an Arp2/3-diVCA complex.</p><p>In contrast to the large majority of non-productive filament encounters, a small fraction of Arp2/3-diVCA filament binding events led to formation of a daughter filament. A merit of the single-molecule approach is that we could characterize these rare productive events (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>) independently of the excess of non-productive events. In the productive events, Arp2/3 complex and diVCA release were not simultaneous. There was no evidence that the Arp2/3 complexes which formed branches ever dissociated; the value of τ<sub>3</sub> is set by the photobleaching lifetime of the dye-labeled Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, diVCA dissociated rapidly (typically in &lt;1 s) from the productive Arp2/3-diVCA-filament complexes. Consistent with this observation, the on-filament lifetime distribution of diVCA lacks a long component (τ<sub>3</sub>) that is present in the on-filament lifetime distribution of Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> at time &gt; approximately 4 s). Thus, the data demonstrate that daughter nucleation is essentially always accompanied by Arp2/3 complex retention and diVCA release.</p><p>To determine whether diVCA release occurs before or after the onset of daughter filament growth, we measured the time at which each daughter filament initiated elongation by extrapolating daughter length records (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, top). These filament initiation times were then compared to the times of diVCA release from the same nascent branch. Filament initiation time measurements were imprecise because of the uncertainties inherent in measuring daughter filaments of sub-micrometer lengths. Nevertheless, within this experimental uncertainty we observed that the initiation of daughter filament growth always occurred at or after the time of diVCA release (41 observations; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This was true even in the comparatively rare cases in which diVCA persisted on the nascent branch for times &gt;1 s before dissociating. Taken together, these data suggest that the daughter filament cannot initiate unless and until VCA is released from the nascent branch. Thus, diVCA release may serve as the trigger for daughter growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>VCA does not bind Arp2/3 complex after branch formation</title><p>Next we asked whether diVCA can bind to Arp2/3 complex after branches have formed, in order to better understand how WASP recruits and activates free Arp2/3 complex yet does not stay bound to Arp2/3 complex in branch junctions and restrict network growth (‘Introduction’).

alter the association of diVCA with its binding partners. The V* and C* mutants, by disrupting interactions with Arp2/3 complex and monomeric actin, respectively, produce ternary diVCA-actin-Arp2/3 complexes that are less kinetically stable than wild-type. Conversely, the A* mutant produces a more stable ternary complex than wild-type.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Rate of diVCA release from the nascent branch limits rate of daughter filament nucleation</title><p>The diVCA mutants have distinct activities in stimulating branch nucleation by Arp2/3 complex. In bulk solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) wild-type diVCA boosted Arp2/3 complex-dependent nucleation by 2.0 ± 0.5-fold (p=0.017; measured by concentration of filament barbed ends at the midpoint of the reaction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The V* and C* mutants were more potent than wild-type (p=0.018 and 0.053, respectively), stimulating nucleation 10 ± 3-fold and 6 ± 3-fold. Conversely, the A* mutant was less potent than wild-type (p=0.040), stimulating only 1.4 ± 0.4 fold. In all of these experiments, the diVCA construct was at 25 nM, a concentration that produces near-maximal stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Similar effects of the mutant diVCA constructs were seen in real-time observations of individual filaments being nucleated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). As expected, all three diVCAs were able to promote nucleation from the sides of existing filaments. More importantly, the mutant diVCA constructs shared with wild-type the key molecular behaviors discussed previously. Like wild-type, mutant diVCA constructs released from the nascent branch prior to initiation of the daughter filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), and did not bind to Arp2/3 complex after the branch formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>; this later behavior could not be verified for the A* mutant because of its low activity in the experiments using tethered Arp2/3 complexes). Overall, these results suggest that the mutant constructs stimulate Arp2/3 complex by the same mechanism as wild-type. Moreover, the rank order of the diVCA construct nucleation activities was identical in the single-molecule measurements of the rate of branch formation observed on existing filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and in bulk measurements of concentration of filaments generated in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, the mutants provide a range of activities both above and below wild-type that can be seen in both experimental modes, and the mechanism by which the mutants stimulate branch formation appears to be identical to wild-type.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01008.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>diVCA constructs differ in the rate but not the pathway of activity in stimulating branch formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rate (±S.E.) of initiation of daughter filament growth by Arp2/3 complex in the absence or presence of diVCA wild-type and mutant constructs. <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub>, the second order rate constant for the appearance of branches on existing filaments, per subunit, was calculated from observations of branch formation on existing filaments, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (‘Materials and methods’).

Strikingly, this rate of release of diVCA from the nascent branch is proportional, within experimental uncertainty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), to the branch formation rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> measured above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Despite the relatively subtle effects of the mutants on the measured rate constants, the high correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic> = 0.993) is unlikely to be coincidental (p=0.0045; ‘Materials and methods’). This relationship provides strong support for the hypotheses that diVCA release is a prerequisite for daughter filament formation, and that the rate of release of diVCA limits the rate at which nascent branches initiate daughter filament growth.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>By placing three different colors of fluorescent labels on Arp2/3 complex, diVCA, and actin, we directly observed the sequence and kinetics of key steps in the branch nucleation pathway. The observations confirm our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>) that branch nucleation is inefficient even at near-saturating VCA protein concentrations, with only a small fraction of Arp2/3 complex-mother filament associations yielding branches. In contrast to the tight binding of diVCA to Arp2/3 complex in solution, we show that diVCA binding is undetectable when Arp2/3 complex is incorporated into a branch junction.</p><p>Significantly, we observed that the branch formation process is strictly dependent on release of diVCA from the filament-bound Arp2/3-diVCA complex. Taken together with earlier work, the data support a specific mechanism for diVCA-stimulated actin nucleation by Arp2/3 complex in which diVCA plays a dual role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Initially, diVCA stimulates assembly of the nascent branch by associating tightly with Arp2/3 complex and actin monomers, which promotes the binding of Arp2/3 complex to the sides of filaments. However, once the nascent branch forms, diVCA plays an inhibitory role: diVCA must dissociate before daughter filament can grow. In mutants that alter the interactions of diVCA with Arp2/3 complex or monomeric actin, alterations of the rate at which diVCA leaves the nascent branch exactly parallel changes in the efficiency of branch formation. These observations strongly suggest that diVCA dissociation is the key, rate-limiting step in daughter filament nucleation.</p><p>The key mechanistic conclusions reached here with dimerized VCA constructs in vitro are likely to apply to the mechanism of activation of branch nucleation by native WASP oligomers in vivo. Data on dimeric VCA showing a minimum crosslinker length for high activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Padrick et al., 2011</xref>) strongly suggests that the system passes through a form with two VCAs bound at some point during nucleation. The crosslinkers and spacer sequences used here allow a maximum VCA separation of 122 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Padrick et al., 2011</xref>). During Arp2/3 complex activation in diverse contexts in living cells, WASP family proteins are separated by similar or even smaller distances. For example, when dimerized by activators such as EspFu, the WASP protein VCA regions would be ∼80 Å apart if the proline rich region is considered as a random coil polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Padrick et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, ActA density on the surface of <italic>Listeria</italic> separates its VCA-like sequences by 19 nm, close enough to function as VCA dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Footer et al., 2008</xref>). N-WASP proteins recruited to moving PIP2-rich vesicles have a high local density, such that their average spacing is &lt;50 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Co et al., 2007</xref>), and in rocketing vesicles, N-WASP proteins are recruited by Nck onto the vesicle surface such that their average separation is ∼100 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ditlev et al., 2012</xref>). Bzz1 and Cdc15 are the activators of the fission yeast WASP family protein Wsp1 during endocytosis, and they array their SH3 domains (which engage Wsp1) at a density sufficient to bring VCA regions from adjacent Wsp1 proteins within 50–80 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arasada and Pollard, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The reaction scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> describes the essential features of the Arp2/3 complex-dependent filament nucleation process. This mechanism, derived from direct observation of single molecules as opposed to fitting of bulk data, is broadly consistent with proposed kinetic schemes for Arp2/3 complex nucleation of filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zalevsky et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beltzner and Pollard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). The dominant pathway is that VCA and actin monomer associate with Arp2/3 complex in solution, and this complex then binds to an existing filament, after which an activation step occurs, which allows the daughter filament to elongate. Here we add two informative points. First, we ascribe a distinct mechanism to the activation step, the release of diVCA. Previously this step had been ascribed to structural rearrangements within the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dayel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zalevsky et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beltzner and Pollard, 2008</xref>). Second, our measurements indicate that most engagements of diVCA-Arp2/3 complexes with the mother filament are resolved by dissociation of the complex from filament without releasing VCA, an idea distinct from previous models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beltzner and Pollard, 2008</xref>). It is possible that the observed inefficiency in branch formation is to allow for positive regulation of branch formation by factors not present in our experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this idea, cortactin has been recently demonstrated to accelerate release of WASP proteins from Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helgeson and Nolen, 2013</xref>). Since WASP proteins are tethered to the cell membrane, it is also possible that mechanical tension between the filament network and the membrane plays a similar role in promoting WASP release and consequent daughter growth, which might allow alteration of cell motility in response to mechanical stimuli.</p><p>While our scheme encompasses key features of the mechanism of diVCA stimulation of Arp2/3 complex-mediated branch formation, it should be noted that the scheme shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> is not complete. The clearest indication of this is that the diVCA lifetime distribution observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> is multi-exponential, whereas the scheme of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> predicts only a simple single-exponential distribution. The data can be explained if there are two or more conformations of filament-bound diVCA-Arp2/3 complexes that differ in kinetic stability. This proposal is consistent with our previous kinetic analysis with monomeric VCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>) and with demonstrations that Arp2/3 complex exists in multiple conformations in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rodal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Formulating a more complete kinetic mechanism of diVCA stimulation that accounts for the multiple diVCA-Arp2/3 complex conformations will require additional data.</p><p>Our model in which association of VCA with the nascent branch inhibits initiation of daughter filament growth is consistent with the known interaction of the WH2 motif (V-region) with actin in a conserved cleft involved in longitudinal filament contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hertzog et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Irobi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chereau et al., 2005</xref>). We suspect that inhibition of daughter filament elongation from nascent branches results from the WH2 motif staying engaged with the cleft, occluding addition of the next actin subunit in the daughter filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Egile et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Higgs et al., 1999</xref>). Further support for this model is realized by recent reports showing that VCA peptides covalently crosslinked to actin monomers are inactive in stimulating Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boczkowska et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ti et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, the C-region of VCA likely occupies a similar location on Arp2 and Arp3 that the V-region occupies on actin, preventing insertion of subdomain 2 of the actin recruited by the V-region into the cleft on the bound Arp subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hertzog et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Irobi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chereau et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boczkowska et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Padrick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ti et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the molecular structures are consistent with the observed dual function of VCA in both stimulating daughter nucleation (by recruiting actin monomers to Arp2/3 complex) and in suppressing daughter nucleation (by blocking assembly of the daughter filament). These structural models are also consistent with the low affinity of diVCA for branch junctions. If neither the V-region nor the C-region can bind the branch (when the actin and Arp clefts are occupied by D-loops of daughter filament actins), then the affinity of VCA for the branch may be of the order of that observed for isolated A-region. This affinity has been reported to be approximately 9 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marchand et al., 2001</xref>), consistent with the lack of observed binding under the conditions necessary for single molecule observations.</p><p>In cells, active WASP proteins are predominantly tethered to membranes. Taken together, our data suggests a straightforward mechanism by which WASP regulation of Arp2/3 complex can cause branches to form preferentially at membranes without having membrane attachment restrict network growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Binding of Arp2/3 complex to VCA dimers in the absence of mother filaments is of high affinity and of long lifetime, allowing dimerization of WASP by upstream activators to promote recruitment of Arp2/3 complex to the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, ‘WASP dimer association with Arp2/3 complex’). Association with VCA promotes filament binding by Arp2/3 complex (‘Arp2/3 complex engagement of filament’), but that process is readily reversible and the nascent branch most frequently is simply lost through dissociation (‘Filament release’). More rarely, WASP detaches (‘WASP release’) leaving Arp2/3 complex associated with the mother filament. This severs the direct linkage to the membrane, and only then allows the daughter filament to nucleate and grow (‘Initiation of daughter filament elongation’). Our data show that once the branch forms, WASP does not rebind. The dissociation of WASP prior to nucleation and the lack of rebinding provide an appealing explanation for how WASP dimers stimulate branched network formation at the membrane without interfering with network growth.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01008.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of WASP-Arp2/3 complex stimulated actin branch formation at cell membranes (see text).</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01008.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01008.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01008-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein design, labeling, and purification</title><p>The bis-maleimide crosslinked N-WASP VCA dimers were prepared from human N-WASP VCA (amino acid residues 432–505), with the sequence CGGSGGSGGSGGS appended at the N-terminus.

For experiments designed to enable quantitative comparison of actin assembly rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) to results from single molecule analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) the buffer was supplemented with additional components (final concentrations: 10 mM DTT, 0.2 mM ATP, 15 mM glucose, 0.02 mg/ml catalase, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mM 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox), 1 mM 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol, and 0.5 mM propyl gallate) so as to maintain similar buffer conditions in the two experiments. Reactions were then immediately placed in a cuvette in a PTI Quantamaster spectrofluorometer. Pyrene-actin fluorescence was observed over time by exciting at 365 nm and observing at 407 nm. For some assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), 10% pyrene labeling was used, and the reactions were placed into 96-well plates and followed using a plate reader (VarioSkan Flash, Thermo Scientific, Hudson, NH).</p><p>Actin filament barbed end concentrations were evaluated at 50% polymerization (<italic>t</italic><sub>50</sub>) by first scaling the pyrene fluorescence intensity over the full range of filament concentrations (0–1.9 µM), then fitting the slope (actin assembly rate) between 42% and 58% polymerization. These rates were then divided by the approximate filament elongation rate (10 subunits per second) to obtain the barbed end concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Fold stimulation of branch formation by diVCA was calculated by subtracting the barbed ends created by actin alone from the total barbed ends formed in the presence of Arp2/3 complex, then dividing the concentrations of these excess barbed ends formed in the presence diVCA by those formed in the absence of diVCA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fluorescence anisotropy</title><p>Binding of VCA to actin was monitored by fluorescence anisotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). 20 nM N-WASP VCA-AF488 was mixed with the indicated concentrations of actin and Cy3-diVCA competitor with buffer additions to bring the final mixture to 10 mM imidazole pH 7.0, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM ATP, and 1/10th residual concentration of buffer G. The mixtures were incubated for 3 min at room temperature prior to placing in a 3 mm by 3 mm cuvette in a T-form PTI Quantamaster Spectrafluorometer, equipped with Glan-Thompson polarizers. Emission intensity was averaged for 3 min and converted to anisotropy values, after correcting for background signal intensity and G-factor. Competition binding experiments (including N-WASP diVCA competition) were performed with 20 nM N-WASP VCA-AF488, 200 nM rabbit muscle actin, and the indicated concentrations of VCA dimers. Binding isotherms (both direct and competition binding) were fit to a complete competition binding solution for a single site receptor, using Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least squares methods, with bound and free fluorescence anisotropy as fit parameters. Direct binding isotherms were fit with the concentration of competitor ligand set to zero. Fitting of the competition-binding isotherm used the direct binding <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> that was obtained from fitting the direct binding isotherm. Fit values for free fluorescence anisotropy values were similar to the actual free anisotropy, and the values of free and bound fluorescence anisotropy determined from competition binding experiments was similar to that of the direct binding system.</p><p>Binding of VCA to bovine Arp2/3 complex in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) was monitored by fluorescence anisotropy using the same basic protocol as for actin binding, with a few modifications. First, the reporter was 20 nM VVCA-A462C-AF594. Next, as there was no actin present, there was no residual buffer G in the mixture. Finally, the mixture was incubated for 10 min prior to measurement, and the fluorescence intensity data averaged for 5 min. Solution binding of VCA to non-polymerizable <italic>Drosophila</italic> 5C actin, and to yeast Arp2/3 complex, was followed by fluorescence anisotropy. Acquisition and processing was similar to the actin binding assay described above, except 10 nM VCA-A594 was used, and either <italic>Drosophila</italic> 5C actin was added or endogenous budding yeast Arp2/3 complex was added. From fitting the Arp2/3 complex titration curve, 300 nM was judged to have essentially complete binding, and this was added to a separate titration of actin with Arp2/3 complex present. In fitting all three data sets, a single binding site was assumed on VCA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Colocalization single molecule spectroscopy (CoSMoS)</title><p>Single molecule imaging was performed on a custom built multi-wavelength total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope, described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friedman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friedman and Gelles, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, the microscope design permitted selective fluorescence excitation of molecules immobilized on the surface of a glass flow chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>) using three lasers at wavelengths 488 nm, 532 nm, and 633 nm. Emissions were split into short (&lt;635 nm) and long (&gt;635 nm) wavelengths and focused on different locations on the camera, to allow for simultaneous acquisition of two-color fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friedman et al., 2006</xref>). Experiments were performed using two different modes of operation described below, one for recording Arp2/3 complex and diVCA interacting with tethered filaments, and another for recording diVCA and filaments interacting with tethered Arp2/3 complexes.</p><p>All experiments were performed in TIRF buffer: 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM imidazole pH 7.2, 10 mM DTT, 0.2 mM ATP, 15 mM glucose, 0.02 mg/ml catalase, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 2% dextran. To suppress blinking of the fluorophores, TIRF buffer was supplemented with a mixture of triplet state quenchers: 1 mM 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox), 1 mM 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol, and 0.5 mM propyl gallate, which were dissolved in DMSO at a 200× stock concentration. Prior to flow chamber assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>), surfaces were first cleaned by sonication in detergent (2% Micro-90, 1 hr), ethanol (1 hr), KOH (0.1 M, 30 min), and deionized water (10 min), then coated with a mixture of methoxy-poly (ethylene glycol)-silane and biotin-poly (ethylene glycol)-silane (mPEG-sil-2000 and biotin-PEG-sil-3400; Laysan Bio Inc., Arab, AL) in 80% ethanol, pH 2 HCl, baked overnight at 70°C. Immediately before each experiment, the chambers were incubated in 0.5 mg/ml BSA and 0.03 mg/ml streptavidin in successive washes.</p><p>The oxygen scavenging activity of the glucose/glucose oxidase/catalase system in our buffers resulted in a gradual decrease in pH over time through the course of our experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi et al., 2010</xref>). We measured this pH change in our microscope flow chambers using a pH-sensitive fluorophore (SNARF-4F, pKa ∼6.4; Molecular Probes/Life Technologies), by recording the ratio of fluorescence emission intensities in the two color channels of our microscope, exciting at fixed wavelength (533 nm). The ratiometric response from 0.1 µM SNARF-4F was first calibrated using strong buffers (0.1 M phosphate buffer) over a pH range of 5.8–8.0 (increment 0.2). The time dependent pH of our TIRF buffer was then measured and found to decrease from 7.0 to 6.5 over the typical time course of our experiments (∼30 min). The effect of pH on Arp2/3 complex mediated actin filament assembly was also tested and showed that decreasing the pH from 7 to 6 increased nucleation twofold without VCA, while stimulation by diVCA and mutants differed by &lt;1.5-fold. Thus, we expect that the buffer conditions used for the single molecule experiments had only a minor influence on diVCA stimulation of branch formation by Arp2/3 complex.</p><p>For tethered-filament experiments, a mixture of 10% AF488 labeled actin, 1% biotinated actin, and unlabeled actin was allowed to polymerize for 2–8 hr at 3 μM in TIRF buffer without dextran. Preassembled filaments were then diluted 40-fold, flowed into the microscope observation chamber coated with a 1:100 mixture of biotin-PEG-silane:PEG-silane, and allowed to adhere to the surface. The chamber was then rinsed with TIRF buffer and the reaction mixture was introduced: 1 μM actin (10% AF488 labeled), 5 nM Arp2/3-SNAP649, and 5 nM Cy3-diVCA. Data was recorded for 15–30 min in cycles of a single 50 ms frame of fluorescence emission using 488 nm laser excitation (to image actin filaments) followed by continuous acquisition of 200 frames (50 ms per frame) of emissions using dual 532 nm and 633 nm excitation (to image Arp2/3 complex and diVCA). Each cycle was followed by a ∼1 s delay during which the focus was automatically adjusted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>), bringing the total cycle interval to ∼12 s.</p><p>For tethered-Arp2/3 experiments, 1 nM Arp2/3-SNAP-649-biotin was introduced into a microscope observation chamber coated with a 1:2000 mixture of biotin-PEG-silane:PEG-silane, and allowed to adhere to the surface. The chamber was then rinsed with TIRF buffer and the reaction mixture was introduced: 1 μM actin (10% AF488 labeled) and 0.1–1 nM Cy3-diVCA. Data was recorded for 30–50 min in cycles of a single frame of fluorescence emission using dual 488 nm and 633 nm excitation (to image actin filaments and tethered-Arp2/3) followed by continuous acquisition of emissions using 532 nm excitation (to image VCA). For these experiments the frame duration was varied in the range 0.05–1 s and the number of frames per cycle was adjusted such that each cycle interval was 14–28 s. The frame duration was increased to allow for the use of lower power excitation, so as to characterize and correct for the effect of photobleaching on the observed lifetimes of Cy3-diVCA bound to tethered Arp2/3 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>For each experiment, we calibrated the transformation matrix for superimposing images from the split emission recordings by imaging fluorescent beads that emitted in both the short- and long-wavelength color channels of the microscope. This transformation corrected for the translocation of the two color images on the camera, as well as differences in the rotation and magnification in the two channels. For records of colocalization on tethered Arp2/3 complexes we also corrected for drift in the microscope stage using automated tracking of the centers of 2D-Gaussian-fit fluorescence emissions from individual Arp2/3-SNAP649-biotin molecules stably tethered to the microscope slide.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>CoSMoS data analysis</title><p>Image processing and kinetic analysis was performed in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), Origin (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA) and with custom programs developed in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA).</p><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Colocalization dynamics before, during, and after branch formation</title><p>To monitor Arp2/3 complex and diVCA colocalization dynamics on the sides of tethered filaments during branch formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we first identified sites of branch formation in image sequences and integrated the fluorescence intensities in a 4 × 4 pixel (0.54 × 0.54 µm) area centered on the branch junctions. Fluorescence intensity traces were created from data in the long- and short-wavelength channels of the microscope, corresponding to Arp2/3-SNAP649 and Cy3-diVCA emissions, respectively. Daughter filament lengths were measured from AF488-actin images by manual tracing the filament contours, and nucleation times were calculated by extrapolating from linear fits of elongation data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). Errors in measurement of filament lengths, possibly due to non-uniform incorporation of labeled subunits or fluctuations of filament ends away from the microscope slide (and therefore out of the TIRF excitation field), sometimes led to nucleation times that preceded arrival of Arp2/3 complex on the mother filament (typically ∼20% of nucleation events). To ensure that nucleation times were accurate, we restricted our analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> to nucleation events that occurred &gt;0.1 s after Arp2/3 complex appeared on the mother filament side.</p><p>To monitor colocalization dynamics of diVCA and filaments on tethered Arp2/3 complexes, we first identified the locations where individual Arp2/3 complexes were stably tethered and integrated the fluorescence intensities at those locations in both emission channels. To specifically analyze diVCA-Arp2/3 interactions when Arp2/3 complex is not bound to filament sides, the Arp2/3-SNAP649-biotin and AF488-actin emission were used to identify periods where each Arp2/3 complex was tethered and no filament colocalized. diVCA binding and dissociation kinetics were then analyzed during those periods at each tethered-Arp2/3 location, as described below. In the rare cases when a mother filament colocalized with tethered-Arp2/3 and nucleation occurred, daughter filament lengths were measured (as above) and the interactions of diVCA with branch junctions were separately analyzed, in periods following nucleation during which tethered-Arp2/3 was continuously observed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Binding and dissociation kinetics</title><p>To detect times at which diVCA and Arp2/3 complex associated and detached from tethered filament sides, as well as times of association and dissociation of diVCA from tethered Arp2/3 complexes, a combination of automated colocalization detection algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crocker and Grier, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friedman and Gelles, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>) and manual inspection of images were used. First, the spatial and temporal coordinates of single molecule fluorescence were detected using custom particle tracking software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crocker and Grier, 1996</xref>), applied to image sequences that had been filtered by averaging of sequential frames (5-frame sliding average for Arp2/3 complex, 2-frame sliding average for diVCA). These coordinates were then compared to manually selected target sites: either a mask that circumscribed an observed tethered filament or the location of a tethered Arp2/3 complex. Colocalization was scored if the coordinates agreed within ∼0.8 µm from the center line of a tethered filament mask or within ∼0.3 µm of a tethered-Arp2/3 location. These colocalization records were used in combination with integrated fluorescence intensity traces and image sequences (not subjected to adjacent frame averaging) to guide the ultimate discrimination of bound and dissociated intervals.</p><p>Quantification of the kinetics of diVCA-Arp2/3 and Arp2/3-filament interactions was achieved by fitting distributions of bound and dissociated intervals to one-, two-, or three-exponential functions, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). Fits were performed with maximum likelihood algorithms and errors were determined by bootstrapping. The times until first appearance of an Arp2/3 complex on resolvable (0.4 µm) segments of tethered filaments were fit with a single-exponential function to find the second order rate constants for filament side binding (<italic>k</italic><sub>A+</sub>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The distribution of lifetimes of coincidently bound Arp2/3 complex and diVCA on filament sides were fit with three- and two-exponential functions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; see below for how coincidence was determined). Given the limited number of observations of branch formation events (&lt;70 for each diVCA construct) the dwell times of diVCA on filament-bound Arp2/3 complexes prior to nucleation were not fit to an exponential decay, rather, they were averaged to determine the mean lifetime of diVCA on the nascent branch (τ<sub>V</sub><sup>*</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). For tethered-Arp2/3 experiments, the second order rate constant for diVCA binding was obtained from single-exponential fits to the intervals where tethered-Arp2/3 was unoccupied by diVCA (<italic>k</italic><sub>V+</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>), whereas the characteristic lifetimes were obtained from double-exponential fits to the distributions of intervals where tethered-Arp2/3 was occupied by diVCA (τ<sub>V1</sub>, τ<sub>V2</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). There was no evidence that the biexponential distribution of diVCA-Arp2/3 complexes reflects two distinct forms of Arp2/3 complex that do not interconvert on the timescale of our experiment (∼30 min). This was assessed for the V* mutant by calculating the fraction of diVCA-V*-Arp2/3 complexes that lasted &lt;10 s for each tethered Arp2/3 complex observed, which showed a single distribution centered at ∼50%, consistent with the ensemble distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The effect of photobleaching on the apparent dissociation rate of Cy3-diVCA constructs was assessed and corrected by analyzing the dependence of τ<sub>V2</sub> on the excitation laser power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Laser power was measured by intercepting the beam path between dichroic mirror D3 and mirror M5 (Figure 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friedman et al., 2006</xref>). All binding rates and lifetime distributions were corrected for non-specific binding of Arp2/3 complex or diVCA to the microscope slide, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Arp2/3-diVCA coincidence, co-release, and branching efficiencies on filament sides</title><p>For each Arp2/3 complex detected on the side of a tethered filament, we evaluated what fraction arrived complexed with diVCA (<italic>f</italic><sub>AV</sub>). Coincident arrival of Arp2/3 complex and diVCA was determined if a diVCA appeared within 0.27 µm (2 pixels) from the location and within 0.15 s (3 frames) of the arrival time of the Arp2/3 complex, given conservative estimates of spatial and temporal resolutions of the frame-averaged dual-channel particle tracking methods. Although we cannot distinguish between coincident arrival and sequential arrival of Arp2/3 complex and diVCA within 0.15 s, we would not expect that diVCA could bind so rapidly after formation of Arp2/3-filament complexes, given the measured rate of binding to Arp2/3 complexes off-filament and the diVCA concentration in solution (∼10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> × 5 nM = ∼0.5 s<sup>−1</sup>). We also corrected the total number of Arp2/3 complexes that appeared on filament sides with and without diVCA by the expected number of Arp2/3-filament encounters missed because they were too transient (lifetime &lt;0.1 s) to be detected. This correction factor (1/p<sub>0</sub>) was calculated using the multi-exponential fits to the Arp2/3-filament lifetime distributions (survival probability p[<italic>t</italic>]), with and without coincident diVCA, evaluated at the minimum detectible event duration: p<sub>0</sub> = p(0.1 s). This detection efficiency was typically 0.5–0.6. The same correction factor was applied to the second order rate constants of filament side binding, <italic>k</italic><sub>A+</sub>.</p><p>Similarly, co-release of an Arp2/3 complex and diVCA was determined if the disappearance of diVCA was within 0.15 s from the disappearance of the Arp2/3 complex with which it coincidently bound the filament side. The subset of diVCA-Arp2/3-filament complexes from which diVCA was released leaving Arp2/3 complex bound to the filament, for at least 0.15 s after diVCA release, was counted toward the diVCA release efficiency (<italic>f</italic><sub>V−</sub>). Also, the fraction of diVCA-Arp2/3-filament complexes or Arp2/3-filament complexes that nucleated a daughter filament was counted as the branch formation efficiency (<italic>f</italic><sub>B</sub>) with or without diVCA, respectively. The number of binding and release events in each category (Arp2/3 complex alone, coincident with diVCA, Arp2/3-diVCA co-released, and diVCA release before Arp2/3 complex) were corrected by the number of observations in each category on regions of the field of view that did not contain a filament, so as to correct for non-specific interactions with the microscope slide.</p><p>Finally, the rate of release of diVCA from the nascent branch was calculated as: <italic>k</italic><sub>V−</sub><sup>*</sup> = <italic>f</italic><sub>V−</sub>/τ<sub>V</sub><sup>*</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This relation results from the fact that the observed lifetime of the nascent branch intermediate is limited by the combination of the dissociation of diVCA from the filament-bound Arp2/3 complex (proceeds with rate <italic>k</italic><sub>V−</sub><sup>*</sup>) and the dissociation of diVCA-Arp2/3 complex from the filament (proceeds with rate <italic>k</italic><sub>A−</sub>), such that τ<sub>V</sub><sup>*</sup> = 1/(<italic>k</italic><sub>A−</sub> + <italic>k</italic><sub>V−</sub><sup>*</sup>). The lifetimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) are very similar for all diVCA constructs because the dissociation of diVCA-Arp2/3 complexes from filament sides is dominant (<italic>k</italic><sub>A−</sub> &gt;&gt; <italic>k</italic><sub>V−</sub><sup>*</sup>) and <italic>k</italic><sub>A−</sub> is not significantly affected by VCA mutations. Note that the proposed mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) predicts that the nominal lifetime of nascent branches is the same whether we select all nascent branches or only those that terminate in diVCA release and subsequently form branches. The fraction of nascent branches that release diVCA is determined by kinetic competition between the two pathways of nascent branch disassembly: diVCA release leaving an Arp2/3-filament complex (with rate <italic>k</italic><sub>V−</sub><sup>*</sup>; labeled green arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and filament release leaving a diVCA-Arp2/3 complex (with rate <italic>k</italic><sub>A−</sub>; thick red arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This yields <italic>f</italic><sub>V−</sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub>V−</sub><sup>*</sup>/(<italic>k</italic><sub>A−</sub> + <italic>k</italic><sub>V−</sub><sup>*</sup>), and thus we obtain <italic>k</italic><sub>V−</sub><sup>*</sup> = <italic>f</italic><sub>V−</sub>/τ<sub>V</sub><sup>*</sup>.</p><p>We compared the diVCA release rate to the second order rate of overall branch formation calculated from the single molecule data as: <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub>A+</sub>[<italic>f</italic><sub>AV</sub> <italic>f</italic><sub>B</sub>(<italic>+diVCA</italic>) + (1 − <italic>f</italic><sub>AV</sub>) <italic>f</italic><sub>B</sub>(<italic>−diVCA</italic>)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

In each sample, activity and release rate values for the four diVCA constructs were randomly permuted, and the correlation coefficient was calculated. The probability p was then calculated as the definite integral of the normalized distribution of the sample correlation coefficients from the correlation coefficient of the experimental data to one. To the extent that replicate measurements may have correlated sources of error, we may overestimate the magnitude of the errors and therefore underestimate p.</p><p>Standard errors on parameters determined from fits to distributions of binding times or lifetimes were calculated by bootstrapping.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Wesley Sundquist, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and one of whom, Thomas Pollard, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors address how WASP/NPF family members (as represented by the minimal dimerized VCA activation region) act to stimulate actin branching through the Arp2/3 complex. They conclude that: 1) diVCA stimulates initial assembly of the nascent branch by associating with Arp2/3 complex and actin and promoting association of this “nascent branch complex” to the side of the actin filament, and 2) diVCA (but not Arp2/3 complex) then dissociates to create a complex that is elongated into a branch. The latter point is the major new contribution of the manuscript.</p><p>In support of the idea that dissociation of the diVCA component triggers branch formation, the authors use three-color fluorescence experiments to demonstrate that: 1) Arp2/3 complex and diVCA (and presumably also actin monomers) bind filaments simultaneously. These nascent branch complexes usually associate non-productively and the complex typically dissociates as a unit. In a small subset of the cases, however, the diVCA component alone dissociates, and this almost invariably leads to branch formation. Furthermore, diVCA release and initiation of branch elongation occur at exactly the same time (within experimental error). The data in Figure 1 appear to be of high quality, and imply that release of diVCA is likely an obligatory step in the commitment to branch formation. 2) diVCA does not bind Arp2/3 complexes once branches have formed (Figure 2), again consistent with the idea that the presence of diVCA is incompatible with branch formation, and that diVCA departure induces a conformational change(s) that destroy the diVCA binding site and stimulates branch formation. 3) Mutations that alter the half life of diVCA within the nascent branch complexes also alter the rate of branching stimulation, and there is a strong positive correlation between the diVCA dissociation rate constant and the rate constant for branch formation (Figures 3 and 4). These observations support a model that explains how membrane-associated WASP complexes can stimulate actin branching, but then dissociate to create space for subsequent actin polymerization (Figure 5).</p><p>This work is interesting and important, being the first to document at the single molecule level the timing of the interactions of Arp2/3 complex with the partners required to make an actin filament branch – the nucleation promoting factor VCA, actin filaments and actin monomers. The data are generally of high quality, and enhance our understanding of the mechanism of Arp2/3 complex activation by revealing NPF release as a key step in the activation process. Moreover, the study is a nice example of the application of single-molecule imaging to address an important yet incompletely defined biochemical pathway. The manuscript should therefore be acceptable for publication once the following three important issues have been addressed: Additional points noted below are also important, and should be considered carefully and a response provided.</p><p>1) Figure 1: We would urge the authors to provide a more explanatory diagram at the beginning of the paper to draw in the outsider and help explain the points being made in the Introduction, and the key question that is being tested. Figure 1A does this to some extent, but it's small and could be much more explanatory. Figure 1E is very busy and it is difficult to distinguish data points for diVCA wild type from diVCA mutants. The data might be more clearly illustrated in four separate graphs without taking up too much more space. Also, there appear to be outliers for which diVCA release occurs after daughter nucleation. These are not mentioned explicitly in the text, and it is unclear whether these outliers are the ones that fall within “experimental uncertainty”. Moreover, it is unclear what the error bars in this figure represent (and, more generally, the authors need to be careful to describe what error bars represent in all of the different graphs in the figures).</p><p>2) Although the data with diVCA wild type is pretty clear, the data with the diVCA mutants is sometimes a bit confusing. For example, the data in Figure 3C suggests that diVCA-C* dissociates more rapidly from Arp2/3 complex than diVCA-wt. However, the data in Figure 4E suggest that the release rate constant is similar for diVCA-C* and diVCA-wt. Might this is due to the difference between free versus filament-bound Arp2/3 complex? Also, the error bars for some of these panels are fairly large, and it isn't clear whether the observed parameters are statistically significantly different. The authors should therefore carry out statistical tests to determine whether there are significant differences in the measured parameters for wild type and mutant diVCA in Figure 4 (and elsewhere). Without that, it is hard to say whether the trend with the mutants fully supports the main conclusions.</p><p>3) Please also: A) reorganize the figures, and B) reframe the presentation of the central question under study to reflect previous literature precedents more accurately.</p><p>Below, we have raised a series of specific issues for your consideration. We acknowledge that authors have the right to write their own paper, but believe you will agree that the manuscript will be improved once these different issues are addressed, particularly those involving accurate literature citations.</p><p>Additional important points to consider:</p><p><italic>1) Figure organization</italic></p><p>The figures are currently organized based on the methodology rather than on logical flow. The panels in Figure 2 about mutant VCA's beg for the information in Figure 3. We therefore suggest that you either: A) Switch the figure order so that you present the nature of these mutations and fully explore the binding of VCA wild type and mutants before presenting what happens when a mother filament binds these mutant VCA's. Having Figure 2 after Figure 3 will also provide a better opportunity to integrate the two (currently neglected) panels in Figure 2 on mutant VCA's into the presentation of branching by mutant VCA's in Figure 4. B) Alternatively, consider merging Figure 2A,B (diVCAwt) with Figure 1 and merging the remaining panels in Figure 2B (diVCAmutants) with Figure 3.</p><p><italic>2) Presentation</italic></p><p><italic>Introduction</italic></p><p>A fundamental issue is that the study is presented as resolving the literature “paradox” that having WASP tethered to the plasma membrane by its activators (Rho-family GTPases, polyphosphoinositides and SH3 domain proteins) restricts filament growth. In fact, the present work confirms the existing hypothesis about the order of events. That is super, but it's not resolving a “paradox” or “conundrum”.</p><p>This concern is best illustrated by a review of the background leading up to this study. In 1999 Egile et al. and Higgs et al. found that the V motif binds the barbed end of actin, so the V-actin complex does not bind the pointed end of actin filaments and inhibits elongation at that end. Egile et al. imagined that VCA was a “motor of insertional polymerization” that would bind actin monomers and deliver them to the end of the filament and then dissociate rapidly. The current work disproves this hypothesis. On the other hand, Higgs concluded: “Since WA (VCA) only slightly inhibits barbed end elongation at the concentrations we tested, it must rapidly dissociate from the filament barbed end upon addition of WA-bound monomer. Profilin has a similar effect on polymerization; it inhibits nucleation and pointed end elongation but not barbed end elongation.” Thus the concept that rapid V dissociation is required for barbed end elongation is 14 years old.</p><p>Next, Marchand et al. (2001) showed directly that VCA regions of WASP family proteins bind to and dissociate from actin and Arp2/3 complex rapidly. They measured koff from actin monomers to be 3/s and from Arp2/3 complex to be 0.2/s.</p><p>Dayel (2001) discovered that hydrolysis of ATP bound to Arps promotes dissociation of VCA from Arp2/3 complex during branch formation. They concluded “binding N-WASP brings the actin monomer attached to the WH2 domain of N-WASP in contact with the Arp2/3 complex and this stimulates ATP hydrolysis. Step 2: Hydrolyzing ATP to ADP-Pi causes a conformational change on the complex, forming a stable nucleus among Arp3, Arp2, and the conventional actin monomer. Step 3: A new actin filament polymerizes from this nucleus. Step 4: Phosphate release from Arp2/3 complex decreases the affinity for N-WASP and allows the Arp2/3 complex to release its membrane-associated activator.” Dayel (2004) looked at the timing more carefully and concluded “it is very likely that ATP hydrolysis on Arp2, like actin, provides a timing signal to the system. ATP hydrolysis on Arp2/3 would promote release of VCA from the complex and allow a new actin branch to move away from the site of its creation (Dayel et al. 2001).” The enclosed drawing from Dayel (2004) summarizes their understanding of the process. This drawing is very similar to Figure 5 in the current paper. Neither Dayel paper is cited, and this seems inappropriate. [See attached PDF version for image of Figure 5B from Dayel (2004).]</p><p>A new paper from the Nolen lab (Hetrick et al, Chem Bio, 2013) has an updated version of the Dayel diagram in their Figure 6. Of course the present authors would not have known about this new paper, but it illustrates that the basic idea is central to the thinking in the field.</p><p>Although it is less well established that the C motif binds the barbed end of Arp3 and possibly Arp2, previous workers postulated that C might inhibit binding of the first two subunits of the daughter filament. Therefore, several investigators emphasized that early in the nucleation process VCA must inevitably dissociate from Arp2/3 complex and the rates of dissociation measured previously mean that the delay would be on the order seconds. A recent paper from the current authors (Smith et al.) reported the important insight that most interactions of Arp2/3 complex with the side of an actin filament are transient, explaining why Arp2/3 complexes associate stably with actin filaments so slowly (Beltzer; Ti).</p><p>An account of the background with these points would be an appropriate place to begin this paper. Rather than investigating a paradox, this work tests the main hypothesis in the field, which has been put forward by multiple labs.</p><p>Other aspects of the Introduction are a nice account of branching by Arp2/3 complex but several of the citations are misplaced. See the attached pdf with notes.</p><p><italic>Results</italic></p><p>It might be noted that the observation that most Arp2/3 complexes binding to filaments are associated with di-VCA is exactly what is expected, given the thermodynamic argument in Ti et al. (2011), namely that bound VCA increases the affinity of Arp2/3 complex for actin filaments about 30 fold.</p><p>The conclusion “daughter nucleation is essentially always accompanied by Arp2/3 complex retention and diVCA release” is exactly what is expected from previous work, although it is certainly valuable to confirm this order of events by these lovely single molecule observations. Congratulations on the lovely experiments.</p><p>“Thus, diVCA release may serve as the trigger for daughter nucleation.” The wording of this conclusion reinvents the concept of the actin nucleus, which according to historical precedent is the smallest actin oligomer that elongates like a filament. Classic simulations of the time course of spontaneous actin polymerization (labs of Frieden, Pollard and Korn) showed that the nucleus is a trimer. Sept confirmed this interpretation with Brownian dynamics simulations. Even though the trimer is unstable, it adds subunits like any longer filament. The nucleus in the case of Arp2/3 complex is therefore likely consists of the two Arps and one or two actin subunits. Therefore, the nucleus is formed when the first and second actin subunits bind Arp2/3 complex, which can surely happen prior to dissociation of V from the two actins. Thus what is observed in this experiment is not nucleation, but the beginning of elongation, which appears to be limited by dissociation of the diVCA as suggested by others. Therefore throughout the paper “nucleation” should be replaced with “elongation” of the daughter filament (which is what is observed).</p><p>“Most of the tethered Arp2/3 complexes (&gt;80 %) were observed to bind diVCA.” Please explain. Does this mean that 20% never bound di-VCA? Were they dead?</p><p>Machesky et al. (PNAS, 1999) (not cited) showed that mother filaments are required for nucleation, not Mullins et al. (1998).</p><p>The authors should check carefully whether or not there is a precedent for their finding that “the affinity of diVCA for isolated Arp2/3 complex is high, whereas the diVCA affinity for Arp2/3 complex in the branch junction is comparatively low.” Regardless, that observation makes sense given that both the C and V binding sites are likely to be occluded in the branch junction, and since the A motif binds weakly to Arp2/3 complex (Kd ∼ 9 µM, Marchand, 2001).</p><p>The text states “The goal was to modestly perturb VCA interactions with Arp2/3 complex or actin without altering the mechanism by which diVCA stimulates branch formation.” This statement reveals a misunderstanding about the thermodynamics and should be rephrased. It is highly unlikely that one could change the affinity of VCA for its receptors without altering the activation process. The reason is that activation depends on the free energy from Arp2/3 complex binding its three ligands (VCA, actin monomers and actin filament), so if one perturbs any of these free energy changes, one inevitably perturbs activation.</p><p>“With the A* mutant dissociating from Arp2/3 complex more slowly than wild type.” Were you surprised? Why should this be true?</p><p>“Both wild type and mutant complexes displayed lifetime distributions that were fit well with two exponential components (Figure 3D, Figure 3–figure supplement 2D, Table 1), indicating that at least two distinct diVCA-Arp2/3 complex assemblies could form.” The semi-log plot makes it difficult to see the fast component in some of these plots. What is the behavior of each individual Arp2/3 complex? Were they consistently in one of these states or did one Arp2/3 complex behave differently over time? This behavior deserves a more detailed analysis and presentation.</p><p>The presence of multiple complexes is expected – really? Alternatively, given the bivalent nature of the ligand and the receptor, loss of function of one site on a subset of ligands or receptors could result in the observed two lifetimes. Can you rule out this explanation?</p><p>Figure 4A (and the associated supplemental figure) show that wild type diVCA boosted Arp2/3 complex-dependent polymerization only 1.5 fold (microscopy) to 2.0 fold (bulk biochemistry). This result agrees with previous work from the Rubenstein lab on bulk samples (not cited), but it deserves some comment. Describe what was observed by microscopy about branches formed by Arp2/3 complex in the absence of VCA, since this unusual feature of budding yeast Arp2/3 complex is poorly understood. The experiments in the magenta and green boxes in Figure 2 also need more detailed explanations.</p><p><italic>Discussion</italic></p><p>Arasada (2011) has another estimate of NPF density that is more relevant this work on budding yeast Arp2/3 complex than the other examples, namely between 16,000 and 45,000 NPF's per µm2 at sites of endocytosis where actin polymerization depends on Arp2/3 complex.</p><p>Only Ti et al. (2011) presented a molecular structure of Arp2/3 complex showing how the C-region of VCA may occupy a similar location on Arp3 that the V-region occupies on actin. The other cited work infers the location of the C binding sites from indirect data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01008.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1)</italic> <italic>Figure 1</italic><italic>: We would urge the authors to provide a more explanatory diagram at the beginning of the paper to draw in the outsider and help explain the points being made in the Introduction, and the key question that is being tested.</italic> <italic>Figure 1A</italic> <italic>does this to some extent, but it's small and could be much more explanatory</italic>.</p><p>We have added a new figure, which we cite in the Introduction.

Presentation of the mutant data is deferred until later in the paper. We think it important to show all mutant and wild type data superimposed (so that readers can see that the distribution of points is similar in all four cases), but we agree with the reviewers that such a presentation makes it difficult to evaluate which points are significant outliers. We therefore compromised by presenting both the original panel (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and new panels that present the data for the four constructs individually (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>Also, there appear to be outliers for which diVCA release occurs after daughter nucleation.

In the mutant data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) there is one point for V*, zero for C*, and one for A* that could be significant outliers, out of 41, 49, and 27 observations, respectively.

Might this is due to the difference between free versus filament-bound Arp2/3 complex</italic>?</p><p>Yes, that is the likely explanation. Indeed, the reason for the measurements in Figure 4E (it is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) is to characterize the dissociation kinetics of VCA from filament–bound Arp2/3 complex. They do in fact turn out to be different from those with off-filament Arp2/3 complex. The text now states this clearly.</p><p><italic>Also, the error bars for some of these panels are fairly large, and it isn't clear whether the observed parameters are statistically significantly different.

The first are pairwise comparisons (e.g., statements that a particular mutant is different than wild type with respect to a particular measurement). For each of the pairwise comparisons that we utilize, we have now performed a significance test and p values are given in the text or figure captions. The second type of conclusion is the apparent correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). For each of these we now report the correlation coefficients and further report a bootstrap calculation, which shows that it is unlikely (p = ∼0.005 and ∼0.03, respectively) that the high measured correlation coefficient was obtained by chance from two quantities that are in truth uncorrelated. This analysis is described in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) Please also: A) reorganize the figures, and B) reframe the presentation of the central question under study to reflect previous literature precedents more accurately.

That is super, but it's not resolving a “paradox” or “conundrum”</italic>.</p><p>We did not intend to present our work as resolving a “literature paradox”. Rather, we are addressing the inherent conflict between the need for Arp2/3 complex to associate with membrane bound activators at one stage of the daughter filament formation process and to be distant from those activators at a subsequent stage. By directly observing the order of events by which the complex moves from one stage to the next, our study defines the mechanism by which this conflict is resolved.</p><p>In order to more clearly define the problem that is resolved by our study, and to more fully place the work in the context of the existing literature, we have slightly rephrased the Abstract and made substantial changes to the Introduction. The changes to the Introduction include:</p><p>• We added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and accompanying text in the Introduction. We feel that these work together to more clearly define the most important problem that is addressed by our study.</p><p>• We have expanded and reorganized the beginning of the Introduction to include additional literature citations (mostly ones suggested below by the reviewers) to more thoroughly place the work in the context of existing knowledge about how VCA proteins function to stimulate daughter filament initiation.</p><p>• We added a new paragraph that emphasizes (with numerous literature citations) that separation of the new branch junction from the membrane- or surface-bound activator is already well established in a variety of biological contexts and in vitro.</p><p>• We added a new penultimate paragraph to the Introduction that explicitly states (with citations) that VCA departure prior to initiation of daughter filament growth was previously hypothesized.</p><p>• We removed the words “paradox” and “conundrum” in an effort to avoid any implication that there are inconsistencies between different results in the existing literature, an implication that we did not intend.</p><p>We believe that these changes will largely address the concerns of the referees about the original introduction. We anticipate that they will also make the context of the work clearer to readers, particularly those who may be less familiar with prior work in the field.</p><p><italic>This concern is best illustrated by a review of the background leading up to this study…</italic>.</p><p>Although we concur with most of what is said below, there are a few stated conclusions and implications that we do not think are well supported by the literature or that are contradicted by it. However, since it is explicit that some of what follows is intended to be illustrative, we have responded only to parts that explicitly recommend changes to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>…In 1999 Egile et al. and Higgs et al. found that the V motif binds the barbed end of actin, so the V-actin complex does not bind the pointed end of actin filaments and inhibits elongation at that end. Egile et al. imagined that VCA was a “motor of insertional polymerization” that would bind actin monomers and deliver them to the end of the filament and then dissociate rapidly. The current work disproves this hypothesis. On the other hand, Higgs concluded: “Since WA (VCA) only slightly inhibits barbed end elongation at the concentrations we tested, it must rapidly dissociate from the filament barbed end upon addition of WA-bound monomer. Profilin has a similar effect on polymerization; it inhibits nucleation and pointed end elongation but not barbed end elongation.” Thus the concept that rapid V dissociation is required for barbed end elongation is 14 years old</italic>.</p><p><italic>Next, Marchand et al. (2001) showed directly that VCA regions of WASP family proteins bind to and dissociate from actin and Arp2/3 complex rapidly. They measured koff from actin monomers to be 3/s and from Arp2/3 complex to be 0.2/s</italic>.</p><p><italic>Dayel (2001) discovered that hydrolysis of ATP bound to Arps promotes dissociation of VCA from Arp2/3 complex during branch formation. They concluded “binding N-WASP brings the actin monomer attached to the WH2 domain of N-WASP in contact with the Arp2/3 complex and this stimulates ATP hydrolysis. Step 2: Hydrolyzing ATP to ADP-Pi causes a conformational change on the complex, forming a stable nucleus among Arp3, Arp2, and the conventional actin monomer. Step 3: A new actin filament polymerizes from this nucleus. Step 4: Phosphate release from Arp2/3 complex decreases the affinity for N-WASP and allows the Arp2/3 complex to release its membrane-associated activator.” Dayel (2004) looked at the timing more carefully and concluded “it is very likely that ATP hydrolysis on Arp2, like actin, provides a timing signal to the system. ATP hydrolysis on Arp2/3 would promote release of VCA from the complex and allow a new actin branch to move away from the site of its creation (Dayel et al. 2001).” The enclosed drawing from Dayel (2004) summarizes their understanding of the process. This drawing is very similar to Figure 5 in the current paper. Neither Dayel paper is cited, and this seems inappropriate. [See attached PDF version for image of Figure 5B from Dayel (2004).</italic>]</p><p>We have added a citation to both Dayel papers in the new section in the final paragraph of the Introduction. As an aside, we note here that the image provided by the referees shows a hypothesis that is not identical to our conclusions. First, it posits a key role for ATP hydrolysis by Arp2/3 complex, a question about which our work is silent but which is addressed in subsequent studies (Martin, 2006; Ingerman, 2013). (These subsequent studies suggest that hydrolysis does not, in fact, accompany initiation of the daughter filament, as suggested in Dayel (2004), but rather is related to debranching.) Second, it does not address the central concern of our paper, which is the order of VCA release and initiation of daughter filament polymerization. It shows the two lumped into a single, final step so that their order is not specified. In this respect the figure is more akin to our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (which illustrates the key question we are asking in our study) than it is to our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (which illustrates the answer).</p><p><italic>A new paper from the Nolen lab (Hetrick et al, Chem Bio, 2013) has an updated version of the Dayel diagram in their Figure 6. Of course the present authors would not have known about this new paper, but it illustrates that the basic idea is central to the thinking in the field</italic>.</p><p>We have added citations to the Hetrick paper at the relevant locations in the Introduction. We would respectfully disagree with the reviewers’ implication that the inclusion of this model in a single paper published a few months ago establishes that the idea is central to the thinking in the field. In our estimation, a more reasonable conclusion is that some features in the model published by Hetrick et al. were influenced by the as-yet unpublished work from the Nolen lab (we cite their submitted publication) and perhaps also by reports of our work reported in this paper, which has been presented at conferences.</p><p><italic>Although it is less well established that the C motif binds the barbed end of Arp3 and possibly Arp2, previous workers postulated that C might inhibit binding of the first two subunits of the daughter filament. Therefore, several investigators emphasized that early in the nucleation process VCA must inevitably dissociate from Arp2/3 complex and the rates of dissociation measured previously mean that the delay would be on the order seconds</italic>.</p><p>While there is a great deal of literature that touches on related points, we were unable to find any published studies that explicitly “postulated that C might inhibit binding of the first two subunits of the daughter filament”.</p><p><italic>A recent paper from the current authors (Smith et al.) reported the important insight that most interactions of Arp2/3 complex with the side of an actin filament are transient, explaining why Arp2/3 complexes associate stably with actin filaments so slowly (Beltzer; Ti)</italic>.</p><p><italic>An account of the background with these points would be an appropriate place to begin this paper. Rather than investigating a paradox, this work tests the main hypothesis in the field, which has been put forward by multiple labs</italic>.</p><p>As noted earlier, we have expanded the Introduction to incorporate additional background, including many of the references cited by the referees that we did not already include. We did not include all such material because we regard some of it as related but not essential, and we think that too much additional length in the Introduction would weaken the presentation. Also noted earlier is that we have added a section explaining that it is well established that VCA must depart before the daughter filament elongates too far. We do not agree (for reasons that are in part explained above) that the field has coalesced on a single hypothesized mechanism to explain this. For this reason, we did not (as the reviewers seem to be suggesting) adopt this hypothesis as a rhetorical device to introduce the question being asked in the paper. Instead, we used the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and related discussion. We think this is a more effective presentation and will also make the paper more accessible to readers outside of the field. We realize that the reviewers may not agree with this decision, but we ask that some deference be given to authors’ choices on how they introduce their work.</p><p><italic>Other aspects of the introduction are a nice account of branching by Arp2/3 complex but several of the citations are misplaced. See the attached pdf with notes</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for the notes on the pdf. These suggestions have been incorporated by changing the references and/or citing text.</p><p><italic>Results</italic></p><p><italic>It might be noted that the observation that most Arp2/3 complexes binding to filaments are associated with di-VCA is exactly what is expected, given the thermodynamic argument in Ti et al. (2011), namely that bound VCA increases the affinity of Arp2/3 complex for actin filaments about 30 fold</italic>.</p><p>The observation that nearly all Arp2/3 complexes binding to filaments are accompanied by diVCA is not a reflection of the stability of the ternary complex. Rather, it is mainly a consequence of the fact that Arp2/3 complexes free in solution (i.e., not attached to a filament) are nearly saturated with diVCA under the conditions of the experiments.</p><p><italic>The conclusion “daughter nucleation is essentially always accompanied by Arp2/3 complex retention and diVCA release” is exactly what is expected from previous work, although it is certainly valuable to confirm this order of events by these lovely single molecule observations. Congratulations on the lovely experiments</italic>.</p><p>This comment seems to imply that expectations and hypotheses do not satisfy the need for direct experimental data. We agree.</p><p><italic>“Thus, diVCA release may serve as the trigger for daughter nucleation.” The wording of this conclusion reinvents the concept of the actin nucleus, which according to historical precedent is the smallest actin oligomer that elongates like a filament. Classic simulations of the time course of spontaneous actin polymerization (labs of Frieden, Pollard and Korn) showed that the nucleus is a trimer. Sept confirmed this interpretation with Brownian dynamics simulations. Even though the trimer is unstable, it adds subunits like any longer filament. The nucleus in the case Arp2/3 complex is therefore likely consists of the two Arps and one or two actin subunits. Therefore, the nucleus is formed when the first and second actin subunits bind Arp2/3 complex, which can surely happen prior to dissociation of V from the two actins. Thus what is observed in this experiment is not nucleation, but the beginning of elongation, which appears to be limited by dissociation of the diVCA as suggested by others. Therefore throughout the paper “nucleation” should be replaced with “elongation” of the daughter filament (which is what is observed)</italic>.</p><p>In the original manuscript, we used the term “nucleation” to refer both to the overall process shown in the final figure and to the specific step in which the daughter filament begins to grow. To minimize any possible confusion, we now refer to the latter as “initiation of daughter filament growth”. We think this terminology is consistent with the point made by the reviewers but is more apt than “elongation”.</p><p><italic>“Most of the tethered Arp2/3 complexes (&gt;80 %) were observed to bind diVCA.” Please explain. Does this mean that 20% never bound di-VCA? Were they dead</italic>?</p><p>Yes, &lt;20% never bound di-VCA. There are multiple possible explanations for the apparently inactive fraction, including 1) incompletely assembled “dead” Arp2/3 complexes, 2) fully assembled and active complexes bound to the surface in an orientation or local environment that precludes VCA binding, and 3) presence of a small number of the dye-biotin adducts used to label the Arp2/3 complex that never were or are no longer attached to protein.</p><p><italic>Machesky et al. (PNAS, 1999) (not cited) showed that mother filaments are required for nucleation, not Mullins et al. (1998)</italic>.</p><p>Thanks; we now cite the correct reference.</p><p><italic>The authors should check carefully whether or not there is a precedent for their finding that “the affinity of diVCA for isolated Arp2/3 complex is high, whereas the diVCA affinity for Arp2/3 complex in the branch junction is comparatively low.” Regardless, that observation makes sense given that both the C and V binding sites are likely to be occluded in the branch junction, and since the A motif binds weakly to Arp2/3 complex (Kd ∼ 9 µM, Marchand, 2001)</italic>.</p><p>We now say that the results are consistent with data from previous studies and cite two. We agree that the result makes sense given the Marchand result and we now point this out in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>The text states “The goal was to modestly perturb VCA interactions with Arp2/3 complex or actin without altering the mechanism by which diVCA stimulates branch formation.” This statement reveals a misunderstanding about the thermodynamics and should be rephrased. It is highly unlikely that one could change the affinity of VCA for its receptors without altering the activation process. The reason is that activation depends on the free energy from Arp2/3 complex binding its three ligands (VCA, actin monomers and actin filament), so if one perturbs any of these free energy changes, one inevitably perturbs activation</italic>.</p><p>We disagree that the statement reveals a misunderstanding about the thermodynamics. Rather, it arises from different meanings attached to the term “mechanism” by the authors and the reviewers. To lessen the possibility of being misunderstood, we have substituted the term “reaction pathway” for “mechanism” to clarify that we are making a statement about the sequence of chemical species in the reaction rather than about free energy changes or rate constants of the reaction steps.</p><p><italic>“With the A* mutant dissociating from Arp2/3 complex more slowly than wild type.” Were you surprised? Why should this be true</italic>?</p><p>The A* mutation was indeed designed with this goal in mind. In 2001, Zalevsky et al. reported that VCA peptides have an activation step following assembly of VCA, actin and Arp2/3 complex onto the mother filament. The apparent activation rate constant for this step differed between N-WASP, WASP and WAVE1. The origin of this difference was concluded to be in the length of the acidic region, with a longer acidic region (e.g. in N-WASP) giving faster rate and a shorter region (e.g. in WAVE1) giving slower rate. We wondered if the ‘activation step’ might be departure of VCA. If so, shortening the N-WASP acidic region might make it more WAVE1-like, slowing dissociation. We proceeded to essentially reverse the series of experiments used by Zalevsky et al. by deleting several acidic residues from the N-WASP acidic region. Multiple VCA modifications along these lines generated VCA dimers with lower activity in pyrene actin assays than our wild type diVCA. The “A*” mutant had the smallest perturbation (in terms of amino acid changes) and was therefore chosen for further analysis in the single molecule measurements. In the interest of keeping the manuscript focused, we have not included a description of the reasoning involved in this aspect of the experimental design.</p><p><italic>“Both wild type and mutant complexes displayed lifetime distributions that were fit well with two exponential components (Figure 3D, Figure 3–figure supplement 2D, Table 1), indicating that at least two distinct diVCA-Arp2/3 complex assemblies could form.” The semi-log plot makes it difficult to see the fast component in some of these plots. What is the behavior of each individual Arp2/3 complex? Were they consistently in one of these states or did one Arp2/3 complex behave differently over time? This behavior deserves a more detailed analysis and presentation</italic>.</p><p>We added a magnified inset so that the fast component of the distributions in Figure 3D (now 4D) is more visible. Individual Arp2/3 complexes show both short and long events. In a more detailed analysis with the V* mutant, which is the one for which the short and long components are most clearly resolved, we saw no evidence that the short and long lifetime components segregated into different subpopulations of individual Arp2/3 complexes. Both results are now stated in the Results section and further details are given in Methods. We agree with the reviewer that the multicomponent lifetime distributions are intriguing: they could potentially shed light on the different modes of interaction between VCA dimers and Arp2/3. However, such an investigation would likely require analysis of Arp2/3 complex mutations and of a more extensive panel of VCA mutations. Such work is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p><italic>The presence of multiple complexes is expected - really? Alternatively, given the bivalent nature of the ligand and the receptor, loss of function of one site on a subset of ligands or receptors could result in the observed two lifetimes. Can you rule out this explanation</italic>?</p><p>We changed this passage to say that the result is “consistent” with the results of the previous studies cited, not “expected” from them. We cannot rule out the alternative explanation raised by the reviewers, but we see no reason to explicitly discuss it in the manuscript since we already give multiple examples of other possible explanations for the observed behavior and there is currently no basis to choose between them. Distinguishing between these alternatives is not essential to the conclusions of our paper.</p><p><italic>Figure 4A (and the associated supplemental figure) show that wild type diVCA boosted Arp2/3 complex-dependent polymerization only 1.5 fold (microscopy) to 2.0 fold (bulk biochemistry). This result agrees with previous work from the Rubenstein lab on bulk samples (not cited), but it deserves some comment</italic>.</p><p>We surmise that the reviewers feel that 1.5–2.0 fold activation is somehow anomalously low and, further, that this value is explained by the significant activity of budding yeast Arp2/3 complex in the absence of VCA. However, another factor is that the N-WASP diVCA construct we use was deliberately chosen because it is only a weak activator (this helped us to engineer mutants that increased activation). This is illustrated by data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2C,D</xref> which show for example, that N-WASP VVCA dimers are much better activators than N-WASP VCA dimers like the one we used as our wild type construct. We now mention both factors in the caption to that figure and we cite Wen &amp; Rubenstein (2005) (although they observed high basal activity only with yeast actin and did not see it with rabbit muscle actin).</p><p><italic>Describe what was observed by microscopy about branches formed by Arp2/3 complex in the absence of VCA, since this unusual feature of budding yeast Arp2/3 complex is poorly understood. The experiments in the magenta and green boxes in Figure 2 also need more detailed explanations</italic>.</p><p>A thorough presentation of the microscopy observations without VCA was included in our previous publication (Smith et al., PNAS 2013), which we cite. We see no reason to recapitulate that in the present paper, particularly since the small subpopulation of Arp2/3 complexes that bind to filament unaccompanied by detectable di-VCA fluorescence are excluded from our analyses (e.g., in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). As described above, the data in the magenta and green boxes from Figure 2B have now been moved to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>; they are described in the caption.</p><p><italic>Discussion</italic></p><p><italic>Arasada (2011) has another estimate of NPF density that is more relevant this work on budding yeast Arp2/3 complex than the other examples, namely between 16,000 and 45,000 NPF's per µm2 at sites of endocytosis where actin polymerization depends on Arp2/3 complex</italic>.</p><p>The densities mentioned in Arasada (2011) appear to be densities of SH3 domains of F-BAR proteins, inferred from the electron microscopy work of Frost et al.
