The fundamental building block of chromatin is the nucleosome, a complex of ~146 base pairs (bp) of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins. The degree of chromatin compaction influences DNA replication, transcription, and repair. Maintenance of the appropriate chromatin state requires ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes. These ‘chromatin remodelers’ are divided into four families called CHD, SWI/SNF, ISWI, and INO80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clapier et al., 2017</xref>). All chromatin remodelers contain a conserved ATPase core that hydrolyses ATP to alter contacts between nucleosomal DNA and the histone octamer and to facilitate nucleosome assembly, sliding, ejection, or histone exchange.</p><p>Members of the CHD (‘chromodomain helicase DNA-binding’) family of chromatin remodelers all contain a central SNF2-like ATPase motor domain and a double chromodomain in their N-terminal region. The double chromodomain binds modified histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sims et al., 2005</xref>) and interacts with nucleosomal DNA to regulate ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nodelman et al., 2017</xref>). Recent structures of the yeast remodeler Chd1 in complex with a nucleosome uncovered the architecture of one subfamily of CHD remodelers (subfamily I) and its interactions with the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farnung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018</xref>). A unique feature of these structures is that Chd1 binding induces unwrapping of terminal DNA from the histone octamer surface at superhelical location (SHL) −6 and −7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farnung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018</xref>). However, the resolution of these studies was limited, such that atomic details were not resolved.</p><p>The human CHD family member CHD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Woodage et al., 1997</xref>) shows nucleosome spacing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Silva et al., 2016</xref>). CHD4 is also known as Mi-2 in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kehle et al., 1998</xref>). CHD4, CHD3, and CHD5 form CHD subfamily II, which differs in domain architecture from subfamily I. CHD3, CHD4, and CHD5 contain two N-terminal plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc finger domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schindler et al., 1993</xref>), a DNA-interacting double chromodomain, and the ATPase motor. CHD4 contains an additional high mobility group (HMG) box-like domain in its N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Silva et al., 2016</xref>) and two additional domains of unknown function that are located in the C-terminal region.</p><p>CHD4 is implicated in the repression of lineage-specific genes during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liang et al., 2017</xref>) and is required for the establishment and maintenance of more compacted chromatin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bornelöv et al., 2018</xref>). CHD4 mutations have a high incidence in some carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kandoth et al., 2013</xref>) and in thyroid and ovarian cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Längst and Manelyte, 2015</xref>). Mutations in CHD4 have also been implicated in intellectual disability syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sifrim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weiss et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>CHD4 is a subunit of the multi-subunit Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase (NuRD) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tong et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xue et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>). NuRD also contains the deacetylase HDAC1/2 and accessory subunits that serve regulatory and scaffolding roles. NuRD is implicated in gene silencing, but also gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gnanapragasam et al., 2011</xref>). It is essential for cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Polo et al., 2010</xref>), DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smeenk et al., 2010</xref>), establishment of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sims and Wade, 2011</xref>), and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bornelöv et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgold et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, CHD4 is part of the heterotrimeric ChAHP complex that is also involved in gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ostapcuk et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Thus far, structural studies of CHD4 have been limited to individual domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kwan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mansfield et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human CHD4 bound to a nucleosome at an overall resolution of 3.1 Å. CHD4 engages the nucleosome at SHL +2 and induces a conformational change in DNA at this location in the presence of the ATP analogue adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). Structural comparisons show that CHD4, in contrast to Chd1, does not induce unwrapping of terminal DNA, and this is also observed in biochemical assays. Maintenance of the integrity of the nucleosome in the presence of CHD4 is consistent with the role of CHD4 in gene repression, and in heterochromatin formation and maintenance. Finally, the detailed nucleosome-CHD4 structure enables mapping of known human disease mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kovač et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sifrim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weiss et al., 2016</xref>) and indicates how these may perturb enzyme function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nucleosome-CHD4 complex structure</title><p>To investigate how the human chromatin remodeller CHD4 engages a nucleosome, we determined the structure of <italic>H. sapiens</italic> CHD4 bound to a <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> nucleosome core particle in the presence of the ATP analogue AMP-PNP. We recombinantly expressed and purified full-length CHD4 and reconstituted a complex of CHD4 with a pre-assembled nucleosome core particle. The nucleosome comprised 145 base pairs (bp) of DNA, corresponding to the Widom 601 sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lowary and Widom, 1998</xref>) with additional 4 and 30 bp of extranucleosomal DNA on the entry and exit side of the nucleosome, respectively. The nucleosome-CHD4 complex was purified by size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To determine the structure of the nucleosome-CHD4 complex, we collected single particle cryo-EM data on a Titan Krios (FEI) microscope equipped with a K2 direct electron detector (Gatan) (Materials and methods). We obtained a cryo-EM reconstruction of the nucleosome-CHD4 complex at an overall resolution of 3.1 Å (FSC 0.143 criterion) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The nucleosome was resolved at a resolution of 3.0–4.5 Å, whereas CHD4 was resolved at 3.1–5.0 Å, depending on the protein region. The register of the DNA was unambiguously determined based on distinct densities for purine and pyrimidine nucleotides around the dyad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3h</xref>). Well-defined density was also obtained for AMP-PNP and a coordinated magnesium ion in the CHD4 active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3i</xref>). The model was locally adjusted and real-space refined, leading to very good stereochemistry (Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM data collection, refinement and validation statistics.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Nucleosome-CHD4 complex <break/>(EMD-10058) <break/>(PDB 6RYR)</th><th colspan="2" valign="top">Nucleosome-CHD4<sub>2</sub> complex <break/>(EMDB-10059) <break/>(PDB 6RYU)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Data collection and processing</td><td valign="top"/><td colspan="2" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Magnification</td><td valign="top">130,000</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">130,000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Voltage (kV)</td><td valign="top">300</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">300</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Electron exposure (e–/Å<sup>2</sup>)</td><td valign="top">43–45</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">43–45</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Defocus range (μm)</td><td valign="top">0.25–4</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">0.25–4</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Pixel size (Å)</td><td valign="top">1.05</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">1.05</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Symmetry imposed</td><td valign="top">C1</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">C1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Initial particle images (no.)</td><td valign="top">650,599</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">650,599</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Final particle images (no.)</td><td valign="top">89,623</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">40,233</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Map resolution (Å) <break/>FSC threshold</td><td valign="top">3.1 <break/>0.143</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">4.0 <break/>0.143</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Map resolution range (Å)</td><td valign="top">3.0–5</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">3.7–8.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Refinement</td><td valign="top"/><td colspan="2" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Initial models used (PDB code)</td><td valign="top">3LZ0, 5O9G, 2L75, 4O9I, 6Q3M</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">3LZ0, 5O9G, 2L75, 4O9I, 6Q3M</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Map sharpening <italic>B</italic> factor (Å<sup>2</sup>)</td><td valign="top">−36</td><td valign="top">−86</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Model composition <break/>Non-hydrogen atoms <break/>Protein residues <break/>Nucleotides <break/>Ligands</td><td valign="top"><break/>17,834 <break/>1463 <break/>298 <break/>4</td><td colspan="2" valign="top"><break/>23,598 <break/>2180 <break/>298 <break/>8</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>B</italic> factors (Å<sup>2</sup>) <break/>Protein <break/>Nucleotide <break/>Ligand</td><td valign="top"><break/>45.28 <break/>71.82 <break/>60.10</td><td colspan="2" valign="top"><break/>95.29 <break/>112.27 <break/>125.7</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">R.m.s. deviations <break/>Bond lengths (Å) <break/>Bond angles (°)</td><td valign="top"><break/>0.003 <break/>0.638</td><td colspan="2" valign="top"><break/>0.005 <break/>1.028</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Validation <break/>MolProbity score <break/>Clashscore <break/>Poor rotamers (%)</td><td valign="top"><break/>1.54 <break/>5.69 <break/>0.08</td><td colspan="2" valign="top"><break/>1.92 <break/>6.52 <break/>1.64</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ramachandran plot <break/>Favored (%) <break/>Allowed (%) <break/>Disallowed (%)</td><td valign="top"><break/>96.50 <break/>3.50 <break/>0.0</td><td colspan="2" valign="top"><break/>94.16 <break/>5.84 <break/>0.0</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-56178-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM density and structure of the nucleosome-CHD4 complex.</title></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CHD4 architecture</title><p>The CHD4 ATPase motor binds the nucleosome at SHL +2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4f</xref>).

Similar observations were previously made for the Snf2 chromatin remodeler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) in its apo and ADP-bound states.</p><p>Our high-resolution structure fills a gap in our understanding of the mechanism of chromatin remodeling by capturing an additional enzymatic state. The DNA distortion at SHL +2 that we observed in the AMP-PNP bound state differs from distortions observed previously in the apo and ADP-bound state that involved a twist distortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Winger et al., 2018</xref>). This is consistent with a proposed ‘twist defect’ mechanism for chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sabantsev et al., 2019</xref>). In this model, binding of the ATPase motor at SHL ± 2 induces a twist defect in the DNA. Subsequent ATP binding, captured by AMP-PNP and ADP·BeF<sub>3</sub> structures, then leads to closing of the ATPase motor and to propagation of the twist defect toward the dyad. It is possible that previous nucleosome-Chd1 structures with ADP·BeF<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farnung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018</xref>) contained the same DNA distortion but that the lower resolution prevented its observation. Finally, ATP hydrolysis would reset the remodeller and the enzymatic cycle can resume at the next DNA position.</p><p>A major difference between the subfamily I remodeller Chd1 and the subfamily II remodeller CHD4 is that Chd1 induces unwrapping of the terminal nucleosomal DNA, whereas CHD4 does not change the DNA trajectory between SHL −7 and −5. DNA unwrapping is observed for Chd1 in structures and in solution and is independent of which ATP or transition state analogue is bound to the motor domain, indicating it is achieved with the use of binding energy only. Our observations are consistent with a single-molecule FRET study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhong et al., 2019</xref>). This major difference in Chd1 and CHD4 molecular function is likely related to a striking difference in cellular function. Whereas Chd1 functions in euchromatic regions of the genome during active transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Skene et al., 2014</xref>), CHD4 plays a central role in the establishment and maintenance of repressive genome regions. Consistent with these findings, DNA unwrapping should be prevented in stable heterochromatic regions. It is possible that these differences in functionality were achieved during evolution by the addition of distinct auxiliary domains in different CHD subfamilies.</p><p>Our structure also maps causative disease mutations and helps to investigate how these can impair CHD4 function. Our structure suggests that various mutations may disrupt DNA binding, impede ATP hydrolysis, or uncouple ATP hydrolysis and DNA translocation. The structure thus suggests the effects of CHD4 mutations in cancer and intellectual disability syndromes on chromatin remodeling. It also helps in understanding disease phenotypes of other chromatin remodelers such as the BAF complex that shows a related domain architecture for its ATPase motor. Due to its high resolution, the structure may also guide drug discovery using chromatin remodelers as targets in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of CHD4</title><p><italic>H. sapiens</italic> CHD4 (Uniprot Accession code Q14839-1) was amplified from human cDNA using the following ligation-independent cloning (LIC) compatible primer pair (Forward primer: 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TAC TTC CAA TCC AAT GCA ATG</named-content> <named-content content-type="sequence">GCG TCG GGC CTG</named-content>-3’, reverse primer: 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TTA TCC ACT TCC AAT GTT ATT ACT GCT GCT GGG CTA CCT G</named-content>-3’).

Cryo-EM data were acquired on a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (FEI/Thermo) operated at 300 keV, equipped with a K2 summit direct detector (Gatan) and a GIF Quantum energy filter. Automated data acquisition was carried out using FEI EPU software at a nominal magnification of 130,000 × in nanoprobe EF-TEM mode. Image stacks of 40 frames were collected in counting mode over 10 s. The dose rate was ~4.3–4.5 e<sup>−</sup> per Å<sup>2</sup> per s for a total dose of ~43–45 e<sup>−</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup>.

Using a 30 Å low-pass filtered <italic>ab initio</italic> model generated in cryoSPARC from 1679 particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>), we performed one round of 3D classification of all particle images with image alignment. One class with defined density for the nucleosome-CHD4 complex was selected for a second round of classification. The second round of classification resulted in two classes with one copy of CHD4 bound to the nucleosome. The respective classes were selected and 3D refined. The refined nucleosome-CHD4 model was subsequently CTF refined and the beam tilt was estimated based on grouping of beam tilt classes according to their exposure positions. The CTF refined particles were submitted to one additional round of masked 3D classification without image alignment. The mask encompassed CHD4.

The final map was sharpened with a <italic>B</italic>-factor of −36 Å<sup>2</sup>. To exclude that the reconstruction could be a mixture of particles with CHD4 bound to either SHL –2 or SHL +2, CHD4 signal was subtracted and prior angular and translational information for every particle was removed. The subtracted particles were then refined against a synthetic nucleosome core particle map lacking CHD4. As expected, the refinement resulted in a reconstruction where only density for the nucleosome core particle was observed. Subsequently, the particle subtraction was reverted and a 3D classification without image alignment against a single class was performed. This 3D classification employed the angular and translational information provided from the subtraction refinement. The resulting reconstruction showed clear density for CHD4 only at SHL +2, and not at SHL −2, giving a clear indication that the final nucleosome-CHD4 reconstruction contains CHD4 bound only at SHL +2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4f</xref>).

The high-quality EM structure and the associated EM data in this work is expected to be a great resource for the chromatin field to develop and test mechanistic models.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Nucleosome-CHD4 chromatin remodeller structure explains human disease mutations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will see from the individual reviews attached below all the reviewers found the structure to be of high quality. However, in the discussion amongst the reviewers it was also agreed that the structure by itself does not sufficiently advance our understanding of remodeling mechanisms. Comparison with previous Chd1 structures forms a key component of the mechanistic conclusions made in this work. The reviewers thought that such direct comparisons were not appropriate primarily because of the different ATP states of the two structures. Additionally, the first Chd1 structure had other proteins in the mix that are not present in the context of CHD4. Comparing structures of CHD4 and Chd1 bound to nucleosomes in the presence of the same ATP analog would be ideal. However, the reviewers recognized that this may be difficult and take time. So, in their discussion they tried to come up with possible biochemical experiments (instead of another structure) that could be carried out to test the mechanistic predictions of your current CHD4-nucleosome structure. These are summarized below.</p><p>1) Directly compare terminal DNA unwrapping by CHD4 and Chd1 (positive control) in the presence of AMP-PNP and ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> using a FRET assay.</p><p>2) Introduce gaps at SHL 2 and determine if deformation of the DNA at SHL 2 has a functional role.</p><p>3) Test the functional effects of the new contacts and compare to corresponding effects with Chd1.</p><p>If any of these biochemical experiments or any others that you choose to carry out provide new mechanistic insights, then we would welcome a resubmission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Recent high-resolution cryo-EM structures of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers are shedding new light on the mechanisms of these complex enzymes. Here the authors use cryo-EM to study the structure of CHD4, a human CHD enzyme, bound to a nucleosome in the presence of AMP-PNP. They find that the ATPase domain binds at SHL 2 as predicted from studies of other CHD enzymes and observe a distortion of nucleosomal DNA at this location. However, in contrast to their earlier structure of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Chd1, the authors do not see unpeeling of the terminal DNA that is proximal to the bound ATPase domain. They argue that this difference may arise because CHD4 does not have the SANT-SLIDE DNA binding domains present in Chd1. They also observe interactions with the H4 tail as predicted by previous studies. Finally, they map specific disease associated mutations map on to the ATPase and accessory domains of Chd4.</p><p>Overall, the cryo-EM data appears to be of very high quality. My main concern is that the findings do not substantially move the field forward compared to previous structural studies on chromatin remodelers. There are some new findings in this work that have the potential to be mechanistically significant, but these need additional tests. Below are some suggestions for raising the mechanistic impact.</p><p>1) The authors suggest that the absence of unpeeled DNA compared to Chd1 may arise because of the absence of a known DNA binding domain. This difference could in principle point to significant mechanistic differences between the two CHD proteins due to different ways of engaging the DNA. However, the differences could also arise due to the difference in nucleotide state between the two studies. The author's previous study used ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> while this study used AMP-PNP. To test for mechanistic differences between Chd4 and Cdh1 the authors should compare the two structures in the same ATP state.</p><p>2) The presence of distorted DNA is interesting, but the extent of distortion appears much less than observed with Snf2. The authors should test the mechanistic significance of the distortion by classical approaches previously used with ISWI and SWI/SNF enzymes. These experiments used nucleosomes with nicks or gaps at SHL 2. If the authors find substantial reduction in nucleosome sliding but not much reduction in nucleosome binding using nucleosomes with gaps or nicks at SHL 2, then this will imply that distortion of the DNA at SHL 2 plays a functional role.</p><p>3) The authors should test the consequences of mutating the specific interactions identified in their structure on remodeling by CHD4. This includes interactions made with the H4 tail, the histone surfaces and DNA. Comparison of the magnitude of the effects of these mutations with the corresponding published effects observed with Snf2, Chd1 and ISWI enzymes will allow for a direct comparison of how different remodelers use interactions with the nucleosome to drive octamer sliding.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling is one of the mechanisms to modulate nucleosome structure, using the energy from ATP hydrolysis and dedicated ATPases. These macromolecular machines are employed and influence a range of processes, such as transcription, replication or repair. To maintain or effectuate changes in chromatin, eukaryotic cells evolved four known major families of remodeling factors: SWI/SNF, ISWI, Ino80 and CHD, that have their unique properties.</p><p>Farnung et al. report a high-resolution structure of CHD4 bound to a nucleosome, solved using cryo-EM. In their article, they use a full-length human CHD4 construct and a nucleosome with additional extranucleosomal DNA (4 bp on the entry and 30 bp at the exit of the nucleosome) and reveal the mode of binding and interaction between them. This is the first structure of group II CHD ATP-dependent remodelers, following on the studies by Farnung et al., 2017 of group I remodeler, yeast CHD1.</p><p>This is a well-written, strictly structural paper that provides a view on an important chromatin remodeler that in the eukaryotic cells is a part of larger remodeling complexes, such as NuRD and ChAHP. The authors could have provided some FRET data to confirm their model. This is important, especially since they derive functional differences from structural comparison of two not-fully resolved remodelers from different organisms on different nucleosomal substrates, using different ATP analogues. However, after some modifications, this data and paper could be accepted, as it is an important and well-approached study.</p><p>1) Upon comparing the PDB 3LZ0 with 6RYR, authors modeled 4 base-pairs on the exit site, which leads to the following question:</p><p>a) The map EMD-10058_6RYR: If there is 4bp on the entry, and 30bp at the exit, upon filtering the density, why would there be such a large additional amount of density on the entry-side at the low threshold level? Could that be an indication of a mixed population in the final reconstruction, or a translocation?</p><p>2) The authors write: &quot;Structural comparisons show that CHD4, in contrast to Chd1, does not induce unwrapping of terminal DNA.&quot; The follow up to this is: &quot;In contrast to the nucleosome-Chd1 structure (Farnung et al., 2017), we did not observe unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA from the histone octamer on the second DNA gyre at SHL -6 and -7 (Figure 2)&quot;.

Could it be completely excluded here?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of CHD4 bound to a nucleosome, thus adding to a small but growing number of chromatin remodeling protein structures. The main strength of the work is the high-resolution structure of this disease-relevant protein and the ability to discuss previous work in a structural context. Comparisons are made to previously defined remodeler-nucleosome structures, which mainly point to commonalities with a few noted exceptions including a lack of exit-side DNA distortion. An intriguing minor deformation in DNA trajectory is observed in the presence of AMP-PNP, which is made possible by the high resolution. Other strengths include determination of the placement of double chromodomains and one of two PHD fingers (albeit to lower resolution) as well as determination of a CHD3/4/5-specific contact with nucleosomal DNA. CHD4 disease-specific mutations are mapped onto the structure to help explain their previously defined functional consequences.</p><p>The biggest limitation of the work is the lack of functional information. This manuscript is entirely structural modeling. Though an exceptionally high-resolution structure for a remodeler-nucleosome complex, many of the findings were previously predicted, which makes the insight from the structure more limited than other contemporary remodeler-nucleosome structures. Another limitation is that the structure lacks a significant portion of the CHD4 protein, though this is not mentioned explicitly in the text. Figure 1 displays the fragment that was modeled, but it would be worthwhile to discuss that regions of CHD4 that may be functional or contributing to the remodeling cycle are not resolved. Otherwise it would be important to show that the modeled structure that is being used to justify a remodeling mechanism is sufficient for CHD4 remodeling.</p><p>It would be useful to incorporate at least some functional data, particularly to demonstrate function of the newly defined contacts (e.g. loop 832-837, Asn1010, Arg1068, Arg1173) to help solidify structure-function relationships that are proposed.</p><p>The title contains &quot;explains disease mutations&quot; but most (perhaps all) of the functional consequences of these disease mutations were defined previously in Mi-2 (Kovac et al) or could have been predicted from highly-conserved ATPase regions. While the manuscript gives credit to the previous characterizations, I believe the title overstates the contribution of the structure. Even simply changing to &quot;Nucleosome-CHD4 chromatin remodeller structure maps human disease mutations&quot; would be more acceptable. In addition, making it transparent in the Abstract that the effects of these mutations were previously defined would be appreciated.</p><p>Similarly, the Discussion states that &quot;our structure elucidates the mechanism of chromatin remodeling&quot;. More appropriately, the structure may add to or fill gaps in models of the chromatin remodeling mechanism.</p><p>The exit-side Discussion section relating heterochromatin to lack of exit-side DNA dynamics in the cryo-EM structure seems speculative and unsupported. It is simpler to state that the lack of unwrapping at the exit side may be due to lack of DNA binding domain. However, unwrapping may still be seen in the context of CHD4 complexes like NuRD and ChAHP. It may be too early to speculate about intermediate DNA unwrapping states, as this structure captures one part of the CHD4 remodeling cycle that is complex and may require some distortion of DNA on both sides for nucleosome repositioning to occur.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Nucleosome-CHD4 chromatin remodeller structure maps human disease mutations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Earlier we had said that if any of the biochemical experiments that we had listed or any others that you choose to carry out provide new mechanistic insights then we would welcome a resubmission. In this context, the reviewers appreciated the addition of biochemical data to the resubmission. However, after extensive discussion all reviewers felt that the added FRET data did not provide sufficient new mechanistic insight to merit publication as a Research Article. At the same time, they agreed that your high-quality EM structure and the EM data would be a valuable resource for the chromatin field to develop and test mechanistic models. We can therefore offer to consider your work under the Tools and Resources category of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>If you would like for your paper to be published in the Tools and Resources category, we ask that you submit a revised version that addresses the remaining EM-related questions. The major EM related question is summarized below.</p><p>As pointed out by our EM expert reviewer it appears that the structure could be a mix of the SHL +2 and SHL -2 bound particles. In this situation, the way to clearly define the structure would be to mask out or delete computationally the density for CHD4 and align particles based on some other feature. Then, without again aligning the data, go back to the original particles and project back the resulting information. This could show if there are SHL +2 and SHL -2 bound particles – the final maps could be at lower resolutions, nevertheless, it would be more precise. Even if this analysis shows no mixture of particles, we feel the analysis is necessary for conclusive interpretation of the data.</p><p>Carrying out such an analysis would comprehensively address the following two prior questions asked by the reviewer.</p><p>1) Upon comparing the PDB 3LZ0 with 6RYR, authors modeled 4 base-pairs on the exit site, which leads to the following question: The map EMD-10058_6RYR: If there is 4bp on the entry, and 30bp at the exit, upon filtering the density, why would there be such a large additional amount of density on the entry-side at the low threshold level? Could that be an indication of a mixed population in the final reconstruction, or a translocation?</p><p>2) The authors write: &quot;Structural comparisons show that CHD4, in contrast to Chd1, does not induce unwrapping of terminal DNA.&quot; The follow up to this is: &quot;In contrast to the nucleosome-Chd1 structure (Farnung et al., 2017), we did not observe unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA from the histone octamer on the second DNA gyre at SHL -6 and -7 (Figure 2)&quot;. However, upon closer examination, this DNA density, while not unwrapped, appears to exhibit a lower occupancy than the rest of the nucleosome. Is that an effect of incomplete classification, or a partial distortion by the remodeler?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The FRET data presented by the authors addresses part of my core concern about comparing DNA unpeeling by Chd4 vs. Chd1. However, the experiments are quite minimal. Beyond suggesting some unpeeling in one context and not in the other, they do not provide much new insight into the mechanistic differences between Chd1 and Chd4.</p><p>In addition, several controls are missing.</p><p>1) The authors need to mention describe how they ensured that the nucleosome was fully bound by Chd1 and Chd4 under the FRET experimental conditions. This is important in the case of Chd4, which shows no FRET change.</p><p>2) To rule out any environmental effects on the Cy dyes upon binding by Chd1, the authors should show a scan for direct excitation of Cy5. The absence of an effect with direct excitation of Cy5 would rule out an environmental effect on Cy5.</p><p>3) It is not clear what is the significance of the extent of FRET change. Some comparison to the FRET changes observed upon increasing salt would allow for calibrating the observed effect with respect to other contexts where DNA is unpeeled.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This revised manuscript from Farnung et al. presents a high resolution cryo-EM structure of the nucleosome core particle in complex with human CHD4, a disease-relevant chromatin remodeling protein with known roles in transcriptional repression. The structure is a nice addition to our limited but growing number of chromatin remodeling proteins in complex with nucleosome substrates. The work defines a potential remodeling intermediate where nucleosomal DNA is distorted at SHL +2, and contrasts CHD4 with Chd1 by showing CHD4 does not unwrap terminal DNA. The structure provides a valuable resource to the chromatin community and it bridges the gap between known structure, known chromatin remodeler function, and known disease mutations.</p><p>The major drawback from the work is the limited insight into new chromatin remodeler biology. There is limited new knowledge gained regarding how chromatin remodeling proteins work, and the function of most of the disease mutations were predictable based on a significant number of previous publications describing ATPase and chromatin remodeler biochemistry. Even the described remodeling intermediate is speculative, since there are no comparable structures of CHD4 in other nucleotide-bound states, so the extent of disruption of SHL +2 as a function of nucleotide state is unclear. As mentioned in the previous review, minimal biochemical experiments testing some of the newly identified remodeler-nucleosome contact points would have been quite useful to address these concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling is one of the mechanisms to modulate nucleosome structure, using the energy from ATP hydrolysis and dedicated ATPases. These macromolecular machines are employed and influence a range of processes, such as transcription, replication or repair. To maintain or effectuate changes in chromatin, eukaryotic cells evolved four known major families of remodeling factors: SWI/SNF, ISWI, Ino80 and CHD, that have their unique properties.</p><p>Farnung et al. report a high-resolution structure of CHD4 bound to a nucleosome, solved using cryo-EM. In their article, they use a full-length human CHD4 construct and a nucleosome with additional extranucleosomal DNA (4 bp on the entry and 30 bp at the exit of the nucleosome) and reveal the mode of binding and interaction between them. This is the first structure of group II CHD ATP-dependent remodelers, following on the studies by Farnung et al., 2017 of group I remodeler, yeast CHD1.</p><p>This is a well-written, well-approached structural paper that provides a view on an important chromatin remodeler that in the eukaryotic cells is a part of larger remodeling complexes, such as NuRD and ChAHP.</p><p>This is the second time this paper has been reviewed by me; thus, upon reading the paper and the changes made by the authors, I took the liberty of resubmitting this review in an almost unchanged form. From the previous submission, it is clear that the authors took their time to address the most criticized part and performed FRET studies. This is convincing and removes the greatest hurdle in their paper.</p><p>However, I still want to request answers to the question I made in the past, that has not been addressed.</p><p>I could not see it from the classification, so, could authors provide an indication of how they made sure that their nucleosome orientation in the reconstruction was done properly (30/4bp)? Could it be that the single CHD4 could bind on either side (as in Armache et al., 2019, SNF2H), and thus the EM assignment would have to be extra careful?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Nucleosome-CHD4 chromatin remodeller structure maps human disease mutations&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the work will provide a very valuable resource to the chromatin community. However, our EM expert reviewer has some remaining concerns. Below are excerpted the two key issues that the reviewer raises:</p><p>Since the authors decided not to provide a deeper insight into the mixed dataset angle I asked about before, and the density on either side of the nucleosome seems to not clearly support the statement about the 4bp, I would want them to add a sentence about this in the text. A statement, such as, for example: &quot;We cannot rule out that our map is still to some extent a mix of the CHD4 bound on either side of the nucleosome, as filtering of the map suggests the presence of more than 4 bp&quot;. As this is to be a resource paper, I also want to suggest the paper acceptance provided that the raw EM data is uploaded to EMPIAR as soon as possible.</p><p>All three reviewers have discussed these comments and agree that the following actions are needed prior to acceptance:</p><p>1) Addition of the following sentence in the text: &quot;We cannot rule out that our map is still to some extent a mix of the CHD4 bound on either side of the nucleosome, as filtering of the map suggests the presence of more than 4 bp&quot;.</p><p>2) Uploading the raw EM data to EMPIAR.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56178.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

We now provide the key additional biochemical experiment that the reviewers suggested, the direct comparison of Chd1 and CHD4 in their ability to detach nucleosomal DNA, as monitored by FRET (Suggestion #1). We carried out these assays in the presence of ADP.BeF3 or AMP-PNP. We found that, as expected from the structural data and comparisons, Chd1 detaches/unwraps DNA in the presence of either ATP or transition state analogue, whereas CHD4 does not. This assay complements our structural comparison with Chd1 and indicates an important mechanistic difference between these two CHD proteins. The new data and figure clearly improved our manuscript by providing not only structural but also biochemical evidence for mechanistic differences between members of two CHD subfamilies. We think the resulting manuscript is acceptable for publication. Please also refer to the detailed responses with respect to individual concerns by reviewers below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) The authors suggest that the absence of unpeeled DNA compared to Chd1 may arise because of the absence of a known DNA binding domain. This difference could in principle point to significant mechanistic differences between the two CHD proteins due to different ways of engaging the DNA. However, the differences could also arise due to the difference in nucleotide state between the two studies. The author's previous study used ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> while this study used AMP-PNP. To test for mechanistic differences between Chd4 and Cdh1 the authors should compare the two structures in the same ATP state.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. As explained above, we have addressed this by a FRET assay that monitors DNA unwrapping. The FRET assay was performed with both remodellers in the presence of ADP.BeF<sub>3</sub>- or AMP-PNP. Indeed, Chd1 unwraps DNA in the presence of either ATP/transition state analogue, whereas CHD4 does not. These data are presented now along the structural comparisons of the Chd1- and CHD4-nucleosome complexes in Figure 2B, C. The FRET assay confirms a significant mechanistic difference between these two CHD proteins. With respect to new structures, we trust the reviewer understands this is beyond the scope of the current work, and this is also what we understood from the editorial decision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The presence of distorted DNA is interesting, but the extent of distortion appears much less than observed with Snf2. The authors should test the mechanistic significance of the distortion by classical approaches previously used with ISWI and SWI/SNF enzymes. These experiments used nucleosomes with nicks or gaps at SHL 2. If the authors find substantial reduction in nucleosome sliding but not much reduction in nucleosome binding using nucleosomes with gaps or nicks at SHL 2, then this will imply that distortion of the DNA at SHL 2 plays a functional role.</p></disp-quote><p>See above, we did not use this approach but concentrated to the comparisons between CHD4 and Chd1. We trust the reviewer understands this is beyond the scope of the current work, and this is also what we understood from the editorial decision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should test the consequences of mutating the specific interactions identified in their structure on remodeling by CHD4. This includes interactions made with the H4 tail, the histone surfaces and DNA. Comparison of the magnitude of the effects of these mutations with the corresponding published effects observed with Snf2, Chd1 and ISWI enzymes will allow for a direct comparison of how different remodelers use interactions with the nucleosome to drive octamer sliding.</p></disp-quote><p>See above, we did not use this approach but concentrated to the comparisons between CHD4 and Chd1.

Our analysis revealed additional density of extranucleosomal DNA on the entry and exit side. The entry side, however, only showed additional density for approximately 4 base pairs as can be expected from the used DNA sequence. We did not choose to model these additional 4 base pairs because of the poor signal/noise for this region. In contrast, we were able to observe less ambiguous density at the DNA exit side and accordingly modelled 4 clearly distinguishable base pairs. We would like to point out that a mixed population or translocation events are highly unlikely due to the fact that we were able to assign the DNA register unambiguously using the density around the nucleosomal dyad, which exhibits high resolution (Figure 3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors write: &quot;Structural comparisons show that CHD4, in contrast to Chd1, does not induce unwrapping of terminal DNA.&quot; The followup to this is: &quot;In contrast to the nucleosome-Chd1 structure (Farnung et al., 2017), we did not observe unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA from the histone octamer on the second DNA gyre at SHL -6 and -7 (Figure 2)&quot;.

Is that an effect of incomplete classification, or a partial distortion by the remodeler?</p></disp-quote><p>The lower occupancy is likely due to a higher flexibility at SHL -7 and for the extranucleosomal DNA. Nevertheless, the flexibility around SHL -7 is comparable with the flexibility observed for canonical NCPs (see also FRET assay in Figure 2). Therefore, it is unlikely to be due to a partial distortion by the remodeler.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Regarding CHD1 and CHD4 comparison:</p><p>a) If comparing it only to the CHD1 publication from 2017 by Farnung et al., the sample there was significantly different. It involved CHD1-FACT-Paf1C-nucleosome assembly, of which only CHD1-nucleosome was visible. The DNA substrate was also different, containing 63 base pairs of extranucleosomal DNA on the exit side vs 30 in this study. Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018 contained only CHD1-nucleosome, but also with a different nucleosome substrate. Could the extranucleosomal DNA be of significance in this study, and could the authors provide a 1-2 sentence explanation of their particular exit/entry side DNA construct rationale?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. As indicated in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, we used the canonical 145 bp Widom 601 with additional 4 bp on the entry side of the DNA and 30 bp of linker DNA. The full sequence is given in the Materials and methods section of the submitted manuscript. The construct was designed based on the published NCP-Chd1 structures that clearly indicated that a construct with 30 bp of extranucleosomal DNA is sufficient for binding by a DNA binding region (as present in Chd1). We added a corresponding statement on this to the manuscript Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Authors are comparing a yeast CHD1 bound by ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub>3, with human CHD4 bound by AMP-PNP.
