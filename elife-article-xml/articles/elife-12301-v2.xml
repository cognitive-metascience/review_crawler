The genetic identities of premotoneurons providing behaviorally relevant excitation to any pool of respiratory motoneurons remain unknown. Recently, we established in vitro that Dbx1-derived pre-Bötzinger complex neurons are critical for rhythm generation and that a subpopulation serves a premotor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we further show that a subpopulation of Dbx1-derived intermediate reticular (IRt) neurons are rhythmically active during inspiration and project to the hypoglossal (XII) nucleus that contains motoneurons important for maintaining airway patency. Laser ablation of Dbx1 IRt neurons, 57% of which are glutamatergic, decreased ipsilateral inspiratory motor output without affecting frequency. We conclude that a subset of Dbx1 IRt neurons is a source of premotor excitatory drive, contributing to the inspiratory behavior of XII motoneurons, as well as a key component of the airway control network whose dysfunction contributes to sleep apnea.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12301.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12301.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>central pattern generator</kwd><kwd>breathing</kwd><kwd>motor behavior</kwd><kwd>brainstem</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HL089742</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>Paul A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Operating grant, 130306, RES0018140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Funk</surname><given-names>Gregory D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery grant, 402532, RES0012299</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Funk</surname><given-names>Gregory D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000145</institution-id><institution>Alberta Innovates - Health Solutions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Salary award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Funk</surname><given-names>Gregory D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000196</institution-id><institution>Canada Foundation for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Equipment and infrastructure grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Funk</surname><given-names>Gregory D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HL104127</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Del Negro</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Wang et al., 2014), we use a combination of genetic, electrophysiology and laser ablation approaches to identify a developmentally defined population of neurons that are a significant source of clinically relevant inspiratory drive to XII motoneurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding the genetic basis of behavior is a fundamental goal of neuroscience that requires functional identification of constituent neurons, knowledge of their embryonic origins, and characterization of their cellular, synaptic and modulatory properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goulding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Garcia-Campmany et al., 2010</xref>).

Ten of 23 (43%) inspiratory and five of 14 (36%) noninspiratory Dbx1 IRt neurons were antidromically activated via electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral XII nucleus. Two of the 10 antidromically activated inspiratory neurons also showed positive collision tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Second, anatomical reconstruction of seven biocytin-filled Dbx1 IRt inspiratory neurons revealed two neurons with axons that projected ipsilaterally towards the XII nucleus border, one of which projected into the XII nucleus and was antidromically activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E, F</xref>). Interestingly, two of these seven reconstructed inspiratory neurons were antidromically activated from the ipsilateral XII nucleus and had commissural axons, indicating bilateral connectivity.

Therefore, this study advances our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) by demonstrating that Dbx1 IRt neuron ablation disrupts inspiratory burst amplitude but not rhythm. These data strongly suggest that a subpopulation of Dbx1-derived IRt neurons serve an important inspiratory premotor function.</p><p>While we did not perform dual intracellular recordings to unequivocally show synaptic contact between Dbx1 IRt neurons and XII motoneurons, our conclusion that Dbx1 IRt neurons are XII inspiratory premotoneurons is based on: (i) synaptic drive potentials and action potential volleys in Dbx1 IRt neurons that were in phase with inspiratory rhythm; (ii) evidence from antidromic activation (including positive collision tests) and axon reconstructions showing that inspiratory Dbx1 IRt neurons project to the XII nucleus; and, (iii) the sequential appearance, on average, of inspiratory-related activity first in preBötC neurons, then Dbx1 IRt neurons and finally in the XII nerve.</p><p>The significant reduction in ipsilateral inspiratory XII motor output following unilateral ablation of Dbx1 IRt neurons without a corresponding change in frequency also strongly supports an inspiratory premotor function. Nonspecific ablation-associated damage to circuits contained in the slice is unlikely to be a factor since tissue-matched control slices similarly subjected to cumulative laser ablation protocols showed no degradation in previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>However, there are two main limitations to the ablations experiments. First, Dbx1 IRt neurons detected for ablation included inspiratory and noninspiratory neurons. Selective ablation of inspiratory-modulated, Dbx1 IRt neurons with demonstrated synaptic connections to XII motoneurons would be required to more thoroughly assess the significance of Dbx1 IRt inspiratory XII premotoneurons. We predict a more precipitous, and possibly complete, decline in inspiratory burst amplitude if bona fide Dbx1 IRt inspiratory premotoneurons could be selectively ablated, avoiding Dbx1 IRt neurons with alternative functions.</p><p>A second limitation is that the ablated Dbx1 IRt neurons have unknown transmitter phenotype. Just over half of Dbx1 IRt neurons are glutamatergic. Thus, the ablated population will include GABA and glycinergic neurons. This limitation, however, is unlikely to impact significantly our conclusion that Dbx1 IRt neurons are a major source of excitatory (glutamatergic) inspiratory XII premotor drive. Phrenic motoneurons in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parkis et al., 1999</xref>) and XII motoneurons in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Woch and Kubin, 1995</xref>) receive weak concurrent inspiratory inhibitory premotor drive, but there is no evidence of tonic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Numata et al., 2012</xref>), nor endogenous inspiratory inhibitory XII premotor drive in the slice. Rhythmic inspiratory XII motoneuron drive in the rhythmic slice preparation, and therefore premotor activity, is entirely glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Funk et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ireland et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kubin and Volgin, 2008</xref>). Moreover, while XII motoneurons and XII inspiratory output in vitro are inhibited by exogenous activation of GABA and glycine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">O'Brien and Berger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaiswal et al., 2015</xref>), ablation of endogenously active inhibitory premotoneurons, tonic or phasic, would potentiate rather than reduce XII inspiratory output. Thus, in the unlikely circumstance that we ablated endogenously active inhibitory Dbx1 IRt premotoneurons, it would underestimate rather than contradict our conclusion that Dbx1 IRt premotoneurons provide excitatory drive for inspiratory motor output.</p><p>We identified at least three types of Dbx1 neurons in the IRt: (i) inspiratory premotoneurons that project ipsilaterally; (ii) inspiratory premotoneurons that project ipsi- and contralaterally; and, (iii) noninspiratory premotoneurons. Inspiratory neurons comprise more than 20% of Dbx1 IRt neurons. Ipsilaterally projecting Dbx1 IRt premotoneurons are a significant source of glutamatergic inspiratory drive to XII motoneurons in vitro. Whether they are the sole source is uncertain. Persistence of inspiratory XII nerve activity following laser ablation of Dbx1 IRt neurons might suggest additional non-Dbx1 derived sources of inspiratory premotor drive. However, the ablation-resistant activity could also derive from Dbx1 premotoneurons too deep for laser ablation, or Dbx1-derived neurons that went untargeted due to lack of tdTomato expression (see Methods). The contribution of ipsilaterally projecting Dbx1 IRt premotoneurons to inspiratory drive in vivo is an important question that cannot be extrapolated from in vitro experiments. Portions of the XII premotor network, as well as sources of modulatory drive, are missing from slices, which may make inspiratory XII output more sensitive to the loss of premotoneurons.</p><p>Contralateral projections from Dbx1 IRt inspiratory putative premotoneurons were unexpected and of unknown function. They may contribute to the contralateral inspiratory drive for airway and tongue movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ono et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peever et al., 2002</xref>), they may be inspiratory rhythmogenic preBötC neurons displaced into the IRt, or they may help coordinate inspiration with other oromotor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ono et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tupal et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>From a clinical perspective, XII inspiratory premotoneurons are relevant in the context of obstructive sleep apnea where reductions in airway muscle tone, especially in the genioglossus muscle of the tongue, during sleep can result in airway obstruction and apnea. XII inspiratory premotoneurons decrease their firing during carbachol-induced REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Woch et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, understanding the modulatory control of XII premotoneuron excitability during sleep-wake cycling may provide insight into mechanisms underlying sleep-disordered breathing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>All the experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines laid down by the NIH in the US regarding the care and use of animals for experimental procedures, the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">National Academy of Sciences, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">National Academy of Sciences, 2015</xref>), and in compliance with protocols approved by the College of William and Mary Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, the Animal Studies Committee at Washington University School of Medicine and the University of Alberta Faculty of Medicine Animal Welfare Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Animals</title><p>We used Cre-Lox transgenic technology to identify Dbx1 interneurons via native fluorescent protein expression.

The dorsal border of nucleus ambiguus was defined by visual inspection of the slice. When this was not visible, the dorsal border of nucleus ambiguus was defined based on relative position along the dorsoventral (vertical) axis of the slice.

Based on this analysis of the published atlas and our own sections, the dorsal border of nucleus ambiguus was located 36-37% of the maximum length along the ventrodorsal axis (closer to the ventral surface).

Dbx1-labeled cells within 175 µm of the midline were excluded because there are few XII premotoneurons in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Dobbins and Feldman, 1995</xref>). Levels of digital images were adjusted so that the full 255 range of greyscale levels were used, which served to maximize low-level expression. Co-localization of β-Gal and mRNA required at least half of the nucleus to be surrounded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Laser ablation</title><p>Cell-specific detection and laser ablation of Dbx1 IRt neurons was carried out by an automated system previously applied to Dbx1 preBötC neurons, consisting of a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning head and fixed-stage microscope body, an adjustable wavelength 1.5-W Ti-sapphire tunable laser, a robotically-controlled xy translation stage and custom software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Detection and ablation procedures consist of three phases: (1) initialization, (2) target detection, and (3) ablation. The initialization phase defines the domain for detection and ablation, which in this case comprises a region of the IRt, as defined above, that is a 412 µm<sup>2</sup> in the transverse plane and 100 µm along the rostrocaudal axis; i.e., ablation was limited to neurons within 100 µm of the slice surface. This spanned the area dorsomedial to nucleus ambiguus and ventrolateral to XII nucleus, which excludes the preBötC. During the detection phase, tdTomato emission was detected using a HeNe 543 nm laser at depths &lt;100 µm, while scripted routines making use of ImageJ functionality were used to differentiate Dbx1 neurons based on threshold-crossing algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). During the ablation phase, individual Dbx1 IRt neurons were randomly selected from the list of validated targets and scanned over a 10 µm<sup>2</sup> area at the center of the defined cell location by maximum-strength 800-nm Ti:Sapphire laser pulses. The time between ablations was ~30 s, which includes scanning time required for the ablation and for confirmation of the ablation. Lesions were confirmed by optical criteria described elsewhere and confirmed ablations were added to the running tally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Lesions were performed until the entire target list was exhausted. XII motor output was monitored for 30 min prior to beginning ablations and then throughout the ablations. XII motoneuron axons travel across the slice virtually parallel to the cut surface and then exit the brainstem through the ventral surface in multiple nerve rootlets that span more than 500 µm rostrocaudally. We record from the XII nerve root closest the targeted slice surface since it is most likely to contain axons of motoneurons that receive input from the surface Dbx1 neurons that we are able to ablate.</p><p>XII burst amplitude and area were computed using LabChart PeakParameters module and averaged over a 5-min window immediately prior to commencing target ablation (control) and a 5-min window after exhausting the target list (post-ablation). Inspiratory burst period was calculated from XII burst peak to peak throughout the entire experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All intrinsic cellular properties were measured in current clamp from a membrane potential of -60 mV, only including cells with spikes that reached at least 0 mV. Input resistance (R<sub>N</sub>, MΩ) was calculated from the slope of the voltage-current relationship from a series of 500-ms current pulses that hyperpolarize the membrane potential as much as 30 mV from the -60 mV baseline potential. The membrane time constant (τ, ms) was computed from an exponential fit to membrane potential relaxation. Cell capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>, pF) was calculated from the quotient of the time constant and the input resistance. Finally, rheobase (I<sub>rh</sub>, pA) was measured by applying 3-ms depolarizing pulses that were manually adjusted until reaching the minimum pulse magnitude that elicited a single action potential on the termination of the current pulse. A minimum of five measurements was averaged for each parameter for each cell.</p><p>Measurements of the underlying inspiratory drive were computed in LabChart, and were averaged over at least six cycles. Inspiratory burst latency (drive latency) quantifies the time interval between summating excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the recorded neuron (causing the neuron to depolarize and potentially fire action potentials) and the XII motor output; positive numbers indicate that the Dbx1 neuron depolarized before the onset of the XII root output. Drive latency was measured from the onset of summating EPSPs in the recorded neuron to the maximum slope of the XII burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rekling et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Picardo et al., 2013</xref>). Drive amplitude was measured as the difference between maximum depolarization and the baseline (baseline defined as the average membrane potential during 250 ms of the interburst interval preceding the burst to be measured), if the depolarizing burst was insufficient to lead to action potentials. If, however, the neuron spiked during the inspiratory drive, the maximum depolarization was estimated based on the shape of the underlying drive potential. Drive potential area was measured as the integral of the burst, which (unlike drive potential amplitude) is a measure insensitive to intraburst spiking. Finally, drive potential duration was measured for both the XII root output and for inspiratory-modulated Dbx1 IRt neurons based on the elapsed time from when XII discharge or the membrane potential exceeded 10% of peak depolarization to the moment XII discharge or membrane potential dropped below 10% of peak depolarization.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor (Ole Kiehn), and three reviewers.</p><p>The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jeff Smith and Nino Ramirez (peer reviewers).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this Research Advance, Revill et al. present data showing that a subpopulation of Dbx1-derived neurons in the intermediate reticular formation (IRt) of the mouse medulla exhibit rhythmic inspiratory activity in neonatal slice preparations in vitro, and that some of these inspiratory neurons have axonal projections to the XII motor nucleus and are proposed to be inspiratory XII premotoneurons. The authors show that laser ablation of a set of ~70 Dbx1-tdTomato labeled neurons in the IRt significantly reduces the amplitude of the ipsilateral inspiratory hypoglossal motor output without affecting the frequency of the rhythm, thereby providing functional evidence that at least some of these DBx1 positive cells in this region of brainstem are premotor neurons downstream of the rhythm-generating inspiratory kernel mediating drive to the XII motor neurons. The authors argue that the novelty the present study is establishing the developmental origin (from Dbx1-expressing progenitors) of some identified inspiratory premotoneurons. Together with previous work showing that a subset of Dbx1-derived pre-BötC neurons are inspiratory neurons and function in rhythmogenesis, the authors also argue that the potential advance is the demonstration that that these premotor neurons are distinct from the inspiratory rhythm generating neuronal population but are derived from the same progenitors. The responses of the reviewers were generally positive and agree that study is a significant advance of the previous study of Dbx1 derived neurons in pre-BötC. The reviewers felt however that the authors' statement of the advance is out of line with what they actually show and that it contains overstatements for which there is no support in the presented data. While the study is technically sound and well performed, the authors need to acknowledge the limitations of their findings. These points are outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is hard to see why is it a significant advance for understanding respiratory circuit function per se to know that a subset of IRt XII inspiratory premotor neurons are Dbx1-derived. Or that Dbx1-expressing progenitors give rise to both rhythm and pattern generating neurons. Knowing the genetic specificity of these cells does not give insight into how genetically defined neuronal populations determine function and connectivity. Rather the advance and novelty of the present study with respect to the previous study is the functional demonstration of a group of cells that are premotor (amplitude modulation not affecting frequency) different from the rhythm generation kernel (frequency and amplitude modulation). The authors should state that the main novelty and advance is their direct demonstration of functional perturbations from the ablation experiments, which is consistent with an inspiratory premotor function of some of the Dbx1-derived IRt neurons.</p><p>2) The definitive proof that the inspiratory neurons are XII premotor neurons is to directly demonstrate structurally and functionally synaptic connections with XII inspiratory neurons, which would require more advanced circuit reconstruction techniques than those applied in this study. The authors need to acknowledge these limitations by stating that selectively ablating of identified Dbx1-derived inspiratory neurons with demonstrated synaptic connections to XII motor neurons will be required to more thoroughly establish that the identified subset of Dbx1-derived IRt cells are in fact inspiratory premotor neurons.</p><p>Related to this issue, it is not clear why the anatomical reconstructions of loaded neurons shown on panel G, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, do not show projections towards the XII nucleus for all neurons. The authors should clearly state what are the criteria required to define them as XII premotor neurons.</p><p>3) They authors need to acknowledge that they have not determined the transmitter-content of the ablated cells. Thus, while the inspiratory drive to the XII is primarily glutamatergic, it is not exclusively glutamatergic. There is significant GABAergic innervation, see e.g. Jaismal et al. 2015. Similarly, the work by Albert Berger identified the Nucleus of Roller as a major source of inhibitory drive to the XII motoneurons. This is an issue since Dbx1 neurons can also be inhibitory (as stated here, &quot;only 57% are glutamatergic&quot;). Since the authors did not demonstrate that the Dbx1 premotor neurons generate EPSPs in the XII motor neurons, it could well be that among these premotor neurons there are some that are inhibitory. Thus, the authors were not able to address whether Dbx1 IRt premotor neurons are the sole source of glutamatergic inspiratory drive to XII motor neurons, nor could they address whether the Dbx1 IRt premotor neurons also contribute to an inhibitory drive to XII motor drive. The lesion experiment suggests that they contribute to the excitatory drive, but they don't exclude the possibility that some of the lesioned neurons were inhibitory. This issue needs to be stated explicitly.</p><p>4) The potential role of contralateral connections is neglected by the authors. They show themselves that some hypothetical XII premotoneurons send axon to the contralateral premotor region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and it is known that some pre-Bötzinger neurons send their axons directly to XII nucleus (Koizumi et al., 2013). The authors should address this point at least in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article> <sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12301.007</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) It is hard to see why is it a significant advance for understanding respiratory circuit function per se to know that a subset of IRt XII inspiratory premotor neurons are Dbx1-derived.

These data, combined with the demonstration that a subpopulation of IRt Dbx1 inspiratory modulated neurons appear to be premotoneurons underlie support the key conclusion that Dbx1-derived IRt neurons serve an inspiratory premotor function. We now state this explicitly:</p><p>“Therefore, this study advances our previous work (Hayes et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014) by demonstrating that Dbx1 IRt neuron ablation disrupts inspiratory burst amplitude but not rhythm. These data strongly suggest that a subpopulation of Dbx1-derived IRt neurons serve an important inspiratory premotor function.”</p><p><italic>2) The definitive proof that the inspiratory neurons are XII premotor neurons is to directly demonstrate structurally and functionally synaptic connections with XII inspiratory neurons, which would require more advanced circuit reconstruction techniques than those applied in this study. The authors need to acknowledge these limitations by stating that selectively ablating of identified Dbx1-derived inspiratory neurons with demonstrated synaptic connections to XII motor neurons will be required to more thoroughly establish that the identified subset of Dbx1-derived IRt cells are in fact inspiratory premotor neurons.</italic> </p><p>Two limitations are mentioned here. The first is that we have not provided definitive proof that Dbx1 IRt neurons are XII premotoneurons. The second limitation is that our ablation studies eliminate Dbx1 neurons in the IRt, regardless of whether they are inspiratory or not. The ideal experiment would be to eliminate only those Dbx1 IRt neurons that are also inspiratory-modulated <italic>and</italic> confirmed XII premotoneurons. For clarity, we have addressed each of these limitations separately.</p><p>In the first limitation, definitive proof that Dbx1 IRt neurons are XII premotoneurons would require that we directly demonstrate structurally and/or functionally that there are synaptic connections between the putative premotoneuron and XII inspiratory neurons. Anatomical evidence could include EM while functional evidence would require simultaneous dual whole-cell recording from a Dbx1 IRt inspiratory neuron and an inspiratory XII MN that are synaptically connected, and then evoking synaptic potentials in the XII MN. This is not a trivial experiment, which is why none of the papers from the existing literature defining inspiratory XII premotoneurons have provided this evidence either. As in our study, the strongest evidence provided in these previously published papers is antidromic activation from the XII nucleus. To clarify this limitation, we included in the Discussion the statement that:</p><p>“While we did not perform dual intracellular recordings to unequivocally show synaptic contact between Dbx1 IRt neurons and XII motoneurons, our conclusion that Dbx1 IRt neurons are XII inspiratory premotoneurons is based on: i) synaptic drive potentials and action potential volleys in Dbx1 IRt neurons that were in phase with inspiratory rhythm; ii) evidence from antidromic activation (including positive collision tests) and axon reconstructions showing that inspiratory Dbx1 IRt neurons project to the XII nucleus; and, iii) the sequential appearance, on average, of inspiratory-related activity first in preBötC neurons, then Dbx1 IRt neurons and finally in the XII nerve.”</p><p>The second limitation raised here is that our ablation studies eliminate Dbx1 neurons in the IRt, regardless of whether they are inspiratory or not. A more ideal experiment would be to ablate only those Dbx1 IRt neurons that are also inspiratory-modulated AND confirmed XII premotoneurons. We agree with the reviewers that this would be a much more advantageous experiment. Our automated detection and laser ablation system should – in theory – be able to detect targets on the basis of genetically encoded fluorophores and activity-dependent calcium indicator dyes. However, this has proved very tricky and still cannot be done reliably. Thus, we acknowledge this limitation in the revised manuscript by defining the conditions that should be met for the ideal experiment. In the Discussion, we now state:</p><p>“However, there are two main limitations to the ablations experiments. First, Dbx1 IRt neurons detected for ablation included inspiratory and non-inspiratory neurons. […] We predict a more precipitous, and possibly complete, decline in inspiratory burst amplitude if bona fide Dbx1 IRt inspiratory premotoneurons could be selectively ablated, avoiding Dbx1 IRt neurons with alternative functions.”</p><p><italic>Related to this issue, it is not clear why the anatomical reconstructions of loaded neurons shown on panel G, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, do not show projections towards the XII nucleus for all neurons.</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> is the population of neurons that had anatomically reconstructed contralateral projections. These Dbx1 inspiratory-modulated neurons were in the IRt and thus considered putative preMNs. A subset of these neurons (i.e. on the left-hand side of the slice) was also antidromically activated. There are a number of reasons why any anatomical reconstruction does not show projections to XII, including: 1) axon collaterals to the XII nucleus may be superficial and then severed during the slicing process even while commissural axon collaterals are evident, 2) axons may course deeply into the slice and thus are too deep in tissue to image, and 3) neuron fills and reconstructions are not always successful.</p><p><italic>The authors should clearly state what are the criteria required to define them as XII premotor neurons.</italic> </p><p>We have clarified the criteria in the text for defining neurons in the present study as XII inspiratory premotoneurons (Results):</p><p>“Criteria for inclusion in our putative premotoneuron sample were somatic location in the IRt, tdTomato expression, and inspiratory modulation. Additional evidence obtained in some cells included antidromic activation from the XII nucleus, positive collision tests, and axonal projections to the ipsilateral XII nucleus.”</p><p>We have also removed three neurons from the reported database. These three neurons were all antidromically activated from the XII nucleus so very likely premotoneurons. Anatomically, however, they sit at the dorsal border of the preBötC. They can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> of the previous version; they are the three the ventral-most cells. Two of these were also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> where they were shown as contralaterally projecting neurons with cell bodies on the left side of the slice. These cells have been removed from all figures, the numbers of recorded neurons were changed accordingly, and the electrophysiological properties reported in association with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> have also been recalculated.</p><p>We removed these neurons to clarify the criteria for inclusion as a putative premotoneuron. As an Advance article, the novel aspect of this study compared to our previous work is that it now reports the properties of Dbx1 IRt neurons, and the effects of ablating Dbx1 IRt neurons on inspiratory modulated XII output. The three neurons that have been removed from the study were on the preBötC side of the border between IRt and preBötC. Removing these three neurons does not change any of the conclusions, but now all cells included in the study are unambiguously in the IRt.</p><p><italic>3) They authors need to acknowledge that they have not determined the transmitter-content of the ablated cells. Thus, while the inspiratory drive to the XII is primarily glutamatergic, it is not exclusively glutamatergic. There is significant GABAergic innervation, see e.g. Jaismal et al. 2015. Similarly, the work by Albert Berger identified the Nucleus of Roller as a major source of inhibitory drive to the XII motoneurons. This is an issue since Dbx1 neurons can also be inhibitory (as stated here, &quot;only 57% are glutamatergic&quot;). Since the authors did not demonstrate that the Dbx1 premotor neurons generate EPSPs in the XII motor neurons, it could well be that among these premotor neurons there are some that are inhibitory.</italic> </p><p>We agree completely that a portion of the ablated IRt Dbx1 neurons are likely to be GABAergic. We now discuss this in detail and make the point that this will not significantly impact our conclusion that a subpopulation of Dbx1 IRt neurons are glutamatergic and have a significant excitatory inspiratory premotor function. We now state in the Discussion that:</p><p>“A second limitation is that the ablated Dbx1 IRt neurons have unknown transmitter phenotype. Just over half of Dbx1 IRt neurons are glutamatergic. […] Thus, in the unlikely circumstance that we ablated endogenously active inhibitory Dbx1 IRt premotoneurons, it would underestimate rather than contradict our conclusion that Dbx1 IRt premotoneurons provide excitatory drive for inspiratory motor output.”</p><p><italic>Thus, the authors were not able to address whether Dbx1 IRt premotor neurons are the sole source of glutamatergic inspiratory drive to XII motor neurons […]</italic></p><p>We agree completely so state in the Discussion:</p><p>“Whether they are the sole source is uncertain. Persistence of inspiratory XII nerve activity following laser ablation of Dbx1 IRt neurons might suggest additional non-Dbx1 derived sources of inspiratory premotor drive. However, the ablation-resistant activity could also derive from Dbx1 premotoneurons too deep for laser ablation, or Dbx1-derived neurons that went untargeted due to lack of tdTomato expression (see Methods).”</p><p><italic>[…] Nor could they address whether the Dbx1 IRt premotor neurons also contribute to an inhibitory drive to XII motor drive. The lesion experiment suggests that they contribute to the excitatory drive, but they don't exclude the possibility that some of the lesioned neurons were inhibitory. This issue needs to be stated explicitly.</italic> </p><p>This issue has been discussed in detail as described above in our first response to comment 3.</p><p><italic>4) The potential role of contralateral connections is neglected by the authors. They show themselves that some hypothetical XII premotoneurons send axon to the contralateral premotor region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and it is known that some pre-Bötzinger neurons send their axons directly to XII nucleus (Koizumi et al., 2013). The authors should address this point at least in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the potential role of contralateral projections is very interesting. However, we are unclear on how to further elaborate on the potential significance of contralateral projections. We feel we have already covered the most likely possibilities when we state (Discussion):</p><p>“Contralateral projections from Dbx1 IRt inspiratory putative premotoneurons were unexpected and of unknown function. They may contribute to the contralateral inspiratory drive for airway and tongue movements (Onoet al., 1994; Peeveret al., 2002), they may be inspiratory rhythmogenic preBötC neurons displaced into the IRt, or they may help coordinate inspiration with other oromotor behaviours (Onoet al., 1998; Tupalet al., 2014)”</p><p>We are not clear on what other potential roles these contralateral projections might play.</p></body></sub-article> </article>
