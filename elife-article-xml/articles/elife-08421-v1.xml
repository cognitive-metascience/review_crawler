that undergo a significant reduction in height during the transition from the membrane-assembled prepore to the membrane-inserted pore. Here, we show that targeted application of compressive forces can catalyze this conformational change in individual PFO complexes trapped at the prepore stage, recapitulating this critical step of the spontaneous process. The free energy landscape determined from these measurements is in good agreement with that obtained from molecular dynamics simulations showing that an equivalent internal force is generated by the interaction of the exposed hydrophobic residues with the membrane. This hydrophobic force is transmitted across the entire structure to produce a compressive stress across a distant, otherwise stable domain, catalyzing its transition from an extended to compact conformation. Single molecule compression is likely to become an important tool to investigate conformational transitions in membrane proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08421.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08421.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08421.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are made up of chains of amino acids that need to fold into intricate three-dimensional shapes to work correctly. But some proteins also have to change their shape drastically when they work. Mechanical forces that change the shape of a protein can therefore be used to determine how a protein folds and how it changes its structure when working.</p><p>Although researchers have developed techniques to analyze the effect of force on single proteins, most studies carried out so far have investigated the effect of stretching (or tensile forces) to understand structural changes that naturally involve an extension within the protein. However, many proteins undergo structural changes that involve a compaction in their shape. How these changes occur remains poorly understood because, for these, methods to apply compressive forces to single proteins are required.</p><p>Perfringolysin O (PFO for short) is a protein that is made by a bacterium that causes food poisoning in humans. PFO makes pores in the membrane that surrounds cells. This causes the cell’s contents to leak out, killing the cell. When inserting into the membrane, PFO changes from an elongated “prepore” state to a compact pore-forming state.</p><p>Czajkowsky et al. now use a combination of single molecule techniques and computer simulations to investigate how PFO undergoes this compaction. Previous work had identified a mutant PFO protein that arrests at the prepore state. Applying a compressive force to the top of this prepore-trapped PFO as it sits on the membrane transmitted forces across the entire PFO protein. This ultimately produced a compressive force across a distant part of the protein that caused the protein to change from the elongated prepore state to the compact, pore-like shape. If a compressive force was not applied, the PFO protein remained in the prepore state. Czajkowsky et al. further found that this compressive force is naturally produced by distant water-repellent parts of the naturally occurring protein interacting with the cell membrane. Therefore, internal forces can transmit across proteins to drive shape changes in distant regions.</p><p>In the future, the methods developed in this study could be applied to analyze other naturally occurring changes in proteins where shape compaction happens when working.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhuang and Rief, 2003</xref>). Moreover, pulling on single molecules with tensile forces has enabled detailed probing of functional and structural transitions within proteins, in particular those that involve a separation of specific structural elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Puchner and Gaub, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">del Rio et al., 2009</xref>). Yet, tensile forces cannot be used to probe transitions that involve a decrease in the distance between structural elements such as the closing of a substrate access gate, for example, as the force acts in a direction opposite to the structural movement. In these instances, what is needed is the controlled application of a compressive force at the single molecule level.</p><p>Perfringolysin O (PFO) is an intriguing pore-forming toxin that undergoes a significant reduction in the distance between two of its domains during pore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gilbert, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hotze and Tweten, 2012</xref>). During the prepore-to-pore transition, the distance between the D1 and D4 domains is reduced as a result of conformational changes in the D2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): this domain is elongated in the prepore but collapses into a more compact structure in the pore, largely accounting for the remarkable 40 Å decrease in height relative to the bilayer surface first observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tilley et al., 2005</xref>). Also within this prepore-to-pore step, an α-helical bundle (the Trans-Membrane Helices (TMHs)) in the D3 domain converts into an amphipathic β-sheet that inserts in the bilayer and lines the aqueous membrane pore. While these changes in the D2 and D3 domains have been firmly established, the mechanism by which these changes are coordinated remains unresolved. In fact, the physical processes associated with long-distance structural communication in proteins are poorly understood in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cui and Karplus, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Whitley and Lee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Herein, using single molecule compressive force spectroscopy and single molecule AFM together with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we demonstrate that intra-protein stresses are the driving force of the structural coordination between the D2 and D3 domains and, ultimately, the catalyst of the collapse of the D2 domain.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08421.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of PFO and the known structural changes during pore formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The water-soluble monomer consists of four domains, D1 to D4.

However, extensive equilibrium MD simulations (&gt;0.3 µs) of a PFO monomer without the TMHs shows that the D2 domain remains in an extended conformation in the absence of the TMHs interactions, fluctuating in height by only a few Å (2.9 Å RMS height deviation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, the loss of contact with the TMHs alone is insufficient to trigger the conversion of the D2 domain into a compact structure, a conclusion consistent with recent work showing that the TMHs in the thermally trapped PFO prepore are unfolded with significant conformational freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sato et al., 2013</xref>) while cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images of a related cytotoxin, pneumolysin, showed that the D2 domain in this state is in its extended conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tilley et al., 2005</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08421.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Steered MD simulations and energy landscape associated with the membrane-directed descent of the D3 domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The change in height of PFO during extended equilibrium simulations following the removal of the TMHs.

This extended conformation exposes hydrophobic residues in the TMHs to water, and so the membrane contact would generate a bilayer-directed hydrophobic force on the TMHs, driving them toward the membrane interior. Such a hydrophobic force exerted on a water-exposed transmembrane region has been reported in the folding of bacteriorhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kessler et al., 2006</xref>) and implicated in the translocon-mediated membrane integration of transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ismail et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To examine the effect of this bilayer-directed force on the conformation of the protein, we employed steered MD simulations, applying a downward constant force specifically on the TMHs. These calculations reveal that the most significant structural effect of this force is the collapse of the D2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), with the rest of the structure remaining largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). That is, the tensile force on the TMHs is effectively transmitted through the protein to generate a compressive stress across the D2 domain that can catalyze its collapse. During the simulations, after modest initial changes in conformation, the protein structure remained relatively stable owing to the presence of an energy barrier that prevented further conformational changes. Finally, this barrier was overcome, and the height dropped rapidly to a value ∼40 Å lower than its initial height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In this final conformation, the lower portion of the D2 domain is still a β-sheet and lies almost perpendicular on the surface of the D4 domain, pivoting at Lys381. More importantly, the D2 domain remains in this compact conformation even after the force is relieved (for &gt;40 ns) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that this conformation is a relatively stable state. The D2/D4 interface in this conformation covers 842 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kellermayer et al., 1997</xref>) similar to that observed for interfacial contacts in oligomeric proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miller et al., 1987</xref>), and the buried hydrophobic residues (Phe75, Tyr389, Tyr415) in the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) likely contributed to the stability of this compact state. As these residues are highly conserved in the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDC) family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), it is possible that this structure is a common feature of other CDC toxins. For these simulations, the applied force was 250 pN; different forces consistently produced similar results, but the time scale was significantly longer at lower forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Overall this collapsed structure is consistent with the electron-density profile of the pneumolysin pore by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tilley et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>To further understand the energy associated with this transition, extensive adaptive biasing force (ABF) simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chipot and Hénin, 2005</xref>) yielded the energy landscape along the reaction coordinate, the height of the D3 domain. This landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) exhibits a broad minimum at heights associated with the prepore conformation (from −10 to 8 Å) and a local minimum at heights associated with the pore conformation (centered at ∼40 Å), separated by an energy barrier of ∼23 kcal/mol (∼38 <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic>) from the prepore minimum. Thus, the extended structure of the D2 domain is indeed associated with the energetically minimized conformation of PFO. Of note, there is a sharp rise in the energy at ∼25 Å, where the energy increases by ∼17 kcal/mol over a distance of ∼6 Å. Such a barrier height would require a time frame of days to be overcome by thermal fluctuations alone (see 'Materials and methods'), far longer than the observed timescales of the prepore-to-pore transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hotze et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, this is the primary barrier that must be reduced by the force generated by the bilayer-TMHs interaction in order to drive PFO into its pore conformation.</p><p>As the aforementioned steered MD simulations revealed that it is, ultimately, a compressive stress across the D2 domain that is responsible for its collapse, we reasoned that this process could be experimentally probed with compressive forces applied by an AFM probe on individual complexes if the tensile forces owing to the bilayer-TMHs interaction could be prevented. In this regard, a mutant protein, PFO<sup>G57C-S190C</sup>, has been identified that spontaneously assembles into prepore complexes on the membrane like the wild-type protein but does not proceed to the pore state owing to a disulfide bridge that inhibits the restructuring of the TMHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hotze et al., 2001</xref>). When this constraint is removed by adding Dithiothreitol (DTT), this mutant quickly converts into a native-like pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hotze et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, this mutant enables investigation of just the energy barrier of the D2 collapse under compressive forces, without any complicating effects associated with the D3-bilayer interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Steered MD simulations confirmed that under compressive forces mimicking those that would be applied with AFM, the D2 domain of this mutant recapitulates the same collapse as that of the D2 domain under tensile forces applied to the TMHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Indeed, direct application of constant compressive forces with an AFM tip to individual PFO<sup>G57C-S190C</sup> prepore complexes reproducibly induced the characteristic height reduction in the absence of any reducing agent, leaving the general morphology of the complexes otherwise unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and additional images are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). We note that this pore-like structure does not revert back to the prepore conformation upon removing the applied force, indicating that this compact structure is relatively stable, consistent with the MD simulations. We further note that this applied force (110 pN/monomer) is &gt;10-fold smaller than the force required to break a covalent bond over this time period (see 'Materials and methods') (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grandbois et al., 1999</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08421.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Single molecule compression provides a direct measure of the energy landscape of the D2 collapse.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PFO<sup>G57C-S190C</sup> prepore-trapped mutant.

Therefore, we investigated the prepore-to-pore transition in the presence of a detergent (n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside, DDM), since detergent binding to hydrophobic residues in the TMHs should reduce this hydrophobic force on the TMHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Egg phosphatidylcholine (eggPC), cholesterol (chol), and 1,2-bis(10,12-tricosadiynoyl)-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (diynePC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, US). n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) was purchased from Anatrace (Maumee, OH, US). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, US).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>AFM sample preparation and imaging</title><p>The supported membranes containing mutant PFO<sup>G57C-S190C</sup> were formed by sequentially depositing two separately prepared lipid monolayers onto a mica substrate, followed by the injection of the protein into small Teflon wells, as previously detailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</xref>). For the single molecule compressive force experiments, the composition of the first monolayer (facing mica) was eggPC, and the second monolayer was eggPC:chol at 50:50 mol%. For the experiments with the detergent, supported bilayers of a similar composition were dissolved too quickly following the addition of detergent to enable investigation. Instead, for these experiments, the first monolayer was composed of diynePC and the second monolayer was eggPC:chol (50:50 mol%). Following deposition of the diynePC monolayer onto mica, the sample was irradiated with UV light (Bio-Rad) for 10 min to induce cross-linking of the lipids. As is evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the PFO<sup>G57C-S190C</sup> complexes proceed to their pore-like height in the presence of DTT, just as in bilayers where the first monolayer is composed of eggPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</xref>). For all experiments, the final concentration of the protein in the well was ∼15 µg/ml, and the buffer in the well consisted of buffer A (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7). After incubating for 45 min, the sample was extensively washed and then, for the compressive force experiments, imaged in the AFM under buffer A. For the experiments with detergent, the sample was first washed in buffer B (10 mM HEPES, 0.1 M NaCl, 25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.5), then washed and incubated for 5 min in buffer B with DDM (at the concentrations indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), then washed and incubated for 10 min in buffer B with DDM and 2.5 mM DTT, then washed and incubated for 10 min in buffer B with DDM and 2% glutaraldehyde, followed finally by an extensive wash in buffer B, a final incubation in 20 mM glycine, pH 6, and a final wash and imaging in buffer B. The chemical fixation was necessary because stable imaging of the protein complexes directly in the detergent solution was not possible. The histogram data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> was determined from imaging five different regions in each of three different samples at each condition. Imaging was performed in the contact mode with a Nanoscope II AFM (Bruker - Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA, US) using oxide-sharpened ‘twin-tip’ Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> cantilevers with a spring constant of 0.06 N/m. The spring constant was verified by measuring the thermal induced oscillation. The typical scan rate was 9 Hz, and the imaging force was minimized to 0.1 nN. The piezoscanner (14 mm, D scanner, Bruker - Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA, US) was calibrated using a variety of samples including mica and the cholera toxin B subunit. Scanning electron microscopy of the AFM probe (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) was obtained with a JEOL 7800F microscope (Peabody, MA, US).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Single molecule compression with AFM</title><p>Compressive forces have been previously applied with AFM to probe mesoscopic mechanical properties of various biomaterials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kodama et al., 2005</xref>). In our experiments, after obtaining an image of the sample at small applied forces in scan sizes of 300 to –400 nm, the tip was positioned within the center of a given complex by zooming in with progressively smaller scan sizes (generally 2), arriving at a sample location with the complex of interest in the center of a scan size of ∼80 nm. Once one-half of the complex was imaged, we immediately zoomed in on its center, set the scan size to zero, and then applied the larger constant force for a specific duration (1 or 5 s). The force was then immediately reduced to detach the tip from any contact from the sample, the scan size was adjusted to ∼500 nm, and then the tip was re-engaged at smaller forces to obtain an image of the sample to determine whether or not the larger applied force catalyzed the height reduction in the complex. In this way, the applied force was equally distributed on each of the monomers within the complex. No complex was probed more than once. We measured the time between the final zoom-in step and the application of force to be less than 5 s. We measured the extent of lateral drift in our system to be less than 0.03 nm/s, which is similar to published reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">King et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, we expect to not have drifted by more than 0.15 nm from the center of the complex prior to force application. As the complex is 35 nm in diameter, this drift imparts only a slight deviation to an equal force on all subunits. Although wild-type PFO complexes and other CDC toxins form a range of sizes, from incomplete arcs to complete rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sonnen et al., 2014</xref>), these prepore mutant PFO<sup>G57C-S190C</sup> complexes formed almost exclusively complete rings of an identical size. Only the complete rings were studied here. Based on the radial periodicity of the monomers in the complete rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</xref>) and high-resolution images of the rings (data not published), the complete rings contain 36 subunits. Thus, in the text, we referred to the applied force either with respect to the entire complex or to each monomer (dividing the total applied force by 36). As such, the total applied force range used here (1800 pN to –3800 pN) corresponds to 50 pN to –106 pN per monomer, which is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the force needed to break a covalent bond over this time frame (1400 pN to –2000 pN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grandbois et al., 1999</xref>). On average, more than 30 individual measurements were performed at each applied force, resulting in more than 600 individual single molecule measurements obtained from tens of samples and using tens of different AFM cantilevers.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>To obtain a measure of the energy barrier height (<italic>∆G<sub>o</sub></italic>) and the reaction coordinate distance (<italic>x<sub>β</sub></italic>) from the AFM data, we first sought evidence that each of the two datasets (the 1s and 5s data) was individually consistent with a similar single barrier model.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Czajkowsky et al. present a study that combines MD simulations and single-molecule AFM experimental data to analyze Perfringolysin O (PFO) pore-forming protein. The conformational changes responsible for the pre-pore to pore transition were previously known. The authors themselves published an article in 2004 in EMBO journal that uses the same di-sulfide-linked mutant in combination with AFM imaging with or without DTT to observe the shrinking of the pore heights due to pore formation. Here, the new contribution is that compressive AFM is used to induce pore formation. Also, steered MD simulations are performed to complement experiments. Importantly, they are able to obtain the transition probability as a function of force magnitude and duration, allowing them to fit the data to a two state model and deduce the distance to the transition state (and less clearly) the free energy barrier. If indeed this is the first time such analysis has been performed, this would be a significant contribution regardless of the novelty and biological significance of the findings themselves. In the physiological context, the force will be applied between D3 and the membrane, largely driven by hydrophobic force, and the compressive force is proposed to mimic this force, which is reasonable. MD simulations provide molecular accounting and some quantitative comparisons. The experiments were performed in an expert fashion, and the data is highly original and of high quality. Because we are not aware of any prior publication measuring a certain rate as a function of compressive force from a single molecule, this work could be a significant contribution even without important biological insights as long as the authors can address important technical issues raised, including a major concern about the validity of the construct used for the study. In addition, the work presents possible mechanisms underlying the transition from prepare to pore of PFO.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The pore-forming complex used in the AFM studies is a covalently-locked disulfide mutant that known from the authors' previous work not to form pores. They also state the compressive forces applied by the AFM tip are too low to break these disulfide bonds. Based on these two facts, it follows that the mechanism of pore collapse in their AFM experiment must be very different than the natural conformational change in the protein. This undermines their claim that &quot;targeted application of compressive forces can recapitulate a critical step&quot; of the pore-formation. How can they obtain a pore-like conformation in the presence of disulfide bond? There is no evidence presented that shows that a pore-like conformation can be obtained without breaking the disulfide bond between D2 and D3. We suggest that the authors perform MD simulations with the disulfide bond present and present evidence that the force results in pore-like conformations of D2 and D3 even in the presence of disulfide bond.</p><p>2) The authors assume that the compressive force is applied equally to all subunits. But they do not provide any evidence. What if the conformational change occurs efficiently only when the force is applied to primarily one subunit? Is their AFM free of lateral drift enough to be sure that the tip is pushing down in the middle of the pore? What is the AFP tip is not symmetrically shaped? What was the tip radius of the cantilever they used for AFM imaging and compression experiments? If the authors could please provide an SEM image of the cantilever tip so the reader can make a comparison to the pore size, it would improve the manuscript.</p><p>3) The tensile pulling geometry in the MD simulations does not mimic that found in the experiment, where compression is applied to the pore from above. The specific geometry will of course play a major role in determining the mechanical response of the protein pores. Additionally, the lipid membrane is not simulated in the MD trajectories. These dissimilarities between MD and experiment are too large to make any quantitative comparisons between the two results.</p><p>4) Perhaps the biggest issue with the MD simulations is that the authors performed MD simulations using one monomer, not as part of the complex. How does the conformational change in one PFO trigger the pre-pore to pore transition for all the PFOs in the pore complex? This is a major limitation because subunit interactions are likely to be important in determining the force response and conformational changes.</p></body></sub-article> <sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08421.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The pore-forming complex used in the AFM studies is a covalently-locked disulfide mutant that known from the authors' previous work not to form pores.

Based on numerous lines of evidence (Cell 97, 647 (1999), EMBO J 23, 3206 (2004), Cell 121, 247 (2005), Nat Chem Biol 9, 383 (2013)), it has been well established that the significant compaction of the D2 domain is a critical conformational change of pore formation. The unfolding of the TMHs in the D3 domain are not directly coupled structurally to that of the collapse of the D2 domain, thus the mechanism of D2 conversion remained unresolved prior to our work. That is, the objective of our study was to determine how the D2 domain is driven into its compact conformation, not the insertion of the TMHs into the lipid bilayer per se. As the reviewer correctly pointed out, with the disulfide bridge intact, these mutants cannot form transmembrane pores. But this mutant protein enabled testing of the predictions from the MD simulations of the compressive force-catalyzed collapse of the D2 domain without any complicating effects associated with the D3-bilayer interaction. We have now included a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) to further clarify this point. Additional text of explanation is also included in Results and Discussion, third and fifth paragraphs,.</p><p>As suggested, we have now performed MD simulations of a PFO protein with the disulfide bond present under a compressive force mimicking that applied during the AFM experiments. Now included as (new) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, these simulations clearly show that, under compressive forces mimicking those that would be applied with AFM, the D2 domain of this mutant recapitulates the same collapse as that of the D2 domain under tensile forces applied to the TMHs (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1</xref>). Also, the protein maintains this compact structure even after release of the compressive force, similar to the previous simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We have rephrased our previous text and included additional discussion describing these results in Results and Discussion, fifth paragraph, and in the subsection “Steered MD simulations”. We are grateful for this suggestion, as these results further strengthened our main conclusions.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08421.017</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the structures of the D2 domain and the D2/D4 interface, following the application of compressive or tensile forces.</title> <p>Shown are snapshots of the structures 40 ns after the release of the applied force.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08421.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08421.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-08421-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) The authors assume that the compressive force is applied equally to all subunits. But they do not provide any evidence. What if the conformational change occurs efficiently only when the force is applied to primarily one subunit? Is their AFM free of lateral drift enough to be sure that the tip is pushing down in the middle of the pore? What is the AFP tip is not symmetrically shaped? What was the tip radius of the cantilever they used for AFM imaging and compression experiments? If the authors could please provide an SEM image of the cantilever tip so the reader can make a comparison to the pore size, it would improve the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate these comments. Indeed, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility of a slightly unequal distribution of applied forces in some of the measurements. However, the data presented were obtained from tens of samples probed with many batches of tips. As such, the ensemble of such measurements should average out such “outliers”. In fact, overall, the data are well-behaved, suggesting that unequal applications of force did not constitute a significant portion of our data.</p><p>Further, we should have been more explicit about our experimental protocol regarding the effect of lateral drift during the period of force application. With this protocol, the time between the final zoom-in step and the application of force was measured to be less than 5 s. We measured the extent of lateral drift in our system to be less than 0.03 nm per second, which is similar to published reports (Nanolett 9, 1451 (2009)). Thus, at most, we expect a drift of less than 0.3 nm from the center of the complex by the end of the force application. As the complex is ~35 nm in diameter, this drift, clearly, imparts only a slight deviation to an equal force on all subunits. We have now added this information to the Methods section, in the subsection “Single molecule compression with AFM”.</p><p>Finally, as suggested, we have obtained an SEM image of our AFM probes and include this as (new) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. The ultimate probe shape is essentially spherical at the apex and approximately 25 nm in radius, consistent with the manufacturer’s specifications. As this is roughly the same as the diameter of the pore, it is reasonable to assume that the applied force should be more or less equally applied to all subunits within the time frame of each data acquisition. We have now included this information to this figure legend and additional text to the Methods section: “Scanning electron microscopy of the AFM probe (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) was obtained with a JEOL 7800F microscope (Peabody, MA).”</p><p><italic>3) The tensile pulling geometry in the MD simulations does not mimic that found in the experiment, where compression is applied to the pore from above. The specific geometry will of course play a major role in determining the mechanical response of the protein pores. Additionally, the lipid membrane is not simulated in the MD trajectories. These dissimilarities between MD and experiment are too large to make any quantitative comparisons between the two results.</italic> </p><p>As described above, we have now performed MD simulations with compressive forces mimicking those in the AFM experiments, and these show a similar compaction of only the D2 domain, just as with the tensile forces. The reason for performing the tensile force MD simulations was the speculation that the tensile force on the TMHs in the actual pore-forming process generates a compressive force across the D2 domain. As such, the D2 would collapse under a compressive force regardless whether it is generated by the membrane insertion of the TMHs or by the AFM probe pushing the top of the protein. This is indeed the case as shown by the MD simulations. Also, we note that, based on AFM and cryo-EM data (EMBO J 23, 3206 (2004), Cell 121, 247 (2005)), the contact of the protein with the lipid bilayer does not change the structure of the D2 domain from that in the monomer. We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and the newly added MD results further supported our approach.</p><p><italic>4) Perhaps the biggest issue with the MD simulations is that the authors performed MD simulations using one monomer, not as part of the complex. How does the conformational change in one PFO trigger the pre-pore to pore transition for all the PFOs in the pore complex? This is a major limitation because subunit interactions are likely to be important in determining the force response and conformational changes.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that, in principle, it would be optimal to simulate the entire process, from the monomer binding to cholesterol, to oligomerization, to the release of the D3, to the compaction of the D2 domain, and finally to pore formation. But such simulations are clearly beyond our current computational capability. Furthermore, the interface between the subunits is known to involve only the D1 and D3 domains (and not the D2 domain), but the precise details of this interaction are largely not understood, and remain one of the main enigmas in the complete understanding of pore formation for this class of toxins. These limitations notwithstanding, it is well established that the compaction of the D2 domain is a critical step of the pore formation process, which is the central question we wish to answer in this paper: namely, through what mechanism is the D2 domain compacted? Previous work suggested that oligomerization is responsible for the separation of the D3 domain from contact with the D2 domain, leading to the unraveling of the TMHs. Their contact with the lipid bilayer is the driving force leading to the irreversible compaction of the D2 domain. The latter point is provided by the studies presented in this paper, and we are certainly keen to pursue answers to the other questions in future studies.</p></body></sub-article> </article>
