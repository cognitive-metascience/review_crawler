However, the roles of the proposed steps of NL docking, cover-neck bundle (CNB) and asparagine latch (N-latch) formation, during force generation are unclear. Furthermore, the necessity of NL docking for transport of membrane-bound cargo in cells has not been tested. We generated kinesin-1 motors impaired in CNB and/or N-latch formation based on molecular dynamics simulations. The mutant motors displayed reduced force output and inability to stall in optical trap assays but exhibited increased speeds, run lengths, and landing rates under unloaded conditions. NL docking thus enhances force production but at a cost to speed and processivity. In cells, teams of mutant motors were hindered in their ability to drive transport of Golgi elements (high-load cargo) but not peroxisomes (low-load cargo). These results demonstrate that the NL serves as a mechanical element for kinesin-1 transport under physiological conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>kinesin</kwd><kwd>force</kwd><kwd>molecular motor</kwd><kwd>neck linker</kwd><kwd>cover-neck bundle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM070862</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Barry J</given-names></name><name><surname>Verhey</surname><given-names>Kristen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1330792</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lang</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Qatar Leadership Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jariwala</surname><given-names>Shashank</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1256260</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Budaitis</surname><given-names>Breane G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1445197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reinemann</surname><given-names>Dana N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007315</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Budaitis</surname><given-names>Breane G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Force generation by kinesin motor proteins requires formation of both a 2-stranded cover-neck bundle and an asparagine-based latch for transport of membrane-bound cargoes in cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kinesin motor proteins are responsible for orchestrating fundamental microtubule-based processes including cell division, intracellular trafficking, cytoskeletal organization, and cilia function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Verhey and Hammond, 2009</xref>). All kinesins contain a highly-conserved motor domain with signature sequences for nucleotide and microtubule binding. How nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in the catalytic site result in a mechanical output that drives cargo transport has been a fundamental question in the field.</p><p>The two motor domains in most dimeric kinesin motors are linked via a flexible 12–18 amino acid sequence called the neck linker (NL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hariharan and Hancock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kozielski et al., 1997</xref>). The NL has been suggested to serve as a structural element critical for both directed motility and force generation of kinesin motors. For kinesin-1, the founding member of the kinesin superfamily, structural and spectroscopic studies have shown that conformational changes in the NL are coupled to the nucleotide state of the motor domain. Specifically, the NL undergoes a transformation from being flexible in both the ADP-bound and nucleotide-free states to being docked along the core motor domain in the ATP-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rice et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosenfeld et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sindelar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Skiniotis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asenjo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sindelar and Downing, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shang et al., 2014</xref>). NL docking of the leading motor domain positions the lagging motor domain forward along the microtubule track, thereby specifying the direction of motility. NL docking also coordinates the alternating ATPase cycles of the two motor domains to ensure processive stepping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Case et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tomishige and Vale, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hahlen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yildiz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clancy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dogan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Isojima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).

ATP-induced NL docking involves distinct interactions of the two β-strands that comprise the NL, β9 and β10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). The first half of the NL, β9, pairs with another β-strand, the coverstrand (CS or β0), located at the opposite end of the core motor domain. The zippering of β9 of the NL with β0 of the CS forms a 2-stranded β-sheet, termed the cover-neck bundle (CNB), to provide the power-stroke for force generation by kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hwang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khalil et al., 2008</xref>). Support for the CNB as a mechanical element comes from optical trap assays where point mutations in the CS designed to hinder β-strand formation, or deletion of the entire CS, in the fly kinesin-1 motor significantly reduced the motor’s ability to withstand load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khalil et al., 2008</xref>). CNB formation may be a critical element for force generation across the kinesin superfamily as recent work has shown that the coverstrand (CS or β0) and NL (β9) of members of the kinesin-5 and kinesin-6 families engage in CNB formation in response to ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atherton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hesse et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44146.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MD simulations identify key interactions between the kinesin-1 NL and motor domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Surface representation of the kinesin-1 (<italic>Rn</italic>KIF5C) motor domain in the nucleotide-free (apo) state (top, PDB 4LNU) or ATP-bound, post-power stroke state (bottom, PDB 4HNA).

In particular, an asparagine residue between β9 and β10 begins the process of docking β10 of the NL onto β7 of the motor core. This asparagine residue (N334) is predicted to serve as a latch (the N-latch) to hold the docked NL along the core motor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hwang et al., 2008</xref>) but its role in force generation has not been directly tested. The N-latch residue is conserved in most kinesins, particularly motors known to processively step along microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that N-latch formation may also be a conserved feature of kinesin force generation.</p><p>Whether CNB and/or N-latch formation are critical for multiple kinesin motors to drive transport of membrane-bound cargo under physiological conditions is not known. To address this, we combined molecular dynamics simulations, in vitro single-molecule assays, and cell-based transport assays to delineate how NL docking influences kinesin-1 motors cooperating in teams to transport membrane-bound cargoes in cells. We found that mutations that disrupt CNB formation and/or N-latch formation severely reduced the ability of single kinesin-1 motors to successfully transport against load in an optical trap. Strikingly, single mutant motors traveled faster and for longer distances under unloaded conditions as compared to wild type (WT) motors. These results indicate that mutations to the CS and N-latch of kinesin-1 can enhance processivity and velocity but at a cost to force production. Mutant motors with impaired CNB formation or N-latch formation are able to cooperate to transport low-load cargo in cells. However, the mutant motors are unable to effectively cooperate to transport high-load cargo in cells. Overall, these findings suggest that CNB and N-latch formation are required for transport of high-load cargoes in cells, even when kinesin-1 motors work collectively as a team.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations highlight residues critical for ATP-dependent NL docking</title><p>To test whether CNB and/or N-latch formation serve as mechanical elements for kinesin-1 force generation, we sought to identify critical interactions between the CS (β0, aa 4–9), motor core (β1-α6, aa 10–326), and NL (β9-β10, aa 327–338) that we could target for mutagenesis. We performed 100 ns all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the rat kinesin-1 (<italic>Rn</italic>KIF5C) motor domain in association with tubulin. Four replicate simulations were carried out for motors in the nucleotide-free (apo) state (PDB 4LNU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2014</xref>]) and the ATP-bound state (PDB 4HNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>]), similar to previous analyses of kinesin-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muretta et al., 2018</xref>).

In the apo state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2014</xref>), the NL is flexible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> top) and forms few interactions with the motor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) while the CS interacts with residues in α4 and in Loop13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, red boxes marked CS-α4 and CS-L13). Specifically, the C-terminal residue (CTR) of the CS (I9) points down into a hydrophobic pocket called the docking pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sindelar, 2011</xref>) where it contacts residues I266, L269, and A270 of α4 and the remaining residues of the CS contact Loop13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

For the N-terminal half of the NL, β9 forms contacts with the CS to form the cover-neck bundle (CNB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, blue box marked NL-CS) as well as contacts with α4 and Loop13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, blue boxes marked NL-α4 and NL-L13). These contacts are made possible by the ATP-dependent formation of an extra turn at the end of α6, the NL initiation sequence (NIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nitta et al., 2008</xref>]), that positions β9 for insertion between the CS and α4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sindelar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lang and Hwang, 2010</xref>]).

First, the CTR of the CS (I9) occupies the docking pocket bordered by α6, α4, and L13 in the nucleotide-free state such that the NL remains undocked and flexible. Second, I327 of the NIS occupies this pocket in the ATP-bound state and begins the process of NL docking along the core motor domain. We note that the presence of an isoleucine or valine as the CTR and NIS residues is a conserved feature of most kinesin motors that undergo processive motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This conservation suggests that the ability of these residues to occupy the docking pocket in a mutually exclusive manner may be a conserved mechanism for kinesin motility and force generation. Third, residue N334 interacts with both α1 and β7 to position the NL along the core motor domain, thereby specifying the direction of motion. As noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hwang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khalil et al., 2008</xref>), an asparagine residue between β9 and β10 is a conserved feature of many kinesin motors with an N-terminal motor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> asterisk, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CNB and N-latch mutations severely cripple single kinesin-1 motor stepping under load</title><p>To delineate the importance of CNB formation and N-latch formation for force generation and transport by kinesin-1 motors, we generated mutations that would weaken the CNB, N-latch, or both.

As a control, we carried out the same analysis for a known superprocessive motor, the kinesin-3 motor KIF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Soppina et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For the CNB+Latch mutant motors, the distance moved during a gap was ~1 pixel less than the distance expected for a motor undergoing constant motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), whereas for KIF1A motors, the distance moved during a gap was nearly identical to the distance expected for a motor undergoing constant velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These data are consistent with the idea that the gaps in the kymographs are due to CNB+Latch mutant motors undergoing detachment and reattachment events rather than constant motility. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the gaps in the kymographs are due to blinking of the fluorescent markers used to track CNB+Latch motors given that i) the distances moved during the gaps are at the limit of resolution of our microscope system and ii) the fluorescent markers may behave differently when attached to the CNB+Latch mutant motor vs the KIF1A motor. Regardless of whether the gaps in the kymographs are due to reattachment events that string together multiple runs or due to blinking behavior during superprocessive runs, the single-molecule motility data highlight the differences in motor behavior under unloaded and loaded conditions. For kinesin-1 motors, mutations that result in weakened CNB and/or N-latch formation lead to a decreased detachment from the microtubule track (increased run length) under unloaded single-molecule conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) but a more rapid detachment from the microtubule when subjected to a load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>MD simulations predict that modulating CNB and N-latch formation enhances microtubule binding and catalytic site closure</title><p>We hypothesized that the enhanced motility properties of the mutant motors under unloaded conditions are due to allosteric effects of mutations designed to hinder NL docking on the nucleotide and microtubule binding regions of the motor domain.

The structures of seventeen motor domains from five different kinesins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) were subjected to interconformer analysis with PCA. The CS and NL regions were excluded from the analysis due to their absence from most ADP-bound structures. PCA analysis revealed that the first two dimensions account for over 80% of the variance in atomic positional displacements of the microtubule-binding surface between these states (PC1 79.66%, PC2 4.95%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, PC1 and PC2 provide a suitable conformational space to describe the structural dynamics of kinesin motor domains transitioning from an ADP-bound, microtubule-free state to an ATP-bound, microtubule-bound state. The major conformational difference between these states can be described by PC1 which involves a displacement of α4, where α4 is in a ‘down’ orientation in the ADP-like, microtubule-free structures and in an ‘up’ orientation in the ATP-like, microtubule-bound structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scarabelli and Grant, 2013</xref>).</p><p>We then used the PCA conformational space to compare how often the WT and CNB+Latch motor domains could adopt the ATP-bound, microtubule-bound state from the ADP-bound, microtubule-free state. MD simulations of WT and CNB+Latch mutant motors were done in replicate for a total of 1 µs each. The conformations sampled by each motor were then projected onto the PCA map. Starting from the PDB 2KIN structure which partially adopts an ATP-like conformation (docked NL but weak microtubule binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sack et al., 1997</xref>]), the WT motor sampled a conformational space between the ADP-bound, microtubule-free and the ATP-bound, microtubule-bound states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, blue topographic lines). Starting from the same 2KIN structure, the CNB+Latch mutant sampled an additional conformational space closer to that defined by the ATP-bound, microtubule-bound kinesin structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, red topographic lines). Overall, this suggests that the CNB+Latch mutant has a higher degree of structural flexibility in its microtubule-binding regions as compared to the WT motor domain. This structural flexibility would enable the motor to more readily adopt a conformation compatible with strong microtubule binding in response to ATP in the nucleotide pocket and could account for the enhanced microtubule-landing rate and processivity observed in single-molecule assays.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>CNB and N-latch mutations do not affect the ability of teams of kinesin-1 motors to transport low-load cargo (peroxisomes) in cells</title><p>Having defined the force generating properties of individual CNB, Latch, and CNB+Latch mutant motors, we sought to test whether the integrity of CNB formation followed by NL latching is a critical determinant for kinesin motors working in teams to drive cargo transport in cells.

Before addition of rapamycin, both peroxisomes and Golgi were clustered in middle of cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Thirty minutes after addition of rapamycin and recruitment of teams of KIF18A motors, peroxisomes were dispersed to the periphery of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>, qualitatively 91% of cells have dispersed peroxisomes, quantitatively 80% of peroxisome intensity at the cell periphery).

Before addition of rapamycin, the Golgi was clustered near the nucleus of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, qualitatively 85% of cells have clustered Golgi; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, quantitatively 83% of Golgi intensity near the nucleus). 30 min after addition of rapamycin and recruitment of teams of WT kinesin-1 motors to the Golgi surface, Golgi elements were efficiently dispersed to the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, qualitatively 82% of cells have dispersed Golgi; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, 50% of Golgi intensity at the cell periphery). However, hindering either CNB or N-latch formation resulted in motors that were crippled in their ability to cooperate in teams to transport Golgi elements to the cell periphery. Thirty minutes after addition of rapamycin and recruitment of teams of CNB or Latch mutants, a significant fraction of Golgi elements remained clustered in the perinuclear region rather than accumulated at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B,C,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, qualitatively only 64% of cells have dispersed Golgi for CNB and 42% for Latch mutant; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, quantitatively only 34% of Golgi intensity at the cell periphery for CNB and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, only 35% for Latch mutant).</p><p>In this cellular assay, the effects of the CNB and N-latch mutations were additive as teams of CNB+Latch mutants were even more crippled in their capacity to cooperate and transport Golgi elements than the CNB and Latch mutant motors.

Statistical analysis indicates that there is significant impairment of Golgi dispersion to the cell periphery after recruitment of mutant motors compared to WT motors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>).</p><p>To verify that the inability of the CNB, Latch, and CNB+Latch mutant motors to drive Golgi dispersion was due to the increased load imposed by this cargo, we repeated the assay in cells where the contribution of cytoplasmic dynein to Golgi clustering was reduced. To do this, we overexpressed a truncated dynein intermediate chain 2 (IC2-N237) that acts in a dominant negative (DN) manner to block endogenous dynein function and causes partial dispersion of the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">King et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blasius et al., 2013</xref>). In cells overexpressing the dynein DN, transport of Golgi elements by teams of KIF18A motors was enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B,D</xref>; qualitatively 54% of cells have dispersed Golgi; quantitatively 37% of Golgi intensity at the cell periphery). These results indicate that cytoplasmic dynein contributes to the forces that teams of recruited kinesin motors must overcome to transport Golgi elements to the cell periphery.

Here we use molecular dynamics simulations, optical trapping, and single-molecule assays to show that both CNB and N-latch formation are critical for single kinesin-1 motors to transport against force. Weakening of either CNB or N-latch formation results in motors that do not stall under load and detach at low forces. Under unloaded conditions, mutant motors display improved motility properties due to allosteric effects of NL docking on the microtubule and nucleotide binding regions of the motor. We also use cellular assays to examine the contribution of CNB and N-Latch formation to the ability of motors to work in teams for transport of membrane-bound organelles. We find that both CNB formation and NL latching are critical for kinesin-1 motors to transport a high-load cargo in cells, even when the motors are working in teams.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Impact of CNB and N-latch formation on kinesin-1 force generation</title><p>We used MD simulations to prioritize contacts whose mutation would weaken CNB formation (interaction of β9 with CS) and/or NL latching (interaction of N-latch and β10 with β7). Importantly, the ability of the CNB and/or Latch mutant motors to undergo processive motility was not impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), indicating that the mutations are tolerated by the motor when stepping under no load. Measurements of individual motors in an optical trap demonstrate that disruption of either CNB or N-latch formation resulted in motors unable to stall under load and more likely to detach when subjected to low forces (average detachment force ~1 pN, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The effects of the CNB and N-latch mutations were not additive as weakening of both elements in the CNB+Latch mutant resulted in motors with similar behavior under load and similar detachment forces as the CNB and Latch mutant motors.</p><p>These results support the model that the CS plays a critical mechanical role in the force generation of kinesin-1 motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rice et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hwang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khalil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hesse et al., 2013</xref>). It is interesting that mutation of the two CS residues (A5 and S8) in our rat kinesin-1 motor resulted in an average detachment force of ~1 pN whereas previous work demonstrated that mutation of the same CS residues in the fly kinesin-1 motor resulted in an average detachment force of ~3 pN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khalil et al., 2008</xref>). An intriguing possibility is that the additional residues at the N-terminus of the fly kinesin-1 motor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) can engage in additional interactions with the core motor domain and thereby partially compensate for the mutations during CNB formation.</p><p>Our results provide the first experimental demonstration of the contribution of N-latch formation to kinesin-1 force generation. A role for N-latch formation was previously implicated in MD simulations of forced breakage of the N-latch which resulted in complete undocking of the NL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hwang et al., 2008</xref>). Experimentally, a previous study mutated the N-latch of human kinesin-1 KIF5B (N332A) and found that force generation was crippled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rice et al., 2003</xref>), however, the contribution of the N-latch in this study was examined in the context of i) mutation of the proceeding residue (V331A) predicted to be important for CNB formation, and ii) a cysteine-light kinesin-1 motor domain whose force dependence is dampened compared to WT kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreasson et al., 2015</xref>). Our results indicate that without N-latch formation, single kinesin-1 motors can generate a power stroke via CNB formation but cannot sustain force generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). At present, it is unclear whether an impaired N-latch disrupts force production due to dissociation of the CNB, as predicted in the simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khalil et al., 2008</xref>), and/or due to an inability to coordinate processive stepping and the out-of-phase mechanochemical cycles of a dimeric kinesin-1 motor.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Allosteric effects of CNB and N-latch mutations on unloaded motility</title><p>Although mutant motors with weakened NL docking underwent premature detachment under loaded conditions, they exhibited enhanced motility properties under unloaded conditions. Specifically, the CNB, Latch, and CNB+Latch mutant motors displayed enhanced velocity in single-molecule motility assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), similar to previous results with the CS mutant version of fly kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khalil et al., 2008</xref>). The enhanced velocity is likely due to allosteric effects of NL docking on core motor regions that coordinate and bind nucleotide (α0, S1, S2, PL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and could result in enhanced catalytic site closure that would favor ATP hydrolysis in the mutant motors. Our findings are consistent with previous structural and enzymatic studies suggesting that NL docking allosterically gates ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hahlen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings are also consistent with previous time-resolved (TR)<sup>2</sup>FRET studies of kinesin-1 and kinesin-5 motors demonstrating that NL docking is allosterically coupled to active site closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muretta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muretta et al., 2015</xref>). Collectively, these results highlight how subtle changes in NL docking elements (CS, β9, N-latch/β10) can act as a molecular gearshift, where speed and processivity comes at the cost of robust force production.</p><p>The CNB, Latch, and CNB+Latch mutant motors also displayed longer runs and an increased landing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These results indicate that NL docking also has allosteric effects on the microtubule-binding surface of kinesin-1. PCA analysis demonstrated that the major structural difference between motors in the ADP-bound and microtubule-free state and motors in the ATP-bound and microtubule-bound state is the positioning of α4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). MD simulations of CNB+Latch mutant motors indicated an increased ability of this motor’s microtubule-binding surface to sample a conformation compatible with strong microtubule binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, α4 up). We suggest that these allosteric changes can account for the mutant motors’ enhanced run lengths and ability to enter or re-enter a processive run.</p><p>That weakening of CNB and N-latch formation resulted in increased detachment under loaded conditions but reduced detachment under unloaded conditions is intriguing and further work is required to understand the mechanistic basis. These results highlight the benefits of a simulation-guided approach to weaken single contact points between the NL and the core motor domain in a manner that can reveal mechanical features of the motor under load yet can be tolerated by the motor when stepping under no load. In the future, this approach can be utilized to examine how sequence changes in CS and NL elements across the kinesin superfamily impact the force generation and motility properties of these motors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Physiological relevance of NL docking and implications for multi-motor transport in cells</title><p>Our results suggest that both CNB formation and NL latching are essential for teams of kinesin-1 motors to collectively transport high-load, but not low-load, membrane-bound cargoes in cells. Teams of CNB and/or N-latch mutant motors were impaired in their ability to transport Golgi elements to the cell periphery as compared to WT kinesin-1 motors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) but were able to transport peroxisomes to the cell periphery in a manner indistinguishable from the WT motor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Notably, this is the first evidence that a power stroke mechanism and force generation are critical for multi-motor driven transport under physiological conditions. Further support for the conclusion that force generation by individual kinesin-1 motors within a team is required for transport of high-load cargoes in cells comes from two additional findings. First, the kinesin-8 motor KIF18A, which generates only 1 pN of force individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jannasch et al., 2013</xref>), is able to cooperate to drive peroxisome motility but is unable to drive Golgi dispersion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, single-headed kinesin motors that weakly engage with the microtubule track as individual motors can cooperate to drive peroxisome motility but are largely unable to drive Golgi dispersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schimert et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that motility properties other than a power stroke-like mechanism can contribute to collective motility and cargo transport but only under low-load conditions.</p><p>Interestingly, the CNB, Latch, and CNB+Latch mutant motors differ in their ability to work collectively to drive dispersion of a high-load cargo. Teams of CNB+Latch mutant motors were more impaired in their ability to drive Golgi dispersion as compared to the CNB and N-Latch mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This result was surprising as we observed similar properties under load for the CNB, Latch, and CNB+Latch mutants as single motors in optical trap assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These results highlight the limitations of extrapolating single-molecule properties to understand motor behavior in teams and/or in a cellular environment. The most likely explanation for why the CNB+Latch mutant is more impaired in Golgi dispersion relates to differences in the assays themselves. The optical trap assay measures the behavior of single motors whereas the cargo dispersion assays report on the cooperative activity of teams of motors. In addition, in the optical trap assay, motors are statically attached to a bead whereas in the cellular assays, motors can freely diffuse in the lipid environment of the membrane-bound organelle.</p><p>In multi-motor assays, the motility of individual motors can be facilitated or hindered by other motors in the complex. For example, motors at the leading edge of a membrane-bound vesicle are predicted to shoulder most of the load during transport, and can generate assisting forces that promote the stepping of motors at the trailing edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leduc et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nelson et al., 2014</xref>). For kinesin-1, assisting loads as small as 1.5 pN could restore forward stepping and processive motion of a severely crippled kinesin-1 motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khalil et al., 2008</xref>). It may be that the CNB and Latch mutants are more amenable to assisting forces in the Golgi dispersion assay than the CNB+Latch mutant motors. Other parameters that have been noted to influence the ability of motors to work in teams are the load-dependent detachment of the motor from the microtubule track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arpağ et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Norris et al., 2014</xref>) and the ability to rebind to the microtubule after detachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feng et al., 2018</xref>). These parameters seem less likely to explain the differences between the CNB, Latch, and CNB+Latch mutant motors in Golgi dispersion as all of the mutant motors readily detached from the microtubule as single motors under load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and displayed an enhanced microtubule landing rates under unloaded conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Although our findings provide strong support for the hypothesis that CNB formation, as the mechanical element for kinesin force production, is required for high-load cargo transport in cells, it is possible that the differences observed between the peroxisome and Golgi dispersion assays are due to experimental conditions rather than motor force generation. While experimental conditions such as kinesin expression level and the effectiveness of motor recruitment have minimal influence on peroxisome dispersion in these assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kapitein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Efremov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schimert et al., 2019</xref>), it is possible that differences in size and/or local microenvironment fluidity result in cargo-specific steric effects and/or drag forces that impact transport driven by the exogenous motors. Further work with reconstitution systems are required to examine these possibilities.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications for CNB formation and NL docking in other kinesins</title><p>The motor domain is highly conserved in both sequence and structure across the kinesin superfamily and many chemical and mechanical features are likely to be shared across all members.

Whether N-latch formation and docking of β10 along the core motor domain play important roles beyond kinesin-1 remain to be investigated. The asparagine residue involved in N-latch formation is highly conserved across processive kinesins with the exception of kinesin-6 family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and recent work failed to resolve a docked NL conformation for the kinesin-6 motor MKLP2 (human KIF20A) even in the ATP- and microtubule-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atherton et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of ATP, formation of the CNB is prevented by occupancy of the docking pocket by the hydrophobic CTR (I9 in kinesin-1 KIF5C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sindelar and Downing, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nitta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sindelar, 2011</xref>]).

As an isoleucine or valine residue is found in the CTR and NIS positions across a large number of kinesin sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), mutually exclusive access of the CTR and the NIS to the docking cleft may be a shared feature for N-kinesins that generate force and processive motility.

Before assembly, etched coverslips were incubated in a solution of 100 µL poly-l-lysine (PLL, Sigma P8920) in 30 mL ethanol for 15 min. The coverslip was then dried with a filtered air line. After flow cell assembly, microtubules were diluted 150 times from the stock in a solution of PemTax (1 µL 10 mM Taxol in 500 µL P12). The diluted microtubules were added to the flow cell and allowed to incubate to the PLL surface for 10 min. Unbound microtubules were then washed out with 20 µL PemTax. A solution of casein (Blotting-Grade Blocker, Biorad 1706404) diluted in PemTax (1:8 mixture) was then added to the flow cell and allowed to incubate for 10 min to block the remainder of the surface to prevent non-specific binding. After the incubation, the flow cell was washed with 50 µL PemTax and 80 µL assay buffer (AB). 20 µL of the bead/motor incubation was then added to the flow cell.</p><p>Optical trapping measurements were obtained using a custom-built instrument with separate trapping and detection systems. The instrument setup and calibration procedures have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khalil et al., 2008</xref>). Briefly, beads were trapped with a 1,064 nm laser that was coupled to an inverted microscope with a 100x/1.3 NA oil-immersion objective. Bead displacements from the trap center were recorded at 3 kHz and further antialias filtered at 1.5 kHz. To ensure that we were at the single molecule limit for the motility assay, the protein-bead ratio was adjusted so that fewer than half of the beads trapped and tested on microtubules showed binding, actually having 5–10% binding the majority of the time. A motor-coated bead was trapped in solution and subjected to position calibration and trap stiffness Labview routines. Afterward, the bead was brought close to a surface-bound microtubule to allow for binding. Bead position displacement and force generation were measured for single motor-bound beads. Detachment forces are plotted as a dot plot where each dot indicates the maximum detachment force of an event and the mean for each construct is indicated by a black horizontal line. Statistical differences between the maximum detachment force of wild type and mutant motors were calculated by using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Single-molecule motility assays</title><p>Microtubules were polymerized (purified tubulin unlabeled and HiLyte-647-labeled tubulin, Cytoskeleton Inc) in BRB80 buffer (80 mM Pipes/KOH pH 6.8, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA) supplemented with GTP and MgCl<sub>2</sub> and incubated for 60 min at 37<sup>o</sup> C. 2 mM taxol in prewarmed BRB80 was added and incubated for 60 min to stabilize microtubules. Microtubules were stored in the dark at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. Flow cells were prepared by attaching a #1.5 mm<sup>2</sup> coverslip (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to a glass slide (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using double-sided tape. Microtubules were diluted in fresh BRB80 buffer supplemented with 10 μM taxol, infused into flow cells, and incubated for four minutes to allow for nonspecific absorption to the glass. Flow cells were then incubated with blocking buffer [30 mg/mL casein in P12 buffer (12 mM Pipes/KOH pH 6.8, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA) supplemented with 10 μM taxol] for four minutes. Flow cells were then infused with motility mixture (0.5–1.0 μL of COS7 cell lysate, 25 μL P12 buffer, 15 μL blocking buffer, 1 mM ATP, 0.5 μL 100 mM DTT, 0.5 μL, 0.5 μL 20 mg/mL glucose oxidase, 0.5 μL 8 mg/mL catalase, and 0.5 μL 1 M glucose), sealed with molten paraffin wax, and imaged on an inverted Nikon Ti-E/B total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope. with a perfect focus system, a 100 × 1.49 NA oil immersion TIRF objective, three 20 mW diode lasers (488 nm, 561 nm, and 640 nm) and EMCCD camera (iXon<sup>+</sup> DU879; Andor). Image acquisition was controlled using Nikon Elements software and all assays were performed at room temperature.</p><p>Motility data were analyzed by first generating maximum intensity projections to identify microtubule tracks (width = 3 pixels) and then generating kymographs in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Only motility events that lasted for at least three frames were analyzed. Furthermore, events that ended as a result of a motor reaching the end of a microtubule were included; therefore, the reported run lengths for highly processive motors are likely to be an underestimation. For the Latch and CNB+Latch motors, the run lengths are reported as the distance moved between gaps in the runs. Run length and velocities were plotted as cumulative distributions in MATLAB and used for statistical analysis. The cumulative distributions of motor velocities were fit to a Gaussian cumulative distribution as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arpağ et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Norris et al., 2014</xref>) and a one-way analysis of variance test was used to assess whether velocity distributions were significantly different between motors. The cumulative distribution of WT motor run lengths was fit to an exponential distribution as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Norris et al., 2014</xref>). However, a fit to an exponential decay function was not an appropriate model to describe the cumulative distributions of the CNB, Latch, and CNB+Latch motor run lengths. Rather, the cumulative distributions of the run lengths of the mutant motors were well fit to a gamma distribution. The scale parameter was fixed (assuming a rate of 1 or 2) and the shape parameter was the only fit parameter. The expected mean run length was calculated by multiplying the shape and scale parameters. A Kuskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance was used to assess whether run length distributions were significantly different between motors. For each motor construct, the velocities and run lengths were binned and a histogram was generated by plotting the number of motility events for each bin. A corresponding Gaussian, exponential, or gamma distribution was overlaid on each histogram plot using rate and shape parameters derived from fitting the cumulative distributions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>Simulation models of rat kinesin-1 (<italic>Rn</italic>KIF5C) motor domain in complex with tubulin heterodimer were constructed for motors in the no nucleotide (apo) and ATP-bound states based on PDB 4LNU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2014</xref>) and PDB 4HNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gigant et al., 2013</xref>), respectively.

Histidine protonation states were assigned based on the their pKa values calculated by PROPKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bas et al., 2008</xref>). Starting structures were solvated in a cubic box of pre-equilibrated TIP3P waters molecules, extending 12 Å in each dimension from the surface of the solute. Sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) were added to neutralize the systems, followed by addition of sodium and chloride (Cl⁻) ions to bring the ionic strength to 0.050 M. Energy minimization was performed in four stages, with each stage consisting of 500 steps of steepest descent followed by 4000 steps of conjugate gradient. First, minimization of solvent was performed by keeping positions of protein and nucleotides fixed. Second, side-chains and nucleotides were relaxed keeping the backbone positions fixed. Third, protein and nucleotide atoms were relaxed while keeping the solvent atoms fixed. Fourth, a last minimization stage was performed with no restraints. The system was gradually heated to 300K over 25 ps of simulation time in constant-volume (NVT) and periodic boundary conditions (PBC), with restraint of 20 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup> on backbone atoms. Constant-temperature (T = 300K) and constant-pressure (p=1 bar) (NpT) equilibration was then performed in six stages. First, a 400 ps NpT equilibration was performed with restraint of 20 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup> on backbone atoms. Further stages involved gradually reducing restraints of 20, 10, 5, and one kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup> on α carbons over five ns each. A final NpT equilibration was carried out without any restraints for five ns. Subsequent production phase molecular dynamics simulations were then performed under NpT and PBC with random velocity assignments for each run. Particle-mesh Ewald summation was adopted for treating long-range electrostatics. A 12 Å cutoff for energy minimization, and a 10 Å cutoff for molecular dynamics simulations was used to truncate non-bonded interactions. A two fs time-step was adopted for all molecular dynamics simulations. Hydrogen atoms were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm. All simulations were performed in-house on NVIDIA GPU cards with the GPU version of PMEMD (pmemd.cuda).

Briefly, PCA involves diagonalization of the covariance matrix <italic>C</italic>, whose elements <italic>Cij</italic> are calculated from the Cartesian coordinates of Cα atoms, <italic>r</italic>, after superposition:<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="⟩" open="⟨" separators="|"><mml:mrow> <mml:mi/><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="⟩" open="⟨" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="⟩" open="⟨" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced> <mml:mi/></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> represent all pairs of 3N coordinates. The eigenvectors, or principal components (PCs), of the covariance matrix form a linear basis set of the distribution of structures. The variance of the distribution along each eigenvector is given by the corresponding eigenvalue. Projecting structures onto a sub-space defined by principal components with the largest variance (largest eigenvalues) provides a lower dimensional representation of the structure dataset.</p><p>PCA was performed on 112 equivalent, non-gap Cα atoms from each of the structures after superposition onto an invariant core comprising of structural elements β1, β2, β3, P-loop, α2, β6, β7 and α6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scarabelli and Grant, 2013</xref>). The trajectories from MD simulations of ADP-bound wildtype and CNB+Latch mutant kinesin motor domains were projected on to the PC sub-space defined by the first two PCA eigenvectors to allow comparison of the conformational space spanned by the simulations and the experimental structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Inducible cargo dispersion assays</title><p>Plasmids for expression of wild type or mutant Kif5C(560) motors tagged with monomeric NeonGreen and an FRB domain were cotransfected into COS-7 cells with a plasmid for expression of PEX3-mRFP-FKBP or GMAP210p-mRFP-2xFKBP at a ratio of 6:1 and 3:1 respectively with TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus). Eight hours after transfection, rapamycin (Calbiochem, Millipore Sigma) was added to final concentration of 44 nM to promote FRB and FKBP heterodimerization and recruitment of motor the peroxisome or Golgi surface. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 1X PBS, quenched in 50 mM ammonium chloride in PBS for 5 min, permeabilized for 5 min in 0.2% Triton-X 100 in PBS for 5 min and blocked in 0.2% fish skin gelatin in PBS for 5 min. Primary and secondary antibodies were added to blocking buffer and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Primary antibodies: polyclonal antibody against cis-Golgi marker giantin (1:1200 PRB-114C, Covance), antibody against β-tubulin (1:2000, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank #E7). Secondary antibodies: goat anti-rabbit Alexa680-labeled secondary antibody (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Coverslips were mounted in ProlongGold (Invitrogen) and imaged using an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Nikon TE2000E) with a 40 × 0.75 NA objective and a CoolSnapHQ camera (Photometrics). Only cells expressing low levels of motor-mNG-FRB were imaged and included in quantification, as high expression of mutant KIF5C disrupted the microtubule network. Cargo localization before and after motor recruitment was quantified using two different methods. First, the phenotype of cargo dispersion was scored as clustered, partial dispersion, diffuse, or peripheral dispersion based on the signal localization in the PEX3 (peroxisome) or giantin (Golgi) signal. Second, a distance-based analysis using a custom ImageJ plugin was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, manuscript in preparation). Statistical differences between mean cargo intensity at each binned distance between wild type and mutant motors were calculated by using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge Will Hancock for supplying purified KIF5C(1-560).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Neck linker docking is critical for Kinesin-1 force generation in cells but at a cost to motor speed and processivity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ahmet Yildiz (Reviewer #2); William O Hancock (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors use a variety of complementary methods (molecular dynamics simulations, single-molecule in vitro assays and cellular organelle redistribution assays) to investigate the role of the neck linker and cover strand docking in kinesin transport and force generation. They carry out an in-depth computational/structural investigation of the residues in the neck linker, N-term, and catalytic core that come together to dock the cover-neck bundle (CNB) during the kinesin force-generating step. The Lang and Hwang labs have looked into this previously, both through MD simulations and optical trapping experiments, but this work goes beyond that published work. The single-molecule trapping and TIRF data show clearly that mutations in the N-latch and CNB a) decrease force generation capabilities due to premature detachment of the motor, b) increase motor speed and processivity, and c) increase the motor landing rate. The authors also show that the mutant motors are able to redistribute small peroxisomes, whereas they are not able to redistribute the large Golgi. This cellular data is interpreted to be in agreement with the single-molecule results, nicely wrapping up the study. In summary, this manuscript is very interesting, well presented and overall the quality of the data is high. The study is in principle suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, provided the authors can address the following concerns.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The classification of peroxisomes and Golgi as low-load and high-load cargos does not appear to be fully justified. It is based on two earlier in vivo trapping studies showing that 2-15 pN force is needed to stall peroxisomes whereas much larger forces are needed for Golgi. While this can be true, there may be many other reasons why mutant proteins can transport peroxisomes but not Golgi to its destination. It is not known how many motors are bound per cargo, or how much force is being produced by these motors per cargo. Therefore, some of the differences they observed might be due to the differences in expression levels, or effectiveness in motor recruitment to a cargo. The sizes of these cargos are different from each other, which might result in different steric effects and drag forces in cytoplasm. In addition, there can be other kinesins engaged in transporting the cargo in the same direction and dynein that transport these cargos towards the opposite direction. These uncertainties should be kept in mind when drawing conclusions, making sure that results are presented separately from interpretations. Editorial revisions are expected to be sufficient to address this point.</p><p>2) In this context: Overexpression of dynein DN is done for kinesin-18, but not for the mutants for the Golgi transport. The authors should overexpress dynein DN and see if it helps kinesin-1 mutants to disperse the Golgi, as is the case for kinesin-18, which would support their interpretation. This experiment is doable with the available reagents.</p><p>3) Subsection “CNB and N-latch mutants display enhanced unloaded motility properties”: Gaps in kymographs may not be the rapid reattachment of the motor, and may be caused by fluorescence blinking. Although the authors mention that another protein with the same fluorophore does not have these gaps in kymographs, these probes may behave differently when bound/fused to different proteins.</p><p>Was there any evidence of fast reattachment in the optical trapping assays? The argument for reattachment solely due to the &quot;gaps&quot; in the unloaded runs is weak and an increased landing rate does not necessarily imply fast reattachment during stepping. In the kinesin-2 optical trapping studies that the authors reference, there were clear reattachment events that may be predicted to be seen for the present mutants.</p><p>To clarify the nature of the gaps, the authors could measure the motor run length in force-feedback-controlled optical trap assays under low load and determine whether the motors release quickly under the weak pull of the trap. Given that the Lang lab is fully equipped to do these experiments, the reviewers expect that the authors can test the motility of at least one mutant under one low backward load condition within a reasonable revision time.</p><p>4) The authors argue that reduced NL docking in the mutants leads to smaller unbinding forces due to premature detachment. This should however in principle also impede NL docking under zero load. So, in a sense the longer unloaded run lengths and the smaller detachment forces are in conflict. This issue should be addressed either experimentally or by changes to the text. A related point is the observation of pauses and Gaussian rather than exponential run length distributions for the long run length mutants. The authors should clarify how these observations can be explained.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Neck linker docking is critical for Kinesin-1 force generation in cells but at a cost to motor speed and processivity&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers concluded that 'essential revision point 3' (gaps in kymographs) has not been convincingly addressed: In their view, the new experimental data strengthen the argument that the motors keep walking and that blinking in their fluorescence signal leads to gaps. Small molecules with low Reynolds number do not have momentum. Therefore, they cannot &quot;jump&quot; in the forward direction after releasing from a microtubule, simply because they were walking in that direction. New Figure 4—figure supplement 1 clearly shows that net displacement in the gaps is in the direction of motion and very close to (but slightly lower than) the expected displacement from the constant velocity of the motor before the gap. The evidence is not strong enough to make the conclusion of 'rebinding'. The authors can mention that their results are consistent with (or suggest) motor hopping on a microtubule, but they should also mention that they cannot rule out the possibility of fluorophore blinking leading to gaps in kymograph. This is not one of the main conclusions of this study, so this point can be addressed by softening their argument.</p><p>In the light of this remaining criticism, we ask the authors to either tone down their claims, discuss alternative interpretations or even remove (part of the) blinking data/analysis that is not considered convincing by the reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers were also not quite satisfied with the response to 'essential revision point 4' but acknowledge that this concerns a complicated topic and is not quite at the center of the study. The authors may however also here consider rewording some of their statements.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44146.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p></disp-quote><p> <italic>1) The classification of peroxisomes and Golgi as low-load and high-load cargos does not appear to be fully justified.

We used overexpression of the dynein DN construct to decrease the load imposed on the motors in the Golgi dispersion assay and found that each of the kinesin-1 mutants (CNB, Latch, and CNB+Latch) is now able to drive Golgi dispersion. Thus, disruption of cytoplasmic dynein activity facilitates transport of the high-load Golgi cargo not only for KIF18A as we showed previously, but also for the CNB, Latch, and CNB+Latch mutant motors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “CNB and N-latch mutants display enhanced unloaded motility properties”: Gaps in kymographs may not be the rapid reattachment of the motor and may be caused by fluorescence blinking.

However, similar to our recent work with the kinesin-14 motor HSET (Reinemann et al., 2018), the low force of the motor and the low stiffness of the trap make any fast reattachment events difficult to record.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To clarify the nature of the gaps, the authors could measure the motor run length in force-feedback-controlled optical trap assays under low load and determine whether the motors release quickly under the weak pull of the trap.

There is no one currently in the Lang lab who is familiar with optical trapping assays of kinesin motors and thus able to pull off such a challenging experiment within the revision time. Since the main concern of the reviewers is whether the gaps in the kymographs truly represent fast reattachment rather than fluorescence blinking, we propose the following alternative experiment: we will repeat the single molecule assays for the CNB+Latch mutant (where we see largest number of gaps) tagged with two other fluorophores. First, mRuby (a naturally blinking fluoroscent protein) and second, Janelia Flour 549 dye labeling of a HaloTag. If we see the same gaps in the kymographs regardless of fluorophore blinking, then this will support our hypothesis that the gaps are due to rapid reattachment of the motor rather than fluorescence blinking.”</p><p>Following discussion between the Reviewing Editor and the reviewers, the editors agreed and encouraged us to consider the following comment from one of the reviewers: “If the &quot;gaps&quot; in the kymographs are truly detachment and fast reattachment events, then the mean displacement during these events should be zero. In contrast, if they are due to blinking, then the motors should be continuing at the same velocity. By measuring the displacements during the gaps, a finding of near zero or, at a minimum, a displacement significantly less than that expected from steady velocity would be strong evidence. If displacements during dark periods are what is expected from steady velocity, that rules out the &quot;hopping&quot; argument.&quot;</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. We have carried out new single-molecule imaging experiments for the CNB+Latch mutant motor tagged with HaloTag or mRuby (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We find that the kinesin-1 CNB+Latch mutant shows “gaps” in the kymographs regardless of fluorescent tag. When the mutant motor is labeled with the HaloTag JF649 dye (which rarely blinks), the displacement is less than what is expected from steady velocity. In contrast, when the mutant motor is labeled with the mRuby tag (which frequently blinks), some of the gaps display a displacement consistent with steady velocity (due to blinking) and some of the gaps display a displacement less than what is expected from steady velocity (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We believe this data strongly support our interpretation that the gaps in the kymograph indicate fast reattachment of the mutant motors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors argue that reduced NL docking in the mutants leads to smaller unbinding forces due to premature detachment.

This issue should be addressed either experimentally or by changes to the text.</p></disp-quote><p>It is not clear to us why the reviewer(s) believes that the longer run lengths under no load and the smaller detachment forces under load are in conflict. Explaining why the results are the way they are depends on the model for the motility cycle, coordination among motor heads, and very complex non-equilibrium probabilities leading to rupture in one case and dissociation probability in the other. Perhaps the reviewer has the view that weak force generation equates to weak microtubule binding. Under load, the weakened NL docking may indeed create a weak microtubule binding state that leads to rapid detachment from the microtubule track. However, in the unloaded scenario, weak associations with the microtubule may be sufficient to keep the motor attached. In addition, our MD simulations show that NL docking has allosteric effects on microtubule and nucleotide binding that facilitate motility in the unloaded state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A related point is the observation of pauses and Gaussian rather than exponential run length distributions for the long run length mutants. The authors should clarify how these observations can be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>With respect to the pauses, please see our response above to essential revision #3.</p><p>With respect to the run length distributions of the Latch and CNB+Latch mutant motors, have reanalyzed these data fitting to a γ distribution. We believe that the non-exponential distributions of these data indicate that two or more kinetic steps influence motor detachment from the microtubule track during an unloaded run. The identity of these kinetic steps and their mechanistic basis are presently unclear. We note that similar distributions have been reported for other highly processive motors such as kinesin-3 motors (e.g. Soppina et al., 2014, Lessard et al., 2019).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers concluded that 'essential revision point 3' (gaps in kymographs) has not been convincingly addressed: In their view, the new experimental data strengthen the argument that the motors keep walking and that blinking in their fluorescence signal leads to gaps.
