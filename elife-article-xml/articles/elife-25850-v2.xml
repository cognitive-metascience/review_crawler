However, the mechanism of structural coupling between these functions remains to be established. Using a combination of molecular modeling, substituted cysteine accessibility, electrophysiology and glutamate uptake assays, we identified a chloride-channeling conformer, <italic>iCh</italic>S, transiently accessible as EAAT1 reconfigures from substrate/ion-loaded into a substrate-releasing conformer. Opening of the anion permeation path in this <italic>iCh</italic>S is controlled by the elevator-like movement of the substrate-binding core, along with its wall that simultaneously lines the anion permeation path (<italic>global</italic>); and repacking of a cluster of hydrophobic residues near the extracellular vestibule (<italic>local</italic>).

Each protomer contains eight transmembrane (TM) helices and two reentrant hairpin loops, HP1 and HP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yernool et al., 2004</xref>). TM1, TM2, TM4 and TM5 make intersubunit contacts and form the trimerization domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lezon and Bahar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yernool et al., 2004</xref>). A scaffold formed by these domains surrounds the highly conserved core (of each subunit) composed of HP1, HP2, TM7 and TM8. These core elements, together with TM3 and TM6, form the transport domain that moves in an elevator-like motion across the membrane to enable substrate translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lezon and Bahar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Glt<sub>Ph</sub> has been crystallized in two end-states: outward-facing state (OFS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yernool et al., 2004</xref>) and inward-facing state (IFS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>).

The asymmetric Glt<sub>Ph</sub> structure that was captured in the <italic>i</italic>OFS provided evidence for an aqueous accessible cavity that was also proposed as a potential anion permeation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verdon and Boudker, 2012</xref>). EAAT1 residues in this cavity were tested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cater et al. (2014)</xref>, who suggested that the interface between the transport and trimerization domains could facilitate anion permeation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cater et al., 2014</xref>). Recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by Fahlke’s group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machtens et al., 2015</xref>) showed that the formation of anion-selective permeation pathway is unlikely in the <italic>i</italic>OFS proposed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verdon and Boudker, 2012</xref>), but required a global rearrangement of the <italic>i</italic>OFS that included a lateral movement of the transport domain to facilitate the anion pore opening. Data obtained using fluorescence spectroscopy in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and electrophysiological recordings in mammalian EAATs also identified several residues at the interface between the transport and trimerization domains that appear to directly interact with chloride, and when mutated, alter the anion-to-cation selectivity and unitary anion conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machtens et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although these studies broadly agree that anion permeation takes place between the transport and trimerization domains, they differ in the conformational states that mediate anion conduction and the precise residues involved. Here, we use a different set of approaches to characterize the structural features of the anion conducting state, to distinguish the residues lining the pore and to resolve the structural elements involved in the coupling between anion conduction and substrate transport. First, using a combination of advanced computations and experiments, we identified a <italic>chloride-channeling intermediate state</italic>, <italic>iCh</italic>S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The <italic>iChS</italic> is transiently visited during the passage between these <italic>i</italic>OFS and IFS, consistently observed in both Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and EAAT1. Our simulations clearly showed how the opening of a continuous anion channel is facilitated by the movement of a <italic>flexible wall</italic> between the substrate-binding cavity and the anion conduction pathway, whereas in the <italic>i</italic>OFS and IFS, the continuity of the channel was compromised by constricted areas. We further identified a cluster of hydrophobic residues (F50, V51 and L212 in Glt<sub>Ph</sub>; L88, M89 and L296 in EAAT1) that line the permeation pathway. We probed the accessibility of residues predicted by our simulations to line the anion permeation pore in the <italic>iCh</italic>S using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karlin and Akabas, 1998</xref>), shown earlier to successfully identify pore-forming residues in many ion channels and transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Contreras et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fahlke et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holmgren et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin and Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pascual et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reyes and Gadsby, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takeuchi et al., 2008</xref>). Different engineered cysteine substitutions were introduced into a fully functional EAAT1 that lacks the three endogenous cysteine residues (EAAT1 Csls WT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seal et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Torres-Salazar et al., 2015</xref>). Each individual mutant was expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and incubated with different MTS (methanethiosulphonate) reagents. We combined electrophysiological recordings and radiolabeled glutamate uptake assays to monitor residue accessibility and the effect of the modification on anion permeation and substrate transport. Among the residues predicted by our simulations to be part of the proposed anion-channeling pathway, two extracellularly exposed residues, M89 in TM2 and L296 in TM5 reacted rapidly to MTS reagents and reduced anion permeation without affecting substrate transport. In addition, we observed that the accessibility of these residues was reduced or eliminated under conditions that favor OFS, <italic>i</italic>OFS or IFS, which our simulations predict as non-conducting states, suggesting that exposure of these residues to thiol-modifying reagents is state-dependent.</p><p>Our results confirm that the anion-selective pathway is conserved in archaeal and mammalian EAATs and that it consists of a cavity between the transport and the trimerization domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cater et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machtens et al., 2015</xref>) that opens up upon structural rearrangements from <italic>i</italic>OFS out of the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machtens et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, our work provides novel evidence that the anion pore opening consists of a cavity that is distinct from the substrate translocation path and suggest that both pathways are limited by a flexible wall, whose movement dictate whether that monomer exclusively facilitates anion permeation or substrate translocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A water channel intermittently forms during transition of the substrate-loaded subunit from the <italic>i</italic>OFS to the IFS</title><p>We first examined the putative anion permeation pathway in the <italic>i</italic>OFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) suggested by Verdon and Boudker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verdon and Boudker, 2012</xref>). We observed that the particular path was blocked by tight interactions near M286, Y195, S65 and P304 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The pore radius near this constriction zone was 0.9 ± 0.4 Å, which would render the pore impermeable to chloride ions (1.8 Å in radius). On the other hand, M286 (in HP1) is separated from Y195 by over 15 Å in the IFS, which might easily accommodate an anion passage.

In contrast to the anion current, the transport current in cells expressing M89C remained intact after application of MTSES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These experiments demonstrate that while application of MTSES significantly decreased anion permeation, it did not affect glutamate translocation. To rule out the possibility that the electrostatic interactions of the negatively charged MTSES might affect anion permeation, we repeated the same experiment using the positively charged MTSET and the neutral MTSACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reyes and Gadsby, 2006</xref>). Both reagents produced a similar decrease in the anion current without altering substrate translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–K</xref>, <italic>n</italic> &gt; 3), further confirming that M89C is accessible to thiol-specific reagents and, that the resulting modifications decrease anion permeation without affecting substrate translocation.</p><p>We obtained similar results with L296C (L212 in Glt<sub>Ph</sub>), another residue highlighted in our simulations to be exposed upon opening of the anion pore in the <italic>iCh</italic>S.

In contrast to oocytes expressing M89C or L296C, the oocytes expressing L88C did not show any significant changes in current amplitudes or substrate transport upon application of 10 mM MTSES or 1 mM MTSET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B,D–E and I</xref>), suggesting that L88 was not accessible from the EC side of the membrane. To test for potential accessibility from the IC side, we applied the membrane permeable MTSEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holmgren et al., 1996</xref>) to oocytes expressing this mutant. Application of 2.5 mM MTSEA resulted in a slow increase in the anion current amplitude at +60 mV. About 10 s after the application, the current started increasing, to reach a maximum of 10-fold increase within ~50 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>open circles</italic>, <italic>n</italic> = 6). No detectable changes were observed in oocytes-expressing Csls WT 50 s after an identical application of MTSEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <italic>gray triangles</italic>, <italic>n</italic> = 3). The full current-voltage relationships from −120 to 60 mV measured before and 3 min after the MTS-application confirmed the effects of the modifications observed at +60 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). To test whether L88C was not accessible to MTSES and MTSET, or if it was accessible but the modification caused no effect on the carrier function, we designed a new experiment in which both reagents were independently applied before the application of MTSEA. If the initially applied reagent could access L88C, the subsequent application of MTSEA would have no effect or at least a significantly lower effect than it had when applied without previous treatment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref> (<italic>n</italic> &gt; 3) show that the effect of MTSEA remains unchanged when applied after a previous application of the other reagents, indicating that L88C was not accessible to MTSES or MTSET.

Therefore, these results suggest that L88 may be part of the permeation pathway, but it is also involved in anion channel gating. Because MTSEA is positively charged, in an attempt to mimic the effect of the modification, we substituted L88 by arginine and measured macroscopic current amplitudes, radiolabeled glutamate uptake as well as relative permeability ratios. Similar to that observed after the modification with MTSEA, in oocytes-expressing L88R, we observed much larger macroscopic current amplitudes.

These results are in perfect agreement with previous observations showing that a similar substitution in the homologous residue in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (F50K), results in a significantly larger anion conductance (about fourfold) and that negatively charged substitutions at the same position in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and EAAT2 affect the cation/anion permeability of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machtens et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The anion-channeling pathway emerging in the <italic>iCh</italic>S is energetically favored over other putative pathways</title><p>At present, there is still a debate about the actual Cl<sup>−</sup> permeation pathway(s) in glutamate transporters (for a review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cater et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fahlke et al., 2016</xref>]).

Because these constrictions may affect the accessibility of residues within the pore that are passed these points, we hypothesized that the accessibility of at least some of the pore forming residues would be affected when favoring these conformations where we observed an interrupted continuous pathway. To evaluate our hypothesis, we repeated the modification experiments in conditions that would favor the stabilization of the carrier in either an inward (in high extracellular K<sup>+</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shlaifer and Kanner, 2007</xref>]) or an outward (in the presence of TBOA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>]) conformation. In oocytes-expressing M89C, we applied 10 mM MTSES in a KNO<sub>3</sub>-based solution, which is expected to favor inward-facing conformations and consequently a constriction in the EC region of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). When we measured the current amplitudes in NaNO<sub>3</sub> + glutamate before (<italic>white bars</italic>) and after (<italic>black bars</italic>) the application of MTSES in high K<sup>+</sup> conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <italic>center bars</italic>, <italic>n</italic> = 5), we did not observe the 40% reduction of the current amplitudes obtained when the application was done in conditions that favored channel opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8A</xref> right bars, <italic>n</italic> = 5). We performed a similar experiment in oocytes-expressing L88C but using MTSEA, which we previously demonstrated that it modified L88C from the IC part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Although application of MTSEA in a KNO<sub>3</sub>-based solution did not prevent the modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, <italic>central bars</italic>, <italic>n</italic> = 4), its effect was much smaller than the observed when MTSEA was applied in a NaNO<sub>3</sub>-based solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8B</xref>, right bars, <italic>n</italic> = 5). If we consider that MTSEA access L88C from the cytoplasm and that the constriction observed at the IC part of the channel in the IFS is not as small as the one observed at the EC region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), a partial modification of L88C is not surprising. On the other hand, based on the tight constriction zone observed at the IC region in the <italic>i</italic>OFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), one would expect a much reduced or no accessibility of MTSEA to L88C under conditions that favor this conformation. To test that, we then applied MTSEA in the presence of TBOA, which lock the carrier in an outward or intermediate outward conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>). In the presence of 200 µM TBOA, no effect of MTSEA was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–D</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 5). In the same cells, following the application in TBOA, we applied MTSEA in the same conditions used before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and the effect was very similar, increasing the current about 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–D</xref>). This result demonstrates very little or no modification at all in the presence of TBOA, supporting the hypothesis that when the carrier is stabilized in an outward-facing conformation the accessibility of L88C from the cytoplasm is limited or abolished, consistent with the constriction we observed in the IC region in a similar conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To ensure that TBOA was working, we measured the current amplitudes in the absence and the presence of 200 µM TBOA before and after each of the applications; in all cases, TBOA blocked the anion current near background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25850.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The opening of the anion permeation path occurs only in the <italic>iCh</italic>S, and the accessibility of pore-forming residues is state-dependent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bar graph representation of averaged current amplitudes at +60 mV measured in oocytes expressing either CslsWT or M89C before (<italic>white bars</italic>) and after (<italic>black bars</italic>) the application of 10 mM MTSES.

The present study highlights the high propensity of glutamate transporters to form an anion-selective channel upon reconfiguration of the substrate-loaded transporter. The anion selective pore, consistently observed in simulations of the archaeal aspartate transporter, Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, and confirmed for the homology-modeled human EAAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), became accessible when the transporter visited an intermediate state, <italic>iCh</italic>S, during its transition from <italic>i</italic>OFS to IFS. This intermediate state is distinguished by the repacking of a hydrophobic cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) that promotes the opening of a continuous cavity between the transport and the trimerization domains, which, in turn, facilitates anion permeation, in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cater et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machtens et al., 2015</xref>). The channeling intermediate <italic>iCh</italic>S is distinct from the X-ray resolved OFS, <italic>i</italic>OFS and IFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) in Glt<sub>Ph</sub>. The versatility of the transport domain to sample yet another functional conformation relative to the relatively rigid trimerization domain is consistent with the conformational heterogeneity of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> transport noted by Slotboom and coworkers in their EPR study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hänelt et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A combination of electrophysiological recordings with cysteine accessibility assays in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C–Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) confirmed the critical role of the conformational flexibility of the pore-lining residues near the EC entrance of the pore, as observed in our simulations. In oocytes-expressing mutants of introduced cysteines in predicted pore-forming residues, we observed a reduction of the macroscopic current amplitude by about 50% after application of different MTS-reagents. Moreover, our results showed that most modifications that significantly affected anion permeation did not affect transport currents or radiolabeled glutamate uptake, indicating that substrate transport is not altered by these modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The two residues that showed a reduction in current amplitudes upon modification with MTS-reagents without affecting substrate translocation (M89 and L296), were the ones that displayed the highest solvent accessibilities as reflected by their high SASA values in the iChS. They also have significantly lower SASA values in the IFS or the iOFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), confirming that their aqueous exposure to the solvent reaches a maximum when the channel adopts the open state. It is worth noting that M89C and L296C are homologous of V51 and L212 in Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, which in the report by Machtens et al. (2015) showed the highest interaction with Iodide and the largest chloride occupancy in their simulated open channel conformation. We did not observe changes in current amplitude with any of the MTS-reagents applied to other cysteines substituted residues predicted to be pore-lining in MD simulations (I293C, M286C, R477C, S363C or M279C, data not shown). These residues are either deeper into the pore (e.g. I293 and M286) and inaccessible to MTS-modification, or located on the wide open surface of the channel (e.g. M279 and R280) such that the modification with bulky reagents would not affect anion permeation. R276 in HP1 of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (homologous S363 in EAAT1) and a highly conserved basic residue in TM8 of EAATs (R477 in EAAT1) have been suggested to line the anion pore and serve as selectivity filters for the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machtens et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, in the Glt<sub>Ph</sub> <italic>iCh</italic>S, R276 is a critical residue that prevents the permeation of Na<sup>+</sup> through the anion channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Although EAAT1 R477 is highly exposed to water in the <italic>iCh</italic>S (SASA value of 110 ± 40 Å<sup>2</sup>) and IFS (SASA value of 75 ± 25 Å<sup>2</sup>), its substitution by cysteine in the R477C mutant (data not shown) decreased the SASA to 30 ± 10 Å<sup>2</sup>, which may explain the limited accessibility to modifying reagents (data not shown). In fact, only the residues that show a high SASA in the <italic>iCh</italic>S and low SASA in IFS and/or <italic>i</italic>OFS could be modified by MTS-compounds. Another substituted cysteine mutant, L88C, could only be accessed from the IC side of the membrane. Modification of L88C affected both anion currents and substrate transport, suggesting that L88 resides deep within the pore and may participate in channel gating and line the permeation pathway. Interestingly, a very similar phenomenon is observed in voltage-gated chloride channels (ClCs). In ClC-0, specific residues known to interact with the permeant anion contribute to both anion conduction and channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pusch et al., 1995</xref>). As shown for ClCs, the gating of EAAT-associated anion channels is also modulated by permeant anions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kovermann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Melzer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Torres-Salazar and Fahlke, 2006</xref>). We suggest L88, in addition to coordinating anion permeation through the pore, may also regulate a shift in the equilibrium between channel gating and substrate translocation cycle.</p><p>During transition from <italic>i</italic>OFS, a continuous water channel was initially formed when the RMSD of the conformer was around 3.5 ~ 4.0 Å away from the <italic>i</italic>OFS and was dehydrated once the protomer approached the IFS (e.g. RMSD &gt;5.5 Å). The observation of an intermittent water channel during the global transition of the Glt<sub>Ph</sub> complies with the notion that water conducting-states may generally arise as short-lived intermediates as the protein undergoes a transition from one global state to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, Kanner and coworkers reported that cysteine cross-linking of the W441C/K269C double mutant of the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 allowed for anion conductance, but not substrate transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shabaneh et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, constraining the homologous Glt<sub>Ph</sub>V216-A391 distance in silico restricted the lateral motions of the transporter domain but allowed for sufficient conformational flexibility to form an anion-conducting pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machtens et al., 2015</xref>). Notably in our simulations, the initial formation of the water channel occurred as the C<sup>α</sup> distance of V216-A391 was within 9.5–11.5 Å, therefore the cysteines in the double mutant V216C/A391C are likely to form cross-links. We also recently identified a point mutation in the IC end of TM7 (R388D/E) that drives the carrier into a constitutive open channel state while virtually eliminating substrate transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Torres-Salazar et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition, our data identified residues in HP1 and HP2 loops and TM8, e.g. R276, P356, G357, A360 and A391 that act as a 'moving wall' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) between substrate-transport cavity and the anion permeation channel. This underscores the idea that the channel and substrate translocation pathways are mutually exclusive. Another interesting and novel observation is the constriction zones that we observed of the permeation pathway in the <italic>i</italic>OFS and the IFS, which explains why the continuous permeation pathway is only observed in the i<italic>ChS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machtens et al., 2015</xref>). This was confirmed by the state-dependent modification that we observed with two of the MTS-reactive residues (L88C and M89C). Perfusion of the cells with a K<sup>+</sup>-based external solution shifts the equilibrium of the carriers toward the IFS. When MTS-reagents were applied under this condition, M89C became inaccessible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), and the IC accessibility of L88C was only partially reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). As predicted from the pathway associated with the IFS, there is a tighter constriction of the cavity on the EC side and a more open configuration on the IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, when we repeated the experiment in the presence of TBOA, which lock the protein in an OFS or iOFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>), the accessibility of M89C was not significantly altered (data not shown), and L88C became inaccessible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–D</xref>), findings consistent with the very tight constriction of the pathway on the IC side in the <italic>i</italic>OFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These data support the state-dependent changes in the shape of the pore and illustrate why channel opening in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and EAAT1 occurs only in conformational states between iOFS and IFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cater et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machtens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shabaneh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Torres-Salazar et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our study also provides an independent perspective, based on computational and experimental methods different from earlier studies, on a number of divergent conclusions regarding the specific residues lining the conduction pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cater et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machtens et al., 2015</xref>). The pore lining residues in our in silico deduced chloride channel in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and the modeled hEAAT1, generally agree with those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machtens et al. (2015)</xref>. One important discrepancy between previous studies was on the relevance of S65 (S103 in hEAAT1) to the formation of the permeation pathway. This residue was first observed to alter anion permeability ratios when mutated to valine in hEAAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ryan et al., 2004</xref>) and the same substitution was later confirmed to alter chloride flux in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ryan and Mindell, 2007</xref>). These observations led the authors to propose S65 (S103) as a critical element of the chloride permeation pathway and the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cater et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ryan and Mindell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ryan et al., 2004</xref>), which was later supported by an aqueous cavity observed in a resolved crystal structure in the iOFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verdon and Boudker, 2012</xref>). Although S65 (S103) was not part of the continuous water pathway obtained in our simulations, we examined its role in greater detail by performing a series of simulations in the presence of a Cl<sup>−</sup> ion near S65, and additional experiments. In the simulations, although the Cl<sup>−</sup> ion initially moved into the crevice proposed as a potential pathway by Verdon and Boudker, this route remained obstructed with an energy barrier of more than 20 kcal/mol by hydrophobic contacts near I61 and V58. We further assessed the modification of the analogous residue in EAAT1, S103C, with different MTS-reagents (MTSES, MTSET or MTSEA), and did not observe an effect on current amplitudes with any of these reagents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together with the previous reports, our results suggest that S65 (S103) may play a significant role in anion permeation by contributing to the structural elements involved in channel opening and closing but not as part of the permeation pathway.</p><p>Taken together, these data build on an emerging mechanism of anion channel pore opening by demonstrating that the open channel state proceeds through the cooperative dislocation of a flexible-wall during the elevator-like movement of the transport core. Our findings reinforce the idea that substrate transport and anion permeation proceed through two mutually exclusive pathways that are facilitated by conformational changes involving this flexible wall domain. The same mechanism is robustly shared by both the archaeal and mammalian transporters Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and EAAT1, and confirmed by both experiments and simulations. These efforts and those of others have begun to illuminate the anion permeation pathway and gating mechanism, and also provide a basis for exploring how EAAT-associated anion channels regulate synaptic function and contribute to neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Heterologous expression of EAAT1</title><p>Point mutations were introduced into the hEAAT1 WT cysteineless cDNAs (Csls WT) using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

We used both metadynamics and ABF to estimate the free-energy profiles along the putative pathways, as a way of consolidating the results. These two methods complement each other. Metadynamics has the advantage of identifying curved permation pathways and estimating the free-energy profiles with less computational effort, albeit at lower accuracy compared to other methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang and Voth, 2011</xref>), like ABF. We used metadynamics for a first, quick assessment of putative chloride channeling pathways. Then the one with the lowest energy barrier was reevaluated using ABF to achieve higher accuracy.

While the findings are largely consistent with the earlier findings, they fall short of providing significant new insights. It appears that, in a close look, the identified transporter conformation and the channel for chloride permeation do not differ substantially from that identified and characterized by Machtens et al., 2015.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Cheng et al. report an investigation of the mechanism by chloride ions permeate across secondary-active glutamate transporters, through passive diffusion. To this end, the authors combine molecular dynamics simulations and biochemical and functional studies. The former are primarily focused on Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, a prokaryotic transporter, while the experimental assays are carried out for human EAAT1, expressed in oocytes.</p><p>The most apparent shortcoming of this study is that it is unclear how it adds to the published body of work on this subject – particularly recent work, e.g. Machtens et al., 2015. The principal conclusion in that study is essentially the same as that proposed here, namely that an intermediate conformation between the OF and IF states is such that an anion-selective conducting pore opens up at the interface between the transport and trimerization domains; as far as I can discern by comparing the figures in these two articles, even the proposed pathway for chloride is highly similar.</p><p>It could be argued that independent verification of that result would be of interest. For example, a reader of Machtens et al. might be concerned by the fact that the conducting intermediates hypothesized that study originate from computer simulations in which the transporter is subject to transmembrane voltages of up 1.6 V. Thus, a re-evaluation of those results with more sophisticated or systematic approaches would be well justified. This is not the case here, however. The computational work in Cheng. et al. is of subpar quality, from a methodological standpoint, and appears to follow a design that is largely arbitrary. For example, the authors use so-called targeted MD simulations to generate conformational intermediates between the so-called iOFS and IF states. In this approach, the RMSD of the protein backbone structure, relative to a target, is gradually reduced to a value close to zero. This approach might seem reasonable, except these TMD trajectories are 10 ns long – i.e. clearly out of equilibrium. In that timescale, there simply is no chance that the side-chain structure, which is, after all, what controls the backbone conformation, will be minimally realistic. In my opinion, therefore, it is improbable that the resulting structural intermediates fall close to a minimum free-energy pathway between the two states considered – except in a purely qualitative sense. This issue aside, why exactly are the authors assuming here that the Cl<sup>-</sup> conducting state is an intermediate between iOF and IF conformations? As mentioned, the work seems to examine the same concepts put forward elsewhere. The authors should also clarify why they reportedly carry out 6 of these non-equilibrium trajectories, but apparently consider only one configuration of run #1 for further analysis. Why this precise configuration? What is the significance of these multiple calculations?</p><p>The subsequent steps of the computational protocol are equally confusing and seemingly ad hoc. Why are multiple simulations of the selected intermediate carried out with and without voltage applied? In which way does this procedure lead to the &quot;refinement&quot; of the structure of this intermediate? What is the metric that enables the authors to consider this structural intermediate is &quot;refined&quot;? And why, again, is the endpoint of only one of these multiple simulations considered for the analysis of ion permeation through PMF calculations? Are the authors using two different methods to compute these PMF profiles (Metadynamics and ABF), as the supplementary information seems to suggest? Why would that be necessary? What is the statistical error in the calculated PMF profiles? And importantly, what is the Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance associated with the calculated PMF profile, and does it resemble the experimental value? Finally, why are these PMF profiles (for Cl<sup>-</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>) computed in the absence of one of the 3 Na<sup>+</sup> ions bound to the structure?</p><p>I don't have major concerns in regard to the experimental data. However, I fail to recognize in which way this data specifically supports or confirms the computational work presented here, except on a very qualitative sense. As far as the question of Cl<sup>-</sup> channeling is concerned, the main experimental result is that MTS modifications of Cys substitutions at EAAT1 positions equivalent to Val51 and Leu212 Glt<sub>Ph</sub> reduce the rate of ion permeation, but not transport. The structure of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> shows these residues cluster together at the above mentioned interface, and clearly exposed to the solvent on the extracellular side. This data therefore helps to confirm the previously proposed notion that Cl<sup>-</sup> diffuses across this interface – it also confirms the data for V51 mutants in Machtens et al., 2015. What I fail to recognize is (a) what is distinct about the computational predictions put forward here, and (b) in which way the experimental data obtained in this study specifically validates those predictions.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is very nice and comprehensive work that reveals novel information on the mechanims of the anion conductance associated with glutamate transporters. The combination evidence from molecular dynamics simulations supported by experimental data is compelling. I have no general concerns, but would like to ask the authors to include citations of the work of Tao and Grewer regarding the location of the Na3 binding site, which is used in this manuscript for the MD simulations.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25850.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Cheng et al. report an investigation of the mechanism by chloride ions permeate across secondary-active glutamate transporters, through passive diffusion.

But it should be noted that (Bahar, 2014) there was an ambiguity (if not disagreement) in the literature on this topic, and now our study clearly supports the results of Machtens et al; and (2) we also provide new data beyond what has been reported. Our work demonstrates that the opening of the channel proceeds through a cooperative dislocation of a flexible-wall that physically separates the anion permeation pathway and the substrate translocation site. This new concept was notreported in earlier works. The role of this flexible wall is demonstrated by modifications that significantly affected anion conduction without interfering with substrate transport. Our data indicated that substrate transport and anion permeation proceed through these two mutually exclusive pathways, by virtue of the conformational flexibility of the wall which may obstruct one pathway while opening the other, and <italic>vice versa</italic>. We further showed that this mechanism is shared by both the archaeal and mammalian transporters.</p><p><italic>It could be argued that independent verification of that result would be of interest. For example, a reader of Machtens et al. might be concerned by the fact that the conducting intermediates hypothesized that study originate from computer simulations in which the transporter is subject to transmembrane voltages of up 1.6 V. Thus, a re-evaluation of those results with more sophisticated or systematic approaches would be well justified. This is not the case here, however.</italic> </p><p>Transmembrane voltages of up 1.6 V and the usage of 1M NaCl (in Machtens et al) are too far off from reality. Glt<sub>Ph</sub> has over 150 charged residues and EAAT1, over 200 charged ones. Application of a high voltage (1.6 V) would significantly alter the side chain orientations of these charged residues, thus generating structures that would depart from those stabilized under physiological voltages used in experiments. Indeed, we have employed a more sophisticated computational methodology to avoid high voltages (up to 300 mV) and high sodium concentrations (0.15 M), which permitted us to identify the chloride permeation pathways in both Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and EAAT1. The methodology we implemented here should find valuable applications in other membrane proteins too.</p><p><italic>The computational work in Cheng. et al. is of subpar quality, from a methodological standpoint, and appears to follow a design that is largely arbitrary.

This approach might seem reasonable, except these TMD trajectories are 10 ns long – i.e. clearly out of equilibrium. In that timescale, there simply is no chance that the side-chain structure, which is, after all, what controls the backbone conformation, will be minimally realistic. In my opinion, therefore, it is improbable that the resulting structural intermediates fall close to a minimum free-energy pathway between the two states considered – except in a purely qualitative sense.</italic> </p><p>We respectfully disagree. Our simulations use well-established methods of molecular computational biology. However, we take responsibility for not being clear enough and induce what we believe is a misinterpretation by reviewer #1. We are now explaining in more details. Multiscale methodologies combine conventional MD (cMD) simulations for visualizing local events, targeted MD (tMD) for directing the motion to undergo functional transitions, and/or accelerated MD (aMD) for simulating processes of biological interest otherwise not accessible by conventional MD. As such they present useful tools for exploring coupled global and local events. We adopted such an approach here: we performed a series of cMD simulations guided by short tMD runs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). It is important to note that tMD runs ought to be short (e.g. 10 ns), their goal is simply to enable the sampling of conformers that are otherwise beyond the reach of cMD. If these runs are conducted for longer (than for example 10 ns) durations, they may artificially drive the molecule toward unrealistic conformations – especially if the force constants associated with the targeted harmonic constraints are too large. To avoid such situations, three important requirements are (i) to apply soft forces on the backbone (only), and (ii) to conduct these runs for short durations (as we did), and (iii) to follow tMD runs by long cMD simulations that allow the biomolecule to relax and sample energetically favorable conformers (note that our tMD runs were succeeded by cMD runs of 100s of nanoseconds – which the Reviewer has apparently overlooked). So, tMD runs are not expected to reach equilibrium conformers for the side chains (nor the backbone). The succeeding cMD runs do. The generation of short tMD trajectories followed by long cMD is a well-established protocol (see for example Schulz R et al. 2010: PLoS Comput Biol 6: e1000806. Shaikh and Tajkhorshid, 2010 and our previous work, Cheng and Bahar, 2013 and 2014.</p><p><italic>This issue aside, why exactly are the authors assuming here that the Cl<sup>-</sup> conducting state is an intermediate between iOF and IF conformations?</italic> </p><p>This assumption (or assessment) was based on two observations consistently made in independent runs. First, in all 6 independent runs, we consistently observed a water channel to form (or a hydrated conformer to stabilize) when the RMSD reached 3.5-4.0 Å with respect to the <italic>i</italic>OFS, and the transporter became dehydrated once it approached the IFS (e.g. RMSD &gt; 5.5 Å). It was clear that an open form that could conduct ion facilitated by the influx of intracellular water would be this intermediate hydrated conformer that exhibited a stable water channel, with structural characteristics distinct from both the iOF and IF states (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p><italic>As mentioned, the work seems to examine the same concepts put forward elsewhere. The authors should also clarify why they reportedly carry out 6 of these non-equilibrium trajectories, but apparently consider only one configuration of run #1 for further analysis. Why this precise configuration? What is the significance of these multiple calculations?</italic> </p><p>As we mentioned, in all six simulations, we consistently observed the intermediate water channel state. We simply reported one of these equilibrated conformers for illustrative purposes, and we are happy to provide in the supplementary material those obtained in the individual runs.</p><p><italic>The subsequent steps of the computational protocol are equally confusing and seemingly ad hoc. Why are multiple simulations of the selected intermediate carried out with and without voltage applied?</italic> </p><p>It is well-known that the chloride channels in the glutamate transporters are voltage-gated. So we performed multiple simulations of selected intermediate with and without voltage applied.</p><p><italic>In which way does this procedure lead to the &quot;refinement&quot; of the structure of this intermediate? What is the metric that enables the authors to consider this structural intermediate is &quot;refined&quot;?</italic> </p><p>The refined or stabilized channel was confirmed by a stabilized RMSD from the initial conformer, small fluctuations in the channel pore and continuous water occupancy over the time course of cMD runs.</p><p><italic>And why, again, is the endpoint of only one of these multiple simulations considered for the analysis of ion permeation through PMF calculations?</italic> </p><p>In multiple runs, the water channel conformers were overall similar, if not identical. PMF calculations are usually time-consuming (up to several 100 ns). We used one as the initial conformer, but the PMF calculation averages over all the configurations within the sampling time scale (~100 ns). Note that our approach to estimate PMF differs from that used by Machtens et al., who used continuum approach (Poisson-Boltzmann) on a static conformer.</p><p><italic>Are the authors using two different methods to compute these PMF profiles (Metadynamics and ABF), as the supplementary information seems to suggest? Why would that be necessary? What is the statistical error in the calculated PMF profiles? And importantly, what is the Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance associated with the calculated PMF profile, and does it resemble the experimental value? Finally, why are these PMF profiles (for Cl<sup>-</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>) computed in the absence of one of the 3 Na<sup>+</sup> ions bound to the structure?</italic> </p><p>We used both metadynamics and ABF to estimate the free energy profiles along the putative pathways, as a way of consolidating the results. These two methods complement each other. Metadynamics has the advantage of identifying curved permation pathways and estimating the free energy profiles with less computational effort, albeit at lower accuracy compared to other methods (see Zhang and Voth (2011) J. Chem. Theory Comput 7, 2277-2283) like ABF. We used metadynamics for a first, quick assessment of putative chloride channeling pathways. Then the one with the lowest energy barrier was reevaluated using ABF to achieve higher accuracy. The standard error in the calculated PMF profiles are presented in standard way shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, with the <italic>light</italic> and <italic>cyan</italic> shaded area corresponding to sodium and chloride ion translocation, respectively. Note that the purpose of PMF calculations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) was to identify the ion selectivity region and the gating residues. Computation of chloride conductance is beyond the scope of the present study. Finally, the binding site of the third Na<sup>+</sup> ion is quite far (&gt; 20 Å) from the permeation pathway (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and as such it would have a minimal effect, if any, on the computed free energies.</p><p><italic>I don't have major concerns in regard to the experimental data. However, I fail to recognize in which way this data specifically supports or confirms the computational work presented here, except on a very qualitative sense. As far as the question of Cl<sup>-</sup> channeling is concerned, the main experimental result is that MTS modifications of Cys substitutions at EAAT1 positions equivalent to Val51 and Leu212</italic> Glt<sub>Ph</sub><italic>reduce the rate of ion permeation, but not transport. The structure of</italic> Glt<sub>Ph</sub><italic>shows these residues cluster together at the above mentioned interface, and clearly exposed to the solvent on the extracellular side. This data therefore helps to confirm the previously proposed notion that Cl<sup>-</sup> diffuses across this interface – it also confirms the data for V51 mutants in Machtens et al., 2015. What I fail to recognize is (a) what is distinct about the computational predictions put forward here, and (b) in which way the experimental data obtained in this study specifically validates those predictions.</italic> </p><p>The experimental data support the computational predictions by confirming that three of the residues that appear to be critical to form the anion permeation cavity in both Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and hEAAT1 (V51/M89, L212/L296 and F50/L88) all showed accessibility to MTS reagents; and modification with these reagents significantly affected anion permeation, which is a classical approach used by many others to identify pore forming residues. The facts that in the SASA calculations for hEAAT1, (i) these three residues are the only ones that showed a high SASA value in the predicted channeling conformation (iChS), and (ii) at the same time their SASA was significantly different than those values obtained for the same residues in the inward-facing (IFS) or the intermediate outward-facing conformation (iOFS), further shows the significance of computational predictions, which were confirmed by experiments.</p><p>Moreover, the fact that modifications of two of these residues altered anion permeation without affecting substrate transport, support the computational prediction that the two pathways are physically separated.</p><p>In addition, the substitution of L88 for an arginine, resulting in altered permeability ratios for all permeant anions, further supports the computational prediction that this residue is deep into the pore, probably interacting with the permeant anion and even the selectivity filter.</p><p>Furthermore, the experimental data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> demonstrate that when the carriers are exposed to conditions that favor either the outward- (OFS) or the inward-facing state (IFS), those residues are less accessible, or even not accessible at all. These data confirm the novel finding proposed by our computational predictions that only intermediate conformations allow opening of the anion permeation pathway and therefore that anion channel opening is state-dependent.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is very nice and comprehensive work that reveals novel information on the mechanims of the anion conductance associated with glutamate transporters.
