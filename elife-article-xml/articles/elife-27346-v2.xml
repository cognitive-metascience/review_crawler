Serrate (Ser) to activate Notch signalling. These ligases transfer ubiquitin to lysines of the ligands' intracellular domains (ICDs), which sends them into an Epsin-dependent endocytic pathway. Here, we have tested the requirement of ubi of Dl for signalling. We found that Dl requires ubi for its full function, but can also signal in two ubi-independent modes, one dependent and one independent of Neur. We identified two neural lateral specification processes where Dl signals in an ubi-independent manner. Neur, which is needed for these processes, was shown to be able to activate Dl in an ubi-independent manner. Our analysis suggests that one important role of DSL protein ubi by Mib1 is their release from cis-inhibitory interactions with Notch, enabling them to trans-activate Notch on adjacent cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27346.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells use chemical signals to communicate, setting off chains of reactions known as signalling pathways.

These included some flies that could produce mutant versions of the Serrate and Delta proteins that lacked the locations to which ubiquitin normally attaches. The results of the experiments reveal that Delta requires ubiquitin, Mindbomb1 and Neuralized to work at full capacity. However, Delta could still perform some of its roles without ubiquitin. Neuralized and Delta can partner up to send some signals independently of ubiquitin, and Delta can even send some signals on its own. Serrate, on the other hand, does not work at all without ubiquitin.</p><p>The results presented by Berndt et al. help us to understand the role that ubiquitin plays in activating Notch signalling. Further work that builds on these findings could help to shed light on how uncontrolled Notch activation can contribute to a variety of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases and multiple sclerosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Notch signalling</kwd><kwd>Mindbomb1</kwd><kwd>neuralized</kwd><kwd>cis-inhibition</kwd><kwd>E3-ligase</kwd><kwd>Delta</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000921</institution-id><institution>European Cooperation in Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BM1307</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delidakis</surname><given-names>Christos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003448</institution-id><institution>General Secretariat for Research and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Aristeia II, No 4436</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delidakis</surname><given-names>Christos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KL 1028/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klein</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1208 Teilprojekt B01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klein</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of a variant without lysine in the intracellular domain reveals a ubiquitylation-independent signalling activity of the DSL ligand Delta and novel functions of the Neuralized and Mindbomb1 E3-ligases during Notch signalling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Signalling through the Notch signalling pathway is required in many developmental processes of probably all metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bray, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fiúza and Arias, 2007</xref>). Notch receptors are hetero-dimeric type 1 trans-membrane proteins, which are activated through ligands of the <underline>D</underline>elta/<underline>S</underline>errate/<underline>L</underline>ag2 (DSL) protein family. The genome of <italic>Drosophila</italic> contains two DSL ligands, Delta (Dl) and Serrate (Ser), which are structurally related in their extracellular domain (ECD). Their binding elicits two consecutive proteolytic cleavages of Notch performed by Kuzbanian (Kuz)/ADAM10 and the γ-secretase complex, which results in the release of the intracellular domain (NICD) into the cytoplasm. The first, Kuz-mediated cleavage (S2-cleavage) occurs in the extracellular juxta-membrane region and removes the ecto-domain (NECD). The shedding of NECD triggers the second cleavage within the transmembrane domain by the γ-secretase (S3-cleavage), allowing the release of NICD. NICD enters the nucleus and associates with the CSL transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)) and co-factors to activate the transcription of target genes. In the absence of NICD, Su(H) acts as a repressor of transcription in association with Hairless (H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barolo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brou et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>A number of studies have demonstrated the importance of endocytosis for Notch signalling and regulation of its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Le Borgne et al., 2005a</xref>). During signalling, the ligands must be endocytosed in the signal-sending cell to activate Notch in the signal-receiving one. Two membrane-associated E3-ligases, Neuralized (Neur) and Mindbomb1 (Mib1), play a crucial role in the activation of the ligands and their endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Le Borgne et al., 2005a</xref>). E3-ligases mediate the ubiquitylation (ubi) of specific substrates at lysines (Ks). This label constitutes a common signal to initiate endocytosis and is thought to initiate endocytosis of the DSL ligands. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> the two ligases can functionally substitute for one another in at least some processes such as the wing primordium, suggesting that they perform similar functions, even though they share no obvious sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weinmaster and Fischer, 2011</xref>). Both ligases contain a Ring Finger domain (RF) that catalyses the ubi.</p><p><italic>neur</italic> is highly expressed in the mesoderm and then all over the neuroectoderm in the embryo and is restricted to neural precursor cells until the pupal stages. Mib1 is ubiquitously expressed, indicating that most DSL signalling is dependent on Mib1. Recent analysis indicates that human Mib1 (MIB1) binds to two peptide motifs in the ICD of the mammalian Ser ortholog Jagged1 (Jag1) ligand termed the N- and C-Box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McMillan et al., 2015</xref>). Two domains in the Mib1 N-terminus, MZM and REP, are responsible for this binding, with MZM binding the N- and REP the C-box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McMillan et al., 2015</xref>). Dl has both of these motifs in its ICD; the N-box, also termed ICD2, was shown to be essential for its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daskalaki et al., 2011</xref>). Since MIB1 can substitute for Mib1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it is likely that the interactions between Mib1 and the N-Box are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McMillan et al., 2015</xref>). Neur binds to a distinct site with the core consensus sequence NXXN, also termed ICD1 in Dl (NEQN in Dl). Such a motif is present in the ICDs of both ligands of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daskalaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fontana and Posakony, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glittenberg et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Both ligases are involved in endocytosis of the ligands and their ubi: we recently showed that Neur and Mib1 can ubiquitylate the ICD of Dl in an ICD1 and ICD2 dependent manner, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daskalaki et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, a K at position 742 (K742) of the ICD was identified as the preferred target for Neur in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Moreover, we found a good correlation between the ability of Dl to undergo ubiquitylation by Neur and Mib1, its internalisation efficiency and its ability to signal. In mammals, a Dll1 variant in which all 17 Ks of its ICD are replaced by arginines (Rs) (Dll1K17) is not ubiquitylated and inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heuss et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> endocytic adapter protein Liquid facets (Lqf), which is the ortholog of Epsin, is absolutely required for the function of DSL ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Overstreet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang and Struhl, 2004</xref>). The structural analysis of Lqf revealed that its ubiquitin binding motifs (UIMs) are necessary for function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Overstreet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang and Struhl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ho et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>Two, not mutually exclusive, models have been suggested to explain why the activity of the ligands requires endocytosis. In the first model (pulling force model) the Epsin-mediated entry of ubiquitylated ligands in Clathrin-coated pits creates a pulling force that is essential for shedding of the NECD. In the second model (recycling model), ligand signalling activity is thought to depend on events taking place after internalisation of the ligands into endosomes, such as enzymatic processing of the ligand into the active form or packaging into exosomes: accordingly, signalling activity would require recycling of the ligands to the cell surface to be able to activate Notch. Previous work has provided evidence for both models (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weinmaster and Fischer, 2011</xref>]).</p><p>Although Mib1 and Neur are clearly required for DSL signalling, their role is not entirely understood: (1) While endocytosis of Ser is virtually abolished in <italic>mib1</italic> mutant cells, that of Dl is not obviously affected, although both Ser and Dl function is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang and Struhl, 2004</xref>). (2) Recent work suggests that Neur might have a function that is separable from its ligase function and required for endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Skwarek et al., 2007</xref>). (3) The phenotype of <italic>mib1</italic> mutants is milder than that of mutants of other genes involved in Notch signalling. These results raise the possibility that one or both ligands might possess an activity that is independent of ubi.</p><p>In addition to activating Notch in adjacent cells (trans-activation), the ligands engage in inhibitory interaction with Notch molecules present in the same cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klein et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Micchelli et al., 1997</xref>). This cis-inhibition occurs if DSL ligands are expressed above a threshold level. The underlying mechanism is not well understood, but cis-inhibition can be suppressed by co-expression of Notch, indicating that the ratio between Notch and ligand concentration in a cell is an important parameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klein et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that the ECD of the ligands is involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glittenberg et al., 2006</xref>). Whether the ICD is involved, or cis-inhibition is influenced by Mib1 and Neur is not established, although there is evidence that enhanced/diminished ligand endocytosis relieves/aggravates (respectively) cis-inhibition of Ser and Dl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glittenberg et al., 2006</xref>)</p><p>Here, we tested the activity of a Dl variant (termed DlK2R) in which all 12 Ks of its ICD were replaced by structurally related arginines (Rs). We show that DlK2R possesses signalling activity. However, its activity is reduced compared to Dl, indicating that ubi is required for the full function of Dl. The reduction in activity is in part caused by increased cis-inhibitory activity of DlK2R indicating that the ICD and its ubi contribute to the degree/strength of cis-inhibition of a ligand. We found that an important function of Mib1 during normal signalling is the release of the ligands from cis-inhibitory interaction with Notch. Our results revealed that Dl can signal in two ubi-independent modes, one dependent and one independent of Neur. The results also indicate that Neur and Mib1 have different mechanisms to activate Dl. In contrast to Mib1, Neur can promote Dl signalling in an ubi-independent manner. We identified neuron sibling specification during larval neurogenesis and also specification of the sensory organ precursor of the bristle sensillum as naturally occurring instances of Dl/Notch signalling, where Dl requires Neur, but ubi seems to be dispensable. Finally, we found an instance of Dl induced Notch signalling that is independent of both Neur and ubi.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>mib1</italic> mutants exhibit residual Notch pathway activity, which depends on Dl</title><p>During wing development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> interactions between dorsal and ventral cells mediated by the Notch pathway at the dorso-ventral (D/V) compartment boundary result in the establishment and maintenance of a stripe of expression of Wingless (Wg) that straddles the D/V boundary of the wing disc at the end of the third larval instar stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, arrow) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klein, 2001</xref>). During the initial phase, dorsal boundary cells signal to ventral boundary cells to activate Wg expression and to increase expression of Dl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Micchelli et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Celis and Bray, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Celis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Troost and Klein, 2012</xref>). The ventral boundary cells signal back through Dl to activate expression of Wg in dorsal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, step 1). After establishment, expression of Wg in boundary cells is maintained through a feedback loop (DS-loop, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> steps 2 and 3): it involves the induction of expression of Dl and Ser in cells adjacent to the boundary cells by Wg signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> step 2). Wg expression at the D/V boundary is then maintained by back signalling from these cells to boundary cells through the Notch ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> step 3). Loss of the activity of Notch results in the loss of expression of Wg along the D/V boundary and a reduction of the diameter of its ring-like domains of expression in the proximal wing. The reduction depends on the degree of loss of Notch pathway activity. Strong loss of activity, as observed in mutants of the γ-secretase component <italic>Psn</italic>, reduces the inner ring-like domain to a spot or causes its complete absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, arrowhead) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein and Martinez-Arias, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koelzer and Klein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Struhl and Greenwald, 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ye et al., 1999</xref>).

These constructs behaved in the same manner as the 51C insertion, but the phenotypes were more severe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Expression of each insertion by <italic>ptc</italic>Gal4 resulted in a splitting of the wing primordium into two small halves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>, yellow arrow in A, B, D). A similar split was observed if a dominant-negative variant of Dl, Dl<sup>stu</sup>, or a Notch-RNAi construct is expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E–H</xref>, yellow arrow in E, G). This similarity further confirms that the loss of the Ks strongly increases the cis-inhibitory abilities of Dl. In contrast to Notch-RNAi and Dl<sup>stu</sup>, DlK2R-HA induced an ectopic stripe of Wg expression in the adjacent posterior boundary cells, indicating that it can activate Notch in trans in non-expressing neighbours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>, arrowheads in A, B, arrow in C). The phenotype of DlK2R-HA expression could be mimicked by co-expression of N-RNAi and Dl in wing imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3I,J</xref>, compare with A, B) confirming the increase of cis-inhibitiory abilities without a loss of trans-signalling for the K free DlK2R-HA.</p><p>We sought to suppress the strong cis-inhibitory effect of DlK2R-HA. In the case of Dl-HA, this had been achieved through co-expression with Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klein et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doherty et al., 1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>, yellow arrow, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). When co-expressed with Notch, DlK2R-HA (in 51C) produced the same phenotype. It induced a band of strong ectopic expression of Wg and Gbe + Su(H) and the endogenous expression of Wg along the D/V boundary was not interrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N–P</xref>, yellow arrow in N). This finding shows that the ability of DlK2R-HA to activate the Notch pathway is partly obscured by its increased cis-inhibitory abilities. The co-expression of Dl-HA and DlK2R-HA with Notch in <italic>mib1</italic> mutants resulted in the induction of a broad stripe of expression of Gbe + Su(H) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q–T</xref>). However, induction of Wg expression was severely reduced or absent. Although we did not examine the mechanistic basis of this defect in depth, a possible explanation for the reduction of activity of the Dl variants in <italic>mib1</italic> mutants is the loss of the wing specific DS-loop. In line with this notion, we found that the ability of Dl-HA and DlK2R-HA to induce expression of endogenous Dl in <italic>mib1</italic> mutant discs was severely reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A–G</xref>). Therefore, most of the Notch activity in <italic>mib1</italic> mutants is generated by expression of the exogenous Dl constructs. It is probably too weak to consistently activate the expression of Wg.</p><p>Using the MARCM technique, we co-expressed DlK2R-HA with Notch in <italic>Dl Ser</italic> double mutant cells and found that it induced expression of Wg in the mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3U,V</xref>; arrows). Moreover, we expressed DlK2R-HA in <italic>mib1</italic> mutant wing discs and found that the activity marker Gbe + Su(H) was induced also in cells of <italic>Dl Ser</italic> double mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3W,X</xref>, arrow). These results indicate that the activation of the Notch pathway by DlK2R-HA is independent of the endogenous ligands.</p><p>In summary, the results confirm that DlK2R-HA has a residual activity despite the loss of all Ks in its ICD. At least part of this activity is independent of <italic>mib1,</italic> and probably ubi-independent.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DlK2R-HA displays enhanced stability</title><p>In order to test whether DlK2R-HA is endocytosed, we monitored its sub-cellular distribution in comparison to the endosomal marker Rab7-YFP, which marks maturing endosomes (MEs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–F</xref>; see also M and M).

For this purpose, we ubiquitously expressed Dl-HA and DlK2R-HA for a limited time with <italic>tub</italic>Gal4 <italic>tub</italic>Gal80<sup>ts</sup> and evaluated their relative concentrations with Western blot analysis (eight independent blots).

Low levels of DlK2R-HA were observed even after 36 hr of chase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I,J</xref>). These results further confirm that the degradation of DlK2R-HA is delayed and indicate that at least two effects cause this delay: (1) Inefficient endocytosis and (2) Less efficient transport to the lysosome after endocytosis. Altogether, the results are consistent with the documented requirement of ubi at several steps in the endosomal pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A Dl variant that cannot bind to Mib1 and Neur possesses residual activity and displays increased cis-inhibition</title><p>Dli1/2 is a randomly inserted variant that lacks the binding sites for Neur (ICD1) and Mib1 (ICD2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As a consequence, it is not ubiquitylated by these E3-ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daskalaki et al., 2011</xref>). Based on the expression of Wg, the expression of Dli1/2 with <italic>ptc</italic>Gal4 caused a phenotype that resembled that of DlK2R-HA, including the increased cis-inhibition judged from the large gap inflicted on the endogenous Wg stripe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The quantification of the gap in Wg expression confirmed the increase in cis-inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This resemblance combined with our results raised the possibility that also Dli1/2 has residual activity, although a direct comparison of the two variants is not possible due to the unknown genomic location of Dli1/2. We monitored the induction of the more sensitive Gbe + Su(H) upon expression of Dli1/2.

Thus, cis-inhibition is not restricted to wing and eye development, but appears to be a frequently used mechanism to regulate Notch activity.</p><p>We next tested whether relief of cis-inhibition can also be observed in <italic>mib1</italic> mutant discs. Indeed, strong activation of Gbe + Su(H) in mutant cells at the boundary of <italic>Dl Ser</italic> clones was observed in the notum, indicating that the loss of the ligands can result in strong activation of the Notch pathway also in the absence of <italic>mib1</italic> function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–J</xref>, arrows). As expected, activation occurred only in areas where the ligands were expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–I</xref>). Note, that this Notch activity in <italic>Dl Ser</italic> mutant cells is induced by the activity of ligands in adjacent ligand-expressing cells, although these are devoid of the function of <italic>mib1</italic> function. Since Ser is not able to activate the Notch pathway in the absence of <italic>mib1</italic> function, even when over-expressed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M,N</xref>), the signalling must be mediated by Dl. Thus, Dl can signal in the absence of <italic>mib1</italic> function without being over-expressed and ubiquitylated. The results also show that at least part of the loss of Notch activity in <italic>mib1</italic> mutants is caused by cis-inhibition through the globally expressed ligands and supports the conclusion that Mib1 is required to overcome cis-inhibition during normal signalling.</p><p>The experiments so far were performed with the artificial reporter construct Gbe + Su(H). To confirm the results also with the promoter of an endogenous target gene, we monitored the expression of E(spl)mß-lacZ, which is expressed in a similar global manner as Gbe + Su(H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cooper et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>).

We therefore next tested whether removing Notch expression in a group of cells would release the ligands from cis-inhibition and would result in trans-activation of the Notch pathway in adjacent cells. We created this situation by expression of a <italic>Notch</italic>-RNAi construct that efficiently depletes Notch expression if expressed with <italic>ci</italic>Gal4 in the anterior compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M–O</xref>). In this situation, anterior cells that lack Notch were exposed to posterior Notch expressing cells at the A/P boundary. Consequently, the endogenous ligands of the anterior cells released from cis-inhibition should signal to posterior boundary cells.

Strong ectopic expression of Wg was observed in both genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>, arrows). We confirmed the enhancement of DlK2R-HA by Neur with an independently generated second chromosome UAS <italic>neur</italic> insertion line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lai and Rubin, 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, arrows).

This suggests that the Ks in the ICD of Dl are of minor importance for its activation by Neur. Moreover, cis-inhibition of DlK2R-HA is reduced to a level comparable to Dl-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, compare with B). Using MARCM, we found that the activation of the Notch pathway by the co-expression of Neur and DlK2R-HA occurred in the absence of endogenous Dl and Ser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H,I</xref>, arrow). This excludes the possibility that the endogenous ligands are involved in the induction of the ectopic Notch activity. We co-expressed Mib1 together with DlK2R-HA and found that in contrast to Neur, co-expression of Mib1 failed to modulate the activity of DlK2R-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>, yellow arrow, compare with E). Thus, the enhancing effect on DlK2R-HA is a unique property of Neur.</p><p>NeurΔNHR1 is a variant that is unable to bind to the ICD of Dl, because it lacks the necessary NHR1 binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Commisso and Boulianne, 2007</xref>). In contrast to Neur, NeurΔNHR1 failed to rescue the expression of Wg along the D/V boundary in <italic>mib1</italic> mutant discs and did not enhance the signalling activity of DlK2R-HA and Dl-HA in wildtype and mutant discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K–N</xref>). Moreover, co-expression of Neur did not change the phenotype of Dli1/2, which lacks the Neur binding site in its ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7O</xref>, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Hence, Neur must directly bind to the ICD of Dl-HA and DlK2R-HA to promote their signalling activity and reduce cis-inhibition of DlK2R-HA. The results reveal fundamental differences between Neur and Mib1 in the activation of Dl.</p><p>We next asked whether Neur requires its E3-ligase activity for activation of Dl-HA and DlK2R-HA. To do so, we used a variant that lacks the RF, which catalyses the ubi reaction (NeurΔRF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pavlopoulos et al., 2001</xref>). The subcellular localisation of this variant resembles that of Neur, indicating that the RF is not necessary for localisation of Neur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yeh et al., 2001</xref>). We have confirmed the correct localisation for the constructs used in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to Neur, expression of NeurΔRF alone did not affect expression of Wg along the D/V boundary and did not significantly affect the activity of Dl-HA in wildtype wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7P,Q</xref>). However, unlike Neur, it does not abolish the dorsal anterior stripe of ectopic Wg expression observed if Dl-HA is expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Q</xref>, arrowhead, compare with B). It was also unable to rescue Wg expression in <italic>mib1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7R</xref>). Nevertheless, NeurΔRF strongly enhanced the activity of Dl-HA in <italic>mib1</italic> mutant discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7S</xref>). In comparison to Neur, a significant difference in the strength of the ectopic expression of Wg was observed between wildtype and <italic>mib1</italic> mutant discs (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Q,S and B–D</xref>), indicating a requirement of the RF for full activity. However, the result indicates that Neur can activate Dl in a manner independently of catalysing ubi of its ICD or other components of the endocytic machinery. NeurΔRF was also able to enhance the activity of DlK2R in wildtype discs, indicated by the induction of a stripe of ectopic expression of Wg in posterior boundary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7T</xref>, arrows). A weak stripe was induced if both proteins were expressed even in <italic>mib1</italic> mutant discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7U–W</xref>, arrows). Altogether, the results show that Neur, in contrast to Mib1, can activate Dl in an ubi-independent manner. However, comparison revealed that the induction of Wg expression upon co-expression of Dl and NeurΔRF was stronger than that of DlK2R and NeurΔRF (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7S</xref> with V). In case of Neur the induction of Notch activity was comparable. This suggests that the Ks in the ICD of Dl are important for full activity, especially when Neur lacks its ability to ubiquitylate. The reason for this paradoxical requirement is not clear at the moment. A possible explanation could be a contribution of the Ks to the conformation of the ICD in a manner that cannot be completely replaced by the introduced Rs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Ubi-independent Dl signalling is sufficient for specification of neural fates</title><p>Since Neur can stimulate Dl activity even in the absence of Ks in its ICD, we tested the activity of the various Dl variants in contexts, where Notch signalling is more dependent on endogenous Neur.

However, <italic>mib1</italic> in the presence of Neur shows no loss of Hey. Using the MARCM system, we substituted endogenous Dl by DlK2R-HA or Dli1/2 in the developing late larval CNS. The clones were scored in the central brain and ventral nerve cord. As a control, we confirmed that removal of both endogenous ligands results in 96% of the lineages (clones) being Hey negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,D’</xref>) and this is fully rescued (0% Hey negative) by UAS Dl-HA, but not Dli1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–F</xref>). When we expressed DlK2R-HA in <italic>Dl Ser</italic> MARCM clones, we obtained a full rescue of Hey expression; only 4% of lineages were Hey negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G,G’</xref>). Thus, unlike the wing pouch, where loss of Ks severely compromises Dl activity, in this context DlK2R-HA was able to sustain Notch signalling. Since Neur is needed but Ks are dispensable, we wondered whether the catalytic activity of Neur is necessary. We therefore generated <italic>neur</italic> mutant MARCM clones expressing NeurΔRF. These showed complete rescue of Hey (100% of clones are positive; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H,H’</xref>).

This activating endocytosis is different from bulk endocytosis, which is - in the case of Dl - not dependent on Mib1 or Lqf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Le Borgne et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang and Struhl, 2005</xref>). In order to account for these dependencies on E3-ligases, it has been suggested that ubi of the DSL protein ICDs by Neur and Mib1 initiates a special endocytosis event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weinmaster and Fischer, 2011</xref>). This event either creates a pulling force that is essential for Notch S2 cleavage and subsequent ecto-domain shedding, or sends the ligands through a recycling pathway where they mature into the active form. However, it is not clear why in a given process only one of the two E3-ligases is required or why Neur strongly affects the endocytosis of Dl, but not of Ser, whereas Mib1 affects the endocytosis of the ligands in the opposite way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Le Borgne et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang and Struhl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Le Borgne and Schweisguth, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Here, we further assessed the role of Ks and ubi during activation of Dl, using different tissues of <italic>Drosophila</italic> as test systems. One main finding of our work is that the activity of Dl has three components: One is dependent on Mib1/Neur/E3-ligase activity and probably ubi, the second is Neur-dependent, but ubi-independent and finally the third is independent of any of these factors. Our analysis suggests that the ubi-independent activities probably account for the residual Notch activity observed in <italic>mib1</italic> null mutants. We identified two normal developmental processes, GMC division and SOP selection, which rely on the ubi-independent/Neur-dependent activity of Dl. The only example of a ubi-independent/Neur-independent case of Dl signalling is the S3 notum region expression of Gbe + Su(H) and the endogenous target gene E(spl)mß. Unfortunately, it is not known in which developmental process this expression domain is involved. The latter ubi-/Neur-independent pathway appears to be restricted to Dl as we did not observe ectopic activation of Gbe + Su(H) upon <italic>Ser</italic> expression in <italic>mib1</italic> mutants.</p><p>Recent evolutionary studies suggest that the ubi-independent signalling mode of Dl might be the evolutionary ancient one. <italic>Trichoplax adherens</italic> is the only known member of the basal metazoan phylum Placozoa.

Moreover, the only ligand present in the <italic>Trichoplax</italic> genome belongs to the Dl family. In the light of our results, it is possible that Notch signalling in <italic>Trichoplax</italic> occurs solely by the probably more ancient ubi-independent mechanism. The Ser-like ligands were probably only introduced later in evolution, after the recruitment of the E3-ligases.</p><p>Besides the discovery of the ubi-independent modes, we here confirm that the Ks in the ICD of Dl and Ser are important for their signalling abilities. In addition, our results indicate that the loss of the Ks in Dl also results in a defect in ligand degradation and delayed endocytosis, suggesting the Ks in the ICD are required for the correct degradation. This is in good agreement with our previous finding that the endocytosis of Dli1/2 that lacks the Mib1 and Neur binding sites is delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daskalaki et al., 2011</xref>). We did not find significant differences in the number of Rab7 positive endosomes that are also positive for Dl-HA or DlK2R-HA, however the total amount of DlK2R-HA on these endosomes was increased compared to Dl-HA. Together with the persistence of DlK2R-HA in the plasma membrane, we favour a model where ICD ubi enhances trafficking of Dl-HA at many stations along the endocytic route and ultimately increases its degradation.</p><p>A novel finding is that Neur and Mib1 activate Dl by different mechanisms. In contrast to Mib1, Neur can activate DlK2R-HA to a level that is very similar to that of Dl-HA upon co-expression, also in the absence of <italic>mib1</italic> function. This activation requires direct binding of Neur to the ICD of Dl. This indicates that Neur can strongly activate Dl in a manner independently of ubi of its ICD. The findings are in agreement with the finding that Neur is involved in processes, which appear to depend on ubi-independent Dl signalling, e. g. the selection of neural fates in the brain and the PNS. Previous experiments suggested that Mib1 cannot rescue the embryonic defects of <italic>neur</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Le Borgne et al., 2005</xref>). It is likely that Mib1’s lack of this second, ubi-independent function is the reason for this failure. One possibility for the activation of Dl by Neur might be that it acts as an adapter that connects Dl to the endocytic machinery in the identified developmental processes. In this way Dl could be incorporated into endocytic vesicles without ubi. This adaptor function of Neur is consistent with the observation that it frequently co-traffics with Dl and that expression of Dl can dramatically change the subcellular distribution of Neur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daskalaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Skwarek et al., 2007</xref>). Recent work indicates that this adapter function might be more widespread among E3-ligases than anticipated since it has been shown that also the E3-ligase Suppressor of deltex, which plays an important role in endosomal trafficking of Notch, induces the endocytosis of Notch in an ubi-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yamada et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The selection of the SOP occurs within groups of cells, termed proneural clusters, which are defined by the expression of proneural genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Modolell and Campuzano, 1998</xref>). It has previously been shown that this selection occurs within a subgroup of the proneural cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Troost et al., 2015</xref>). It is termed the Neur group, since the cell that first expresses Neur will develop into the SOP and inhibits its neighbours by increased Dl signalling. The requirement for Neur to increase Dl signalling is puzzling since the cells of the subgroup also express Mib1. The discovery of the ubi-independent activation of Dl by Neur provides an explanation why Neur might be required for correct SOP selection, since it could boost Dl signalling in a different manner than Mib1. Interestingly, our results indicate that also Lqf contributes to SOP selection by an ubi-independent function, as the process is to a large extent rescued by LqfUIM1<sup>3E/3A</sup>-ΔUIM2-GFP in <italic>lqf</italic> mutants. Hence, Lqf might be part of the Neur adapter complex.</p><p>Another so far not well-appreciated finding is that the ICD contributes to cis-inhibition. It has previously been shown that the ECD of the ligands is involved in cis-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fleming et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glittenberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li and Baker, 2004</xref>). Here, we found that the cis-inhibitory ability of Dl strongly increases if the Ks in its ICD are lost. We also showed that loss of <italic>mib1</italic> results in a global increase of cis-inhibition by endogenously expressed DSL ligands. Thus, it appears that both parts of Dl are required for cis-inhibition: The ECD appears to execute the necessary physical interactions with Notch, while the ICD adjusts the strength of cis-inhibition via recruiting E3-ligases and promoting ubi, which suppresses cis-inhibition.</p><p>How might Dl/Notch cis-inhibition be suppressed by ubi of the ligand ICD? The ubiquitin moiety alone might already promote the separation of the Dl/Notch cis-pair on the cell surface. Alternatively, ubi enables binding of Epsin/Lqf via the UIMs, which separates the pair. The similarity between the phenotype of <italic>mib1</italic> mutants and the LqfUIM1<sup>3E/3A</sup>-ΔUIM2-GFP rescued <italic>lqf</italic> mutants favours the second possibility. Another possibility is that ubi/Lqf sends Dl into the recycling pathway as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang and Struhl, 2004</xref>). Separation of the Dl/Notch ECDs is a likely event during this recycling thanks to the acidic pH in the endosome lumen. It is possible that the majority of newly synthesised Dl (and probably Ser) on its way to the cell surface is initially engaged in cis-interaction with Notch. Unless their separation is promoted by ubi, only a minor amount of Dl at the surface would be free to signal. This diminished signalling would justify the reduced (but not eliminated) Notch activity, observed in <italic>mib1</italic> mutants (e. g. S3 expression of Gbe + Su(H)).</p><p>We found that co-expression of Neur also reduces the cis-inhibitory effect of DlK2R-HA and at the same time strongly enhances its signalling activity. To do so, Neur must directly bind to the ICD of DlK2R-HA. These results raise the possibility that the binding of Neur might directly separate the Dl/Notch cis-pair or, as a possible endocytic adapter, stimulates endocytic recycling upon which the cis-pair is separated. Future work is needed to clarify whether the cis-pair separation is the only mechanism through which ubi activates DSL signalling, or whether it also contributes to the pulling force which seems to be a prerequisite for Notch-activation in several contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Drosophila stocks and genetics </title><p><italic>mib1<sup>1</sup>, mib1<sup>2</sup></italic>, <italic>mib1<sup>EY09780</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Le Borgne et al., 2005a</xref>), <italic>lqf</italic><sup>L71</sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xie et al., 2012</xref>) and <italic>lqf<sup>1227</sup></italic> FRT2A(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang and Struhl, 2004</xref>), <italic>Psn<sup>C2</sup></italic> FRT2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Struhl and Greenwald, 1999b</xref>), <italic>Dl<sup>rev10</sup> Ser<sup>RX82</sup></italic> FRT82B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Micchelli et al., 1997</xref>), <italic>H<sup>E31</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bang and Posakony, 1992</xref>).

letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Ubiquitylation-independent activation of Notch signalling by Delta&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Alfonso Martine Arias (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. As you can see, we are very positive about your paper and are sure you will be able to address all major comments speedily.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The mechanism of Notch signalling, specifically the mechanics of the trigger, is still a matter of debate. One of the reasons for this is a lack of understanding of the details that lead Delta to interact productively with Notch. Genetic studies, initially from <italic>Drosophila</italic> with important contributions from vertebrates, have implicated special endocytosis events in this mechanism and, as an important element of this process, the ubiquitylation of Delta. Mib and Neur are two ubiquitin ligases implicated in this process through a direct interaction with Delta. Mib is a general ligase whereas Neur is involved in specific process.</p><p>There are at least three fundamental findings in this manuscript that will have a strong impact in the Notch field:</p><p>i) Delta (but not Serrate) can signal in a ubiquitination independent manner. Furthermore that there are specific processes that use this signalling event, notably the specification of neural progenitors. The authors show two modes of ubiquitylation-independent activation: A weak activation in the absence of both <italic>Mib1</italic> and Neur and a relatively strong activation by Neur-dependent ubiquitylation-independent process.</p><p>ii) The ubiquitin ligase Neuralized activates Delta, but does it independent of Delta ubiquitylation itself.</p><p>iii) The key role of Delta ubiquitylation is to release the cis-inhibition of the ligand by the receptor, which is then competent for trans-activation in neighbouring cells.</p><p>The experiments are well done, the conclusions well supported and the work shows the value of <italic>Drosophila</italic> in eliciting mechanism. There is much detail here that bridges cell biology and pattern formation and the work has the potential to inspire and guide the interpretation of Delta activity in vertebrates.</p><p>In addition to providing these fundamental concepts to the field, this work represents a tour de force, in which a plethora of original assays and reagents are now made available to the community. This manuscript is therefore well suited for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>If the manuscript has a drawback it is that, in places, it is long. We would suggest that the authors make an effort to shorten it and be a bit more direct. The Discussion in particular might not need the length of some of the arguments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It should be made clear in the Abstract and in the Discussion that there are two modes of ubi-independent Notch activation ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">1</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2</xref>) above). The first part of the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>)) deals with mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">1</xref>), and the second part of the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) deal with the second mode.</p><p>2) The authors brought evidence that Neur-dependent, ubi-independent Notch signaling (mode 2) occurs in endogenous situations. Is there evidence for endogenous situations where Notch signaling occurs in the absence of both Neur and <italic>Mib1</italic> (mode 1)?</p><p>3) The Neur dependent ubi-independent mode is quite intriguing. It suggests that the physical binding of Neur, and not its catalytic activity, is somehow sufficient for DSL activation. Can the author discuss/suggest potential mechanisms for that?</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> the authors argue that DlK2R-HA (lysin depleted ligand) and Dl-HA can both activate in the absence of <italic>mib1</italic> (and more strongly so in UAS-N background). However, there are still some differences between the phenotypes of the two variants. These differences could arise from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">1</xref>) the effect of endogenous Dl, or (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2</xref>) that binding of <italic>Mib1</italic> can affect Dl regardless of its catalytic activity (in the same manner that Neur does later). Hence, the authors should check if in the absence of endogenous Dl, DlK2R activity is independent of <italic>Mib1</italic>. If not, this would indicate that <italic>Mib1</italic> binding to Dl also confer some activity to Dl.</p><p>5) The difference between Neur and NeurDelRF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) could be explained by improper membrane localization of the mutant. Can the authors show a high-resolution image to verify that both variants are similarly localized to the membrane?</p><p>6) The paper is somewhat hard to read. This is mainly because it includes many details. While we appreciate the rigour of the work and thoughtful controls, it seems that some of the details can be taken out (not necessary for proving the point) or at least removed to supplementary figures. Some of the details which are redundant are the showing of both the experiments performed in random chromosomal integration positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and in position 51C. The part about the effect of cell death is quite confusing and interferes with the flow of the paper. Also, the Dll1-Dl variant seems less relevant here (although it is an interesting observation). Another less relevant control (in my mind) is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. There are probably more panels that can be moved to supplementary and the authors could make an effort to leave only the panels that convey the main point.</p><p>In addition There are a few suggestions to improve readability:a) Use schematics to explain the wt and mutant patterns in the wing and notum (similar to what is done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><p>b) Make sure to explain the abbreviations and jargon.</p><p>7) The paper relies mostly on images. There are some cases where the paper would benefit from quantification. These include quantifying% of penetrance for penetrant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) and measuring the gap formed by cis inhibition for different mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27346.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It should be made clear in the Abstract and in the Discussion that there are two modes of ubi-independent Notch activation ((1) and (2) above).
