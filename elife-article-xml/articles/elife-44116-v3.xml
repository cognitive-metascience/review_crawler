Patients with jaundice commonly report experiencing an intense non-histaminergic itch. Despite this association, the pruritogenic capacity of bilirubin itself has not been described, and no bilirubin receptor has been identified. Here, we demonstrate that pathophysiologic levels of bilirubin excite peripheral itch sensory neurons and elicit pruritus through MRGPRs, a family of G-protein coupled receptors expressed in primary sensory neurons. Bilirubin binds and activates two MRGPRs, mouse MRGPRA1 and human MRGPRX4. In two mouse models of pathologic hyperbilirubinemia, we show that genetic deletion of either <italic>Mrgpra1</italic> or <italic>Blvra</italic>, the gene that encodes the bilirubin-producing enzyme biliverdin reductase, attenuates itch. Similarly, plasma isolated from hyperbilirubinemic patients evoked itch in wild-type animals but not <italic>Mrgpra1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> animals. Removing bilirubin decreased the pruritogenic capacity of patient plasma. Based on these data, targeting MRGPRs is a promising strategy for alleviating jaundice-associated itch.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44116.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Jaundice causes the skin to yellow as a result of a build-up of a pigment called bilirubin. Normally, bilirubin is made in the liver and removed from the body in digestive fluid called bile, but people with liver or gallbladder problems may end up with too much bilirubin that accumulates in their blood and skin. One side effect of jaundice is intense and uncontrollable itching. Researchers are not sure what causes this itching, and there are few treatments that help to relieve it.</p><p>At the molecular level, itching sensations occur when compounds bind to particular receptors on the surface of nerve cells. One family of receptors that can trigger itch is called the Mas-related G-protein Coupled Receptor (MRGPR). Could one of these receptors trigger jaundice-related itching?</p><p>Now, Meixiong, Vasavda et al. show that bilirubin binds to and activates MRGPRs to cause itch in mice. Whereas injecting bilirubin into normal mice causes them to scratch, mice that have been genetically engineered to lack MRGPRs do not itch when their own bilirubin levels rise, or when they are injected with bilirubin or with plasma from patients who experience jaundice-related itching. Furthermore, removing bilirubin from the plasma of patients before it was injected into normal mice reduced the amount of itching that the mice felt.</p><p>Overall, the results reported by Meixiong, Vasavda et al. suggest that drugs that prevent bilirubin from attaching to MRGPRs might help to alleviate jaundice-related itching. However, researchers must first verify that bilirubin interacts with MRGPRs in people to cause itch. If bilirubin causes itch in people like in mice, scientists could then evaluate existing drugs or make new ones to prevent bilirubin from attaching to the MRGPRs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cholestasis</kwd><kwd>itch</kwd><kwd>Mrgpr</kwd><kwd>bilirubin</kwd><kwd>sensory neuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH18501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Snyder</surname><given-names>Solomon H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS054791</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Xinzhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Xinzhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI135186</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Xinzhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MRGPRX4 is a bilirubin receptor that may be a therapeutic target for patients suffering from cholestatic itch.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic pruritus, or itch, is a complex and often debilitating symptom that accompanies a range of cutaneous and non-cutaneous diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ständer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yosipovitch and Bernhard, 2013a</xref>). The most widely known pruritogen is histamine, which is secreted by mast cells in the skin and activates histamine receptors on nearby sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bautista et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ikoma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">LaMotte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yosipovitch and Bernhard, 2013b</xref>). While viable treatments exist for histamine-mediated itch, most non-histaminergic conditions are more difficult to treat because the mediators are often unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kremer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Jaundice, or yellowing of the skin, sclera, and mucosa due to abnormal accumulation of the yellow heme metabolite bilirubin, is commonly associated with chronic non-histaminergic pruritus. Jaundice often presents in patients with hepatobiliary disorders such as cholestasis, characterized by impaired bile flow. Physiologically, bilirubin is typically bound to albumin in serum and concentrates in the liver, where it is conjugated to glucuronic acid and subsequently excreted in bile. At physiologic and mildly elevated concentrations (0.2–2.7 mg/dL, 3.4–46.2 μM), bilirubin is benign. At highly elevated levels however, such as in cutaneous jaundice (&gt;5 mg/dL, &gt;85.5 μM bilirubin), it is associated with pruritus, a correlation first noted by physicians as early as the second century B.C.E.

To determine whether bilirubin directly elicits pruritus, we subcutaneously injected bilirubin into the napes of mice. Pathophysiologic concentrations of bilirubin stimulated scratching in a dose-dependent manner at the site of injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Pre-incubating bilirubin with excess human serum albumin, which binds bilirubin with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Breaven et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Griffiths et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacobsen and Brodersen, 1983</xref>), elicited fewer scratches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The behavioral profile of bilirubin-induced scratching mirrored that of two well-characterized pruritogens, histamine and chloroquine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, histamine and chloroquine only elicit itch when injected into mice at millimolar concentrations despite having nanomolar affinity towards their receptors. In comparison, bilirubin elicited a similar degree of itch even when injected at lower concentrations than histamine or chloroquine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since mice indiscriminately scratch at the nape if injected with substances that trigger either itch or pain, we also injected mice at the cheek. Unlike at the nape, painful sensations at the cheek evoke a distinct wiping behavior instead of scratching, whereas itchy sensations still elicit scratching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shimada and LaMotte, 2008</xref>). Injecting bilirubin in the cheek prompted dose-dependent scratching just as it did at the nape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Bilirubin elicited neither wiping nor licking, indicating that it selectively triggers itch and not pain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44116.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Bilirubin elicits non-histaminergic, <italic>Mrgpr</italic>-dependent pruritus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scratching bouts associated with injection of bilirubin.

We assessed whether ditaurate bilirubin, a distinct but similar bilirubin derivative, could activate MRGPRA1. Indeed, ditaurate bilirubin activated MRGPRA1-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Of the four human MRGPRX receptors, only MRGPRX4-expressing cells responded to bilirubin (EC<sub>50</sub> of 61.9 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azimi et al., 2017</xref>)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,I</xref>). U73122 and YM-254890 inhibited bilirubin-induced calcium responses in MRGPRX4-expressing cells just as with MRGPRA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>). Conjugated bilirubin also activated MRGPRX4, whereas hemin had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that bilirubin directly binds the identified receptors, we assayed thermophoresis of each receptor in the presence and absence of bilirubin. Thermophoresis of a molecule is affected by physical parameters such as size, charge, and solvation. By extension, the thermophoresis of one molecule is altered when it interacts with another, and can therefore be used to measure interactions between molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duhr and Braun, 2006</xref>). Using this approach, we determined that bilirubin bound MRGPRA1 with a K<sub>D</sub> of 92.9 ± 15 µM and MRGPRX4 with a K<sub>D</sub> of 54.4 ± 13 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,J</xref>). Bilirubin exhibited little to no affinity for the closely related BAM8-22 receptor MRGPRC11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref>). Hemin, which did not activate MRGPRA1 or MRGPRX4 by calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,I</xref>), also did not bind MRGPRA1 or MRGPRX4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,J</xref>). Conjugated bilirubin bound both MRGPRA1 and MRGPRX4, although with a lower affinity than unconjugated bilirubin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,J</xref>). To make certain that bilirubin activates MRGPRA1 and MRGPRX4 upon binding, we measured exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP), one of the first events in GPCR signaling. Bilirubin increased GTP binding to MRGPRA1 and MRGPRX4 membrane complexes, but not to MRGPRC11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). To confirm that bilirubin activates MRGPRA1 <italic>in vivo</italic> to trigger itch, we generated an <italic>Mrgpra1</italic> (A1 KO) knockout mouse line using CRISPR-Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). A1 KO animals scratched significantly less than WT mice after exposure to either bilirubin or the established agonist FMRF, demonstrating that Mrgpra1 is functional in adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L–M</xref>). The K<sub>D</sub> of bilirubin towards MRGPRA1 and MRGPRX4 suggests that bilirubin likely does not interact with these receptors in healthy individuals. Additional ligands with nanomolar affinities towards MRGPRA1 or MRGPRX4 may exist that modulate the receptors in normal physiology.</p><p>We reasoned that if bilirubin triggers itch through MRGPRA1 and MRGPRX4, bilirubin should activate these receptors in sensory itch neurons. Previous studies have demonstrated that both Mrgpra1 and MRGPRX4 are expressed in sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flegel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lembo et al., 2002</xref>). Mrgpra1 is expressed in a subset of adult DRG and trigeminal ganglia (TG) sensory neurons that innervate the skin and ramify in lamina I and II of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Bilirubin elicited robust action potentials in small-diameter (&lt;30 µm) WT DRG sensory neurons at a proportion consistent with the percentage of sensory neurons that encode itch (5 of 50). Bilirubin failed to elicit action potentials in A1 KO neurons (0 of 60), suggesting bilirubin activates sensory neurons through MRGPRA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Bilirubin-sensitive neurons had an average somal diameter of 20.4 ± 1.3 µm, a diameter characteristic of itch sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Applying bilirubin to neurons elicited calcium transients in approximately 5% of WT DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), whereas significantly fewer sensory neurons from either Mrgpr-cluster KO or A1 KO mice responded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

However, Mrgpr-cluster KO and A1 KO mice scratched markedly less than WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that MRGPRA1 mediates a component of hepatobiliary pruritus. In humans, bile acids, endogenous opioids, and LPA are often increased in cholestatic sera and have been shown to mediate pruritus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alemi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergasa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergasa et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kremer et al., 2010</xref>). The serum of ANIT-treated animals exhibited elevated bilirubin and bile acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>), whereas neither the endogenous opioid peptide met-enkephalin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thornton and Losowsky, 1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thornton and Losowsky, 1989b</xref>) nor the LPA-producing enzyme autotaxin were elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). To assess whether other cholestatic pruritogens act at MRGPRs in mice, we injected WT and Mrgpr-cluster KO with deoxycholic acid (a bile acid), opiates, and LPA. These other cholestatic pruritogens elicited equivalent degrees of scratching in WT and Mrgpr-cluster KO animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Mrgprs are promiscuous receptors. It should be noted that there remain multiple bile acids, LPA molecules, and opiates which remain untested that may be agonists of Mrgprs. Based on this data, we hypothesized that Mrgpr-cluster KO and A1 KO mice scratched less with ANIT because MRGPRA1 mediates bilirubin-induced itch.</p><p>To determine whether bilirubin is activating MRGPRA1 to stimulate itch in cholestasis, we induced cholestasis in a mouse that lacks the biosynthetic enzyme for bilirubin, biliverdin reductase (BVR KO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kutty and Maines, 1981</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). BVR KO mice lack <italic>Blvra</italic>, the gene that encodes for bilirubin reductase. BVR KO mice do not have detectable levels of bilirubin in plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>). When treated with ANIT, BVR KO mice scratched significantly less than WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Plasma levels of bile acids, ALP, AST, ALT, GGT, met-enkephaline, and autotaxin were indistinguishable between treated BVR KO animals and WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Their diminished response to ANIT is not due to aberrant itch circuits, as BVR KO mice scratched normally when injected with either chloroquine or exogenous bilirubin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3E–F</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that the observed differences in cholestatic pruritus were not just specific to ANIT, we administered the hepatotoxin cyclosporin A to WT, A1 KO, and BVR KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laupacis et al., 1981</xref>). We treated mice with either 50 mg/kg cyclosporin A or vehicle for eight days before assessing spontaneous itch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Cyclosporin A induced spontaneous itch in WT animals, whereas A1 KO and BVR KO mice again scratched significantly less than WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–H</xref>).</p><p>Notably, we found that plasma bilirubin correlates poorly with cholestatic itch in patients and in cholestatic animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). We hypothesized that the levels of bilirubin in the skin would correlate better with itch than serum bilirubin largely because bilirubin likely binds and activates the sensory neurons in the skin. Unlike with serum, skin bilirubin appears to be a much stronger predictor of itch severity in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). This is consistent with the anatomical distribution of itch sensory neurons and may explain why studies aimed at identifying plasma pruritogens that correlate with itch severity may have missed bilirubin. Secondarily, we find that plasma bilirubin does not correlate well with skin bilirubin, further suggesting that plasma bilirubin may be a poor predictor of itch severity and may not necessarily serve as a proxy for skin bilirubin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). The amount of bilirubin in the skin is likely affected by several factors and equilibria, such as serum albumin.</p><p>We assessed whether pharmacologically antagonizing MRGPRs could alleviate cholestatic itch. Recently, a 3-amino acid peptide, QWF, was identified as an MRGPRA1 antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azimi et al., 2016</xref>). QWF abolished bilirubin-associated calcium signaling in MRGPRA1-expressing cells with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2.9 μM [1, 5] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Mirroring its pharmacology <italic>in vitro</italic>, co-injecting 0.25 mg/kg QWF with bilirubin significantly alleviated pruritus associated with bilirubin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). QWF specifically antagonized bilirubin, as it did not attenuate chloroquine-MRGPRA3 associated itch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Lastly, we evaluated whether the MRGPRA1 antagonist QWF could alleviate cholestatic pruritus. We dosed WT animals with ANIT as previously described, but intraperitoneally injected mice with either vehicle or 1 mg/kg QWF thirty minutes prior to behavioral analysis. Mice treated with QWF scratched significantly less than vehicle-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). QWF treatment did not change plasma levels of total bilirubin, AST, ALT, or ALP, suggesting that QWF treatment did not alter the underlying liver pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–H</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44116.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>QWF treatment blocks bilirubin activation of Mrgpra1 and cholestatic pruritus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Concentration-response curve for bilirubin induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in MRGPRA1-expressing HEK cells. 200 µM bilirubin was maintained in competition with indicated doses of QWF.

Our results reveal that bilirubin itself is a pruritogen that evokes itch by binding and activating MRGPRs on sensory neurons and may be an overlooked source of some patients’ unrelenting itch. The K<sub>D</sub> of bilirubin towards MRGPRA1 and MRGPRX4 suggests that bilirubin likely only interacts and activates these receptors in individuals with markedly elevated bilirubin and not in healthy people. More narrowly in hepatobiliary diseases such as cholestasis, our data supports a model in which bilirubin is one of several pruritogens that contributes to itch. Specifically, we find that genetically removing either MRPGRA1 (A1 KO) or bilirubin (BVR KO) both strongly attenuated itch. However, these mutant mice still exhibit greater itch compared to untreated mice. This suggests that other pruritogens contribute to itch alongside bilirubin in hepatobiliary disease, consistent with the diverse and complex presentations of patients suffering from conditions such as chronic pruritus. Other responsible pruritogens could include bile acids, endogenous opioids, and LPA. While depleting bilirubin in jaundiced patients like in mice may be effective in reducing itch, not every patient who suffers from hepatobiliary pruritus is jaundiced. Accordingly, identifying and depleting other pruritogens may similarly reduce itch.</p><p>Although our findings directly illustrate that bilirubin is pruritic, it is also clear that not every patient with jaundice experiences itch. For example, patients with genetic hyperbilirubinemias such as Dubin-Johnson syndrome, a disorder involving mutations in the bilirubin transporter ABCC2, or Crigler-Najjar Type 1, a disorder involving mutations in the bilirubin glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A1, rarely complain of pruritus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levitt and Levitt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van der Veere et al., 1996</xref>). Moreover, neonates can have high levels of bilirubin in their skin but not itch. Bilirubin thus appears to exert selective pruritic activity in certain contexts, which we hypothesize may derive from its dynamic biophysical behavior and complex network of interactions.</p><p>In isolated genetic hyperbilirubinemias, few – if any – other organic metabolites are elevated. In contrast, several other metabolites are elevated in addition to bilirubin in cholestasis, many of which may alter the equilibrium between bilirubin and albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alemi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacobsen and Brodersen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalir et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kozaki et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, bilirubin’s affinity for albumin and other lipoproteins is disrupted by numerous agents in bile that are upregulated specifically in cholestasis. Bilirubin also exhibits distinct chemical behavior in cholestatic serum, and several groups have suggested that bile acids affect bilirubin’s solubility and conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ostrow and Celic, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rege et al., 1988</xref>). Accordingly, it is reasonable to speculate that bilirubin is more likely bound to albumin in isolated hyperbilirubinemias than in cholestasis, and is therefore less likely to enter the skin in conditions like Dubin-Johnson. Notably, a predictive metrics for cholestatic pruritus is the Mayo risk score, which considers both serum bilirubin and albumin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Talwalkar et al., 2003</xref>). The Mayo risk score predicts that itch burden increases with increasing bilirubin and decreasing albumin levels; in such circumstances, bilirubin is less likely bound to albumin and is free to enter other tissues such as the skin. Crigler-Najjar patients may be even less likely to complain of itch than Dubin-Johnson patients because the standard treatments for Crigler-Najjar (phenobarbital and light therapy) may directly interfere with bilirubin’s pruritic activity. Specifically, light therapy induces photoisomerization and/or photolysis of bilirubin, which alter its structure and activity. Phenobarbital itself acts by broadly decreasing neural excitability, and may dampen itch circuitry alongside other central nervous system circuits. Notwithstanding these questions, our results suggest that blocking MRGPRX4 may offer relief to those suffering from jaundice and/or cholestatic-associated pruritus.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Gene (M.

Control plasma was isolated from donors who did not exhibit kidney or liver disease, had no complaints of itch, and were free from any detectable viral infection (HCV, HBV, HIV). Both cholestatic and control plasma were isolated under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (Cholestasis Study number: IRB00154650; Control study number: NA_00013177, the Johns Hopkins Department of Dermatology Patient Database and Tissue Bank). Whole blood was collected into PAXgene tubes (PreAnalytiX 761115) and centrifuged for 5 min at 300 g. Plasma was then collected, aliquoted, and stored at −20°C until experimentation. At time of plasma collection, a 5D itch questionnaire was administered.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Molecules and preparation</title><p>The following molecules were used: bilirubin IXα (Frontier Scientific). α-naphthyl isothiocyanate (ANIT, Sigma), biliverdin (Sigma), chloroquine (Sigma), compound 48/80 (Sigma), cyclosporin A (Sigma), hemin (Sigma), human serum albumin (HSA, Sigma), BAM8-22 (Sigma), BOC-GLN-D-(FORMYL)TRP-PHE-BENZYLESTER (QWF, Sigma), bilirubin ditaurate (Lee Biosciences). cetirizine (Tocris Biosciences), stercobilin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), urobilinogen (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FMRF peptide (Sigma), cholera toxin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), U73122 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), YM-254890 (Wako Chemicals), pertussis toxin (Fisher Scientific), fibronectin (Sigma), ruthenium red (Sigma), Fluo 4-AM (Molecular Probes), and Fura 2-AM (Molecular Probes).</p><p>Bilirubin is highly susceptible to oxidation and photolysis. Accordingly, bilirubin was freshly prepared just prior to each experiment in either DMSO or 0.1 M NaOH and then maintained in the dark. For calcium imaging analyses, bilirubin was diluted into calcium imaging buffer a few seconds before use. Final concentration of DMSO in all applicable tested solutions was &lt;0.5%. ANIT and cyclosporin A were dissolved in olive oil and prepared freshly as needed. Urobilinogen and stercobilin were dissolved in phosphate buffered saline and adjusted to a pH of 7.4 before being stored at −20°C in 100 μl aliquots until needed. To maintain the integrity of bilirubin in human plasma samples, samples were stored at −80°C until use. Plasma stocks were maintained in the dark to minimize photolysis during injection or experimental manipulation. Plasma bilirubin was evaluated by HPLC as described above. All other drugs were prepared as 100 μl – 1,000 μl aliquots and stored at −20°C before thawing at 4°C. Freeze/thaw cycles were avoided whenever possible. To remove microprecipitates, we centrifuged our bilirubin solutions at 21,000 g for 20 min to ensure that bilirubin was in solution. Whenever physiologically and experimentally reasonable, we excluded divalent cations in our in vitro biophysical experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioral studies</title><p>All applicable behavioral tests were performed and analysed with the experimenter blind to genotype. All mice used were 8–12 week old males and females (20 to 30 g) that had either been generated on a C57BL/6J background or backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice for at least 10 generations. There were no significant differences in itch between male and female mice. All itch behavior experiments were performed between 8 a.m. and 12 p.m. On the day before the experiment, animals were placed in the test chamber for 30 min before being subjected to a series of three mock injections with 5 min break periods in between. On the day of the experiment, animals were first allowed to acclimatize to the test chamber for 10 min before injection. Pruritic compounds were subcutaneously injected into the nape of the neck (50 μL volume) or cheek (10 μL volume), and scratching behavior was observed for 30 min. A bout of scratching was defined as a continuous scratching movement with either hindpaw directed at the area of the injection site. In the cheek injection model, a wipe was defined as a single forepaw stroking the site of the injection. Use of both forepaws on the face or cheek was considered as grooming behavior. Scratching behavior was quantified by counting the number of scratching bouts at 5 min intervals over the 30 min observation period. Wiping was quantified at 2 min intervals over a ten-minute observation period. For H1R block, 30 mg/kg of cetirizine HCl (pH 7.4) was given intraperitoneally thirty minutes prior to injection of bilirubin. Licking behavior was quantified in seconds and identified as the licking of the toes or footpad of the hind paw site of injection that was neither preceded nor followed by licking of any other portion of the body. For QWF co-injection experiments, either 100 µM (for bilirubin) or 500 µM (for chloroquine) QWF was injected in the same volume as solubilized pruritogen.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Generation of knock-in and knock-out mice</title><p><italic>Mrgpr-clusterΔ</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, <italic>Mrgpra1</italic><sup>GFP</sup> mice, and <italic>Mrgprd</italic><sup>PLAP</sup> were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2007</xref>).

Images were taken 30 min after peripheral stimulation of DRG via injection of vehicle or bilirubin by Hamilton syringe (5 μl) Throughout imaging, body temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5°C with a heating pad and rectal temperature monitoring. Anesthesia was maintained with 2% isoflourane and pure oxygen delivered through nosecone.</p><p>Raw image stacks were collected, deconvoluted, and imported into ImageJ (NIH). Optical planes from sequential time points were re-aligned and motion-corrected using the stackreg rigid-body cross-correlation-based image alignment plugin in ImageJ. Calcium signaling amplitudes were expressed as F<sub>t</sub> /F<sub>0</sub> as a function of time. F<sub>0</sub> was defined as the average pixel intensity during the first two to six frames of each imaging experiment. All neurons that displayed a &gt; 0.25 F<sub>0</sub> change from baseline were selected for further analysis. In subsequent analysis, neurons that displayed a &gt; 0.25 F<sub>0</sub> change during either the baseline or the saline imaging periods were excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Mouse models of cholestasis and sample collection</title><p>1-naphthyl isothiocyanate (ANIT; Sigma) was solubilized in olive oil (Sigma). Animals were dosed with 25 mg/kg ANIT <italic>per os</italic> daily for five days. On day five, animals were acclimatized for itch behavior. On day six, animals were placed in test chambers and videotaped for one hour. The number of scratching bouts, defined as a continuous scratching movement with either hindpaw, was counted and binned in five minute intervals during the one hour period. After itch behavior was assessed, animals were administered pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, <italic>i.p.)</italic>. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and placed into heparinized tubes (BD Biosciences). After centrifugation, plasma was collected, aliquoted, and stored at −20°C until analysis. Bile acid levels were assessed by a fluorometric kit from Cell Biolabs. When applicable, mice were then proceeded for histology. For QWF antagonism of cholestatic itch, Day 5 ANIT-treated animals were dosed with either 1 mg/kg QWF dissolved in PBS or PBS vehicle <italic>i.v.</italic> via tail vein injection approximately 10 min before behavioral assessment of spontaneous itch. The dose was chosen based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azimi et al., 2017</xref>) as well as published pK data indicating stability in plasma (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 70 min).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Skin bilirubin extraction</title><p>The skin of mice were exposed by applying a hair removal cream for 5 min, after which the skin was excised from the back and nape of mice and frozen at −80°C until processing. To extract skin bilirubin, skin was finely minced with a blade and then dounce homogenized at 4°C in 99% chloroform/1% glacial acetic acid (v/v). The organic layer was separated from any remaining tissue by centrifugation at 4°C at 16,000 g for 10 min. The organic layer was subsequently washed in 1% glacial acetic acid, then 0.2 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and then H<sub>2</sub>O. The organic layer was evaporated with a speedvac until the pellet was dry, after which the pellet was resolubilized in buffer (50 mM Tris,150 mM NaCl, 1% TritonX-100, 5% glycerol at pH 7.4). The final pellet was resuspended as thoroughly as possible, but was unfortunately relatively insoluble. The calculated yield was 1.83 ± 0.2463 (SD) % and accordingly factored in to normalize skin bilirubin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>UnaG purification</title><p>UnaG was expressed in pMAL-6P2-6xHIS in BL21(DE3) cells. Starter cultures were grown to saturation overnight in Luria Broth (LB) at 37°C. Starter cultures were then diluted 10-fold in LB and grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.3 at 37°C, after which cultures were moved to 18°C. At OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6, protein expression was induced by the addition of 400 μM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 hr at 18°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 15 ml of resuspension buffer (50 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 2.34 μM leupeptin, 1.45 μM pepstatin at pH 7.4) per liter of culture, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80°C.</p><p>For purification, pellets were thawed on ice and sonicated to lyse. Lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 26,000 g at 4°C for 30 min and subsequently loaded onto an amylose column. Protein was eluted with 20 mM maltose in protease buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 10% glycerol, 0.01% TritonX-100 at pH 7.4), after which the MBP was were removed by the addition of Prescission Protease (GE Healthcare) for 16 hr at 4°C. UnaG was further purified by a second nickel-affinity step to remove the cleaved tag and Prescission Protease. Protein was further purified on a gel-filtration column (S-200, GE Healthcare) in 50 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 10% glycerol at pH 7.4. The purity of peak fractions was assessed by SDS-PAGE. The purified protein was concentrated using a 10 kDa MWCO filter (Amicon) and flash frozen in gel filtration buffer supplemented with 30% glycerol for storage at −80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Patient plasma and skin bilirubin quantification</title><p>To measure plasma bilirubin, patient plasma was diluted 1:20 in HBSS containing purified UnaG. To measure skin bilirubin, UnaG was added directly After a 10 min incubation at 25°C, bilirubin was quantified by interpolating from a standard curve. Samples with blood and hemolysis were excluded from analysis. Skin bilirubin was ormalized to the dry weight of the skin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Plasma bilirubin depletion</title><p>Plasma bilirubin was depleted either by selective oxidation by FeCl<sub>3</sub> to biliverdin IXα/biliverdin XIIIα or by immunoprecipitation. FeCl<sub>3</sub> was prepared as solution of 20% FeCl<sub>3</sub> in 0.1N HCl/methanol. FeCl<sub>3</sub> was fluxed with plasma at a final concentration of 1.5% FeCl<sub>3</sub> at 37°C for 10 min. FeCl<sub>3</sub> is a mild oxidant but exhibits a redox potential that the oxidation of bilirubin to biliverdin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolphin, 1978</xref>). Bilirubin was also immunopreciptated by incubating plasma with 5 μg of either normal rabbit IgG or anti-bilirubin antibody (generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doré et al., 1999</xref>)) coupled to protein A/G beads for 1 hr at 25°C. To quantify bilirubin depletion, bilirubin was extracted from samples with 100% methanol and subjected to HPLC and UV-visible spectroscopic analysis. Absorbance was adjusted to a baseline of 0 OD, and bilirubin was quantified by integrating the area under the chromatographic peak.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)</title><p>Plasma bilirubin was detected by HPLC using an analytical LC-18 column, 25 cm ×4.6 mm (Xterra, Waters Corporation). Bilirubin was eluted with gradients of mobile phases: 0.1 M ammonium acetate in 60% methanol/40% water (v/v) (pH 5.2) (Solvent A) and 100% methanol (Solvent B). Bilirubin was eluted as follows: 0 to 14 min: linear gradient from 100% A to 100% B; 14 to 19 min: linear gradient from 100% A to 100% B; 19–24 min: isocratic elution at 100% A. Bilirubin exhibited a retention time of approximately 14–15 min and was detected by measuring absorbance at 450 nm. The peak corresponding to plasma bilirubin was confirmed with the addition of 10 μM bilirubin to the sample as an internal standard.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Group data were expressed as mean ±SEM unless otherwise noted. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-tests, Fisher’s exact test, and Chi-squared tests were used to determine significance in statistical comparisons, and differences were considered significant at p&lt;0.05. Statistical power analysis was used to justify sample size, and variance was determined to be similar among all treatment groups as determined by F test. No samples or animals subjected to successful procedures and/or treatments were excluded from analysis. All behavior experiments were designed in a blocked manner with consideration for both genotype and treatment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Cynthia Wolberger, Dr. Patrick Lombardi, Ms. Adele Snowman, Ms. Nadine Forbes, Mr. Chip Hawkins, and Dr. Xintong Dong for assistance with experiments.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Identification of a bilirubin receptor that mediates a component of cholestatic itch&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including David Ginty as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mark Hoon (Reviewer #2); Ethan Lerner (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting, well-performed study that implicates bilirubin and the Mrgpr family members MRGPRA1 and human MRGPRX4 expressed on DRG and trigeminal sensory neurons as mediators of cholestatic itch. There is a lot to like about this study, including the finding that bilirubin promotes itch in mice, that it binds to and activates MRGPRA1 and human MRGPRX4, and using previously described and new knockouts these receptors mediate a component of cholestatic itch, including that evoked through transfer via human plasma. The reviewers are in favor of publication of this study in <italic>eLife</italic>. A few points for the authors to address/consider are noted below.</p><p>Requested revisions:</p><p>1) Does the injection of bilirubin into human subjects evoke itch? A positive result would markedly enhance the significance of this manuscript while a negative result would raise concerns. While not required for acceptance, this experiment would enhance the study.</p><p>2) Are there positive controls for the negative findings in the receptor activation assays? Are all other Mrgpr family members expressed and functional in the HEK293 cell calcium response assay? Please discuss this point.</p><p>3) There are only four figures and a lot of figure supplements. While not required, the authors may consider some re-organization of the figures.</p><p>4) In the summary paragraph, it is stated that MrgprA1 has not been characterized. That is not accurate. MrgprA1 has been characterized with respect to amino acid residues required for ligand binding and receptor activation, ligands including substance P and 48/80, and function, i.e., itch. In fact, MrgprA1 is functionally quite similar to MRGPRX2. Please discuss this point.</p><p>5) The EC<sub>50</sub> for bilirubin on MrgprA1 and MRGPRX4 was determined to be 145.9 and 61.9 μM respectively. A comment could be added to the Discussion that this modest EC<sub>50</sub> may contribute to why a markedly elevated bilirubin is needed to cause itch.</p><p>6) Previous work from this group has indicated that MrgprA1 may not be functionally relevant in adult mice. Are you now suggesting that MrgprA1 may be functionally relevant in adult mice? Do essentially all MrgprA3 neurons express MrgprA1? This topic is relevant to the sensory neuroscience community as the role of MrgprA1 in itch has been questioned.</p><p>7) It is stated that LPA does not activate MrgprA1 and that there is no difference between LPA-induced itch in WT versus MrgprA1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. A close look at the data indicates that MrgprA1<sup>-/-</sup> mice may scratch less than WT. There are many forms of LPA. We have data that certain LPAs activate MrgprA1. I am not suggesting more experiments, rather that the wording be less dogmatic and leave somewhat open the question of LPA interaction with Mrgprs.</p><p>8) Please acknowledge that neonates can have high levels of bilirubin in their skin but not itch, leaving open the discussion to possible mechanisms.</p><p>9) In the Materials and methods, it is noted that bilirubin must be handled with care and used rapidly. How was this stability concern addressed with respect to the human samples?</p><p>10) In Figure 1—figure supplement 2, there is a graphical depiction of suggested homologies between mouse and human <italic>Mrgpr</italic>s. This depiction is too simplistic. It should include the endogenous neuropeptide substance P, not only non-endogenous pruritogens chloroquine, compound 48/80. I am not sure what to do about BAM8-22 as it is sort of mixed. A line between A1 and Χ2 should be added. Even if their predominant expression is on different cells, there is no reason that the match between mice and human would be expected to be parallel. In addition, QWF is an antagonist of A1 and Χ2. If it is not an antagonist of the interaction between bilirubin and X4, then this would provide further data that the homology between A1 and X4 is imperfect. Please discuss this.</p><p>11) Summary paragraph. MrgprA1 was characterized as a receptor for FMRF, quinine, and partially responds to chloroquine by Liu et al. (2009). Therefore, it is incorrect to say that <italic>Mrgpra1</italic> is an uncharacterized <italic>Mrgpr</italic>. Please modify this statement.</p><p>12) Results, eighth paragraph. The human <italic>MrgprX</italic> family of receptors may have functional similarities between species but have no structural homologs in rodents, this should be clarified by citing Zylka et al. (2003) and Solinski, Gudermann and Breit (2014).</p><p>13) Previously the &quot;Cluster knockout&quot; was named Mrgpr-clusterΔ<sup>−/+</sup> in previous publications by this group, to prevent confusion, it would be better if the same name was used in this publication.</p><p>14) Results, twelfth paragraph and Discussion, first paragraph. It would be reasonable to cite Alemi et al. (2013).</p><p>15) Since there is no direct data implicating either bilirubin or MRGPRX4 in human itch, the title should be modified. Once suggestion is the addition of the word 'may' before 'mediate(s)'.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44116.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Requested revisions:</p><p>1) Does the injection of bilirubin into human subjects evoke itch?

We are currently collaborating on an IRB-approved project (HIC#: 12780) to test whether injecting bilirubin into humans evokes itch. Unfortunately, completion of this trial will require substantial time and resources, making it difficult to complete in a timely and comprehensive manner. At least one author, J.M., has volunteered in the aforementioned study and can report an intense, long-lasting itch in response to pathophysiologic levels of bilirubin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Are there positive controls for the negative findings in the receptor activation assays?

Please discuss this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting an important assumption in our experiments. To ensure we would observe a calcium response following a true ligand-receptor interaction, we expressed each receptor in HEK293 cells stably expressing the G-protein alpha-subunit G<sub>α15</sub>, a Gα protein that couples GPCRs to intracellular calcium stores via phospholipase C (PLC) (Results, sixth paragraph). For Mrgprs with established ligands (MRGPRX1, Χ2, A1, A3, B2, C11, D), functionality and activity was validated by treatment with the established ligand after applying bilirubin (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). For Mrgprs without established ligands, we assayed for cellular expression of each receptor by qPCR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are only four figures and a lot of figure supplements. While not required, the authors may consider some re-organization of the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the figures should be re-organized to improve clarity and readability.

In fact, MrgprA1 is functionally quite similar to MRGPRX2. Please discuss this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely apologize for the incorrect description of MrgprA1 as “uncharacterized.” We have modified the statement to read “Bilirubin binds and activates two Mrgprs, mouse MRGPRA1 and human MRGPRX4” and we have also cited the relevant studies (Azimi et al., 2016, 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The EC<sub>50</sub> for bilirubin on MrgprA1 and MRGPRX4 was determined to be 145.9 and 61.9 μM respectively. A comment could be added to the Discussion that this modest EC<sub>50</sub> may contribute to why a markedly elevated bilirubin is needed to cause itch.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the affinity of the receptors for bilirubin may explain why healthy individuals do not itch in response to normal levels of plasma bilirubin. We added the following comment to the Discussion: “The K<sub>D</sub> of bilirubin towards MRGPRA1 and MRGPRX4 suggests that bilirubin likely only interacts and activates these receptors in individuals with markedly elevated bilirubin and not in healthy people.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Previous work from this group has indicated that MrgprA1 may not be functionally relevant in adult mice. Are you now suggesting that MrgprA1 may be functionally relevant in adult mice? Do essentially all MrgprA3 neurons express MrgprA1? This topic is relevant to the sensory neuroscience community as the role of MrgprA1 in itch has been questioned.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the functionality and expression of MrgprA1 in adult mice is relevant to the sensory neuroscience community. Previous studies on MrgprA1 expression changes during development were determined by in situ <italic>hybridization</italic> which lacks sensitivity. Although adult mice may express less MrgprA1 than younger mice, we find that MrgprA1 is still expressed in the DRG, skin, trigeminal ganglion, and spinal cord in adult mice (Figure 3A-D). We have updated the text and figure legend to make it clear that these samples were taken from adult WT mice. Adult mice also scratch after treatment with the MrgprA1 agonist FMRF, further suggesting that MrgprA1 is also functional in adult mice. Critically, MrgprA1<sup>-/-</sup> mice scratch significantly less than WT mice (Figure 2M). To emphasize this functional relevance of MrgprA1 in adult mice, we have amended the tenth paragraph of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is stated that LPA does not activate MrgprA1 and that there is no difference between LPA-induced itch in WT versus MrgprA1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. A close look at the data indicates that MrgprA1<sup>-/-</sup> mice may scratch less than WT. There are many forms of LPA. We have data that certain LPAs activate MrgprA1. I am not suggesting more experiments, rather that the wording be less dogmatic and leave somewhat open the question of LPA interaction with Mrgprs.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for making the dogmatic claim that all LPAs do not activate MRGPRs. We have amended the text as follows: “Mrgprs are promiscuous receptors. It should be noted that there remain multiple bile acids, LPA molecules, and opiates which remain untested and could be agonists against Mrgprs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Please acknowledge that neonates can have high levels of bilirubin in their skin but not itch, leaving open the discussion to possible mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for overlooking neonatal cutaneous jaundice in our Discussion and have amended the second paragraph of the Discussion to further emphasis bilirubin’s contextual and complex pruritic activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In the Materials and methods, it is noted that bilirubin must be handled with care and used rapidly. How was this stability concern addressed with respect to the human samples?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting our oversight. We have amended the Materials and methods section to indicate that plasma samples were maintained and manipulated in the dark to prevent bilirubin photolysis. We also reiterate in this section that plasma bilirubin was evaluated and quantified by HPLC. “To maintain the integrity of bilirubin in human plasma samples, samples were stored at -80°C until use. […] Plasma bilirubin was evaluated by HPLC as described above.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In Figure 1—figure supplement 2, there is a graphical depiction of suggested homologies between mouse and human Mrgprs. This depiction is too simplistic. It should include the endogenous neuropeptide substance P, not only non-endogenous pruritogens chloroquine, compound 48/80. I am not sure what to do about BAM8-22 as it is sort of mixed. A line between A1 and Χ2 should be added. Even if their predominant expression is on different cells, there is no reason that the match between mice and human would be expected to be parallel. In addition, QWF is an antagonist of A1 and Χ2. If it is not an antagonist of the interaction between bilirubin and X4, then this would provide further data that the homology between A1 and X4 is imperfect. Please discuss this.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for over-simplifying and overlooking the diverse functional overlap and homology amongst the mouse and human Mrgprs. As the Mrgprs are particularly promiscuous and functionally diverse, we eliminated the graphic in order to avoid incorrectly suggesting rigid or universal human/mouse homology between receptors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Summary paragraph. MrgprA1 was characterized as a receptor for FMRF, quinine, and partially responds to chloroquine by Liu et al. (2009). Therefore, it is incorrect to say that Mrgpra1 is an uncharacterized Mrgpr. Please modify this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the incorrect portrayal of MrgprA1 as “uncharacterized”. We have modified the statement to read “Bilirubin binds and activates two Mrgprs, mouse MRGPRA1 and human MRGPRX4.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Results, eighth paragraph. The human MrgprX family of receptors may have functional similarities between species but have no structural homologs in rodents, this should be clarified by citing Zylka et al. (2003), and Solinski, Gudermann and Breit (2014).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for identifying and highlighting important studies and findings that add useful context to our work. We amended the paragraph to begin reading “The human MRGPRX family of receptors has functional similarities between species but have no obvious structural homologs in rodents.” We also cited the relevant studies suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Previously the &quot;Cluster knockout&quot; was named Mrgpr-clusterΔ−/+ in previous publications by this group, to prevent confusion, it would be better if the same name was used in this publication.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for identifying this inconsistency in our text. At the request of a mouse genetics nomenclature expert that the journal contacted, we have amended the text and figures by replacing &quot;Cluster <sup>-/-</sup>&quot; with “Mrgpr-cluster KO”. We note in the fourth paragraph of the Results, that Mrgpr-cluster KO refers to the previously published Mrgpr-clusterΔ<sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Results, twelfth paragraph and Discussion, first paragraph. It would be reasonable to cite Alemi et al. (2013).</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the text to cite this study in the Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Since there is no direct data implicating either bilirubin or MRGPRX4 in human itch, the title should be modified. Once suggestion is the addition of the word 'may' before 'mediate(s)'.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our data are limited to mouse models of human itch and do not directly demonstrate that bilirubin plays a role in human cholestatic itch. Accordingly, we have amended our title to read “Identification of a bilirubin receptor that <italic>may</italic> mediate a component of cholestatic itch”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
