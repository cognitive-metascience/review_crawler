suite of downstream regions. Accumulating evidence suggests that the subiculum pyramidal cell population may actually be comprised of discrete subclasses. Here, we investigated the extent and organizational principles governing pyramidal cell heterogeneity throughout the mouse subiculum. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we find that the subiculum pyramidal cell population can be deconstructed into eight separable subclasses. These subclasses were mapped onto abutting spatial domains, ultimately producing a complex laminar and columnar organization with heterogeneity across classical dorsal-ventral, proximal-distal, and superficial-deep axes. We further show that these transcriptomically defined subclasses correspond to differential protein products and can be associated with specific projection targets. This work deconstructs the complex landscape of subiculum pyramidal cells into spatially segregated subclasses that may be observed, controlled, and interpreted in future experiments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>subiculum</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>pyramidal cell</kwd><kwd>cell type</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cembrowski</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Lihua</given-names></name><name><surname>Lemire</surname><given-names>Andrew L</given-names></name><name><surname>Copeland</surname><given-names>Monique</given-names></name><name><surname>DiLisio</surname><given-names>Salvatore F</given-names></name><name><surname>Clements</surname><given-names>Jody</given-names></name><name><surname>Spruston</surname><given-names>Nelson</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pyramidal cells of the subiculum, a major output cell type of the hippocampus, can be deconstructed into distinct subtypes that exhibit a patchwork-like organization in space.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To interpret the complexity of the brain, neuroscience has sought to deconstruct brain regions and circuits into elemental and interpretable cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zeng and Sanes, 2017</xref>). Historically, this deconstruction has employed morphological and electrophysiological approaches, giving rise to the classical cell-type definitions that broadly delineate cells in the brain. Modern neuroscientific tools now enable high-throughput interrogation of complementary modalities, including gene expression and connectivity, to further partition and refine these cell types. Ultimately, a unified deconstruction of the nervous system will require projecting such modern, neurobiologically relevant elaborations onto classical cell types.</p><p>The hippocampus of the mammalian brain provides a comprehensively studied brain region to identify such cell-type-specific elaborations and relate them to function. This brain region has been studied extensively for its critical roles in episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scoville and Milner, 1957</xref>), spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978</xref>), and emotionally motivated behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kjelstrup et al., 2002</xref>). To date, evidence is emerging that suggests heterogeneity within classical cell types of the hippocampus may be an important feature for mediating hippocampal computation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cembrowski et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cembrowski et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Igarashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knierim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Soltesz and Losonczy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Strange et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>One of these classical cell types is the pyramidal cell type of the subiculum, which acts as an output from the hippocampus to a wide array of downstream targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggleton and Christiansen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Naber and Witter, 1998</xref>). We recently found that the dorsal pole of the subiculum can be partitioned into distinct proximal and distal subregions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cembrowski et al., 2018</xref>), motivating us to investigate whether additional heterogeneity could be revealed when considering the full spatial extent of the subiculum. Indeed, recent investigations using immunohistochemical labeling argue that the proximal subiculum is composed of a molecular layer and multiple cell body layers, each distinguished by molecular and morphological differences, while the distal subiculum is more uniform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishihara and Fukuda, 2016</xref>). Additionally, as specific downstream projections and postulated functional contributions change across space in the subiculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">BÃ¶hm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bubb et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishihara and Fukuda, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Naber and Witter, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">O'Mara et al., 2009</xref>), understanding subicular organizational rules will likely be critical for a cell-type-specific deconstruction of memory, cognition, and emotion.</p><p>Here, we took a multimodal approach to understanding the organizational logic of the subiculum. Using single-cell next-generation RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we found that subiculum pyramidal cells could be partitioned into eight subclasses. We were able to register these subclasses in space, uncovering a patchwork landscape of subicular subfields. We subsequently mapped these subfields onto specific protein products and projection targets. We provide these scRNA-seq data, in conjunction with analysis and visualization tools, as a public resource. In total, this work produces a multimodal deconstruction of a key brain region, and will serve as a foundation for continuing to unravel the cell-type-specific rules of cognition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overview of subiculum scRNA-seq atlas: construction, validation, and extension</title><p>We took two complementary approaches to obtain cells for our subiculum scRNA-seq atlas (overview: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; initial analysis: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

We identified cluster-specific marker genes for which Allen Mouse Brain Atlas coronal <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lein et al., 2007</xref>) images were available, and examined the spatial expression of these marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

We found that Kv4.3, a potassium channel pore-forming subunit encoded by <italic>Kcnd3</italic>, was depleted in distal subiculum (i.e. the <italic>Fn1</italic>-associated cluster 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, left).

These datasets included three projection targets: the prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NA), and amygdala.

In contrast, amygdala-projecting cells were largely associated with a single dedicated transcriptomic subclass (86% of amygdala-projecting cells were within the <italic>Gpc3</italic> cluster, relative to 8% and 17% of NA- and PFC-projecting cells).

Taking these results in combination with previous <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cembrowski et al., 2018</xref>), this demonstrates the existence of at least six discretely separable subclasses of subiculum pyramidal cells. Although not examined directly, it is possible that some remaining scRNA-seq clusters may comprise opposite extremes of a continua. On the other hand, there may be additional subiculum subclasses that may be revealed with greater cell number or sequencing depth. As a result, the eight scRNA-seq subclasses resolved here likely represent an approximation (and potentially, a lower bound) as to the ultimate number of true biological subclasses of subiculum pyramidal cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Transcriptomic heterogeneity as a predictor of functional heterogeneity</title><p>Understanding how heterogeneity within the hippocampus underpins function has conventionally been studied by comparing across classical hippocampal cell types (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaifosh and Losonczy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2014</xref>). Complementing this body of across-cell-type work, recent transcriptomic research has illustrated that heterogeneity within each classical hippocampal cell type is also prominent. This heterogeneity encompasses both discrete and continuous variation across dorsal-ventral, proximal-distal, and superficial-deep axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cembrowski et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cembrowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cembrowski et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Habib et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>). As higherÂ order cellular, circuit, and functional features also vary in related ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cembrowski and Spruston, 2018b</xref>, in review; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knierim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Soltesz and Losonczy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Strange et al., 2014</xref>), this suggests that transcriptomic identity can be coherently aligned with specialized functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cembrowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamawaki et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>It follows that the transcriptomically defined subclasses identified in this study likely vary according to higher-order structure and function. This postulate is further underscored by several complementary lines of evidence. For example, there is widespread differential expression of genes associated with neuronally relevant ontologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Additionally, in the case of broadly defined proximal-distal cell classes in the dorsal subiculum, dissociable higherÂ order structural and functional correlates have been previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cembrowski et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, for several of the transcriptomic classes identified in this study, transcriptomic identity covaries with protein products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and projection target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In combination, these lines of evidence indicate that the transcriptomic classes identified here correspond to functionally differentiable and relevant subclasses of subPCs.</p><p>How can such function be identified? In this study, we identified that subPCs can be deconstructed into a collection of discretely separated subclasses based upon disparate gene expression. This approach exploited gene expression heterogeneity as a means of cellular classification and spatial registration. As a consequence, this analysis was performed agnostic to the functional correlates of these genes; however, this work will help to provide a necessary foundation for assessing functional relevance in multiple ways. First, many of the differentially expressed genes in this study are associated with known functional roles in neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Consequently, these findings enable specific hypotheses to be generated and tested across subclasses. Second, as these subclasses can covary with projection target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), these predictions can be investigated and understood at the level of neuronal circuits. Third, our analysis provides individual genes as markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) that will enable these questions to be addressed at a subclass-specific resolution (e.g. via transgenic mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In total, this work will facilitate the coherent interrogation of molecular, cellular, and circuit properties of the specific subclasses of the subiculum.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Single-cell Hipposeq, a public resource for hippocampal scRNA-seq</title><p>Due to the data-rich nature of our subiculum scRNA-seq dataset, there are many additional features that can be mined and analyzed in further studies.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;The subiculum is a patchwork of discrete subregions&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor.</p><p>This paper was submitted as a Tools and Resources contribution and thus should not just serve to provide evidence of cell type heterogeneity in the subiculum. The contribution attempts to go further in providing markers that can be used to manipulate specific cell types in the subiculum, thereby potentially providing a valuable resource that would allow experiments that are not currently possible. However, without sufficient validation of the different classes of subiculum cells, other researchers may hesitate to use such a resource. As is apparent in the reviews, all reviewers had concerns about the lack of a sufficient number of biological replicates. We recommend that results should be replicated across multiple animals (i.e., at least 2 animals, preferably 3). Please also address reviewer 2 and 3's concerns about validation of the clusters (e.g., more detailed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization for multiple target mRNAs in the same section and/or immunostaining). The reviews are provided in their entirety below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting study that reports molecularly and anatomically distinct subgroups of cells in the subiculum, some of which are shown to project to different targets. These findings are important because they will allow for novel experiments in the future that test the functional consequences of manipulations of different of different types of hippocampal output (e.g., test the effects of subiculum projections to amygdala using <italic>Gpc3</italic> as a cell-specific marker). However, there are some points that remain to be clarified.</p><p>1) The term &quot;biological replicate&quot; seems misleading because the authors seem to report that cells from only one animal were analyzed for each region. Is this standard to only use one animal for each region? It seems as though this resource would be most significant to other researchers if the reproducibility of these clusters across animals was demonstrated.</p><p>2) In the Discussion, the authors state that they were &quot;agnostic to the functional correlates&quot; of the genes that serve to differentiate cell clusters. However, this should perhaps be explained earlier in the text, specifically in the section of the Results that describes Figure 2. Otherwise, readers may naturally wonder whether these gene expression patterns provide insights about functions of different cell groups.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Cembrowski and colleagues have used single cell RNA-seq to profile pyramidal neurons in the subiculum. They discover that there are 8 or 9 discrete cell types that span and tile the dorsal/ventral, proximal/distal, and superficial/deep axis of the subiculum. This is the most comprehensive analysis of the subiculum to date and of high quality and value. The authors have shared the data through addition to http://hipposeq.janelia.org â a searchable database that already includes data from many cell types in the hippocampus and is of significant value to the community. Finally, the authors use retro beads injected into the PFC, NA, and amygdala to identify subiculum pyramidal neuron that project to these regions and performed some preliminary analysis of these subtypes. This study uses methods and analyses previously developed/used by the Spruston lab to perform a comparable analysis of CA1/CA2/CA3/and DG.</p><p>1) The text should be clarified as to whether there are 8 or 9 clusters of cell types.</p><p>2) Can any of the clusters be validated with immunostaining or transgenic mouse lines?</p><p>3) In the final Results section describing projection specific-correlates of transcriptomic clusters, it is difficult to evaluate the strength of the data. How many neurons were labeled/profiled in each projection class? How complete was the coverage of the target area? The Materials and methods section indicates retro beads and AAV-SL1-CAG-tdTomato were used to label projections but in the Results section, it seems like just beads were used. This should be clarified. A visual for how the projection neurons map onto the spatial domains described in Figure 6 and layers in Figure 4, would be useful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study, Cembrowski et al. performed deep sequencing of RNA from manually isolated neurons from the subiculum. They identified clusters of neurons most of which were extended throughout the dorso-ventral span of the subiculum with variation in the antero-posterior (or proximo-distal) axis. The results confirm and extend previous observations of differences between the proximal and distal subiculum. The authors go on to show that projections of subicular neurons to the nucleus accumbens and amygdala might map onto their transcriptional identity.</p><p>The potential general interest of the study is that single-cell RNAseq is relatively new and has yet to be applied to the subiculum, which is an interesting brain area because of its roles in memory. The technique is powerful in that it can identify neurons based on transcriptional signatures and when combined with projection and positional identities it can provide a convincing picture of cell diversity in a brain area. The limitations of the present study are that the claimed conceptual advances are over-stated and that the utility of the resource is compromised by a lack of replicates and limited validation.</p><p>1) While the marker genes identified will be useful, layer topography and distinctions in the proximo-distal axis of the subiculum were already largely known. For example, Ishihara and Fukuda (Neuroscience, 2016) have provided strong evidence for a layered molecular organization of the subiculum (nicely summarised in Figure 15 of their paper) and already provide good evidence for the main conclusion expressed in the title of the present study. While their study is very briefly mentioned, its convincing, important and original contributions are not sufficiently acknowledged. They should be outlined in the Introduction and the present data should be compared more directly with their results in the Discussion. It is particularly important to clarify whether the protein markers they identify (e.g. NOS, PCP4, ZnT3) are useful markers at the mRNA level based on the present data. It may also be interesting to address whether the subiculum is analogous to the deep layers of the isocortex or neocortex.</p><p>2) The major potential contribution of the present study will likely be for groups wanting to investigate how gene expression patterns in each of the identified subclasses relate to neuronal function or signaling cascades. For this, we find a biological replicate of 1 is not sufficient. There is a real concern here that the results are not definitive, and the study may mislead rather than benefit future work. Since the authors invested effort in making the dataset public, biological replicates would enhance the reliability of their study once it goes in the public domain.</p><p>3) There seems to be an overlap in expression of the marker genes expressed by neurons projecting to each target area (Figure 7). For example, neurons projecting to the PFC express nearly all genes enhanced in all clusters, which weakens the conclusion that distinct transcriptional identities map onto projection choice. Similarly, NA and amygdala projection neurons express both <italic>Dlk1</italic> and <italic>Gpc3</italic>, albeit at different proportions. Perhaps with more animals sampled, the level of expression of marker genes will appear more even or more different? We suggest to either increase the number of animals in the sequencing assay, or to perform immunostaining / in situs to find out whether neurons projecting to each area are positive for subclass markers.</p><p>4) Selected genes in 5 out of the 8 clusters identified are lamina-specific, but some genes even though they belong to separate clusters seem to be expressed in an overlapping manner. For example, <italic>Cbln4</italic> looks like it is in the same lamina as <italic>Dlk1</italic> from single in-situs (Figure 4B). If the authors want to show this gene really marks a distinct class, they need to perform fluorescent ISH for this gene and <italic>Dlk1</italic>. For the same reason, <italic>Col5a</italic> and <italic>Dlk1</italic>, which are depicted as non-overlapping in Figure 6, need validation with double ISH. Also, <italic>Tpbg</italic> is depicted as restricted to the ventral half of the subiculum, even though it appears to be expressed more dorsally (Figure 3). A diagram indicating which genes are expressed in which lamina may also be helpful â this is hard to see in Figure 6.</p><p>5) In the Abstract, the claim &quot;the subiculum pyramidal cell population can be deconstructed into eight discretely separable subclasses&quot; is difficult to justify based on the data. There is no test of discreteness in the analysis and the t-SNE plots suggest that the suggested subclasses overlap / are contiguous.</p><p>6) Choices made in setting up the analysis pipeline, and the consequences of different choices, are not sufficiently explained. For example, to what extent does changing the cutoff thresholds in FindVariableGenes affect the subsequent clustering? To what extent is clustering affected by the resolution parameter? In generating the t-SNE plots what were the perplexity values and how many steps were used? Several sub-classes do not appear particularly well separated in the t-SNE plots. It may be that optimising perplexity or steps gives a better indication of separation, or it may be that they are not separable even with t-SNE.</p><p>7) Figure 4C-E and Figure 7âfigure supplement 1 require quantification of the numbers of cells and numbers of biological replicates.</p><p>8) Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B suggests that approximately 20-25% of cells are not classifiable. Does this population overlap across simulation runs? If so, what happens to the cell classification if these cells are excluded? For example, are the groupings cleaner?</p><p>9) For reproducibility, the main analysis code should be made available alongside the study. When doing so it would be helpful to make explicit the random number seeds used by Seurat and the version of Seurat used. When we used Seurat to analyze the dataset we obtained different, although qualitatively similar, plots to those in the manuscript. We guess this is because of differences in seeding but cannot know for sure. The methods should also make clear whether key analyses were repeated with different seeds and whether similar results were obtained.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The subiculum is a patchwork of discrete subregions&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook as Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. Please note that the remaining comments only require text revisions, not additional analyses or experiments. Specifically, we would like a clearer explanation of relevance to prior work and a softening of the conclusion that there are definitely eight separate subregions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The revisions do more to acknowledge previous work by Ishihara and Fukuda. However, this previous work is still not credited sufficiently. This doesn't affect the validity of the conclusions, nor the strong case for publishing the study, but a more scholarly approach to recognizing previous work would reflect well on the authors and the journal. We have some suggestions.</p><p>Introduction, third paragraph, acknowledges Ishihara and Fukuda, but their contribution is not made sufficiently clear here. Perhaps state, &quot;Recent investigations using immunohistochemical labeling argue that the proximal subiculum is composed of a molecular layer and multiple cell body layers, each distinguished by molecular and morphological differences, while the distal subiculum is more uniform (Ishihara and Fukuda, 2016).&quot;</p><p>Discussion, subsection âThe subiculum as a laminar and columnar structureâ, last paragraph. It's important to be clear here that prior evidence for and articulation of the idea that &quot;the subiculum can be deconstructed into proximal and distal subdomains, with further laminar organization predominantly found in proximal subiculum&quot; was provided in the previous study by Ishihara and Fukuda. We agree that the present results further refine their model, but as written the text could easily be interpreted as taking credit for ideas previously proposed by Ishihara and Fukuda. Also, the implication in the first paragraph of the aforementioned subsection, that Ishihara and Fukuda's scheme was based only on protein labeling is incorrect, as they also took account of neuronal morphology, something the present study doesn't do.</p><p>2) We're not convinced by the conclusion that the analysis supports the existence of eight discrete cell classes. It seems pretty clear that some of the cell classes are distinct (e.g. groups labeled by <italic>Cbln4</italic> vs. <italic>Dlk1</italic>), but while others can be grouped, the possibility that rather than being discrete classes they reflect a split along a continuum, or overlapping classes, is not convincingly addressed (e.g. <italic>S100b</italic> vs. <italic>Tpbg</italic>).</p><p>First, it's not clear how the algorithm used for clustering provides evidence for groups being generated by discrete as opposed to continuous distributions. As the authors recognize this is a difficult problem. Clustering algorithms will group some continuous distributions into clusters, but this is not evidence that the distributions were in fact discrete. Rather than under-sampling, which doesn't address the problem convincingly, a more rigorous statistical approach is required to support the conclusion that there are eight discrete groups. Previous comments about the interpretation of the tSNE plots must not have been sufficiently clear. They of course don't test for discreteness. Rather, a typical concern is that tSNE can give an exaggerated sense of distances between data points, whereas here even when visualizing the data using tSNE plots the groups appear contiguous.</p><p>Second, the new data in Figure 5 are nice, but their interpretation requires clarification. Each comparison is between groups that appear well separated by the clustering algorithm (cf. Figure 2A) and the conclusion that the groups labeled in Figure 5 are distinct seems very reasonable. However, the clusters in Figure 2A that appear contiguous (e.g. <italic>S100b</italic> and <italic>Tpbg, Dlk1</italic> and <italic>Lefty1, Dlk1</italic> and <italic>Gpc3</italic>, etc.) are not validated in Figure 5. Thus, Figure 5 doesn't support the idea that all eight proposed cell groups are discretely separable, as there is no evidence here that the adjacent groups of cells from Figure 2A are separable.</p><p>Third, the argument that ~80% successful classification with a random forest validates the groupings is not by itself convincing. For genuinely discrete classes wouldn't you expect the RF to do a little better? Are the misclassified cells randomly distributed, or are errors more systematic? For example, are all groups misclassified at the same rate, or is the error rate higher for particular groups? Are some types of error over-represented, e.g. does <italic>S100b</italic> misclassify as <italic>Tpbg</italic>, and vice -versa, at higher rates than other pairings? What error rates would you expect given alternative hypotheses that some groups, e.g. <italic>S100b</italic> and <italic>Tpbg</italic>, represent a split along a continuum, rather than discrete classes?</p><p>These problems could easily be addressed by avoiding use of &quot;discrete&quot; as a conclusion, e.g. in the title, in the Abstract, and multiple other parts of the manuscript, by discussing the potential ambiguities, and by being open to the possibility that some, although clearly not all, of the groupings may not be discrete. Along the same lines, the idea that there are eight groups would be better phrased as a suggestion rather than a definitive conclusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37701.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is an interesting study that reports molecularly and anatomically distinct subgroups of cells in the subiculum, some of which are shown to project to different targets.

As a point of background, in previous work (e.g., Cembrowski et al., 2016; Cembrowski et al., 2016), we have found that animal-to-animal variability is minimal (correlation coefficient typically ~0.99 across biological replicates). This, in conjunction with the robust in situ hybridization cross-validation in our original manuscript (which uses different animals and methodologies), suggesting that our work resolved general organizational principles, rather than being animal-specific.</p><p>Nevertheless, as the reviewer notes, a demonstration the reproducibility of these clusters across animals would provide direct evidence for this general organization. To this end, we have performed sequencing of additional mice; i.e., additional biological replicates. These results include two new biological replicates for each hippocampal region, as well as additional replicates for projections; in total, our revised manuscript now includes single-cell RNA-seq data from 11 animals.</p><p>We approached this new dataset as an independent test of our original submission: employing the same experimental and computational approaches as in our original manuscript, we independently generated and analyzed this new dataset, and compared the results to our original dataset. Critically, the clusters identified in our initial submission give a near-perfect registration to the clusters in our newly acquired dataset (see new âReplicate cross-validationâ subsection and Figure 2âfigure supplement 3). This consistency across biological replicates, in conjunction with the histological validation presented in our original manuscript and augmented in our revision, provides strong evidence that we have uncovered robust subclasses of subiculum neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the Discussion, the authors state that they were &quot;agnostic to the functional correlates&quot; of the genes that serve to differentiate cell clusters.

The functional correlates of these protein products span many neuronally critical functions, including intrinsic electrophysiological properties (e.g., Kv4.3 channels), synaptic transmission (e.g., Vglut2 and synaptotagmin-2), and calcium handling (e.g., S100 and Pcp4). This provides strong evidence that our scRNA-seq accurately predicts differential protein products, which in turn likely underpin functional differences in subiculum subclasses. This work now constitutes the new Figure 8 in our revised manuscript.</p><p>For transgenic mouse lines, we have identified that our scRNA-seq work can be used to accurately identify mouse lines that yield subclass-specific access.

Indeed, we have previously shown that bias introduced by examining only a few markers can fundamentally misidentify the underlying organizational scheme (Cembrowski et al., 2016). Thus, we would argue that âgood evidence for the main conclusionâ is an overreach of the previous work.

Such algorithms generally fail when clusters are not well-separated; the proper classification of our dataset despite a 70% downsampling is a strong indicator of effective separation.</p><p>Regarding the statement ât-SNE plots suggest that the suggested subclasses overlap / are contiguousâ, this is a misinterpretation of t-SNE. t-SNE uses nonlinear dimensionality reduction to effectively balance local and global distances, and thus the distance between clusters cannot be taken as a measure of discreteness. Moreover, t-SNE is solely a visualization procedure, with clustering performed independently of this visualization. The robustness-to-downsampling analysis we discuss above is a stronger measure of separation.</p><p>Finally, the gold standard of putative discrete separation is cross-validation by in situhybridization to show nonoverlapping populations. We had multiple examples of this in our original manuscript, and have since augmented this with additional validation (see Figure 5, including the specific pairings sought in comment 3 above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Choices made in setting up the analysis pipeline, and the consequences of different choices, are not sufficiently explained.</p></disp-quote><p>In general, this point reflects one of the broad challenges of âBig Dataâ in the transcriptomics community â how does one choose parameters inherent to analysis? To date, there is no well principled âone-size-fits-allâ approach to choosing parameters. Our approach â philosophically and practically â has always been to analyze our data to the depth that it can be successfully validated by other techniques. As we hope the reviewer will appreciate, in our revised manuscript we have cross-validated our results extensively with single- and multicolor fluorescence in situhybridization as well as via immunohistochemistry.

However, this previous work is still not credited sufficiently. This doesn't affect the validity of the conclusions, nor the strong case for publishing the study, but a more scholarly approach to recognizing previous work would reflect well on the authors and the journal. We have some suggestions.</p><p>Introduction, third paragraph, acknowledges Ishihara and Fukuda, but their contribution is not made sufficiently clear here. Perhaps state, &quot;Recent investigations using immunohistochemical labeling argue that the proximal subiculum is composed of a molecular layer and multiple cell body layers, each distinguished by molecular and morphological differences, while the distal subiculum is more uniform (Ishihara and Fukuda, 2016).&quot;</p><p>Discussion, subsection âThe subiculum as a laminar and columnar structureâ, last paragraph. It's important to be clear here that prior evidence for and articulation of the idea that &quot;the subiculum can be deconstructed into proximal and distal subdomains, with further laminar organization predominantly found in proximal subiculum&quot; was provided in the previous study by Ishihara and Fukuda. We agree that the present results further refine their model, but as written the text could easily be interpreted as taking credit for ideas previously proposed by Ishihara and Fukuda.</p></disp-quote><p>We now explicitly note that this was previously proposed by Ishihara and Fukuda.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the implication in the first paragraph of the aforementioned subsection, that Ishihara and Fukuda's scheme was based only on protein labeling is incorrect, as they also took account of neuronal morphology, something the present study doesn't do.</p></disp-quote><p>We now note that Ishihara and Fukuda analyzed neuronal morphology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) We're not convinced by the conclusion that the analysis supports the existence of eight discrete cell classes.</p></disp-quote><p>Although all computational and experimental results we have obtained are consistent with the existence and discrete separation of these 8 classes, it is possible in principle that some continua may exist between specific subclasses. As the following 3 points raised by the reviewer below ultimately culminate in âThese problems could easily be addressed by [several means of improvement]â, we keep the rest of our response to the end of this section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems pretty clear that some of the cell classes are distinct (e.g. groups labeled by Cbln4 vs. Dlk1), but while others can be grouped, the possibility that rather than being discrete classes they reflect a split along a continuum, or overlapping classes, is not convincingly addressed (e.g. S100b vs. Tpbg).</p><p>First, it's not clear how the algorithm used for clustering provides evidence for groups being generated by discrete as opposed to continuous distributions. As the authors recognize this is a difficult problem. Clustering algorithms will group some continuous distributions into clusters, but this is not evidence that the distributions were in fact discrete. Rather than under-sampling, which doesn't address the problem convincingly, a more rigorous statistical approach is required to support the conclusion that there are eight discrete groups. Previous comments about the interpretation of the tSNE plots must not have been sufficiently clear. They of course don't test for discreteness. Rather, a typical concern is that tSNE can give an exaggerated sense of distances between data points, whereas here even when visualizing the data using tSNE plots the groups appear contiguous.</p><p>Second, the new data in Figure 5 are nice, but their interpretation requires clarification. Each comparison is between groups that appear well separated by the clustering algorithm (cf. Figure 2A) and the conclusion that the groups labeled in Figure 5 are distinct seems very reasonable. However, the clusters in Figure 2A that appear contiguous (e.g. S100b and Tpbg, Dlk1 and Lefty1, Dlk1 and Gpc3, etc.) are not validated in Figure 5. Thus, Figure 5 doesn't support the idea that all eight proposed cell groups are discretely separable, as there is no evidence here that the adjacent groups of cells from Figure 2A are separable.</p><p>Third, the argument that ~80% successful classification with a random forest validates the groupings is not by itself convincing. For genuinely discrete classes wouldn't you expect the RF to do a little better? Are the misclassified cells randomly distributed, or are errors more systematic? For example, are all groups misclassified at the same rate, or is the error rate higher for particular groups? Are some types of error over-represented, e.g. does S100b misclassify as Tpbg, and vice -versa, at higher rates than other pairings? What error rates would you expect given alternative hypotheses that some groups, e.g. S100b and Tpbg, represent a split along a continuum, rather than discrete classes?</p><p>These problems could easily be addressed by avoiding use of &quot;discrete&quot; as a conclusion, e.g. in the title, in the Abstract, and multiple other parts of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>In our revised manuscript, we have now removed the word âdiscreteâ as it refers to the scRNA-seq results, and use this word to reference our work only in cases where we have explicitly confirmed discreteness via cross-validation (e.g., in situhybridization). We have kept this word in the title of our work because it is an accurate representation of our body of work as a whole â even if some scRNA-seq subclasses do actually exist in a continuum, they will nonetheless be discretely separated from other subclasses (as well as be in the minority of all subclasses; see new Discussion paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>By discussing the potential ambiguities, and by being open to the possibility that some, although clearly not all, of the groupings may not be discrete. Along the same lines, the idea that there are eight groups would be better phrased as a suggestion rather than a definitive conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>In our revised Discussion we have now included an additional paragraph on the interpretation of our scRNA-seq-derived subclasses.
