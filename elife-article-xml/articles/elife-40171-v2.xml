The inner membrane (IM) is a symmetric bilayer of glycerophospholipids (GPL), of which zwitterionic phosphatidylethanalomine (PE), acidic phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and cardiolipin (CL) are among the most widely distributed in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang and Rock, 2008</xref>). In contrast, the outer membrane (OM) is largely asymmetric and composed of an inner leaflet of GPL and an outer leaflet of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or lipooligosaccharide (LOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pelletier et al., 2013</xref>). The OM forms the first line of defense against antimicrobials by functioning as a molecular permeability barrier. The asymmetric nature of its lipid bilayer and the structure of LPS/LOS molecules facilitates barrier function, as the core region of LPS impedes the entry of hydrophobic molecules into the cell while the acyl chains within the bilayer also help to prevent the entry of many hydrophilic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bishop, 2014</xref>). Although progress has been made in understanding many aspects of OM assembly – including the discovery of an LPS transport system and the machinery for proper folding and insertion of outer membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okuda and Tokuda, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Okuda et al., 2016</xref>) – little is known about the molecular mechanisms for transport of the GPLs necessary for OM formation and barrier function.</p><p><italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> is an important cause of antibiotic-resistant opportunistic infections and has significant innate resistance to disinfectants and antibiotics. Similar to other Gram-negative opportunistic pathogens such as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella</italic> spp., individuals with breached skin or damaged respiratory tract mucosa are most vulnerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chmelnitsky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbo et al., 2005</xref>). We performed a genetic screen to identify genes important for the OM barrier of <italic>A. baumannii</italic>. This led to the identification of an ABC (<underline>A</underline>TP-<underline>b</underline>inding <underline>c</underline>assette) transporter complex that promotes GPL export to the OM. Transporter disruption attenuates bacterial OM barrier function, resulting in increased susceptibility of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> to a wide variety of antibiotics.</p><p>The homologous system for <italic>E. coli</italic> has previously been termed Mla for its suggested role in the <underline>m</underline>aintenance of outer membrane <underline>l</underline>ipid <underline>a</underline>symmetry via the removal of GPL from the outer leaflet of the OM to the IM. While this is a reasonable hypothesis, there is not direct biochemical evidence that the Mla system functions to return GPL from the OM to the IM. In this work, we present evidence that the <italic>A. baumannii</italic> Mla system functions to promote GPL movement from the IM to the OM. This conclusion is based on the observation that newly synthesized GPLs accumulate at the IM of <italic>mla</italic> mutants, akin to how LPS molecules accumulate at the inner membrane in bacteria with mutations in the <italic>lpt</italic> genes encoding the LPS ABC transport system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Okuda et al., 2016</xref>). Given the broad conservation of Mla in prokaryotic diderm organisms, the anterograde trafficking function of Mla might be exploited by a variety of species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A screen for activity of a periplasmic phosphatase identifies genes required for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> OM barrier function</title><p>We identified strains with mutations in genes required for maintenance of the <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> OM barrier by screening transposon mutants for the development of a blue colony phenotype on agar plates containing the chromogenic substrate BCIP-Toluidine (XP). Although <italic>A. baumannii</italic> carries an endogenous periplasmic phosphatase enzyme, colonies remain white on agar plates containing XP. We reasoned that lesions in genes necessary for the OM barrier function should result in a blue colony phenotype, as the XP substrate becomes accessible to the periplasmic enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Strauch and Beckwith, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lopes et al., 1972</xref>). Screening roughly 80,000 transposon-containing colonies for the blue colony phenotype yielded 364 blue colonies whose insertions were mapped to 58 unique genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We confirmed the results of the screen by assaying for OM-barrier defects using ethidium bromide (EtBr) and N-Phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN) uptake assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Helander and Mattila-Sandholm, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murata et al., 2007</xref>). We also tested for resistance to antimicrobials, including trimethoprim, rifampicin, imipenem, carbenicillin, amikacin, gentamicin, tetracycline, polymyxin B, and erythromycin. Greater than 85% of the strains identified in the screen demonstrated decreased OM barrier function compared to wild type. Out of the 58 strains with transposon insertions, 23 demonstrated OM permeability defects by NPN and EtBr uptake assays, and 49 out of 58 resulted in increased sensitivity to two or more antibiotics compared to the parent strain, indicating that the screen identified lesions causing OM barrier defects leading to increased permeability to small charged and hydrophobic molecules, including commonly used antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The Mla system is necessary for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> OM integrity</title><p>Four mutants with a blue colony phenotype contained unique transposon insertions in the genetic loci A1S_3103 and A1S_3102, predicted to encode core components (<italic>mlaF</italic> and <italic>mlaE</italic>) of a multicomponent ABC transport system.

Chromosomal deletions were created by allelic exchange, and these mutations resulted in OM permeability defects as measured by EtBr uptake assays. We complemented the OM defect for the ∆<italic>mlaC</italic> and ∆<italic>mlaF</italic> deletion mutants by repairing the original deletion event in the chromosome and confirmed complementation of the observed permeability defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Deletions in <italic>mlaF</italic> and <italic>mlaC</italic> also rendered <italic>A. baumannii</italic> increasingly sensitive to a variety of antibiotics as determined by MIC measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Increased sensitivity to antibiotics whose uptake is not mediated by OM porins is consistent with a direct effect on the membrane component of the OM permeability barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nikaido, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vaara, 1992</xref>). In addition to OM defects, the <italic>mla</italic> mutants display phenotypes that may correlate with OM stress, including increased production of extracellular carbohydrates as evidenced by crystal violet staining of pellicles following growth in broth culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These data indicate a role for Mla in the maintenance of the outer membrane barrier of <italic>A. baumannii</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ATPase activity of MlaF is required for maintenance of the OM barrier of <italic>A. baumannii</italic></title><p>To exclude the possibility that the membrane defect was the result of the disruptive effect of a partially formed Mla protein complex, we engineered an enzymatically inactive ATPase component and expressed the defective enzyme from a plasmid. We reasoned that by expressing this allele in the wild type bacteria we could create a dominant-negative effect on Mla function. The cytoplasmic ATPase component of the Mla system, MlaF, contains the consensus sequence GxxxxGKT at residues 49–56, characteristic of a Walker A motif. Downstream residues 173–178 contain the sequence LIMYDE, typical of a Walker B motif. The Walker motifs form highly conserved structures critical for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Walker et al., 1982</xref>). The lysine residue of the Walker A motif is particularly essential for the hydrolysis of ATP. Mutations in this lysine residue are inhibited for nucleotide binding, and the mutated protein is rendered inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanson and Whiteheart, 2005</xref>). Additionally, ATPase mutants in the key lysine residue have been shown to have a dominant-negative effect on ATP hydrolysis when co-expressed with their wild-type ATPase counterparts, as typical ABC transporters have a structural requirement for two functional nucleotide-binding proteins which dimerize upon substrate transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davidson and Sharma, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilkens, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we created a version of the MlaF coding sequence with a leucine substitution of the Walker A lysine residue (MlaF<sup>K55L</sup>), and then cloned the mutated <italic>mlaF</italic> into the low-copy pMMBkan vector under control of the <italic>mlaF</italic> native promoter. We observed that expression of MlaF<sup>K55L</sup> in wild type <italic>A. baumannii</italic> had a dominant-negative effect on membrane permeability as measured by EtBr uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and expression of MlaF<sup>K55L</sup> also resulted in increased exopolysaccharide production as demonstrated by increased staining by crystal violet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Correspondingly, expression of MlaF<sup>K55L</sup> rendered <italic>A. baumannii</italic> more sensitive to a variety of antibiotics, resulting in reduced MICs when compared to <italic>A. baumannii</italic> expressing the empty pMMBkan vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Therefore, expression of a defective ATPase results in a dominant-negative mutant with a comparable phenotype to deletion of components of the <italic>mla</italic> operon. These results demonstrate a requirement for ATP hydrolysis by MlaF for the maintenance of OM barrier function in <italic>A. baumannii,</italic> and indicate that the phenotypes of deletion mutants were likely a result of a lack of transport function, rather than formation of a toxic incomplete membrane protein complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Structure of the <italic>A. baumannii</italic> MlaBDEF complex</title><p>The genetic arrangement and conservation of the components of this ATPase-containing transport complex indicated it was likely that the individual components formed a higher order protein structure. To define whether the Mla components form a stable protein complex, we expressed the entire operon (<italic>mlaFEDCB</italic>) from <italic>A. baumannii</italic> ATCC 17978 in <italic>E. coli</italic> with a carboxy-terminal hexahistidine tag on the MlaB component. Affinity purification of MlaB revealed three additional bands, with sizes corresponding to MlaF, MlaD, and MlaE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis, indicating that these four proteins form a stable complex. We did not detect MlaC, suggesting it might interact only transiently with the other components, consistent with results recently reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thong et al.

This complex is uniformly dispersed in vitreous ice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and 2D classification demonstrated the presence of a range of views suitable for structure determination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Following 2D- and 3D-classification, we obtained a final dataset of ~14,000 particles with which we obtained a structure to a resolution of 8.7 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The structure possesses significant visible features in agreement with the nominal resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

We note that the structure of ecMlaBDEF, at lower resolution, was reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ekiert et al., 2017</xref>). The overall features of both structures, solved independently, are identical, suggesting that they correspond to the correct structure for the complex. However, the limited resolution of the ecMlaBDEF complex structure did not allow modeling of its individual subunits, in contrast to the abMlaBDEF structure reported here.</p><p>We note that a clear six-fold symmetry is present for the region of the map attributed to MlaD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), despite the fact that we only imposed a 2-fold symmetry averaging. This agrees with the proposed hexameric state of its <italic>E. coli</italic> homologue (ecMlaD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thong et al., 2016</xref>). We next modeled abMlaD, using an evolution restraints-derived structural model of ecMlaD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ovchinnikov et al., 2017</xref>) as a template, and used our previously-published EM-guided symmetry modeling procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergeron et al., 2013</xref>) to model its hexameric state. The obtained abMlaD hexameric model is at a low-energy minimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>) and fits the EM map density well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). A crystal structure of the periplasmic domain of ecMlaD published recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ekiert et al., 2017</xref>) formed a crystallographic hexamer, suggesting that this corresponds to the native hexomeric arrangement for this domain. Our abMlaD hexameric model is very similar to the crystallographic ecMlaD structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>), supporting the proposed domain arrangement in the MlaBDEF complex. We note, however, that one region of density in the EM map is not accounted for by our MlaD hexamer model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The localization of this extra density suggests that it corresponds to a ~ 45 amino-acid insert present between strands 4 and 5 of the abMlaD β-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>).

For both proteins, most helices are well resolved, which allowed us to place the models unambiguously. We then compared the conformation of the ATPase MlaF to that of the maltose transporter ATPase MalK, which has been trapped in several conformations of the transporter; that is the inward-facing state, the pre-translocation state, and the outward-facing state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khare et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oldham et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, the arrangement of MlaF clearly resembles the pre-translocation state of MalK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This suggests that we have trapped a similar conformation of the abMlaBDEF complex. It is possible that MlaD and/or MlaF, for which there are no equivalent in other ABC transporters, stabilizes this conformation. Alternatively, it is possible that the presence of detergents, which were present to solubilize the complex, mimics the natural ligand in the transporter’s active site. Finally, the transmembrane (TM) region of the map is well resolved, and density for the transmembrane (TM) helices can be clearly identified. We therefore modeled abMlaE, using an evolution restraints-derived structural model of ecMlaE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ovchinnikov et al., 2017</xref>) as a template, and fitted the obtained coordinates in the corresponding region of the map, with the orientation corresponding to the predicted topology. The resulting MlaE dimer model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) fits well to the EM map density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>), and clearly corresponds to a closed transporter, with no solvent channel between the subunits. Interestingly, we also noted clear density for three TM helices that likely correspond to the MlaD N-terminal helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, they lacked continuity, and we observed that only two form a direct interaction with MlaE. It is possible that this is due to heterogeneity in the orientation of MlaD relative to the rest of the complex. To verify this, we performed further 2D classification of the particles used for reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which revealed a range of positions for the MlaD region relative to the rest of the complex. We therefore performed further 3D classification leading to a smaller dataset of ~8000 particles. This produced a structure of lower resolution (~11.5 Å) but with the six MlaD N-terminal TM helices clearly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). While the periplasmic domain possesses 6-fold symmetry, the TM domains of MlaD do not appear symmetrical, with two forming close contacts with the density attributed to MlaE while the other four do not appear to contact any other proteins. This observation likely explains the asymmetry of contacts between the dimeric MlaE and the hexameric MlaD. A higher-resolution structure will be required to determine if additional contacts are formed between the outward-facing loops of MlaE and the periplasmic domain of MlaD.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40171.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Localization of the 6 TM helices from MlaD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) lateral section of the abMlaBDEF EM map, with the MlaE model in yellow.

Work performed on the Mla system in <italic>E.coli</italic> has demonstrated that disruption of genes in the Mla pathway results in activation of both the OM acyl-transferase PagP, which cleaves a palmitate moiety from GPL and transfers it to LPS and PG, creating a hepta-acylated LPS molecule and palmitoyl-PG and the OM phospholipase PldA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malinverni and Silhavy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>A. baumannii</italic> has no known PagP enzyme but similar activity of the multiple predicted OM phospholipases could account for the reduction in OM GPL as observed by TLC and quantitative mass spectrometry. Therefore, we designed a mass spectrometry-based assay to study intermembrane GPL transport using <sup>13</sup>C stable isotope labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), to better analyze the directionality of GPL transport by the Mla system between the bacterial membranes. When grown in culture with sodium acetate as the sole carbon source, many bacteria directly synthesize acetyl-CoA using the conserved enzyme acetyl-CoA synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumari et al., 2000</xref>). Acetyl CoA, the precursor metabolite for fatty acid biosynthesis, is first converted to malonyl-CoA and enters the FasII (fatty acid biosynthesis) pathway that supplies endogenously synthesized fatty acids to macromolecules such as lipopolysaccharides, phospholipids, lipoproteins, and lipid-containing metabolites. By growing cultures in unlabeled acetate then ‘pulsing’ with 2-<sup>13</sup>C acetate and analyzing separated membrane fractions from set time points, we can observe the flow of newly synthesized GPLs between the IM and OM of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dalebroux et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Upon introducing the 2-<sup>13</sup>C acetate as the sole carbon source, <sup>13</sup>C-labeled GPL were immediately synthesized in the bacterial cytoplasm. We reasoned that continued growth in <sup>13</sup>C acetate should result in a mixed pool of unlabeled and labeled IM GPL molecules. As the GPL are then fluxed from the IM to the OM, the likelihood that an individual GPL molecule is transported is directly proportional to the ratio of labeled to unlabeled GPL in the IM pool. As the bacteria continue to grow in <sup>13</sup>C acetate, the ratio of labeled to unlabeled GPL in the IM will gradually increase as new GPL are synthesized and inserted in the IM. As such, the likelihood of transporting labeled GPL to the OM will also increase. A comparison of the ratios of labeled to unlabeled GPL in the IM and OM will thus reflect the efficiency of transport between the membranes, and analysis of transport in wild type <italic>A. baumannii</italic> will establish reference for transport efficiency with which to compare our mutants. Additionally, OM phospholipases, some of which may be activated upon membrane damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Istivan and Coloe, 2006</xref>), will not distinguish between labeled and unlabeled GPL and therefore will not affect the ratio of labeled to unlabeled GPL obtained from this assay.</p><p>Membrane separation and analysis of wild type <italic>A. baumannii</italic> revealed near-identical rates-of-change between the two membranes in ratios of <sup>13</sup>C-labeled to unlabeled GPLs, indicating that newly synthesized GPLs are transported and inserted into the OM at a rate equivalent to their rate of synthesis and assembly within the IM. Furthermore, the ratios of labeled to unlabeled GPLs were nearly equal in the IM compared to the OM at the time points evaluated, indicating that GPL transport likely occurs rapidly, consistent with earlier pulse-chase experiments performed in <italic>E. coli</italic> that estimate the half-life of translocation of various GPLs at between 0.5 and 2.8 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donohue-Rolfe and Schaechter, 1980</xref>). By contrast, mutants in the Mla system accumulate newly synthesized GPLs in their IM at a greater rate than occurs in the OM as evidenced by the increasing disparity in the ratio of labeled to unlabeled GPLs between the IM and OM over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Stable isotope experiments on ∆<italic>mlaC</italic> mutants reveal IM accumulation of newly synthesized GPLs similar to the result in ∆<italic>mlaF</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), indicating that in the absence of the periplasmic component GPLs are not efficiently removed from the IM by the remainder of the Mla system. We also sought to characterize the potential role of the putative OM-lipoprotein MlaA, which has been implicated as a component of the Mla system in <italic>E. coli</italic>. A chromosomal deletion strain of <italic>mlaA</italic> was created by allelic exchange, and complemented by expression of MlaA from a pMMB67EH-Kan plasmid. The results of the stable isotope pulse experiments in the ∆<italic>mlaA</italic> strain revealed results consistent with those obtained from ∆<italic>mlaC</italic> and ∆<italic>mlaF,</italic> in which the ratio of labeled to unlabeled GPL is consistently higher in the inner membrane than the outer membrane after one hour of exposure to <sup>13</sup>C-acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). These results are consistent with a model in which the IM-localized ABC transporter complex MlaBDEF first transfers GPLs to the periplasmic binding protein MlaC, which then transports GPL to the OM, whereupon MlaA facilitates GPL insertion into the OM.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We performed a screen to identify <italic>A. baumannii</italic> proteins that are essential for its OM barrier that led to the identification of an ABC transport system whose ATPase activity maintains OM barrier function. IM and periplasmic components of this system can be purified, bind GPLs, and assemble into a defined protein complex with significant symmetry, indicating that this system could function to transport GPLs from the IM to the OM. Consistent with the possibility that Mla functions as an anterograde transporter, the OM of mutants show an overall reduction of GPL along with an excess accumulation of newly synthesized GPL on the IM. Therefore, these results lead us to propose that the function of the <italic>A. baumannii</italic> Mla system is the trafficking of GPL from the IM, across the periplasm, for delivery to the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). According to this model, ATP hydrolysis by MlaF provides the initial energy to extract GPL from the IM, while the substrate binding components MlaD and MlaC take up lipids for delivery to the OM. It has been observed by van Meer and colleagues that complete extraction of GPLs from the membrane bilayer requires a Gibbs free energy of ~100 kJ/mol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abreu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Meer et al., 2006</xref>), whereas ATP contains just 30 kJ/mol of energy. To account for the energy difference, a hydrophobic acceptor molecule is proposed to allow the lipids to fully dissociate from the rest of the ABC transporter and facilitate complete removal from the bilayer. The GPL-binding component, MlaD, contains an IM spanning domain and is shown here, and in orthologous systems, to be in complex with the MlaE and MlaF proteins within the IM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ekiert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roston et al., 2012</xref>). The close association of MlaD with the outer leaflet of the IM may allow it to extract lipids from the IM by hydrophobic interaction with the acyl chains after ATP hydrolysis by MlaF. Subsequent trafficking across the periplasm then involves the periplasmic GPL binding protein MlaC, which likely accepts GPL from MlaD and then carries them to the OM. We note however the observed effect of <italic>mlaC</italic> deletion on GPL accumulation in the IM, while statistically significant for most of the analyzed diacyl-glycerophospholipids, appears to be less than that of deletion of the ATPase component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that while MlaC may participate in transfer to the OM, there may be redundant mechanisms by which the IM complex can transport or remove IM GPL in the absence of MlaC. While the precise mechanism of GPL insertion into the OM is not yet known, work performed on the <italic>E.coli</italic> Mla system has shown that MlaC interacts with both the IM MlaFEDB complex, as well as with the putative OM lipoprotein MlaA, and our results support a role for MlaA in the function of the overall Mla system and delivery of GPL to the OM.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40171.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The multicomponent Mla system transports glycerophospholipids from the inner membrane to the outer membrane of <italic>A. baumannii.</italic></title><p>A schematic of glycerophospholipid transport to the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane by the Mla system.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40171-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In this work, we designed a method to monitor lipid transport between Gram-negative bacterial membranes using stable <sup>13</sup>C isotope labeling. We considered the possibility of loss of GPL from the outer membrane due to outer membrane vesicle formation or, more likely, by the possible increased activation of outer membrane phospholipases. Both would have the effect of removing GPL from the outer membrane and would result in lower GPL levels in the outer membrane of <italic>mla</italic> mutants. Neither of these mechanisms would operate specifically on either labeled or unlabeled lipids. We understood the decrease in outer membrane GPL to be insufficient evidence of an anterograde transport function for <italic>mla,</italic> and for this reason we developed the stable isotope assay to control for these possibilities. The stable isotope assay gives insight into whether these results are due simply to mislocalization or degradation of outer membrane GPL, or if they can in fact be attributed to deficient anterograde GPL transport. This is because the peak intensity of each newly synthesized, C<sup>13</sup>-labeled GPL is normalized to the corresponding unlabeled version of that GPL species with each sample injected into the LC-MS/MS. The result is a ratio of labeled to unlabeled GPL for every membrane sample. With C<sup>13</sup>-acetate as the sole carbon source, we observe a gradual increase in the ratio of labeled GPL relative to unlabeled GPL over time. In wild type bacteria, these ratios for the inner and outer membranes track closely over time, which indicates that under these conditions GPL transport from the inner to the outer membrane occurs quite rapidly. In <italic>mla</italic> mutants the ratio is both higher and typically increases at a greater rate in the inner membrane. Phospholipases and budding outer membrane vesicles will not distinguish between labeled and unlabeled GPL species, and so will not impact the ratios obtained with this assay.</p><p>Our results using this assay are consistent with the Mla system functioning as an anterograde GPL transporter, however they do not exclude the possibility of a dual role for Mla components in the maintenance of OM lipid asymmetry. Previous work performed on the orthologous Mla system in <italic>E.coli</italic> has been interpreted to suggest that the function of the system is to remove GPL from the outer leaflet of the OM for retrograde transport back into the cytoplasm based on the observation that <italic>E.coli mla</italic> mutants likely contain GPLs on the outer leaflet of the OM. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malinverni and Silhavy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benning, 2008</xref>). This proposed function was inferred from the observation that gene deletions resulted in an increased activation of the OM-phospholipase enzymes PagP and OMPLA, suggesting an increased amount of GPL in the outer leaflet of the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malinverni and Silhavy, 2009</xref>). The interpretation of retrograde transport function was also based on the existence of an orthologous system in plant chloroplasts that transports lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the organelle. Many plants require this retrograde transport function because certain lipids in the chloroplast thylakoid membrane derive from GPL originating in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hurlock et al., 2014</xref>). However, since Gram-negative bacteria synthesize GPL within the IM, retrograde transport of GPL would only be necessary for the recycling of GPL mislocalized to the OM outer leaflet. Although this is a reasonable inference based on data available at the time, we would point out that the directionality of transport by the <italic>E. coli</italic> Mla system had not been thoroughly probed experimentally using membrane analysis or with a functional assay of the type performed here. It is conceivable that the import function of the orthologous chloroplast TGD system is a result of adaptation to the intracellular environment, the system in this case having evolved to aid in the transfer of GPL from the nearby ER to the chloroplast. Furthermore, while it is possible that the Mla system in <italic>E. coli</italic> serves a different primary function than in <italic>A. baumannii,</italic> we demonstrate here that both complexes possess a similar architecture, pointing to a conserved function. The outer membrane defect phenotypes observed in <italic>E. coli mla</italic> mutants might also be explained by a disruption of OM structure stemming from decreased concentrations of OM GPL, leading to activation of the PagP enzyme. It is well established that for <italic>E. coli,</italic> GPL displacement to the OM outer leaflet and subsequent activation of these enzymes reflects OM instability and can be achieved by chemical disruption of the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dekker, 2000</xref>). It may be the case that the OM of <italic>E. coli mla</italic> mutants contain GPL in the outer leaflet, but the possibility remains that OM GPL can flip into the outer leaflet under conditions of OM damage resulting from an imbalance of LPS-to-GPL ratios, along with perhaps the corresponding disruption of OM proteins. However, final determination of the directionality of GPL transport by the Mla system in <italic>E.coli</italic> and other organisms will require intermembrane transport studies similar to what has been done here for <italic>A. baumannii,</italic> along with studies similar to those performed for the Lpt LPS transport system for which molecular transfer of LPS from molecule to molecule of the Lpt system is functionally defined.</p><p>Following the introduction of the retrograde transport model for Mla function into the existing literature, a number of studies have examined the phenotypic effects of Mla disruption in various organisms. In a recent study in PNAS, Powers and Trent first obtained <italic>A. baumannii</italic> deficient in lipooligosaccharide (LOS) by selection in the presence of polymyxin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Powers and Trent, 2018</xref>). They then performed an evolution experiment, passaging the strains in cultures containing polymyxin B over 120 generations, at which point they observed significantly improved growth in the populations. These evolved populations were also observed to have increased resistance to antibiotics including vancomycin, bacitracin, and daptomycin, and to appear more morphologically consistent relative to the unevolved strains when observed microscopically. Whole genome sequencing of the evolved strains revealed mutations in <italic>mla</italic> genes in seven of the 10 evolved populations. They also observed frequent disruptions in <italic>pldA</italic>, as well as in other envelope genes. To further study these effects, they then introduced clean deletions of <italic>mlaE</italic> and <italic>pldA</italic> to ATCC 19606, and selected for LOS-deficient bacteria by plating on polymyxin B. These double mutants demonstrated improved growth and resistance to antibiotics but continued to display altered cellular morphology. The authors present their data as evidence in support of Mla as a retrograde transport system, and assume that a lack of removal of GPL from the outer leaflet is promoting the OM barrier. We would point out that lacking in their data is examination of the membrane glycerophospholipid (GPL) profile in their LOS-deficient mutants. It is assumed by the authors that <italic>mla</italic> and <italic>pldA</italic> mutations have the effect of stabilizing a symmetric outer membrane produced in the absence of LOS by allowing GPL to fill in the outer leaflet, resulting in improved growth and antibiotic resistance. Given that the data suggests that Mla and PldA are selected against when LOS is absent, examination of the outer membrane GPL content might have supported the authors’ conclusions if it revealed an increase in GPL in <italic>mla</italic> and <italic>pldA</italic> mutants. Absent such data, it is not obvious to us that the authors have sufficiently ruled out alternative explanations for their observed phenomena. For example, we would question the mechanisms regulating the homeostasis of both the inner and outer membranes and the entire periplasmic space in the absence of LOS. The authors acknowledge earlier work that observed an increase in expression of <italic>mla</italic> genes upon initial loss of LOS in 19606 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boll et al., 2016</xref>). Genes in the <italic>mla</italic> pathway were shown to have an up to 7.5-fold increase in gene expression upon loss of LOS. Powers and Trent assert that the function of Mla is deleterious in the absence of LOS, but perhaps what is deleterious is the profound upregulation of <italic>mla</italic> expression in the absence of LOS, combined with an active PldA. If Mla is an anterograde transporter, we can imagine this might create a situation in which GPL are rapidly removed from the inner membrane and then degraded in the outer membrane in excess of what the cell can support and limiting both of these processes together simply allows the cell to achieve a new homeostasis. Understanding of the myriad processes regulating bacterial outer membrane assembly and integrity remains limited even when LOS is present, and so interpreting results such as these as providing direct evidence of function may exceed the limits of the data.</p><p>The gene for MlaA, the proposed OM component, is at a different chromosomal location from the remainder of the <italic>mla</italic> operon. Recent structural studies on MlaA have revealed that MlaA forms a ring-shaped structure localized the inner leaflet of the OM, and have shown it to form stable complexes with the outer membrane proteins OmpF and OmpC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abellón-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>). The proposed structure of MlaA in the OM supports the argument that MlaA is involved in removal of GPL from the outer leaflet, and it is suggested that GPL from the outer leaflet travel through a pore in MlaA where they are received by MlaC, yet our data reveals that <italic>A. baumannii</italic> ∆<italic>mlaA</italic> mutants are defective in delivery of GPL from the IM to the OM. These data can be reconciled by a model in which MlaA functions both to remove mislocalized GPL from the outer leaflet of the OM, and additionally serves to facilitate delivery of GPL to the OM by MlaC, perhaps by enabling MlaC localization to the surface of the inner leaflet. By this model, mutations in MlaA will be phenotypically similar to mutations in other components of the Mla system, and we would expect to observe a decreased rate of anterograde GPL transport. We would here point out that while previous work has implicated the Mla system in the maintenance of OM lipid asymmetry through observation of increased activity of PagP, the role of the MlaFEDB complex and MlaC in retrograde GPL transport has previously only been inferred from homology to the chloroplast TGD system. It is established that cellular mechanisms exist in Gram-negative bacteria to resist stressful conditions that lead to OM disruption. For example, OM phospholipase enzymes, such as PldA, are activated under conditions of membrane stress to digest GPL in the outer leaflet of the OM, as high levels of GPL in the outer leaflet destabilize the OM barrier function. The model of retrograde GPL transport by the Mla system proposes that growing cells expend cellular energy in the form of ATP in order to transport undigested GPL from the OM, across the periplasm, and back into the IM, at which point some of those same molecules will be transported back to the OM by an unknown mechanism. However, the available data points most clearly to a model of anterograde GPL transport by MlaFEDB and MlaC, facilitated in some way by MlaA.</p><p>The first three genes of the <italic>mla</italic> operon – comprising an ATPase, permease, and substrate-binding components of the ABC transporter complex – are conserved in <italic>Mycobacteria spp, Actinobacteria</italic>, and chloroplasts, while the entire five-gene operon appears to be conserved in Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casali and Riley, 2007</xref>). Given the conservation of the system across Gram-negative species, our results may shed light on a generalized mechanism contributing to OM biogenesis. Additionally, we have here demonstrated that the function of this ABC transport system is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the <italic>A. baumannii</italic> OM. The fact that <italic>mla</italic> mutations are tolerated, and that levels of OM GPL are reduced but not abolished, suggests the intriguing possibility of additional undiscovered mechanisms of GPL delivery to the OM. Also of interest is the potential role of the increased exopolysaccharide observed upon disruption of the Mla system. It is possible this exopolysaccharide plays a partially compensatory role in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> resulting from decreased OM GPL, given that recent work has shown that <italic>A. baumannii</italic> exopolysaccharides can contribute to antibiotic resistance, likely through improved barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geisinger and Isberg, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The progression towards a more complete understanding of intermembrane GPL transport and OM barrier function should ultimately have relevance in the development of novel drug targets to undermine emerging antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative pathogens. The emergence of antibiotic resistant Gram-negative bacteria for which few or no antibiotics are available therapeutically is an important medical concern. This issue is typified by current isolates of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> that can only be treated with relatively toxic colistin antibiotics. This has led many individuals and agencies to propose the development of single agent antimicrobials which could be used for organisms such as <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> that have significant antibiotic resistance. Therefore, work furthering the understanding of the OM barrier could lead to the development of drugs which target the barrier and allow the therapeutic use of many current antibiotics.</p></sec><sec

vector was designed for use in <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> ATCC 17978. The new transposon vector, derived from pBT20, termed pMarKT, contains an outward facing pTac promotor as well as a selectable kanamycin resistance marker followed by an omega terminator within the Mariner arm sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kulasekara et al., 2005</xref>). The plasmid backbone contains the Mariner transposase gene C9 Himar, a <italic>tetRA</italic> resistance marker from Tn10, a p15A origin from pACYC184, and an oriT site for mobilization. The plasmid was constructed by PCR of select fragments followed by restriction digest and ligation of the cleaved ends. The new transposon vector was confirmed by restriction digest and partial sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Transposon mutagenesis</title><p>Initial mutagenesis revealed that many hits occurred in the high affinity phosphate uptake transcriptional repressor <italic>phoU</italic> (A1S_0256). Subsequent rounds of mutagenesis were conducted on an ATCC 17978 <italic>phoU</italic> chromosomal deletion strain, and plated on high phosphate media to reduce the background level of cleavage of the chromogenic substrate. Chromosomal deletions were performed by allelic exchange using a pEX2tetRA vector, which was created by insertion of the <italic>tetRA</italic> tetracycline resistance marker from Tn10 into the pEXG2 plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rietsch et al., 2005</xref>). Roughly 1000 bp regions upstream and downstream of the genes of interest were amplified for homologous recombination with the ATCC 17978 chromosome. Sucrose was used to counter-select against cells retaining the pEX2tetRA backbone, and deletions were confirmed by PCR. Complementation of deletions was accomplished by repairing the original deletion in the chromosome, again using the pEX system and allelic exchange.</p><p>Donor <italic>E. coli</italic> containing the pMarKT transposon vector were suspended in LB broth to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 40 and mixed with an equal volume of the recipient <italic>A. baumannii</italic> suspended to OD<sub>600</sub> of 20. 50 µL aliquots of this mixture were then plated in spots on a dried LB agar plate and incubated for 2 hr at 37°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kulasekara et al., 2005</xref>). Each 50 µL spot resulted in about 80,000 colonies of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> containing Mariner transposon insertions. The mutants were plated on LB agar containing 1X M63 salts, 50 µg/mL kanamycin, 30 µg/mL chloramphenicol, and 40 µg/mL XP substrate. Plates were incubated for at least 36 hr at 30°C to allow for the appearance of the blue color from cleavage of the XP substrate. Sequencing of the transposon insertions was adapted from the method described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chun et al.

Prior to measurement, CCCP was added at 200 µM to inhibit the activity of efflux pumps. Ethidium bromide was added immediately prior to measurement to final concentration of 1.2 µM in 200 µL total reaction volume. Permeability was assessed using a PerkinElmer EnVision 2104 Multilabel Reader using a 531 nm excitation filter, 590 nm emission filter, and a 560 nm dichroic mirror. Readings were taken every 15 s for 30 min with samples assessed in triplicate in a Greiner bio-one 96-well flat bottom black plate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>MIC measurements</title><p>MICs were determined in 96-well microtiter plates using a standard two-fold broth dilution method of antibiotics in LB broth. The wells were inoculated with 10<sup>4</sup> bacteria per well, to a final well volume of 100 μL, and plates were incubated at 37°C with shaking unless stated otherwise. Experiments were performed thrice using two technical replicates per experiment. MICs were interpreted as the lowest antibiotic concentration for which the average OD<sub>600</sub> across replicates was less than 50% of the average OD<sub>600</sub> measurement without antibiotic.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Crystal violet assay for exopolysaccharide production</title><p>Strains were inoculated to OD<sub>600</sub> 0.05 and grown overnight at 37°C in 2 mL LB broth with shaking in glass tubes. The next day, liquid was carefully decanted and the tubes left to dry for 2 hr at 37°C. Pellicles were stained with the addition of 0.1% crystal violet, then gently washed three times in dH<sub>2</sub>O. Crystal violet was solubilized in a 80:20 solution of ethanol:acetone and read at 590 nm.

The nucleotide sequence of the operon was confirmed using DNA sequencing. The plasmid was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> RosettaBlue strain. Cells were grown at 37°C in LB medium until the cell density reached an OD600 of 1.0. The temperature was then reduced to 16°C before induction with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG). After growth at 16°C for 18 hr, cells were harvested by using centrifugation at 4,200 g. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol) and subjected to three runs of homogenization at 10,000–15,000 psi using Avestin EmulsiFlex-C3 high pressure homogenizer (Avestin, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). The homogenate was centrifuged at 17,000 g for 10 min at 4°C, and then the supernatant was ultra-centrifuged at 100,000 g for 60 min. The membrane fraction was resuspended in buffer A supplemented with 1% (w/v) dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM) and was slowly stirred for 1 hr at 4°C. After another ultra-centrifugation at 100,000 g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected and loaded on 2 ml of Ni<sup>2+</sup>-nitrilotriacetate affinity resin (Ni-NTA from Qiagen, Germany) pre-equilibrated with buffer A supplemented with 5 mM imidazole and 0.025% (w/v) DDM. After incubating for 1 hr, the resin was washed with 50 ml buffer A supplemented with 20 mM imidazole and 0.025% (w/v) DDM. The protein sample was eluted with 10 ml elution buffer containing buffer A, 300 mM imidazole, and 0.025% (w/v) DDM, and was concentrated to 0.5 ml. The concentrated protein sample was then loaded onto a Superdex-200 column (10/30, GE Healthcare, US) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0) 150 mM Nacl 0.025% DDM. Peak fractions were collected and the pooled protein sample was concentrated to 1 mg/ml.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cryo-EM sample preparation, data acquisition and image processing</title><p>Purified Mla complex at ~1 mg/ml was applied to glow-discharged holey grids, blotted for 6 s, and plunged in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (FEI).

Particle stacks were generated in Appion using a box size of 200 pixels. Several successive rounds of 2D and 3D classification were performed in Relion 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scheres, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kimanius et al., 2016</xref>) using an initial model generated by Common Lines in EMAN2 (53) leading to a final stack of ~14,000 particles for 3D structure refinement in Relion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Structure modeling and docking in the EM density</title><p>The structures of MlaB and MlaF were modeled using the threading server Phyre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>) based on the structures of the anti-sigma factor antagonist tm1081 (PDB ID 3F43, 18% sequence identity to MlaB) and the ABC ATPase ABC2 (PDB ID 1OXT, 36% sequence identity to MlaF) respectively. Two copies of each structural model were positioned in their putative location within the EM map using Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) and their position was optimised using the Fit to EM map option. The abMlaD and abMlaE structures were modelled on ecMlaD and ecMlaE structural models deposited in the Gremelin database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ovchinnikov et al., 2017</xref>), using Modeller. For abMlaD, the N-terminal TM helix and the insert region were modelled ab initio using the Rosetta suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DiMaio et al., 2011</xref>) and positioned in their putative localisation in Chimera. The MlaD hexamer, as well as the MlaE dimer, were modelled with Rosetta using a EM-guided symmetry modelling approach described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergeron et al., 2013</xref>). The final model was refined with Rosetta.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Membrane isolation and separation</title><p>Cells were resuspended in 20 mL of 0.5 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris pH 7.8, 75 µg freshly prepared lysozyme (Roche 10837059001), and 20 mL of 0.5 mM EDTA, and kept on ice with gentle stirring for 20 min. Samples were homogenized (Avestin EmulsiFlex-C3) and spun down at 17,000 g for 10 min to removed un-lysed cells prior to ultracentrifugation. Membranes were spun down using a Ti45 Beckman rotor at 100,000 g for 1 hr and then added to the top of a sucrose gradient. IM and OM were separated by 18 hr ultracentrifugation using a SW-41 rotor in a Beckman Coulter Optima L90X ultracentrifuge. Spheroplast formation and sucrose gradient separation of IM and OM was adapted from a method by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Osborn et al. (1972)</xref> by use of a defined 73%–53–20% sucrose gradient as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalebroux et al. (2015)</xref>. Our sucrose gradients contain three distinct concentrations of sucrose, and inner and outer membranes separate into distinct bands that are collected individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3F</xref>). To limit any potential mixing of the membranes, the inner membrane is collected from the top of the tube while the outer membrane is collected by puncturing the bottom of the tube and allowing the bottom band to be collected. The purity of membrane separation by this method was confirmed by NADH assay and by Western blotting for the <italic>A. baumannii</italic> OM-localized OmpA protein, with 10 µg of total protein loaded into each lane as measured by Bradford protein assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>GPL extraction and TLC</title><p>GPLs from isolated membranes were extracted using a 0.8:1:2 ratio of water: chloroform: methanol as per the method of Bligh and Dyer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bligh and Dyer, 1959</xref>).

These fragments were cloned into pET29b and expressed with a carboxy-terminal hexahistidine (−6HIS) tag in BL21 <italic>E. coli</italic> with 2 hr induction. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in Tris-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol (TBSG) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Complete EDTA-free). Cells were lysed by homogenization (Avestin) and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 hr to spin down membranes. The supernatants were then applied to a 5 mL-HiTrap(TM) Chelating HP Ni-affinity column pre-loaded with 0.1 M NiSO<sub>4</sub> and equilibrated with TBSG. The proteins were eluted from the column using FPLC (Akta) by applying a stepwise gradient of 25 mM, 50 mM, and finally 300 mM imidazole for protein elution. Elution was monitored by UV-absorption at 280 nm. The MlaC- and MlaD-containing fractions were then further purified by injecting into a HiLoad 120 ml-6/600 Superdex(TM) 200 preparative grade size-exclusion column equilibrated in TBSG using a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The purity of the collected protein fractions was confirmed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were diluted to 2 mg/mL and dialyzed overnight in 1 L TBSG at 4°C with stirring.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;An ABC transporter delivers glycerophospholipids to the <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> outer membrane&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While all reviewers agree that the manuscript addresses an important topic, they all think that the evidence provided is not sufficient to support the main claim of the manuscript, that the Gpt system delivers phospholipids to the outer membrane (OM). This is an especially sensitive issue because the <italic>E. coli</italic> ortholog Mla complex has been described to function in the opposite direction from the OM to the IM. While the reviewers do not exclude that your conclusions are correct, they all think that this controversy can only be resolved if a large body of additional experiments is provided. Briefly, clear membrane fractionation controls should be provided, but it should be explained how the PL decrease in the OM is compensated. Other approaches such as EM and live microscopy would also strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>The policy at <italic>eLife</italic> is to only allow revisions of manuscript that could be performed within a two-months time period. Given, the amount of perceived additional experiments we have are rejecting the manuscript. The individual reviews are appended below to help prepare the manuscript for submission elsewhere.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This work by Kamischke et al. presents the interesting finding of a glycerolipid transport system, which appears to have a major role in establishing the composition of the OM.</p><p>The transporter is present in other gram negative bacteria and the finding would thus be an important insight into the mechanism of OM biogenesis.</p><p>The work nicely provides genetic, structural and biochemical assays to support the authors conclusions</p><p>Overall, I am enthusiastic about the work, but I have a number of concerns.</p><p>– First, the discovery of the Gpt system is not exactly novel, the Mla complex, apparently the direct homolog, has been previously identified in <italic>E. coli</italic> (which the author acknowledge). However contrary to previous interpretations, Gpt is proposed to transport glycerolipids from the IM to the OM while Mla (f I understand correctly) was proposed to maintain lipid asymmetry in the OM, transporting lipids from the OM to the IM. I am not an expert in this field but because this creates a controversy, I am wondering whether the data presented is sufficient to make this claim. The conclusion mostly comes from the assay presented in Figure 7 showing that newly synthesized phospholipids accumulate at the IM in <italic>gpt</italic> mutants. However, I do not understand why the OM composition appears mostly unaffected in the same mutants in that assay? Also given that the authors have this assay in hand it should not be too complicated to test the <italic>E. coli mlA</italic> mutant and see if they get similar results? That would help solving this controversy.</p><p>Bottom line, this part should be absolutely convincing for the paper to be accepted.</p><p>– Some microscopy of the <italic>gpt</italic> mutants (EM, phase contrast) would be helpful to describe the phenotypes in these mutants. Could permeability of the mutants be shown directly in individual cells?</p><p>– Statistics are missing in several instances especially in in Figure 1 and Figure 7 which only shows representative experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This work deals with the most poorly understood aspect of envelope biogenesis in Gram-negative bacteria: transport of phospholipids (PLs) between the inner membrane (IM) and outer membrane (OM). Kamischke et al. characterize the Gpt system of Acinetobacter baumannii, which is orthologous to the previously identified Mla system in <italic>E. coli</italic>. A portion of this work describes how some of what we know about Mla also applies to Gpt: <italic>mla/gpt</italic> mutants have OM permeability defects; IM components of Mla/Gpt system form a complex; part of the Mla/Gpt system is a predicted ABC transporter and activity of its ATPase is required for transport; and finally, some periplasmic components of Mla/Gpt bind PLs.</p><p>The remaining part of this manuscript describes two novel findings but raises the following serious concerns:</p><p>1) Cryo-EM structural information of the GptBDEF IM complex. This is a novel structure that is only validated by the fitting of Phyre model structures of the cytoplasmic components (GptBF) and previous data showing that MlaD (GptD) is hexameric. Because the structure is of low-resolution (~11 Å), its impact is minimal – it does not provide insight into the mode of function or guidance for future work on function.</p><p>2) The authors conclude that Gpt transports PLs from the IM to OM. This is very surprising because both the Mla system of <italic>E. coli</italic> and its chloroplast orthologous system have been reported to function in retrograde PL transport based on in vivo data. Previously, Malinverni and Silhavy (reference #8) concluded that Mla functions in retrograde transport because they obtained in vivo data demonstrating that PLs accumulate in the outer leaflet of the OM: in <italic>mla</italic> mutants, PagP was activated and defects were suppressed by PldA overexpression. It is impossible to explain those data in a model where Mla transports PLs from the IM to the OM, as it is suggested here for Gpt. It is also very difficult to imagine how a multi-protein transport system that is driven by an ABC transporter to transport PLs from one membrane to another could have evolved to run in opposite directions in different organisms.</p><p>Here, Kamischke et al. conclude that Gpt is involved in anterograde transport because of data presented in Figures 6 and 7, where the authors measure PL content in the IM and OM. These data rely on the separation of IM and OM using a density ultracentrifugation procedure. How well these two membranes were separated is crucial to validate this work. Therefore, the authors should show the data they mentioned in the Materials and methods that illustrate proper separation of the IM and OM. In fact, the authors should at the very least show stained protein gels (not just immunoblots) of all fractions so that readers can assess the fractionation procedure. Furthermore, I worry that this technique might have misled the authors because of the following issue. Separation of IM and OM only works when the density values of these membranes are different enough. There are two factors contributing to this difference: the different protein:lipid ratio between the two membranes and the LOS:phospholipid ratio in the OM. If the Gpt system was responsible for retrograde transport, as previously proposed for Mla, a <italic>gpt</italic> mutant would accumulate PLs in the OM. This would cause the density of the OM (or domains/areas in the OM) to be more IM-like, making the fractionation more difficult or even impossible depending on the extent of the defect. In fact, it is likely that if PLs accumulated in the OM, the OM would be a mixture of two types of bilayers: some areas would be like wild-type OM (asymmetric bilayer containing both LOS and PLs), while other areas would be IM-like (symmetric PL bilayer). That is, some OM domains (or areas) would fractionate as expected (heavy density), while others would fractionate with the IM or somewhere in between the OM and IM fraction (lighter density). If this happened, fractionations would appear normal except that one would expect excess PLs in the IM, compared to the OM. This is what the authors' data show, so I wonder if they are misinterpreting the data. Can the authors rule out this possibility? Furthermore, the authors use a fractionation procedure that is based on spheroplasting cells, which leaves domains/areas of the OM still connected to the IM via trans-envelope complexes (e. g. Tefsen J Biol Chem. 2005). Would the same results be obtained if cells were lysed by high pressure?</p><p>Another issue that their data raises is this: The OM should cover more surface area than the IM. Here, the authors say that the OM of a <italic>gpt</italic> mutant has a lot less PLs than the OM of the wild type and that the IM of the mutant has more PLs than that of the wild type. Their data suggest that the OM in the <italic>gpt</italic> mutant covers less surface area that in IM. How is this possible? What is filling the void in the OM caused by the decrease in PLs? The authors do not provide any information about the overall composition of the OM in <italic>gpt</italic> mutants that could explain how it can have less PLs while the IM has more. Again, different composition of the OM could affect how it (or domains of it) fractionates.</p><p>The authors should also address these additional major problems:</p><p>3) Why isn't Figure 6B showing accumulation of PG and PE in the IM? These data seem to contradict the model. Even Figure 6A does not appear to show much of an increase of PLs at the IM.</p><p>4) The authors state (without providing data) that cardiolipin is made at the OM. If that is true, based on the authors' model (Gpt transports the substrates needed to make cardiolipin at the OM), one would expect that the overall cardiolipin content in <italic>gpt</italic> mutants would be very low, especially in comparison to the other PL species. That is not what Figure 6A shows. Why?</p><p>5) Could the authors please show error bars for Figure 7?</p><p>6) Discussion section: &quot;While it is possible that the Gpt system in <italic>E. coli</italic> serves a different primary function than in <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, the phenotypes observed in <italic>E. coli mla</italic> mutants might also be explained by a disruption of outer membrane structure stemming from decreased concentrations of outer membrane PLs, leading to activation of the PagP enzyme.&quot; This weak argument does not make any sense. PagP is activated by an increase in PLs at the outer leaflet of the OM.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The article is written and presented in a seamless manner, where figures, hypotheses, and figures are clearly articulated. This is a testament to the overall quality of the work and presentation. However, this is not to say that it has no weaknesses, some of which need to be addressed prior to publication. The authors' conclusions are never heavy-handed or written in absolute terms; as such they accommodate alternative opinions and possibilities; especially important, as their final figure, serves to upturn the existing dogma in the field, regarding the function of a homologous operon best studied in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Some might argue that renaming these homologs is unnecessary. The authors should strongly consider their proposal to rename these genes for the following reasons: i) the buried mention (Materials and methods) that cardiolipin is not transported by this system, argues that it is not in fact a general &quot;glycerophospholipid&quot; transporter (see below additional comments on cardiolipin); ii) these authors have only demonstrated in one strain of <italic>A. baumannii that</italic> some degree of PE and PG transport to the OM likely occurs as a consequence of this operon, and have not overturned the likely function of this operon to maintain asymmetry of the outer membrane. It's possible that context, such as organism or environments, favors utilization of this machinery in one direction or another. Also of great importance is the issue as to what fills in for the loss of GPL in the outer membrane as it is highly unlikely that it is LOS at the inner leaflet of the outer membrane. The authors' consideration on these matters, and their ability to adequately address these concerns will likely impact publication.</p><p>Major concerns/comments:</p><p>1) As noted above the Mla (Gpt) system has been previously characterized in <italic>E. coli</italic> and hypothesized as a retrograde GPL transporter. Clearly the <italic>mla</italic> system is not required for growth, so if it is functioning as an anterograde transporter what is replacing GPLs in the inner leaflet of the OM in <italic>mla</italic> mutants. In the view of this reviewer, the burden of proof is now higher given the previous work on the <italic>E. coli mla</italic> system.</p><p>2) The audience must be provided with inner membrane and outer membrane separation data throughout the manuscript. This is critical as the reader must be convinced that changing the ratio of GPL/LOS/OM protein allows for proper separation of <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> membranes.</p><p>3) Do the authors have data to demonstrate that the K55L &quot;dominant negative&quot; mutation truly abrogates ATP hydrolysis, since it is a critical assumption in interpreting the data in Figures 1 and 2?</p><p>4) Could the authors please speculate why only A1S_3102 and A1S_3103 were identified using BCIP-Toluidine screen of Tn library? Where there not Tn insertions in the other members of the operon?</p><p>5) Why do the authors not discuss MlaA and why was a mutant not made in this gene? Also, it is not labeled in the model? Does it not function in the pathway in <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>?</p><p>6) Figure 6. Several comments on this figure:</p><p>a) In 6A – it appears there are more GPLs by TLC in the OM of the wild type which is odd</p><p>b) In 6B, – if <italic>gpt</italic> was an anterograde transporter one would expect to see accumulation of GPLs in the inner membrane and decreases of GPLs in the outer membrane. When you look at the bar graph, the levels of PE and PG don't increase in the inner membrane in the <italic>gptC</italic> mutant and they actually decrease a little. Why?</p><p>7) Have the authors performed electron microscopy to see if they observe changes in the inner membrane (membrane invaginations) because of loss of <italic>gpt</italic> mediated GPL transport? This sort of data would greatly strengthen their hypothesis.</p><p>8) Discussion paragraph two: The Mla system was previously reported as a retrograde transport system for <italic>E. coli</italic> and in <italic>mla</italic> mutants PagP is activated. Since PagP is only functional when PLs are present at the surface, the idea was that in <italic>mla</italic> mutants GPLs are mislocalized in the outer leaflet of the OM. In the discussion, the authors rationalize that the phenotypes observed in <italic>E. coli mla</italic> mutants might also occur because GPL transport to the OM is not as efficient and because of this the LPS-to-GPL rations are off, resulting in flipping of GPLs to the outer leaflet and this is why PagP is activated. Is this likely, as PagP needs GPLs for activity and in the authors' model the Gpt (Mla) system is responsible, at least in part, for transport of GPLs to the OM?</p><p>9) Discussion paragraph three: The authors note that since the Mla (Gpt) system is upregulated in LOS deficient Acinetobacter, it suggests that Mla serves as a anterograde transporter as increased transport of GPLs may serve to compensate for lack of LOS in the outer membrane. Why couldn't it be the reverse, that the Mla system is upregulated in order to prevent too many GPLs in the OM. This goes back to what fills in the gaps when LOS is missing. After searching on PubMed, this reviewer found a recent paper from Boll et al., reporting that key lipoproteins seemed to be present in the outer leaflet of LOS deficient <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration. They were asked to provide a plan for revisions before the editors issued a final decision.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;The <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> Mla system and glycerophospholipid transport to the outer membrane&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>The current manuscript proposes that the <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> Mla system transports glycerophospholipid to the outer membrane. This statement challenges a large body of literature on both the <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>A. Baumannii</italic> systems (and to some extent <italic>V. Cholerae</italic> and <italic>H. influenza</italic>), all of which favor that Mla is instead involved in OM turnover and retrograde transport. After consultation with the reviewers, several key points would have to be clarified for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>1) The reference to existing literature must be improved in particular to reconcile and potentially explain the differences between this study and published studies. If needed, additional experiments must be provided to resolve/address these conflicts. Along these lines:</p><p>– Powers and Trent, 2018, published evidence for retrograde transport in the same organism, which is not commented by the authors.</p><p>– Contrarily to this study, multiple laboratories have reported that deletion of <italic>mlA</italic> genes is not associated with increased sensitivity to vancomycin and in fact linked to vancomycin resistance gene induction.</p><p>– Roier et al. (Nat Comm, 2016) have shown that <italic>mlA</italic> deletion is linked to OMV production in <italic>V. Cholerae</italic> and <italic>H. influenza</italic>, which is not taken into account in this study. Can the authors rule out that lower GPL levels in the OM are not due to the loss of OM materials?</p><p>2) The pulse chase assay is an important innovation of this study and the major experimental evidence to support the proposed directionality of Mla. Proving the consistency of this assay is therefore paramount to support the authors’ conclusions. The authors need to provide all the controls confirming that the IM and the OM were correctly separated in sucrose density gradients, which apparently is performed for the first time in <italic>A. Baumannii</italic>. For this, sucrose gradients need to be shown, with a complete set of IM and OM controls. A series of helpful recommendations is provided in the individual reviews. Variations in the assay starting point and in particular the high variance in total labeled lipids should also be explained.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In &quot;The <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> Mla system and glycerophospholipid transport to the outer membrane,&quot; Kamischke et al. report that the previously characterized Mla system functions in an anterograde manner. This is a well-written manuscript and the subject matter is important. The authors used a transposon library to identify genes required for OM integrity in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> by monitoring for release of an endogenous periplasmic phosphatase. Among the 58 genes identified in the screen, two genes encoded for components of the Mla system. The finding that mutations in <italic>mla</italic> genes results in OM permeability defects in Ab aligns with previous data reported in <italic>E. coli</italic> and other Gram-negative organisms (e.g. <italic>Vibrio cholerae, Haemophilus influenza</italic>). Previously, the Silhavy Laboratory demonstrated that Mla mutants show increased sensitivity to SDS-EDTA and deletion of any of the Mla components resulted in mislocalization of phospholipids to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. It was found that the outer membrane phospholipase, PldA, was a suppressor of the <italic>mla</italic> mutant SDS-EDTA sensitivity (see below for additional details on previous work). This is a key point as it suggests that the role of the Mla system is to remove phospholipids from the outer leaflet.</p><p>In the current work, the authors went on to characterize the Ab Mla inner membrane complex via cyro-EM. In the view of this reviewer, this is the most substantial contribution of the current work. Previously, Ekiert and co-workers characterized multiple MCE-domain containing complexes, including the Mla complex (Cell, 2017), and the work completed here is a nice addition to the field. Unfortunately, the other findings reported here are highly problematic. The authors reach the conclusion that Mla functions as an anterograde phospholipid transporter, which is in direct conflict with previous work from multiple groups suggesting that Mla functions in a retrograde manner including a recent paper in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (Powers et al., 2018). The Mla mutants presented here have very different phenotypes than those reported for other Gram-negatives and the biochemical data to support the anterograde claim are not convincing for various reasons.</p><p>Major Points:</p><p>1) Kamischke and co-workers report that deletion of <italic>mlaC</italic> or <italic>mlaF</italic> results in increased sensitivity to vancomycin (~10 fold). First, this goes against previous literature, reported by multiple labs, that <italic>mla</italic> mutants do not show increased sensitivity to vancomycin (or other antibiotics such as novobiocin). Actually, according to others the level of vanc resistance actually increases upon deletion of <italic>mla</italic> genes. How do the authors explain these differences?</p><p>2) Subsection “The Mla system is necessary for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> OM integrity”: What is the rationale for authors to complement mutations in original locus? This does not address the possibility of off-target gene expression alterations. This is even more relevant since it has already been reported that previous <italic>mla</italic> insertational mutants show polar effects (Silhavy, 2009).</p><p>3) Figure 4 and 5 and supplemental: Authors do not adequately illustrate the effectiveness of their membrane separation. It is established that many diderm organisms cannot be physically fractionated into OM and IM. Furthermore, to the reviewer's knowledge, this is the first publication to include membrane separations for <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>. The authors need to include significantly more information to assure the readers that their membrane fractionation works robustly in <italic>A. baumannii</italic>. Currently, the authors only include an outer membrane marker for an unknown fraction of the gradients. This is insufficient in the context of this work. The authors should include an inner membrane marker and an outer membrane marker across the gradient. Also, protein distribution and turbidity measures over the entire gradient would be very helpful.</p><p>4) Figure 4B: Where do the authors hypothesize the GPLs go? They presumably see a decrease in PG and PE in the outer membrane, but no subsequent increase in the inner membrane at steady state. Could this not be explained by vesicular blebbing, which would be an expected consequence after deletion of a retrograde transport system? In fact, an argument could be made that these findings are entirely an artifact of vesicular blebbing in the absence of Mla. In fact, Roier et al. have shown that deletion of <italic>mla</italic> components in both <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>H. influenza</italic> results in increased outer membrane vesicles. However, the authors do not consider this option or discuss this previous work.</p><p>5) Also, in reference to the Roier paper. In the current work the authors make the claim that &quot;biochemical analysis for the membrane GPL composition for Mla mutants has not been published for any organism&quot; This is not correct and these data were reported by Roier et al. Also, Roier did not observe the drastic reduction in OM phospholipid abundance reported in the current manuscript.</p><p>6) Discussion paragraph three: Authors suggest the function of MlaA is to allow MlaC to deposit phospholipids into the periplasmic-leaflet of the OM. The structure of MlaA identified a loop, preventing periplasmic-leaflet phospholipids from entering the MlaA channel. MlaA* lacks this loop, resulting in periplasmic-leaflet phospholipids entry into the MlaA channel. The result is a gain of function increased sensitivity to membrane stress.</p><p>7) Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 2: The authors devised a clever pulse chase assay. Why do the authors see such different starting points for the labeled cultures? Based on the variability of labeling by lipid species (even for the wildtype cultures), there is a concern regarding the consistency of the method.</p><p>8) Supplementary file 2: Furthering the concern about the pulse chase assay is the data presented in Supplementary file 2. We analyzed 3 replicates of the data provided, and it appears that the total lipid labeled achieved by this pulse chase assay is highly variable. How do the authors feel confident in drawing the conclusions presented when consistent data cannot be achieved with wild-type? In some replicates, entire lipid species were unable to be detected. How are the figures presented using this data representative, when the raw data is not?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria is an asymmetric lipid bilayer, composed of an inner leaflet of glycerophospholipids (GPL) and an outer leaflet of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Whereas we now have a reasonable understanding of how LPS molecules are transported across the periplasm and inserted into the OM, we still do not know how GPL molecules are transported from the inner to the outer membrane. In this article, Kamischkke et al. propose an answer to this long-standing question.</p><p>First, the authors carried out a genetic screen to identify genes important for the integrity of the OM in <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, an opportunistic pathogen. They screened a library of transposon mutants for colonies with lesions in the OM, reasoning that bacteria with an impaired OM will allow the chromogenic substrate XP to reach the periplasm where it can be degraded by a phosphatase, yielding a blue color. The results of the screen were validated using different assays. This led them to identify mutants with transposon insertions in genes encoding core components of the Mla system. The Mla system has been identified in <italic>E. coli</italic> where it was proposed to play a role in OM maintenance, transporting GPL from the OM back to the IM. The authors also confirmed that the phenotype exhibited by the mutants resulted from a lack of transport function and then used cryoEM to characterize the structure of the MlaBDEF complex. They also confirmed that components of the system interact with GPL.</p><p>The work described in this first part of the manuscript is convincing, the results are solid and very well presented. However, this first part mostly confirms work previously carried out in <italic>E. coli</italic> where similar screens were performed and where the Mla system was characterized, including at the structural level. In particular, the structure of the <italic>E. coli</italic> Mla complex was recently reported, although at a lower resolution. Overall, this part of the work is interesting and carefully done, but its novelty is not very high.</p><p>The second part of the article contains what I think could warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Indeed, the authors provide experimental evidence that the Mla system transports GPL from the IM to the OM, which would make of this system the first identified transporting GPL in this direction. This conclusion is based on a number of experiments. First, analysing IM and OM fractions separated by density centrifugation with TLC and LC-MS/MS, they showed that GPL levels were reduced in the OM of the <italic>∆mlaC</italic> mutant. Second, they designed an MS-based strategy to quantitatively follow intermembrane transport of radiolabelled GPL in membrane fractions and showed that GPL accumulate in the IM of Mla mutants.</p><p>These results are extremely interesting and are consistent with the model that the Mla system transports GPL from the IM to the OM, which would represent a major finding. However, I have a number of important concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) Given that the authors quantify GPL in membrane fractions, they need to provide all the controls confirming that the IM and the OM were correctly separated in sucrose density gradients. Only one control, showing the localization of OmpA in the OM fraction is provided. I think that more fractions of the sucrose gradients need to be shown, with additional IM and OM controls. My concern is that the accumulation of lipids in one membrane could have an impact on how the two membranes are separated and therefore on the results of the quantitative analysis. In addition, if Mla mutants have portions of the OM with GPL both in the inner and outer leaflet, where will these &quot;GPL bilayers&quot; be found in the sucrose gradients?</p><p>2) If GPL accumulate in the IM, what is the impact of this accumulation on the IM? A thorough microscopy analysis should also be carried out, which would strengthen the conclusions. Does the total surface area of the IM increase as a result of lipid accumulation?</p><p>3) The authors should also verify that the lower GPL levels in the OM do not result from the loss of OM material via increased vesiculation.</p><p>Providing these data is even more important that the direction proposed here for GPL transport is in contradiction with the work performed by others indicating that the Mla system is involved in the retrograde transport of GPL from the OM to the IM. In this regard, the authors need to take into account the recent publication by Powers and Trent in PNAS (2018) providing &quot;strong biological evidence&quot; for the retrograde transport of GPL by the Mla system in the same bacterium (<italic>A. baumannii</italic>). They need to explain how these data are compatible with theirs.</p><p>[Editors’ note: formal revisions were requested, following approval of the authors’ plan of action.]</p><p>Thank you for your careful response to the reviewers' comments. After further consultation with the reviewers we decided that your response could adequately address the comments provided that in addition to the proposed changes the revision further contains the following new experiments:</p><p>1) Given the existing literature, we would like further that the discrepancy on the vancomycin sensitivity be resolved by verification of this phenotype in a different <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strain.</p><p>2) Completion of sucrose gradients with the proper controls to verify inner and outer membrane separation for both wild type and <italic>mla</italic> mutants (e.g. NADH oxidase assays).

However contrary to previous interpretations, Gpt is proposed to transport glycerolipids from the IM to the OM while Mla (f I understand correctly) was proposed to maintain lipid asymmetry in the OM, transporting lipids from the OM to the IM. I am not an expert in this field but because this creates a controversy, I am wondering whether the data presented is sufficient to make this claim. The conclusion mostly comes from the assay presented in Figure 7 showing that newly synthesized phospholipids accumulate at the IM in gpt mutants. However, I do not understand why the OM composition appears mostly unaffected in the same mutants in that assay?</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to note that the data presented in Figure 7 of the original paper (now Figure 5 in the revised manuscript) is not a representation of the absolute value of newly synthesized phospholipids. Instead, we are presenting on the y-axis the molar ratio of newly synthesized, C13-labeled glycerophospholipid (GPL) to unlabeled glycerophospholipid. The data is presented in this manner to limit the need for normalization to something such as membrane protein content, which might be argued to be unreliable given that these mutations have been shown to severely disrupt the outer membrane. However, we recognize that this manner of presentation may cause unnecessary confusion about the assay, and so we have added additional figures to show the relative amount of newly synthesized GPL in the inner and outer membranes of wild type and mutant <italic>A. baumannii</italic> in the hope that this will more clearly represent the data. As detailed below, the data clearly shows that in the <italic>mla</italic> mutants newly synthesized GPL accumulate on the inner membrane.</p><p>At any given time, as GPL are transported from the IM to the OM by any mechanism, <italic>mla</italic> or otherwise, the likelihood that a single GPL molecule which is transported from the IM to the OM will be labeled is proportional to the ratio of labeled to unlabeled GPL in the inner membrane. Although the OM ratio is similar in the mutants and wild type, what is significant is the discrepancy in the ratios between the inner and outer membranes. As the ratio of labeled to unlabeled increases in the IM over time, it should also increase at the same rate in the OM, provided anterograde transport between the membranes is not inhibited, as demonstrated by the results of these experiments in wild type. The significance of our result is that newly synthesized GPL accumulate in the IM at a faster rate than in the OM in our mutants, indicating that some mechanism of anterograde transport is inhibited in these strains. However, as we note in the discussion, transport to the OM is not completely abolished, as there are still labeled GPL that appear in the OM under these conditions. The fact that the ratio of labeled to unlabeled GPL in the OM of mutants increases can be explained by the existence of additional unexplained mechanisms of GPL transport, perhaps including a passive flow of GPL between membranes that may occur during cell division, combined with the fact that the likelihood of transporting a labeled GPL is much higher in the mutants strains due to the excess accumulation of labelled GPL on the inner membranes, giving them a much greater proportion of labeled GPL on the inner membrane after 60 minutes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also given that the authors have this assay in hand it should not be too complicated to test the E. coli mlA mutant and see if they get similar results? That would help solving this controversy.</p><p>Bottom line, this part should be absolutely convincing for the paper to be accepted.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and agree that it would be interesting to repeat our experiments in <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>. However, the focus of our study is mechanisms of outer membrane permeability in <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, and as such we have written this manuscript in order to present our findings about the Mla system in that organism. While we have preliminary data that the function of the system may be similar in <italic>Salmonella typhimurium,</italic> we think that repeating this work in another organism would be beyond the scope of this manuscript, and might serve as the basis of another manuscript entirely. We would also like to point out that we have made efforts to explain that while we believe the system functions primarily for anterograde rather than retrograde transport of GPL, we have not eliminated the possibility that the system does play some role in the maintenance of outer membrane asymmetry. In particular, the precise molecular function of the system’s outer membrane component, MlaA, is not entirely clear, and it is possible to imagine it might be in some way facilitating both the maintenance of lipid asymmetry and the transfer of GPL from MlaC to the outer membrane. It is not our intention in putting forth this data to stoke controversy, but to publish what we have observed about the function of this system in <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>. Pursuing the characterization of Mla in <italic>E. coli</italic> could conceivably put our model in direct conflict with the current paradigm and necessitate an extremely high burden of proof requiring additional experiments that could further delay publication of the data we already have.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Some microscopy of the gpt mutants (EM, phase contrast) would be helpful to describe the phenotypes in these mutants. Could permeability of the mutants be shown directly in individual cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included in this revised manuscript phase contrast images of our mutants to help describe the phenotypes (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). It is our opinion that specific dye uptake or other visual methods would not add much over the quantitative assays of outer membrane permeability and antibiotic susceptibility we have performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) Cryo-EM structural information of the GptBDEF IM complex. This is a novel structure that is only validated by the fitting of Phyre model structures of the cytoplasmic components (GptBF) and previous data showing that MlaD (GptD) is hexameric. Because the structure is of low-resolution (~11 Å), its impact is minimal – it does not provide insight into the mode of function or guidance for future work on function.</p></disp-quote><p>The overall features of both structures, solved independently, are identical, suggesting that they correspond to the correct structure for the complex. However, the limited resolution of the ecMlaBDEF complex structure did not allow modeling of its individual subunits, in contrast to the abMlaBDEF structure reported here. We have been able to further improve the resolution to 8.7 Å in this revised manuscript. Based on the modeling we saw more detail, which was not shown from the ecMlaBDEF structure. Similar to MlaB and MlaF proteins, most helices are well resolved, which allowed us to place the models unambiguously, the arrangement of MlaF clearly resembles the pre-translocation state of MalK. This suggests that we have trapped a similar conformation of the abMlaBDEF complex. We also show that while the periplasmic domain possesses 6-fold symmetry, the TM domains of MlaD do not appear symmetrical. Two of the TM domains of MlaD form close contacts with the density attributed to MlaE while the other four do not appear to contact any other proteins. We believe that this data will in fact prove useful to guide future work regarding the molecular function of the system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors conclude that Gpt transports PLs from the IM to OM. This is very surprising because both the Mla system of E. coli and its chloroplast orthologous system have been reported to function in retrograde PL transport based on in vivo data. Previously, Malinverni and Silhavy (reference #8) concluded that Mla functions in retrograde transport because they obtained in vivo data demonstrating that PLs accumulate in the outer leaflet of the OM: in mla mutants, PagP was activated and defects were suppressed by PldA overexpression. It is impossible to explain those data in a model where Mla transports PLs from the IM to the OM, as it is suggested here for Gpt. It is also very difficult to imagine how a multi-protein transport system that is driven by an ABC transporter to transport PLs from one membrane to another could have evolved to run in opposite directions in different organisms.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer describes, Malinverni and Silhavy demonstrated that mutations in the Mla system lead to activation of PagP, and PldA overexpression suppresses both the PagP activation phenotype as well as increased sensitivity observed in these mutants to SDS-EDTA, suggesting the accumulation of GPL in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane under those conditions. However, we strongly disagree with the reviewer’s statement that it is impossible to reconcile these observations with an anterograde transport model. As we note in our manuscript, conditions that perturb the outer membrane, such as chemical disruption via EDTA exposure, have been shown to result in an increase in membrane disorder, i.e. a reduction in membrane asymmetry following the spontaneous flipping of glycerophospholipids to the outer leaflet and activation of PagP (see references 27-29). It is reasonable therefore to suppose that mutation in <italic>any</italic> protein that contributes significantly to membrane barrier function might result in GPL exposure on the outer leaflet, and it does not necessarily mean that such a protein is directly responsible for maintaining lipid asymmetry under wild type conditions. Pulse-chase experiments have been performed to demonstrate that the orthologous system in the plant chloroplast functions to transport GPL originating in the endoplasmic reticulum towards the interior of the chloroplast for eventual delivery to the thylakoid membrane within the chloroplast (see reference 36). The Gram-negative bacteria we are discussing here are not contained within a eukaryotic cell exposed to organelles such as the ER that might be a source for GPL. Therefore, we do not find it difficult to imagine that this orthologous system might have evolved to have reverse functionality in the chloroplast from what we observe here in <italic>A. baumannii.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Here, Kamischke et al. conclude that Gpt is involved in anterograde transport because of data presented in Figures 6 and 7, where the authors measure PL content in the IM and OM. These data rely on the separation of IM and OM using a density ultracentrifugation procedure. How well these two membranes were separated is crucial to validate this work. Therefore, the authors should show the data they mentioned in the Materials and methods that illustrate proper separation of the IM and OM. In fact, the authors should at the very least show stained protein gels (not just immunoblots) of all fractions so that readers can assess the fractionation procedure.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to the immunoblots, we have here included a figure of stained protein gels of inner and outer membrane fractions in both mutant and wild type bacteria so that readers can better assess the fractionation procedure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, I worry that this technique might have misled the authors because of the following issue. Separation of IM and OM only works when the density values of these membranes are different enough. There are two factors contributing to this difference: the different protein:lipid ratio between the two membranes and the LOS:phospholipid ratio in the OM. If the Gpt system was responsible for retrograde transport, as previously proposed for Mla, a gpt mutant would accumulate PLs in the OM. This would cause the density of the OM (or domains/areas in the OM) to be more IM-like, making the fractionation more difficult or even impossible depending on the extent of the defect. In fact, it is likely that if PLs accumulated in the OM, the OM would be a mixture of two types of bilayers: some areas would be like wild-type OM (asymmetric bilayer containing both LOS and PLs), while other areas would be IM-like (symmetric PL bilayer). That is, some OM domains (or areas) would fractionate as expected (heavy density), while others would fractionate with the IM or somewhere in between the OM and IM fraction (lighter density). If this happened, fractionations would appear normal except that one would expect excess PLs in the IM, compared to the OM. This is what the authors' data show, so I wonder if they are misinterpreting the data. Can the authors rule out this possibility?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct to point out that areas of symmetric GPL bilayer in the OM might conceivably fractionate with the IM upon density centrifugation, leading to the appearance of an excess of GPL in the IM relative to the OM. This is one of the reasons we developed the stable isotope assay after first observing the overall reduction in OM GPL by TLC and LC-MS/MS shown in Figure 4. Additionally, it occurred to us that activation of OM phospholipases such as PldA could result in this phenotype and lead to mischaracterization of the system. The stable isotope assay gives insight into whether these results are due simply to mislocalization or degradation of OM GPL, or if they can in fact be attributed to deficient anterograde GPL transport. This is because the peak intensity of each newly synthesized, C13-labeled GPL is normalized to the corresponding unlabeled version of that GPL species with each sample injected into the LC-MS/MS. The result is a molar ratio of labeled to unlabeled GPL for every membrane sample. With C13-acetate as the sole carbon source, we observe a gradual increase in the ratio of labeled GPL relative to unlabeled GPL over time. In wild type bacteria, these ratios for the inner and outer membranes track closely over time, which indicates that under these conditions GPL transport from the inner to the outer membrane occurs quite rapidly, as has been previously shown in <italic>E. coli</italic> reference. In <italic>mla</italic> mutants the ratio is both higher and typically increases at a greater rate in the inner membrane. Phospholipases will not distinguish between labeled and unlabeled GPL species, and so will not impact the ratios obtained with this assay. Areas of symmetric OM bilayers fractionating with the IM also cannot explain the data for our mutants because that would not result in a specific increase in labeled GPL relative to unlabelled GPL, as such theoretical micro domains would themselves be a mixture of labeled and unlabelled GPL. The results observed in <italic>mla</italic> mutants are best explained as demonstrating a decreased rate of anterograde transport relative to wild type bacteria, in which GPL are first synthesized and inserted in the IM but subsequent transport to the OM is inhibited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors use a fractionation procedure that is based on spheroplasting cells, which leaves domains/areas of the OM still connected to the IM via trans-envelope complexes (e. g. Tefsen J Biol Chem. 2005). Would the same results be obtained if cells were lysed by high pressure?</p></disp-quote><p>As described in our Materials and methods, following the spheroplast procedure, samples were homogenized under high pressure with an Avestin EmulsiFlex-C3 and spun down at 17,000 g for 10 min to removed un-lysed cells prior to ultracentrifugation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue that their data raises is this: The OM should cover more surface area than the IM. Here, the authors say that the OM of a gpt mutant has a lot less PLs than the OM of the wild type and that the IM of the mutant has more PLs than that of the wild type. Their data suggest that the OM in the gpt mutant covers less surface area that in IM. How is this possible? What is filling the void in the OM caused by the decrease in PLs? The authors do not provide any information about the overall composition of the OM in gpt mutants that could explain how it can have less PLs while the IM has more. Again, different composition of the OM could affect how it (or domains of it) fractionates.</p></disp-quote><p>Respectfully, we do not state that the IM of the <italic>mla</italic> mutants have more GPL than wild type, and our TLC and LC-MS/MS quantification data in fact show that IM GPL levels are comparable or slightly decreased in <italic>mla</italic> mutants. While our TLC and initial quantification of GPL by LCMS/ MS in Figure 4 suggest a decrease in OM GPL, we acknowledge in our manuscript that these results could be due to indirect effects, which is why we developed the stable isotope assay, as described in our response above. That being said, these mutants were revealed to us in a screen for outer membrane integrity, and have been shown to have an outer membrane permeability defect, suggesting that damage to the outer membrane is not fully compensated. Previous work implicating orthologous systems in GPL transport, and our own data showing GPL binding to components of the system led us to focus on the GPL components of the membranes rather than attempting to profile the overall membrane composition. We have not attempted to determine whether the LOS or lipoprotein profiles are significantly altered in these mutants so as to compensate for the loss of GPL, although this might be an interesting avenue for future study.</p><p>Regarding this question, our data showing a significant increase in exopolysaccharide in <italic>mla</italic> mutants may suggest regulatory mechanisms responding to membrane damage to mitigate the effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also address these additional major problems:</p><p>3) Why isn't Figure 6B showing accumulation of PG and PE in the IM? These data seem to contradict the model. Even Figure 6A does not appear to show much of an increase of PLs at the IM.</p></disp-quote><p>It is likely that the inner membrane content of GPL is regulated by many factors including synthesis, degradation by phospholipases, outer membrane transport, and cell division. We can speculate that feedback mechanisms have resulted in maintenance of appropriate content of the inner membrane, which is critical to cellular integrity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors state (without providing data) that cardiolipin is made at the OM. If that is true, based on the authors' model (Gpt transports the substrates needed to make cardiolipin at the OM), one would expect that the overall cardiolipin content in gpt mutants would be very low, especially in comparison to the other PL species. That is not what Figure 6A shows. Why?</p></disp-quote><p>Bioinformatic analysis of cardiolipin synthase genes in ATCC 17978 reveals two genes, one of which encodes a signal sequence for export to the periplasm. We do observe a reduction in OM CL by TLC as expected, however our stable isotope assay implicated the Mla system in anterograde transport of PE and PG, but not CL, indicating to us that there may be alternative mechanisms of increasing OM CL content, and we suggest that a periplasmic OM CL may explain this result, although we have not yet thoroughly investigated this as our focus is on the Mla system. We do not understand why the reviewer expects that the overall cardiolipin content in mutants would be low.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Could the authors please show error bars for Figure 7?</p><p>6) Discussion section: &quot;While it is possible that the Gpt system in E. coli serves a different primary function than in A. baumannii, the phenotypes observed in E. coli mla mutants might also be explained by a disruption of outer membrane structure stemming from decreased concentrations of outer membrane PLs, leading to activation of the PagP enzyme.&quot; This weak argument does not make any sense. PagP is activated by an increase in PLs at the outer leaflet of the OM.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree. PagP is activated by OM damage such as the use of EDTA, which may or may not cause migration or membrane disorder. Despite the “dogma” that PagP is activated on migration of phospholipids to the outer membrane (which comes from a detergent based crystal structure) it is activated in the absence of any membrane damage in <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>. The idea that PagP is activated on movement of membrane asymmetry is reasonable but also not necessarily the only mechanism. It is also plausible that a membrane defect has resulted in membrane disorder that allows PagP access to substrate in the inner leaflet.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The article is written and presented in a seamless manner, where figures, hypotheses, and figures are clearly articulated. This is a testament to the overall quality of the work and presentation. However, this is not to say that it has no weaknesses, some of which need to be addressed prior to publication. The authors' conclusions are never heavy-handed or written in absolute terms; as such they accommodate alternative opinions and possibilities; especially important, as their final figure, serves to upturn the existing dogma in the field, regarding the function of a homologous operon best studied in E. coli. Some might argue that renaming these homologs is unnecessary. The authors should strongly consider their proposal to rename these genes for the following reasons: i) the buried mention (Materials and methods) that cardiolipin is not transported by this system, argues that it is not in fact a general &quot;glycerophospholipid&quot; transporter (see below additional comments on cardiolipin); ii) these authors have only demonstrated in one strain of A. baumannii that some degree of PE and PG transport to the OM likely occurs as a consequence of this operon, and have not overturned the likely function of this operon to maintain asymmetry of the outer membrane. It's possible that context, such as organism or environments, favors utilization of this machinery in one direction or another. Also of great importance is the issue as to what fills in for the loss of GPL in the outer membrane as it is highly unlikely that it is LOS at the inner leaflet of the outer membrane. The authors' consideration on these matters, and their ability to adequately address these concerns will likely impact publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer and agree with their points regarding renaming the system and acknowledge that we have not ruled out a role for this system in maintaining OM lipid asymmetry.

Clearly the mla system is not required for growth, so if it is functioning as an anterograde transporter what is replacing GPLs in the inner leaflet of the OM in mla mutants. In the view of this reviewer, the burden of proof is now higher given the previous work on the E. coli mla system.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response above to the similar concerns of reviewer #2 regarding the composition of the OM in <italic>mla</italic> mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The audience must be provided with inner membrane and outer membrane separation data throughout the manuscript.

Several comments on this figure:</p><p>a) In 6A it appears there are more GPLs by TLC in the OM of the wild type which is odd.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not fully understand what the reviewer is referring to here with this observation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In 6B, if gpt was a anterograde transporter one would expect to see accumulation of GPLs in the inner membrane and decreases of GPLs in the outer membrane. When you look at the bar graph, the levels of PE and PG don't increase in the inner membrane in the gptC mutant and they actually decrease a little. Why?</p></disp-quote><p>Gram-negative bacteria likely have multiple redundant mechanisms to ensure that the overall quality of IM GPL does not exceed a viable threshold relative to the OM. We reiterate our response to a similar concern raised by reviewer #2. It is likely that the inner membrane content of GPL is regulated by many factors including synthesis, degradation by phospholipases, outer membrane transport, and cell division. We can speculate that feedback mechanisms have resulted in maintenance of appropriate content of the inner membrane, which is critical to cellular integrity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Have the authors performed electron microscopy to see if they observe changes in the inner membrane (membrane invaginations) because of loss of gpt mediated GPL transport? This sort of data would greatly strengthen their hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting idea but the lack of dramatic increase in GPL in the inner membrane has discouraged us from pursuing this line of research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Discussion paragraph two: The Mla system was previously reported as a retrograde transport system for E. coli and in mla mutants PagP is activated. Since PagP is only functional when PLs are present at the surface, the idea was that in mla mutants GPLs are mislocalized in the outer leaflet of the OM. In the discussion, the authors rationalize that the phenotypes observed in E. coli mla mutants might also occur because GPL transport to the OM is not as efficient and because of this the LPS-to-GPL rations are off, resulting in flipping of GPLs to the outer leaflet and this is why PagP is activated. Is this likely, as PagP needs GPLs for activity and in the authors' model the Gpt (Mla) system is responsible, at least in part, for transport of GPLs to the OM?</p></disp-quote><p>We are not certain that PagP is only active on GPL in the outer leaflet. However there may be migration of GPL to the outer leaflet in the setting of the outer membrane defect of Mla mutants. It is possible even that MlaA could function to maintain lipid asymmetry by binding GPL in the outer membrane and presenting them to phospholipases and it could function as a receiver from MlaC to transport to the outer membrane. What seems unlikely is that there is retrograde transport of the GPL back to the inner membrane. PagP and phospholipases may function and the system may also transport from the inner membrane to the outer membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Discussion paragraph three: The authors note that since the Mla (Gpt) system is upregulated in LOS deficient Acinetobacter, it suggests that Mla serves as a anterograde transporter as increased transport of GPLs may serve to compensate for lack of LOS in the outer membrane. Why couldn't it be the reverse, that the Mla system is upregulated in order to prevent too many GPLs in the OM. This goes back to what fills in the gaps when LOS is missing. After searching on PubMed, this reviewer found a recent paper from Boll et al., reporting that key lipoproteins seemed to be present in the outer leaflet of LOS deficient Acinetobacter.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct to point out that the fact of Mla upregulation in LOS deficient <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> could be argued to support either a retrograde or an anterograde transport model. As such this point may not be useful for readers and we have removed it from the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ plan to address the revisions.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The current manuscript proposes that the Acinetobacter baumannii Mla system transports glycerophospholipid to the outer membrane. This statement challenges a large body of literature on both the E. coli and A. Baumannii systems (and to some extent V. Cholerae and H. influenza), all of which favor that Mla is instead involved in OM turnover and retrograde transport. After consultation with the reviewers, several key points would HAVE to be clarified for publication in eLife:</p><p>1) The reference to existing literature must be improved in particular to reconcile and potentially explain the differences between this study and published studies. If needed, additional experiments must be provided to resolve/address these conflicts. Along these lines:</p><p>– Powers and Trent, 2018, published evidence for retrograde transport in the same organism, which is not commented by the authors.</p><p>– Contrarily to this study, multiple laboratories have reported that deletion of mlA genes is not associated with increased sensitivity to vancomycin and in fact linked to vancomycin resistance gene induction.</p><p>– Roier et al. (Nat Comm, 2016) have shown that mlA deletion is linked to OMV production in V. Cholerae and H. influenza, which is not taken into account in this study. Can the authors rule out that lower GPL levels in the OM are not due to the loss of OM materials?</p><p>2) The pulse chase assay is an important innovation of this study and the major experimental evidence to support the proposed directionality of Mla. Proving the consistency of this assay is therefore paramount to support the authors’ conclusions. The authors need to provide all the controls confirming that the IM and the OM were correctly separated in sucrose density gradients, which apparently is performed for the first time in A. Baumannii. For this, sucrose gradients need to be shown, with a complete set of IM and OM controls. A series of helpful recommendations is provided in the individual reviews. Variations in the assay starting point and in particular the high variance in total labeled lipids should also be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to respond to the thoughtful comments of the reviewers and to share our plan to revise our manuscript to improve suitability for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. We would like to thank the reviewers and editors for their time and careful discussions surrounding this work. Given the concerns of the editors and reviewers, we would like to offer the following clarifications of key points. The reviewers seemed to have three main points of concern for which we believe we can rapidly respond and facilitate the publication of our manuscript. The three concerns were 1) that our paper did not take into account existing literature on published phenotypes of <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> mutants; 2) that we did not provide adequate controls around membrane separation; and 3) about the initial labeling variability and potential alternative explanations of the radiolabeled lipid transport assay. In the case of the literature as discussed below in greater detail, we will take into account in the writing of the manuscript this additional paper that was published after we submitted the manuscript, though we do not believe our results are in conflict with it. As to membrane separation, we ran controls for outer and inner membrane separation that should have been included in the original manuscript, and they are very convincing in that they show that we are able to separate the membranes, and this should allay concerns in this regard. As to potential alternative explanations within the radiolabeled lipid assay (i.e., outer membrane blebbing or lipid hydrolysis), we discuss below how our choice to present data as a ratio of labeled to unlabeled lipid—rather than total lipid—controls for any loss of lipid through alternative methods. In short, while outer membrane blebbing or lipid breakdown may influence the total lipid content, it would not be expected to specifically target either labeled or unlabeled lipid and therefore would not affect the ratios presented. Further, we also discuss in detail below why the initial labeling may have variability but how it is similarly controlled by the measurement of ratios of labeled lipids. We hope this will allay the reviewers’ and editors’ concerns and allow us to publish this work, which is likely to be of interest to the field and stimulate discourse about this topic.</p><p>We intend to rewrite portions of the manuscript that refer to existing literature to further explain why we believe our hypothesis regarding the anterograde transport function of the Mla system is not disproven by existing literature. We are aware that our model of the Mla system conflicts with the dominant idea regarding the system’s function, and as such, our attempts to address previous work must be careful and deliberate. We intend to make every attempt in rewriting the manuscript to explain the limitations of our results, that they are in <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, and that they do not rule out the possibility that under certain circumstance the system could additionally function to maintain outer membrane lipid asymmetry. However, we believe our conclusions regarding an anterograde transport function for the Mla system to be valid and supported by our data. We also intend to revise the manuscript to reflect the following:</p><p>1) The study by Powers and Trent was published in PNAS after our submission of this manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic>, and as such it has not been addressed in earlier versions. We intend to revise the manuscript to comment on this data, and to address those authors’ conclusions that their data reflect evidence of a retrograde transport function for Mla in <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>. Powers and Trent first obtained <italic>A. baumannii</italic> deficient in lipooligosaccharide (LOS) by selection in the presence of polymyxin B. They then performed an evolution experiment, passaging the strains in cultures containing polymyxin B over 120 generations, at which point they observed significantly improved growth in the populations. These evolved populations were also observed to have increased resistance to antibiotics including vancomycin, bacitracin, and daptomycin, and to appear more morphologically consistent relative to the unevolved strains when observed microscopically. Whole genome sequencing of the evolved strains revealed mutations in <italic>mla</italic> genes in seven of the 10 evolved populations. They also observed frequent disruptions in <italic>pldA</italic>, encoding an outer membrane phospholipase, as well as in other envelope genes. To further study these effects, they then introduced clean deletions of <italic>mlaE</italic> and <italic>pldA</italic> to ATCC 19606, and selected for LOS-deficient bacteria by plating on polymyxin B. These double mutants demonstrated improved growth and resistance to antibiotics, but continued to display altered cellular morphology. Mutations in <italic>mlaE</italic> in an LOS-deficient background were also shown by RNA-seq to be differentially regulated for 120 genes.</p><p>The authors present their data as evidence in support of Mla as a retrograde transport system. We would point out that lacking in their data is examination of the membrane glycerophospholipid (GPL) profile in their LOS-deficient mutants. It is assumed by the authors that <italic>mla</italic> and <italic>pldA</italic> mutations have the effect of stabilizing a symmetric outer membrane produced in the absence of LOS by allowing GPL to fill in the outer leaflet, resulting in improved growth and antibiotic resistance. Given that the data suggests that Mla and PldA are selected against when LOS is absent, examination of the outer membrane GPL content might have supported the authors’ conclusions if it revealed an increase in GPL in <italic>mla</italic> and <italic>pldA</italic> mutants. Absent such data, it is not obvious to us that the authors have sufficiently ruled out alternative explanations for their observed phenomena. For example, we would question the mechanisms regulating the homeostasis of both the inner and outer membranes and the entire periplasmic space in the absence of LOS. The authors acknowledge earlier work that observed an increase in expression of <italic>mla</italic> genes upon initial loss of LOS in 19606 (PMID: 22024825, PMID: 27681618). Genes in the <italic>mla</italic> pathway were shown to have an up to 7.5-fold increase in gene expression upon loss of LOS. Powers and Trent assert that the function of Mla is deleterious in the absence of LOS, but perhaps what is deleterious is the profound upregulation of <italic>mla</italic> expression in the absence of LOS, combined with an active PldA. If Mla is an anterograde transporter, we can imagine this might create a situation in which GPL are rapidly removed from the inner membrane and then degraded in the outer membrane in excess of what the cell can support, and limiting both of these processes together simply allows the cell to achieve a new homeostasis. The fact is, understanding of the myriad processes regulating bacterial outer membrane assembly and integrity remains limited even when LOS is present, and so interpreting results such as these is extremely difficult. Lastly, most data support a model in which the outer membrane is not a fluid membrane but an organelle assembled in chunks of proteins and lipids that are further assembled as a mosaic; and therefore it might be somewhat unpredictable whether adding GPL to pieces of the outer membrane without LOS would be detrimental or not, this idea is consistent with the large number of suppressor mutations the authors observed in the LOS mutant. Therefore, the authors’ interpretation of their data may not be as absolute as stated in their discussion, rather it in our view represents one possibility unsupported with biochemical data.</p><p>2) We are not aware of studies in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> that clearly refute our result of increased sensitivity to vancomycin in <italic>mla</italic> mutants. The reviewers did not indicate a specific reference in their comments. Powers and Trent observed an increase in vancomycin resistance in ATCC 19606 when both <italic>mla</italic> and <italic>pldA</italic> are mutated together, but the effect of either single mutation on vancomycin resistance is not shown. Recently, work performed in <italic>Burkholderia</italic> has shown that Bcc <italic>mla</italic> mutants are more sensitive to Gram-positive antibiotics such as macrolides and rifampin, as well as fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol (PMID: 29986943), while those effects were not observed in <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa mla</italic> mutants. This indicates that the effect of <italic>mla</italic> on antibiotic susceptibility may be species-dependent, and may differ in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> from other organisms that have been studied for reasons that are not yet known. In some organisms under the conditions grown in the laboratory, the amount of GPL transported and the expression of Mla may vary and reflect outer membrane integrity, perhaps leading to variability within species. However, we are confident in our results which have been repeated many times in multiple different independently isolated mutants.</p><p>3) The reviewers were interested in the idea that GPL could be lost from the surface by a mechanism that involved the formation of vesicles. While this could be true, it is not really relevant to our assay measuring GPL labeled ratios over time, which was developed in part because of this possibility. We considered the possibility of loss of GPL from the outer membrane due to outer membrane vesicle formation or more likely, by the possible increased activation of outer membrane phospholipases. Both would have the effect of removing GPL from the outer membrane and would result in lower GPL levels in the outer membrane of <italic>mla</italic> mutants. Neither of these mechanisms would operate specifically on either labeled or unlabeled lipids. We understood the decrease in outer membrane GPL to be insufficient evidence of an anterograde transport function for <italic>mla,</italic> and for this reason we developed the stable isotope assay to control for these possibilities. The stable isotope assay gives insight into whether these results are due simply to mislocalization or degradation of outer membrane GPL, or if they can in fact be attributed to deficient anterograde GPL transport. This is because the peak intensity of each newly synthesized, C13-labeled GPL is normalized to the corresponding unlabeled version of that GPL species with each sample injected into the LC-MS/MS. The result is a molar ratio of labeled to unlabeled GPL for every membrane sample. With C13-acetate as the sole carbon source, we observe a gradual increase in the ratio of labeled GPL relative to unlabeled GPL over time. In wild type bacteria, these ratios for the inner and outer membranes track closely over time, which indicates that under these conditions GPL transport from the inner to the outer membrane occurs quite rapidly, as has been previously shown in <italic>E. coli</italic> reference. In <italic>mla</italic> mutants the ratio is both higher and typically increases at a greater rate in the inner membrane. Phospholipases and budding outer membrane vesicles will not distinguish between labeled and unlabeled GPL species, and so will not impact the ratios obtained with this assay. We will include in our manuscript a discussion of OMV production in <italic>mla</italic> mutants and clarify that our stable isotope assay accounts for that possibility.</p><p>We appreciate the need to assure readers that the separation of the inner and outer membranes performed in this study is valid. We intend to provide enzymatic controls to further verify proper separation of the two membranes. We already have data that support the integrity of our samples using an NADH assay, as shown in Author Response Image 1. Our sucrose gradient contains three distinct concentrations of sucrose, and inner and outer membranes separate into distinct bands that are collected individually. To limit any potential mixing of the membranes, the inner membrane is collected from the top of the tube while the outer membrane is collected by puncturing the bottom of the tube and allowing the bottom band to be collected. We do not collect a gradient series as the reviewers may have seen performed by other laboratories. The image below may prove helpful for readers to understand this process and visualize the clear separation of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> membranes in this procedure. We can state that we visually observed no difference in membrane separation of <italic>mla</italic> mutants relative to wild type, but we did not record images of those membrane separations side by side. If those images would be helpful we can repeat the fractionation procedure to demonstrate.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40171-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>The reviewers were concerned about some variability in the initial incorporation of label in the radiolabeled assay. We are aware that over the first hour of exposure, the initial rate at which C13-acetate was taken up and used to synthesize GPL appears to vary within a single strain over different experiments, as can be seen on examination of Supplementary file 2. We attribute this variability to minor differences in the optical density and growth time of the cultures following overnight growth with acetate as the sole carbon source, as well as to potentially slightly varying exposure to the stable isotope, although the exact reasons are not entirely clear. Although the starting values of isotope labeling varied, we consistently observed an increase in labeling in the inner membranes of <italic>mla</italic> mutants compared to the outer membrane that we did not observe in wild type, across multiple experiments. Comparing the relative percentage of isotope labeling on the inner membrane relative to the outer membrane in fact revealed consistent results across replicates, as we have presented in Figure 5C. The initial labeling differences do not necessarily reflect specific biological differences but represent a starting point for the assay. We present some raw data and not data normalized as many might submit because the initial labeling is not relevant and could be altered by the amounts of unlabeled acetate versus labeled in the culture.</p><p>[Editors’ notes: the authors’ response after being formally invited to submit a revised submission follows.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>After further consultation with the reviewers we decided that your response could adequately address the comments provided that in addition to the proposed changes the revision further contains the following new experiments:</p><p>1) Given the existing literature, we would like further that the discrepancy on the vancomycin sensitivity be resolved by verification of this phenotype in a different A. baumannii strain.</p><p>2) Completion of sucrose gradients with the proper controls to verify inner and outer membrane separation for both wild type and mla mutants (e.g. NADH oxidase assays).
