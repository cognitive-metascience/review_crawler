The most severely affected dilated cardiomyopathy patients harbor Titin truncations in the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein, suggesting that mutation position might influence disease mechanism. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated six zebrafish lines with Titin truncations in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions. Although all exons were constitutive, C-terminal mutations caused severe myopathy whereas N-terminal mutations demonstrated mild phenotypes. Surprisingly, neither mutation type acted as a dominant negative. Instead, we found a conserved internal promoter at the precise position where divergence in disease severity occurs, with the resulting protein product partially rescuing N-terminal truncations. In addition to its clinical implications, our work may shed light on a long-standing mystery regarding the architecture of the sarcomere.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09406.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09406.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09406.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The heart is able to beat partly because of a large protein called Titin that helps to give heart muscle its elasticity. Mutations that shorten the gene that encodes Titin can cause part of the heart to become enlarged and weakened, a condition called dilated cardiomyopathy. Some people with shortened copies of this protein have a mild form of cardiomyopathy and are able to lead relatively normal lives. Others develop more severe symptoms that prevent the heart from pumping blood effectively and may even cause the individual to need a heart transplant.</p><p>Genetic studies have revealed that mutations that shorten the Titin protein by disrupting the portion of the gene corresponding to the latter two-thirds of the protein (which encodes the so-called “C-terminal” end of the protein) cause more severe symptoms than mutations that occur near the start of the gene. But it is not clear why the location of the mutation matters.</p><p>To investigate this problem, Zou et al. used a gene-editing tool called CRISPR to create genetically engineered zebrafish. These fish had mutations at one of six different points in the gene that encodes the zebrafish version of Titin. Just as with humans, mutations near the C-terminal end of the gene caused more severe muscle problems in the fish.</p><p>Specifically, Zou et al. found that the worst disease was associated with mutations that occurred at or after a “promoter” region within the gene and near this C-terminal end. Normally, the promoter produces an independent smaller form of the Titin protein, which helps to reduce the severity of muscle problems in zebrafish that have mutations near the start of the gene. However, mutations near the C-terminal end of the gene also damage this smaller form, preventing this failsafe from working, and so lead to more severe symptoms. Zou et al. also found this promoter to be active in both mouse and human hearts.</p><p>Future work will focus on learning how this smaller form of Titin works to help muscle develop and withstand stress and determine whether increasing its production can overcome the more severe forms of disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09406.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09406.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>genetic</kwd><kwd>cardiomyopathy</kwd><kwd>sarcomere</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15POST25090054</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2 HL123228</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deo</surname><given-names>Rahul C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 HL107440-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deo</surname><given-names>Rahul C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08 HL093861</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deo</surname><given-names>Rahul C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The newly discovered Titin internal promoter may explain why the severity of dilated cardiomyopathy in patients with truncating mutations in Titin varies dramatically depending on position of the mutation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The use of genetics in clinical medicine depends on knowledge that an identified mutation confers risk of disease. Recent guidance issued by the American College of Medical Genetics emphasizes that the strongest form of evidence supporting causality of a mutation is whether it results in a truncation of the protein (nonsense, frameshift or canonical splice-site mutations), specifically for genes where loss-of-function mutations are known to cause disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Richards et al., 2015</xref>). Truncating mutations within alternatively spliced exons and at the extreme C-terminus of the protein must be interpreted with caution, as they may have little to no impact on protein function. However, the guidelines do not address whether truncating mutations at different positions along the length of the protein might differ in phenotype severity or mechanism of action, a finding that could complicate interpretation of truncation mutations for a broad range of inherited diseases.</p><p>Truncations in the giant sarcomeric protein Titin (TTN) reveal patterns that are at odds with this uniform assignment of causality. TTN lies along the length of the sarcomere and is thought to mediate passive tension of the muscle fiber, while also serving as a binding scaffold for a large number of proteins, including actin and myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lewinter and Granzier, 2013</xref>). Individual regions of TTN are annotated according to their localization to the Z-disc, I-band, A-band, and M-line regions of the sarcomere visualized on immuno-electron micrographs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fürst et al., 1988</xref>. Truncating and/or missense mutations in TTN result in cardiac (dilated cardiomyopathy [DCM]) and skeletal muscle (myofibrillar myopathy) disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chauveau et al., 2014</xref>). Recent estimates suggest that truncation mutations in TTN may explain as much as 25% of DCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herman et al., 2012</xref>), a disease which affects upwards of 1 in 2500 individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Codd et al., 1989</xref>). Although truncations are found along the length of TTN in DCM patients, in patients with the most severe forms of DCM, truncations reside within the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein (from amino acid 14,760 onwards, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), specifically in the distal I-band and A-band (we will refer to these as C-terminal truncations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roberts et al., 2015</xref>). Multiple TTN exons are alternatively spliced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bang et al., 2001</xref>), with many having little to no inclusion within cardiac isoforms, and splicing has been proposed to at least partially explain the exclusion of N-terminal mutations in patients with end-stage DCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herman et al., 2012</xref>). Nonetheless, over 5500 amino acids in the N-terminal region of the protein are constitutive (percent spliced in or PSI &gt;0.9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), implying the importance of other mechanisms.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09406.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of six stable zebrafish lines with truncating mutations in ttna, the zebrafish orthologue of TTN, using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the <italic>TTN</italic> meta-transcript (Ensembl ID ENST00000589042), including all known exons with the exception of the Novex-3 exon, which is exclusive to the Novex-3 isoform (Ensembl ID ENST00000360870).

For a disease such as DCM, in which inheritance is most commonly observed as adult-onset autosomal dominant with variable penetrance, deciphering such mechanisms in mouse models can be challenging, as heterozygotes tend to show minimal phenotypes and homozygotes tend to be embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gramlich et al., 2009</xref>). We selected the vertebrate zebrafish model for several reasons. Firstly, zebrafish has high sequence conservation of sarcomeric proteins with mammals and recapitulate disease phenotypes with loss-of-function of multiple established Mendelian cardiomyopathy genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dahme et al., 2009</xref>).

Secondly, zebrafish can live for up to two weeks with a non-contractile heart, thus allowing mechanistic studies of homozygote mutants. Thirdly, the relatively low cost and large clutch size of zebrafish allow the ability to generate multiple mutant lines and provide statistical power for robust conclusions.</p><p>As a result of an ancestral genome duplication event, zebrafish include two titin genes: <italic>ttna</italic> and <italic>ttnb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Steffen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seeley et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Ttna</italic> shares considerable similarity with the human TTN gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, showing ‘meta-transcripts’ with all possible exons included). The zebrafish and human proteins are similar in length (∼32,000–35,000 amino acids depending on the splice isoform) and share 56% identity and 82% homology. They have a nearly identical domain organization, with three immunoglobulin-like of domains (proximal, mid, and distal), an elastic PEVK region, N2A and N2B domains which distinguish cardiac and skeletal isoforms, a fibronectin-immunoglobulin repeat region that mediates binding to myosin, and a C-terminal kinase domain. In both species, alternative splicing targets the middle Ig-like and PEVK domains, which modulate passive tensile properties of the sarcomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Granzier and Labeit, 2004</xref>). Cardiac isoforms typically include much of this elastic region as well as the N2B ± N2A domains, while skeletal isoforms include the N2A domain but exclude N2B as well as much of the elastic region. Multiple mutants isolated from forward genetic screens coupled with morpholino knockdown analysis have demonstrated that <italic>ttna</italic> is essential for cardiac sarcomere formation in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Myhre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seeley et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Although the paralagous zebrafish <italic>ttnb</italic> gene is dispensable for cardiac sarcomere development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Steffen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seeley et al., 2007</xref>), it plays an essential role in skeletal muscle sarcomerogenesis.

In contrast to human TTN or zebrafish ttna, the ttnb protein has abbreviated versions of the middle Ig-like and PEVK elastic domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and thus more closely resembles skeletal rather than cardiac muscle isoforms of <italic>ttna</italic>.

To investigate a dominant negative mechanism for ttna<sup>c/c</sup> mutants, we performed a morpholino knockdown of ttna, targeting a splice site of an N-terminal constitutive exon (exon 4), which would be expected to introduce an N-terminal frameshift on top of the same C-terminal mutant allele. If the differences between ttna<sup>n/n</sup> and ttna<sup>c/c</sup> mutants arose simply from inhibitory effects of the ttna<sup>c/c</sup> truncated product, then introducing an upstream frameshift should disrupt production of the dominant negative protein product even further and restore sarcomeric architecture. Knockdown by morpholino was effective (∼78% knockdown efficiency, data not shown) and the combined action of NMD and morpholino knockdown would be expected to reduce mutant ttna protein to only ∼5% of the level of ttnb protein.

To establish conservation in mammals, we repeated 5’-RACE on adult mouse and fetal human cardiac tissue and found a TSS in the upstream intron (257bp upstream of e223 in mouse; 256bp upstream of the orthologous exon, e240, in humans), with a putative initiator methionine 12 amino acids upstream of the relevant exon.

Specifically, an open question remains whether all TTN truncations lead to cardiac or skeletal muscle phenotypes, or conversely, do any TTN truncations lack cardiac or skeletal muscle consequences. In a disease such as dilated cardiomyopathy, with a variable age of onset, it can be challenging to derive general conclusions from observational data of control subjects, many of whom are young or middle-aged. Furthermore, self-reports of ‘health’ may not reveal limitations in an individual’s ability to attain full exercise potential, especially with aging.</p><p>To assess whether any <italic>TTN</italic> truncations are compatible with a high degree of cardiovascular fitness throughout life, we turned to a population genetics approach, and sequenced the complete TTN exome (as well as that of 104 other Mendelian cardiac disease genes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) in 199 competitive senior athletes who entered as contestants in the Huntsman World Senior Games (median age 73, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). We compared the frequency and distribution of TTN truncation mutations to those found in unselected controls and healthy volunteers from a recent sequencing study (CTL<sub>lit</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roberts et al., 2015</xref>). The overall rate of TTN truncations did not differ between senior athletes and CTL<sub>lit</sub> (1.5 vs 1.2%, p = 0.91). However, the distribution of TTN truncations differed significantly between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>): TTN truncations in senior athletes mapped exclusively to the extreme C-terminal exon of the rare Novex-3 isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bang et al., 2001</xref>), at a nearly 8-fold higher rate than CTL<sub>lit</sub> (p = 0.003).

Our work further contributes the discovery of a conserved internal promoter in <italic>TTN</italic>, whose protein product is essential for skeletal muscle sarcomere development in zebrafish. The <italic>Cronos</italic> promoter is prominently expressed in developing mouse heart, and its location coincides strikingly with the position of TTN truncations in patients with the most severe forms of dilated cardiomyopathy. Our working model is that disruption of both the full-length <italic>TTN</italic> and <italic>Cronos</italic> protein products results in more severe disease than disruption of the full-length product alone.</p><p>Throughout this work, we have focused on skeletal muscle architecture and function in zebrafish <italic>ttna</italic> homozygote mutants, given that this tissue demonstrates a sharp and rapidly developing phenotypic distinction between N- and C-terminal Titin truncations. The early onset of this unambiguous phenotypic difference combined with the ease of genetic and transcriptomic manipulation using CRISPR/Cas9 and morpholino technology allowed efficient mapping of the novel <italic>Cronos</italic> internal promoter as well as testing of alternative mechanistic hypotheses for this phenomenon. Nonetheless, implicit in our work is the assumption that findings from zebrafish skeletal muscle sarcomere development in <italic>ttna</italic> homozygote mutants (albeit with the paralogous <italic>ttnb</italic> present for rescue) are relevant towards understanding disease development in humans with <italic>TTN</italic> mutations. Prominent differences between these systems must be noted. With the exception of certain childhood-onset forms of skeletal and cardiac myopathy arising from homozygous <italic>TTN</italic> truncations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carmignac et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ceyhan-Birsoy et al., 2013</xref>), the mode of inheritance in <italic>TTN</italic> truncation mutation patients is heterozygous with marked variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roberts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Itoh-Satoh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Norton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van Spaendonck-Zwarts et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, disease onset usually occurs in adulthood. Such an inheritance pattern is typical of many of the familial forms of cardiomyopathy, and is believed to imply additional modifying effects, potentially from diverse sources as autoimmunity and viral infection as well as contributions from additional genetic variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mrh et al., 2015</xref>). Nonetheless, taking all of our results together, we find it a highly plausible explanation that a superimposed deficiency in expression of the <italic>Cronos</italic> protein product would result in the more severe forms of human cardiac disease seen in DCM patients with C-terminal <italic>TTN</italic> truncations.</p><p>With these limitations noted, our results have two clinical implications for titinopathy patients. Firstly, by precisely mapping the location of the alternate promoter to the e239-e240 intron in humans, we are in a better position to give mutation-specific guidance to TTN truncation patients regarding the potential severity of their disease, with the caveat that additional factors (genetic and environmental) also modulate phenotypic severity. Along these lines, given the overlapping distribution of mutations in unselected cases and controls, it is unlikely that highly accurate patient prognoses would be realized from genotype information alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), although there does appear to be nearly complete separation of mutation distribution for the more extreme phenotypes (end-stage DCM and senior athletes). Secondly, our work implies that strategies that augment activity of the internal TTN promoter and levels of the <italic>Cronos</italic> isoform might provide therapeutic benefit in TTN truncation patients, although it is unclear whether there is a restricted developmental window where this might be possible.</p><p>In addition to clinical ramifications, our work may shed light on a long-standing mystery regarding sarcomeric architecture. Electron microscopy reconstructions of serial sections of skeletal muscle dating back over 50 years presented a puzzle: the thin/thick filament arrangement in the sarcomere alters its geometry, progressing from a tetragonal lattice arrangement at the Z-band to a trigonal arrangement in the A-band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pringle, 1968</xref>), with the transition taking place near the I-A junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Traeger et al., 1983</xref>). The implication for TTN would be that there would be a resulting increase in the copies of TTN protein, with four at the Z-band and six at the A-band and M-line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liversage et al., 2001</xref>), which is difficult to reconcile with the fact that a single TTN molecule spans the entire length, from Z-band to M-line. Our data provides a simple explanation for this observation, with the <italic>Cronos</italic> protein product selectively increasing copies of TTN at the distal I-band, A-band and M-line. Our work also proposes an alternative explanation for the consistently observed ‘T2’ band on protein gels, which migrates at the expected molecular weight of <italic>Cronos</italic>. This has invariably been labeled a C-terminal degradation product, as it reacts with A-band antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Opitz et al., 2004</xref>). However, in keeping with <italic>Cronos</italic> expression patterns in development, the T2 band was prominently seen in developing mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lahmers et al., 2004</xref>) and rat hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Opitz et al., 2004</xref>), but was markedly reduced in adulthood. It is possible that, at least in some situations, T2 and <italic>Cronos</italic> represent the same isoform.</p><p>These results also raise a number of questions related to the function of the <italic>Cronos</italic> isoform. Given its more marked expression in early development, is it important only for the initial sarcomerogenesis or in subsequent aspects of muscle function? Is it likely to be reactivated under stress? And how fast does it turn over compared to full-length TTN? Models with selective disruption and tagging of this isoform should begin to answer these questions. Finally, it is possible that unrecognized internal promoters influence disease severity in truncating mutations of other genes. It is likely a more nuanced diagnostic and prognostic interpretation of truncating mutations will be needed.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>sgRNA design, cloning, and in vitro transcription</title><p>sgRNA’s were designed using an in-house <italic>Python</italic> script, which scans genomic sequences for 23 bp sequences with a terminal NGG (PAM sequence), and prioritizes a GG at the 5’ end because of the use of T7 RNA polymerase for gRNA synthesis.

For each embryo, 2 independent PCR reactions - each with 10 amplification cycles - was performed. Next generation sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, E7370S) with 10 cycles post-amplification. Samples were assessed by 100 bp single end sequencing on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina). The ratio of mutant to wild-type reads was used as a measure of allelic imbalance. For each mutation, between 600 and 10,000 reads were used for ratio estimates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR to assess ratio of Cronos to full-length ttna/Ttn in zebrafish and mouse</title><p>Forward primers mapping to either e115 or the Cronos isoform was used in combination with a reverse primer spanning the e116-e117 exon-exon junction.

For mutations of canonical (-1/-2) splice acceptor variants, which would most likely result in exon skipping, we further required that the downstream exon was not in the same codon phase as the skipped exon, as this would fail to produce a frame-shift and thus not result in a truncation (such a situation is common in the I-band). Likewise, for mutations of canonical splice donor variants (+1/+2), which we predicted would result in intron read-through, we performed in silico translation of the resulting retained intron to ensure that a premature truncation was observed (this was not always the case, especially for the I-band).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analysis was performed in R (3.1.1).

Your submission has been evaluated by Mark McCarthy (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Harry Dietz, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Your manuscript has generated considerable enthusiasm. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This interesting manuscript provides a provocative explanation for a well-described phenotype-genotype correlation in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) caused by mutations in the gene encoding titin (TTN). Specifically, C-terminal heterozygous truncating mutations associate with a much more severe presentation of DCM than do N-terminal truncating mutations, with an apparent discriminating boundary between exons 115 and 116. In this manuscript, the authors recapitulate this experience using a series of targeted mutations in the <italic>ttna</italic> gene in zebrafish, which also have a paralogous <italic>ttnb</italic> gene. Evidence is provided to suggest that these observations are not based upon alternative splicing, differential efficiency of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) or differential dominant-negative potential of the predicted truncated protein products derived from the mutant alleles. Instead, the data strongly suggest the relevance of an alternative promoter that lies between exons 115 and 116, giving rise to an mRNA and protein (termed <italic>Cronos</italic>) that is expressed (and putatively functional) with proximal but not distal premature termination codon mutations. Overall, this is a very elegant study with quality data and largely convincing conclusions. However, there are a number of issues and questions that need to be addressed before we can consider this further.</p><p>1) The most substantive concern expressed by multiple reviewers relates to the relative strengths and limitations of the zebrafish model. The lack of correlation between location of truncating mutations and severity of cardiomyopathy in this model is inadequately explored and discussed. A comprehensive tissue-specific quantitative and developmental survey of alternative promoter utilization in both heart and skeletal muscle is indicated. The rationale for studying homozygous variation in zebrafish is somewhat difficult to justify completely and has an impact on the generalizability of the results. The authors should consider higher resolution phenotyping of heterozygous animals with or without environmental stressors. They should also comprehensively describe (and perhaps illustrate) what is known regarding species-specific TTN genomic structure and message biology.</p><p>2) NMD is generally a very efficient process. There is generally an apparent polarization effect, with greater efficiency for proximal PTCs, with the potential for less efficiency for distal PTCs and near-universal loss of NMD for PTCs in the very distal portion of the penultimate exon or in the last exon. In this light, it is surprising that all assayed PTCs (none in last exons) had a relatively modest effect on transcript abundance (∼50% of WT). The details regarding how this assay was performed are minimal and should be expanded. Would the assay detect the <italic>Cronos</italic> transcript that is expected to be present for N- but not C-terminal truncations? If so, why is this not reflected in the results of this experiment?</p><p>3) Additional experimental details and/or controls are also needed for the dominant-negative assay, for example the control for efficient morpholino-induced exon skipping related to observation of cardiomyopathy in WT mice. There needs to be some demonstration of high efficiency in skeletal muscle. Also, the authors should consider the possibility of a dosage-dependent dominant-negative effect when interpreting their results.</p><p>4) The apparent demonstration of the <italic>Cronos</italic> protein product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is not convincing. There is poor resolution, no demonstration of specificity, no identification of full-length protein, no explanation for the variation in intensity of other protein isoforms that vary between genotypes, and no loading control.</p><p>5) Much more detail is needed regarding the exact location and predicted functional consequence of the truncating mutations observed in senior athletes vs. various control populations. When compared to healthy volunteers or participants in heart study cohorts (numbers not specified), senior athletes had about the same frequency (∼1.0-1.5%) of TTN truncation mutations. However, all senior athletes had their truncating mutation in the very distal portion of the Novex-3 isoform (that is rather poorly described in this manuscript), while the other groups largely showed ‘other’ types of truncations. Apparently, there is an alternative TTN transcript that includes a large (∼6.5kb) terminal exon that also contains a 3' cleavage and polyadenylation signal. By report, the Novex-3 transcript contains all proximal exons, and terminates considerably short of the alternative promoter described here. Are the truncations in the very distal portion of the Novex-3 exon seen in robust old age because they have no functional impact at all (i.e. normal levels of both full-length and Novex-3 message and protein due to avoidance of NMD in both)? While the data might even suggest a selective advantage, there is no mechanism that can even be inferred by the data and conclusions of this manuscript. Perhaps more importantly, what was the specific nature of the ‘other’ truncating mutations in the healthy volunteers and other unselected cohorts? Were they greatly enriched for N- as opposed to C-terminal truncations (defined by the exon 115/116 boundary), as might be predicted by this study? Were the Novex-3 truncations seen in the FHS and JHS cohorts also in the extreme C-terminal exon, or were they more widely distributed?</p><p>6) There are concerns regarding generalizations made about existing TTN phenotype-genotype correlations in human cardiomyopathy patients. The initial inference that C-terminal titin truncation variants are uniformly classified as pathogenic mutations is incorrect. There is a substantial excess of C-terminal truncating variants in DCM subjects, but there are also such variants in the control groups so the position of a variant is insufficient (at least at this resolution) to define pathogenicity. This observation also raises important questions regarding the mechanisms of pathogenicity. In addition, it is worth noting that there are remarkably few of the proposed truncating mutations that have been demonstrated to result in truncated protein and there are only two extant families where there are any segregation data of significance between titin variants of any sort and the DCM phenotype. In each case, the variant is not clearly truncating when studied closely. Finally, the spectrum of variation in titin that leads to skeletal muscle involvement is not so systematically described but many DCM subjects (with heterozygous genotypes) have subclinical skeletal muscle involvement when examined rigorously. The suggestion that TTN mutations cause HCM is controversial and should be stated as such. The distinction between N- and C- terminal truncating mutations with regard to DCM is not as discrete and robust as is suggested by the authors, with documentation of cases with N-terminal truncations (i.e. Herman DS et al, NEJM 2012). Also, given the complexities of TTN transcript biology that remain to be fully explored in fish, mice and especially people, the authors’ suggestion that it is now possible to definitively classify C-terminal variation in the titin gene is overstated. While this work will undoubtedly contribute to progress, much more needs to be done to reliably inform patient management and counseling.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;An internal promoter underlies the difference in disease severity between N- and C-terminal truncations of Titin in zebrafish&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Specifically, C-terminal heterozygous truncating mutations associate with a much more severe presentation of DCM than do N-terminal truncating mutations, with an apparent discriminating boundary between exons 115 and 116. In this manuscript, the authors recapitulate this experience using a series of targeted mutations in the</italic> ttna <italic>gene in zebrafish, which also have a paralogous</italic> ttnb <italic>gene. Evidence is provided to suggest that these observations are not based upon alternative splicing, differential efficiency of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) or differential dominant-negative potential of the predicted truncated protein products derived from the mutant alleles. Instead, the data strongly suggest the relevance of an alternative promoter that lies between exons 115 and 116, giving rise to an mRNA and protein (termed</italic> Cronos<italic>) that is expressed (and putatively functional) with proximal but not distal premature termination codon mutations. Overall, this is a very elegant study with quality data and largely convincing conclusions. However, there are a number of issues and questions that need to be addressed before we can consider this further. 1) The most substantive concern expressed by multiple reviewers relates to the relative strengths and limitations of the zebrafish model. The lack of correlation between location of truncating mutations and severity of cardiomyopathy in this model is inadequately explored and discussed. A comprehensive tissue-specific quantitative and developmental survey of alternative promoter utilization in both heart and skeletal muscle is indicated. The rationale for studying homozygous variation in zebrafish is somewhat difficult to justify completely and has an impact on the generalizability of the results. The authors should consider higher resolution phenotyping of heterozygous animals with or without environmental stressors. They should also comprehensively describe (and perhaps illustrate) what is known regarding species-specific TTN genomic structure and message biology.</italic></p><p>With regard to the primary area of contention, we recognize that we have done an inadequate job drawing a path between our observations in the zebrafish model and human cardiac disease. In the revised manuscript we have sought to make a clearer, more compelling case with the following changes:</p><p>A) Comparison of zebrafish and human titin:</p><p>The following text is included verbatim in the revised manuscript and we have included a new Figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>) to graphically illustrate the domain organization of human TTN and zebrafish <italic>ttna</italic> and <italic>ttnb</italic>, as suggested. Our primary objectives in this section are to 1) highlight the similarities between the human and zebrafish Titin proteins, and 2) emphasize that the paralogous ttna and ttnb proteins are both essential for skeletal muscle sarcomere development, creating a scenario where, at least in skeletal muscle, studying a homozygote knockout of one of these genes bears resemblance to studying a heterozygote in mammals.</p><p>We have also rephrased the text accordingly. Please see: “As a result of an ancestral genome duplication event, zebrafish include two titin genes: <italic>ttna</italic> and <italic>ttnb</italic> […] severe disruption of skeletal muscle sarcomeric architecture, highlighting the mutual contribution of the two genes (14).”</p><p>B) Tissue-specific quantitative and developmental survey of <italic>Cronos</italic> expression:</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have added 3 new figure panels that characterize <italic>Cronos</italic> expression in zebrafish and mouse by whole mount in situ hybridization (with one probe specific to <italic>Cronos</italic>) and by quantitative real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-C</xref>). Our primary observation is that <italic>Cronos</italic> expression is at high levels in zebrafish skeletal muscle during development (∼2:1 ratio of <italic>Cronos</italic> to full-length <italic>ttna</italic>), but drops off dramatically during adulthood (∼1:70 ratio). Although the <italic>Cronos</italic> expression in zebrafish heart also appears to be developmentally regulated, it is much lower than in skeletal muscle, with a ∼1:5 ratio at 72 hr and 1:30 ratio in adulthood.</p><p>In contrast, the relative levels of <italic>Cronos</italic> in mouse heart are much higher than in skeletal muscle, with nearly a 1:1 ratio of <italic>Cronos</italic> to full-length Titin in E12.5 heart. Thereafter mouse cardiac expression of <italic>Cronos</italic> decreases to ∼20–30% of full-length Titin. Skeletal muscle expression varies widely across development and in different muscle beds with a 1:5 ratio in mouse hindlimb at P2, and between 1:16 and ∼1:1000 ratios in adult extensor digitorum longus (fast-twitch) and soleus (slow-twitch) muscle, respectively.</p><p>We indicate that the poor expression of <italic>Cronos</italic> in zebrafish heart can be a possible explanation for the indistinguishable cardiac phenotypes of N- and C-terminal truncation mutants, though the fact that <italic>ttnb</italic> plays a minimal role in cardiac development is probably also contributing to the severity of the <italic>ttna</italic> mutants.</p><p>In addition to the additional <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, we have included two paragraphs summarizing the tissue-specific and developmental stage results: “We next surveyed the expression levels of <italic>Cronos</italic> in cardiac and skeletal muscle […] expression varies across development and in different muscle beds with a 1:5 ratio in mouse hindlimb at P2, and between 1:16 and ∼1:1000 ratios in adult extensor digitorum longus (fast-twitch) and soleus (slow-twitch) muscle, respectively.”</p><p>C) Interpretation of lack of variation in truncation mutation severity in heart:</p><p>We attribute the stark differences between skeletal muscle phenotypes in <italic>ttna</italic> N- and C-terminal truncation mutants to 1) the prominent expression of <italic>Cronos</italic> in developing skeletal muscle and 2) the presence of an important functional paralog, <italic>ttnb</italic>, which can substitute for <italic>ttna</italic> function. Unfortunately, in cardiac muscle the contribution of both of these factors is severely diminished, including low expression of <italic>Cronos</italic>, and a more minimal role for <italic>ttnb</italic> in cardiac sarcomerogenesis.</p><p>We are reassured that there is prominent expression of <italic>Cronos</italic> in developing mouse heart, which is in keeping with <italic>Cronos</italic> playing an important role in mammalian heart development and therefore consistent with the lack of <italic>Cronos</italic> intensifying DCM phenotypic severity. Interestingly, others have described a prominent band on protein gels of developing mouse and rat heart tissue at the expected molecular weight of <italic>Cronos</italic>, which is substantially diminished in adulthood. This band has been dismissed as a degradation product – but we speculate that in some cases this is very likely to be <italic>Cronos</italic>.</p><p>We touch on the limited cardiac expression of <italic>Cronos</italic> in zebrafish as well as the limited contribution of <italic>ttnb</italic> in heart development as explanation for our zebrafish cardiac results. We also include an additional paragraph in the Discussion: “Our work also proposes an alternative explanation for the consistently observed ‘T2’ band on protein gels, which migrates at the expected molecular weight of <italic>Cronos</italic>. This has invariably been labeled a C-terminal degradation product, as it reacts with A-band antibodies (25). However, in keeping with <italic>Cronos</italic> expression patterns in development, the T2 band was prominently seen in developing mouse (25) and rat hearts (26), but was markedly reduced in adulthood. It is possible that, at least in some situations, T2 and <italic>Cronos</italic> represent the same isoform.”</p><p>D) Perturbation induced discrimination of N- and C-terminal heterozygotes:</p><p>We agree that perturbation experiments in heterozygotes (such as was done with <italic>Ttn<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, Gramlich et al, 2009) would have been more consistent with the human disease scenario, although the presence of paralogs complicates this situation in zebrafish. Although we tried isoproterenol (and angiotensin II) at several doses and at several developmental time points and used natriuretic peptide levels as readout, we were not able to consistently distinguish WT fish from heterozygotes (N- or C). Given the low cardiac expression of <italic>Cronos</italic>, we suspect that even with an optimized assay, the distinction of N- and C-terminal truncation mutants from one another would be very challenging. <italic>2) NMD is generally a very efficient process. There is generally an apparent polarization effect, with greater efficiency for proximal PTCs, with the potential for less efficiency for distal PTCs and near-universal loss of NMD for PTCs in the very distal portion of the penultimate exon or in the last exon. In this light, it is surprising that all assayed PTCs (none in last exons) had a relatively modest effect on transcript abundance (∼50% of WT). The details regarding how this assay was performed are minimal and should be expanded. Would the assay detect the</italic> Cronos <italic>transcript that is expected to be present for N- but not C-terminal truncations? If so, why is this not reflected in the results of this experiment?</italic></p><p>This is an excellent point. Our prior approach to NMD estimate was inadequate and involved normalizing total <italic>ttna</italic> to <italic>ttnb</italic> levels in homozygote <italic>ttna</italic> null mutants. In the revised manuscript we have performed targeted RNA-Seq of the mutant exons in heterozygote embryos to estimate NMD by looking at allelic imbalance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Comparing raw counts of mutant and WT alleles, we see ∼80% of the mutant transcript degraded, in keeping with established NMD efficacy. Interestingly, we see very little variation across the length of the transcript. We have also performed qPCR to estimate the ratio of <italic>Cronos</italic> to full-length <italic>ttna</italic> in N-terminal and C-terminal mutants and find the expected result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>): a high ratio of <italic>Cronos</italic> to full-length <italic>ttna</italic> for all N-terminal mutants and a much lower rate, more comparable to WT, for the C-terminal mutants. We suspect that some variation in promoter activity for the full-length and <italic>Cronos</italic> transcripts could account for some of the variation in these ratios within the N- and C-terminal mutant groups.</p><p>We have modified the text and figures to include this data, which we believe strengthens our story. For example, we now state: “Given that NMD substantially reduces the levels of <italic>ttna</italic> transcripts with premature termination codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), we reasoned that we should be able to distinguish N- and C-terminal truncation mutants by the ratio of <italic>Cronos</italic> to full-length transcript. In <italic>ttnan/n</italic> mutants, which would degrade full-length <italic>ttna</italic> but not <italic>Cronos</italic>, we would anticipate a higher <italic>Cronos</italic>:full-length ratio than in <italic>ttna</italic><sup>c/c</sup>mutants mutants, which should degrade both transcripts approximately equally. As expected, we see a much higher ratio of <italic>Cronos</italic>:full-length transcript levels in <italic>ttna</italic><sup>n/n</sup>mutants than in <italic>ttna</italic><sup>c/c</sup>mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).” <italic>3) Additional experimental details and/or controls are also needed for the dominant-negative assay, for example the control for efficient morpholino-induced exon skipping related to observation of cardiomyopathy in WT mice. There needs to be some demonstration of high efficiency in skeletal muscle. Also, the authors should consider the possibility of a dosage-dependent dominant-negative effect when interpreting their results.</italic></p><p>We have now performed qPCR to demonstrate ∼78% knockdown efficiency using our <italic>ttna</italic> morpholino. Either exon skipping or intron retention arising from morpholino injection should result in an N-terminal truncation on top of the C-terminal mutation. In conjunction with NMD, this intervention should result in residual C-terminal truncated protein being at ∼5% of the level of <italic>ttnb</italic>. Given that we see no amelioration in skeletal muscle function (fish remain immobile) or architecture, it is difficult to reconcile this observation with a dominant negative mechanism. Similarly, for dosage to be responsible for the difference between N- and C-terminal truncations, we would not expect to have seen similar levels of NMD for N- and C-terminal truncations nor see persistence of skeletal muscle pathology with such a low level of mutant C-terminal protein present.</p><p>In the manuscript, we have made the following changes: “Knockdown by morpholino was effective (∼78% knockdown efficiency, data not shown) and the combined action of NMD and morpholino knockdown would be expected to reduce mutant ttna protein to only ∼5% of the level of ttnb protein. Nonetheless we were unable to rescue skeletal muscle architecture in <italic>ttna</italic><sup>c/c</sup>mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We thus concluded that <italic>ttna</italic><sup>c/c</sup> mutants do not act as dominant negatives and that an alternative explanation was needed.”</p><p> <italic>4) The apparent demonstration of the</italic> Cronos <italic>protein product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is not convincing. There is poor resolution, no demonstration of specificity, no identification of full-length protein, no explanation for the variation in intensity of other protein isoforms that vary between genotypes, and no loading control.</italic></p><p>We have updated this gel to include morpholino knockdown controls as well as loading controls. We have found this gel technically challenging to execute, potentially because of the long running time ∼6 required, but we believe the results are now convincing.</p><p> <italic>5) Much more detail is needed regarding the exact location and predicted functional consequence of the truncating mutations observed in senior athletes vs. various control populations. When compared to healthy volunteers or participants in heart study cohorts (numbers not specified), senior athletes had about the same frequency (∼1.0–1.5%) of TTN truncation mutations. However, all senior athletes had their truncating mutation in the very distal portion of the Novex-3 isoform (that is rather poorly described in this manuscript), while the other groups largely showed ‘other’ types of truncations. Apparently, there is an alternative TTN transcript that includes a large (∼6.5 kb) terminal exon that also contains a 3' cleavage and polyadenylation signal. By report, the Novex-3 transcript contains all proximal exons, and terminates considerably short of the alternative promoter described here. Are the truncations in the very distal portion of the Novex-3 exon seen in robust old age because they have no functional impact at all (i.e. normal levels of both full-length and Novex-3 message and protein due to avoidance of NMD in both)? While the data might even suggest a selective advantage, there is no mechanism that can even be inferred by the data and conclusions of this manuscript. Perhaps more importantly, what was the specific nature of the ‘other’ truncating mutations in the healthy volunteers and other unselected cohorts? Were they greatly enriched for N- as opposed to C-terminal truncations (defined by the exon 115/116 boundary), as might be predicted by this study? Were the Novex-3 truncations seen in the FHS and JHS cohorts also in the extreme C-terminal exon, or were they more widely distributed?</italic></p><p>We have modified this section and included 2 new figure panels: 1) one that depicts the position of mutations in DCM patients and control populations or from the senior athletes onto a schematic of the TTN meta-transcript 2) a ratio of mutations found in regions C-terminal to the <italic>Cronos</italic> promoter to those in the N-terminus in different populations. We have eliminated the figure panel that emphasizes the location of senior athlete mutations to the terminal exon of the Novex-3 isoform. In fact, when we referred to the Novex-3 isoform we meant only those mutations mapping to the terminal exon, which is unique to this isoform.</p><p>The following text is now included in the revised manuscript: “We compared the frequency and distribution of TTN truncation mutations to those found in unselected controls and healthy volunteers from a recent sequencing study (CTLlit) (7) […] As expected, in end-stage DCM we observed a much higher rate of mutants C-terminal to <italic>Cronos</italic> than N-terminal (30:1), followed by unselected DCM (37:11), literature controls (6:11, 2:2, 10:7 for FHS, healthy volunteers and JHS) and senior athletes (0:3).” <italic>6) There are concerns regarding generalizations made about existing TTN phenotype-genotype correlations in human cardiomyopathy patients. The initial inference that C-terminal titin truncation variants are uniformly classified as pathogenic mutations is incorrect. There is a substantial excess of C-terminal truncating variants in DCM subjects, but there are also such variants in the control groups so the position of a variant is insufficient (at least at this resolution) to define pathogenicity. This observation also raises important questions regarding the mechanisms of pathogenicity. In addition, it is worth noting that there are remarkably few of the proposed truncating mutations that have been demonstrated to result in truncated protein and there are only two extant families where there are any segregation data of significance between titin variants of any sort and the DCM phenotype. In each case, the variant is not clearly truncating when studied closely. Finally, the spectrum of variation in titin that leads to skeletal muscle involvement is not so systematically described but many DCM subjects (with heterozygous genotypes) have subclinical skeletal muscle involvement when examined rigorously. The suggestion that TTN mutations cause HCM is controversial and should be stated as such. The distinction between N- and C- terminal truncating mutations with regard to DCM is not as discrete and robust as is suggested by the authors, with documentation of cases with N-terminal trucations (i.e. Herman DS et al, NEJM 2012). Also, given the complexities of TTN transcript biology that remain to be fully explored in fish, mice and especially people, the authors' suggestion that it is now possible to definitively classify C-terminal variation in the titin gene is overstated. While this work will undoubtedly contribute to progress, much more needs to be done to reliably inform patient management and counseling.</italic></p><p>We apologize for creating the impression that our work has resulted in newfound certainty in genotype-phenotype correlations. From our experience taking care of many dozens of families with inherited cardiomyopathies, such determinism is never the case. We have moderated language that makes any such suggestion in the revision. We would like to address some of the above comments and concerns:</p><p>1) The presence of ‘controls’ with C-terminal truncations does not eliminate the possibility that these mutations do in fact have cardiac consequences that fall short of overt heart failure, which was the motivation for studying a hyper-normal senior athlete population. Finding C-terminal truncations in the senior athlete population would have cast greater doubt on whether such mutations are sufficient to compromise cardiovascular fitness.</p><p>2) We are encouraged by this report of subclinical skeletal manifestations in DCM TTN patients though we cannot find any published studies that have rigorously documented this.</p><p>3) We have eliminated mention of the HCM association with TTN.</p><p>4) Our work actually does not address if N-terminal truncations – especially in constitutive exons – are deleterious. We analyzed the senior athletes with the hope that we might find N-terminal truncations though small sample size precludes robust conclusions. We do note that in Supplementary Table 12 of Herman et al, the dozen or so families with evidence of segregation in 2 or more members all had C-terminal truncations.</p><p>Please see the following passage in the manuscript: “Our results have two clinical implications for titinopathy patients […] although it is unclear whether there is a restricted developmental window where this might be possible.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;An internal promoter underlies the difference in disease severity between N- and C-terminal truncations of Titin&quot; for further consideration at</italic> eLife<italic>.

While this may be the case, the fact is that sarcomerogenesis itself is disrupted during development in the fish limb of this construct, while humans with the proposed orthologous trait have no demonstrable structural defect in the sarcomere and survive to middle age.

Although we firmly believe that our findings represent a substantial advance in this field, with strong biological and clinical implications, we recognize the challenges of studying adult onset autosomal dominant diseases with incomplete penetrance in any sort of animal model. Even if one can bring about phenotypic distinctions with artificial perturbations or genetic modifiers or use increasingly sensitive phenotyping methods to capture differences, one cannot be sure such stresses or distinctions are in fact relevant to the human disease process. Furthermore, TTN brings about an even greater challenge because of the technical challenge of performing rescue experiments with a 110 kilobase transgene.</p><p>With regard to Reviewer 3’s final comment, we do not understand the statement of how a knockdown of a mutant allele in the setting of a WT alternative (<italic>ttnb</italic>) is of no value in assessing a dominant negative mode of action and instead “emphasize(s) the failure of the zebrafish experiments as described to capture the biology of either human skeletal or cardiac titin disease”. If one accepts that <italic>ttnb</italic> is rescuing the <italic>ttna</italic> null, this is analogous to performing allele specific knockdown of a mutant protein in a heterozygote and looking at phenotypic impact. In the manuscript, we stress: “Loss of function experiments across a number of systems have demonstrated Titin’s importance in diverse aspects of sarcomere development and function, including the ordered assembly of sarcomeric constituents […] Nonetheless, taking all of our results together, we find it a highly plausible explanation that a superimposed deficiency in expression of the <italic>Cronos</italic> protein product would result in the more severe forms of human cardiac disease seen in DCM patients with C-terminal TTN truncations.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
