The budding yeast gametogenesis program, also known as sporulation, provides an ideal model for understanding principles of cell fate progression. In sporulation a diploid cell exits the mitotic program and produces four haploid gametes packaged as spores. Gametogenesis is driven by a specialized cell division called meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marston and Amon, 2004</xref>). After entering meiosis, diploid cells undergo a single round of DNA replication, and then recombination of homologous chromosomes in a long-lasting prophase. Completion of meiotic prophase is followed by two rounds of chromosome segregation as well as development and packaging of meiotic gametes into spores. In the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, meiosis can be induced synchronously, allowing the study of stage-specific regulation of gene expression.</p><p>The yeast meiotic program is dynamically regulated by sequential waves of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Primig et al., 2000</xref>). Two master transcription factors, Ime1 and Ndt80, control gene expression during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kassir et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 1995</xref>). Ime1 regulates the early genes controlling S phase and prophase, whereas Ndt80 induces sets of genes controlling meiotic chromosome segregation and spore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitchell et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chu and Herskowitz, 1998</xref>). These two transcription factors are critical for stage specific gene expression during meiosis.</p><p>Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and alternate mRNA isoforms are expressed throughout yeast meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim Guisbert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lardenois et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, ncRNAs are transcribed from the 3’ end of genes important for meiosis and sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). However, only a limited number of these ncRNAs have been assigned a biological function. For example, in cells with a single mating type locus (<italic>MAT</italic>a or <italic>MAT</italic>α) transcription of ncRNAs represses <italic>IME1</italic> and <italic>IME4</italic>, two regulators of entry in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hongay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Werven et al., 2012</xref>). Throughout meiosis a subset of genes show stage specific expression of mRNA isoforms with often reduced translational capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brar et al., 2012</xref>). However, it is not well understood how ncRNAs and mRNA isoforms contribute to dynamic control of gene expression during yeast meiosis.</p><p>One gene with a dynamic expression pattern during yeast meiosis encodes for the kinetochore subunit Ndc80. Ndc80 is downregulated during meiotic prophase and is rapidly induced during meiotic chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>). In the presence of a spindle, mis-expression of Ndc80 during meiotic prophase causes aberrant meiotic chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the dynamic control of Ndc80 expression is critical for meiotic divisions. How Ndc80 is repressed during the early stages of meiosis remained elusive. In the accompanying paper, we show that the transcription of a 5’ extended <italic>NDC80</italic> <underline>l</underline>ong <underline>u</underline>ndecoded <underline>t</underline>ranscript <underline>i</underline>soform (<italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic>) is responsible for repressing the coding-competent <italic>NDC80</italic> isoform (<italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic>) during meiotic S-phase and prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> cannot be translated into Ndc80 protein due to translation of the upstream open reading frames in this mRNA isoform. Altogether, these results demonstrate that <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> functions in a regulatory manner, in which its transcription is both necessary and sufficient to downregulate <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> levels during meiotic prophase.</p><p>In this work we describe the mechanism by which the 5’ extended <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mRNA isoform represses <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup>. NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> transcription interferes with the downstream <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> promoter by establishing a repressive chromatin state. This repression requires both Set3 and Set2. <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic>-mediated repression can be rapidly reversed to suit the physiological needs of the cell. Furthermore, the repression mechanism described here can be adapted to fine-tune gene expression. Thus, transcription of a 5’ extended mRNA isoform mediates transcriptional interference of the downstream promoter, allowing dynamic control of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcription of a <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA isoform with an extended 5’ leader represses the canonical <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA</title><p>Genome wide transcriptome data indicated that there are at least two different mRNA isoforms expressed from the <italic>NDC80</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim Guisbert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lardenois et al., 2015</xref>). During mitotic growth, an <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA is produced from its core promoter. However, in early meiosis a longer <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA is transcribed from approximately 500 base pairs (bp) upstream of the <italic>NDC80</italic> start codon. To investigate the expression pattern of the <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA isoforms more closely in cells undergoing meiosis, we performed northern blot analyses using a probe that recognizes both the ORF and upstream region of <italic>NDC80</italic>. Cells were first grown in rich medium overnight and then shifted to pre-sporulation medium. After a second overnight growth, cells were transferred to sporulation medium (SPO) and samples were taken at specific intervals throughout meiosis. In wild-type cells entering meiosis, both <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA isoforms were co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel [control]). After 3 hr in SPO, the expression of the short mitotic isoform decreased, whereas the levels of the longer <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA isoform increased. At 5 hr the short <italic>NDC80</italic> form was induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel [control]), which corresponds to cells entering meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). To control for changes in RNA levels, the expression of unrelated RNA polymerase II and III genes, <italic>CIT1</italic> and <italic>SCR1</italic> respectively, was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We observed that <italic>CIT1</italic> levels fluctuated throughout the meiotic time course, while <italic>SCR1</italic> expression was more constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Hence, the expression levels of <italic>NDC80</italic> isoforms were normalized to <italic>SCR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We also measured <italic>NDC80</italic> expression in a strain in which the <italic>IME1</italic> and <italic>IME4</italic> genes were fused to a copper inducible promoter (<italic>pCUP-IME1</italic> and <italic>pCUP-IME4</italic>). The induction of <italic>pCUP-IME1</italic> and <italic>pCUP-IME4</italic> ensures that cells can enter meiosis synchronously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berchowitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chia and van Werven, 2016</xref>). Only the short mitotic isoform was clearly detected in cells arrested before entry into meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel (induced), and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Strikingly, soon after <italic>IME1</italic> and <italic>IME4</italic> were induced at two hours in SPO, expression of the long <italic>NDC80</italic> isoform increased and levels of the mitotic <italic>NDC80</italic> isoform decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel (induced), and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The mitotic <italic>NDC80</italic> isoform was repressed throughout meiotic S-and prophase. Mirroring changes in the levels of the mitotic <italic>NDC80</italic> transcript, Ndc80 protein levels also decreased during entry into meiosis, meiotic S-phase and prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). As expected, expression of the mitotic <italic>NDC80</italic> isoform and Ndc80 protein remained relatively constant when meiosis was not induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle panel (uninduced), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We conclude that during meiotic entry, meiotic S phase and prophase, the expression of a longer <italic>NDC80</italic> form is induced and the mitotic form of <italic>NDC80</italic> is repressed.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27420.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> transcription represses the <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> promoter.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression pattern of two <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA isoforms during starvation and early meiosis.

To further investigate whether the mechanism of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic>-mediated gene repression also shares other features of transcriptional interference, we tested whether <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> transcription alters the association of transcription factors with the <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> promoter. The binding of the basal transcription factor Sua7 (TFIIB), which is homologous to human TFIIB, changed during meiosis across the <italic>NDC80</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Before entry into meiosis, Sua7 was bound to the core promoter of <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic>. However, after <italic>IME1</italic> and <italic>IME4</italic> induction (four hours in SPO) when <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> transcription occurred and cells underwent meiotic S phase, Sua7 binding to the <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> core promoter (around −100 bp from AUG) was reduced while binding to the <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> promoter (around −600 bp from AUG) increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). It is worth noting, that the signal for Sua7 binding also showed a peak at −800 bp, which may be due to fluctuation in expression of the adjacent <italic>PAN6</italic> gene in the divergent direction. Next, we examined Sua7 binding at the <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> promoter in a mutant that does not transcribe <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> (<italic>ndc80<sup>-600-300</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>).

To identify where the nucleosomes stably associate with the <italic>NDC80</italic> locus, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of histone H3 on micrococcal nuclease (MNase) treated chromatin extracts (see material and methods for details) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

First, transcription of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> deposits Set1 mediated H3K4me2 and Set2 mediated H3K36me3 in the <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> promoter. Second, co-transcriptional deposition of these marks facilitates the recruitment of the histone deacetylase complexes Set3C and Rpd3S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carrozza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keogh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim and Buratowski, 2009</xref>). Notably, the two marks localize to the same area of the <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> promoter, perhaps indicating that there is redundancy between the two pathways (see following section in the discussion). Previous work established a role for Set2 in suppressing histone exchange and promoting nucleosome stability through chromatin remodelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Venkatesh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smolle et al., 2012</xref>). Hypo-acetylated histones are also associated with increased nucleosome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Venkatesh and Workman, 2015</xref>). Hence, cells lacking both Set2 and Set3 show reduced nucleosome occupancy in the <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> promoter, and <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> transcription is unimpeded despite active <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

It has been reported that Set2 and Set3 modulate the expression of different genes based on the length of adjacent ncRNAs, which overlap with their promoters. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Kim et al.</italic> demonstrate that during a series of carbon source shifts, genes whose promoters overlap with longer transcripts (~2.0 kb) are repressed by Set2/Rpd3S whereas those with shorter overlapping transcripts (~0.9 kb), are repressed by Set1/Set3C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). According to their classification, <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> is a short overlapping transcript. Strikingly, <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mediated repression of <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> was compromised in the <italic>set2∆set3∆</italic> double mutant cells, but not in the single mutants. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We propose that Set1/Set3C and Set2/Rpd3S act redundantly during <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mediated repression of <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic>.</p><p>The mechanism that we have described here has clear similarities with transcriptional interference mediated by intergenic or promoter transcription. Like <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic>, transcription of the intergenic/promoter ncRNA, <italic>SRG1</italic>, leads to increased nucleosome occupancy and lower binding of activators in the downstream <italic>SER3</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martens et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hainer et al., 2011</xref>). Transcriptional interference is also important for mating-type control of sporulation. In cells with a single mating type, transcription of a long noncoding RNA <italic>IRT1</italic>, in the promoter of the master regulatory transcription factor Ime1, is critical for <italic>IME1</italic> repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Werven et al., 2012</xref>). Similar to <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic>, <italic>IRT1</italic> transcription establishes repressive chromatin throughout the <italic>IME1</italic> promoter via a mechanism requiring both Set2 and Set3. Interestingly, while Set1 and Set2 act on different parts of the <italic>IME1</italic> promoter, the H3K4me2 and H3K36me3 marks overlap in the <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> promoter suggesting that both modifications control the same promoter region. Perhaps, H3K4me2 and H3K36me3 occur on the same nucleosome as part of a repressive combinatorial histone code.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mediated repression of <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> is dynamic</title><p>Our synchronous meiosis and return to growth experiments have shed light on the dynamics of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mediated repression of <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic>. During meiotic prophase Ndc80 levels decline, but as soon as cells enter meiotic divisions, Ndc80 levels increase. <italic>Chen et al.</italic> showed that the transcription factor Ndt80 activates the meiotic wave of <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Expression of Ndt80 can bypass <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> induced repression suggesting that repression is not refractory to increasing levels of <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This ensures that <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> can be rapidly produced after meiotic prophase, when Ndc80 becomes essential for proper meiotic divisions. Interestingly, the MSE site (approximately −200 bp upstream from the AUG) in the <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> promoter is not protected by nucleosomes even during <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which may explain the ability of Ndt80 to activate <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> even while <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> is expressed.</p><p>The dynamic nature of the regulation is also illustrated by our finding that <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mediated repression can be rapidly reversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We propose that the reversibility of the repression may provide two main benefits. First, it allows for temporal control of <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> expression during meiosis as <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mediated repression of <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> specifically occurs during meiotic S-phase and meiotic prophase. Cells that progressed into meiotic divisions were able to bypass <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mediated repression and re-expressed <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Second, rapid adjustments to <italic>NDC80</italic> expression in response to changing environmental cues can be directly integrated at the <italic>NDC80</italic> promoter. When we exposed cells arrested in meiotic prophase to a nutrient rich environment and allowed cells to re-enter the mitotic cell cycle, <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> expression was lost and <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> was rapidly induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The mechanism for the reversibility of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mediated repression is not fully understood. We speculate that transcriptional activators and chromatin remodelers stimulate nucleosome eviction in the <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> promoter during its activation. In line with this idea, levels of the repressive H3K36me3 in the <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> promoter are rapidly lost when the repression is reversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This is despite the purported stability of the H3K36me3 mark due to its role in reducing histone turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smolle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Venkatesh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sein et al., 2015</xref>). More work is needed to fully characterize the molecular mechanism of reversing <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mediated repression.</p><p>In addition to its reversibility, <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic>-mediated repression can be adapted to fine-tune gene expression. Using a scalable expression system, we showed that modulating the levels of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> affects the efficiency of <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The higher the levels of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> transcription, the better the repression of <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> becomes. Notably, Set2 and Set3 are no longer required for repressing <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> when <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> is highly expressed. One possible explanation is that the rate of nucleosome deposition at the <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> promoter is increased during higher levels of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> transcription. In this situation, the requirement for histone deacetylase complexes to stabilize nucleosomes becomes obsolete. Alternatively, elongating RNA polymerase might physically interfere with the <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> promoter when <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> is highly expressed.</p><p>Whereas most studies have reported a binary switch for transcription interference mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martens et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hongay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Camblong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bumgarner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Werven et al., 2012</xref>), we propose that transcriptional interference by expression of a 5’ extended transcript is tunable. This principle could be further adapted and used in synthetic genetic circuits to modulate gene expression levels. Indeed, mechanisms of transcriptional interference have been applied to coordinate activities of adjacent genes in both <italic>E. coli</italic> and budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buetti-Dinh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bordoy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoffmann et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Transcriptional interference by 5’ extended isoforms might be wide-spread in yeast and across species.

Approximately 250 OD<sub>600</sub> units of cells were crosslinked for 15 min with formaldehyde (1% v/v) and the reaction was quenched with glycine (125 mM). Subsequently, cells were resuspended in 20 ml of buffer Z (1 M sorbitol, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4) plus β-mercaptoethanol (10 mM) and treated with 250 μg of T100 Zymolase (MP Biomedicals (CA, USA)) for 60 min. Next, cells were resuspended in 2.5 ml NP buffer (0.5 mM spermidine, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (β -ME), 0.075% (w/v) Tergitol solution-type NP-40 detergent (NP-40), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>), and extract was treated with 5, 0.625, 0.2 or 0.04 μl of MNase (2 mg/ml, NEB) for 30 min at 37°C, the reaction was quenched with EDTA (10 mM). The extract was adjusted to 0.1 M HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% w/v sodium deoxycholate, and 1% w/v Triton X-100. To check for the extent of MNase digestion, 60 μl of MNase treated and untreated extracts were reverse crosslinked overnight in SDS-TE (1% (w/v) SDS, 10 mM Tris pH 8, 1 mM EDTA), treated with RNase A and purified DNA fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis. The extracts which the showed a mono-nucleosome pattern were used for ChIP with histone H3 antibodies. The ChIP was performed with 600 μl of extract as described in the chromatin immunoprecipitation section of the Materials and methods. ChIP samples were quantified by qPCR on a 7500 FAST Real-Time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems (CA, USA)). Scanning primer pairs covering the <italic>NDC80</italic> locus and upstream region were used for the analysis. Signals were quantified relative to untreated genomic DNA, and normalized over a primer pair directed against the <italic>PHO5</italic> core promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang and Vancura, 2012</xref>).

In short, RNA was extracted with Acid Phenol:chloroform:IAA (125:24:1) and precipitated in ethanol with 0.3M sodium acetate. RNA samples were denatured in a glyoxal/DMSO mix (1M deionized glyoxal, 50% v/v DMSO, 10 mM sodium phosphate (NaPi) buffer pH 6.5–6.8) at 70°C for 10 min. Denatured samples were mixed with loading buffer (10% v/v glycerol, 2 mM NaPi buffer pH 6.5–6.8, 0.4% w/v bromophenol blue) and separated on an agarose gel (1.1% w/v agarose, 0.01M NaPi buffer) for at least 3 hr at 80 V. RNAs were then transferred onto nylon membranes overnight by capillary transfer. rRNA bands were visualized by methylene blue staining. The membranes were blocked for at least 3 hr at 42°C in ULTRAhyb Ultrasensitive Hybridization Buffer (Thermo Fisher) before hybridization. The radioactive probes specific to <italic>NDC80, SCR1</italic> and <italic>CIT1</italic> were synthesized using a Prime-It II Random Primer Labeling Kit (Agilent (CA, USA)), a DNA template and ATP (α−32P) (Perkin-Elmer (MA, USA)).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. As you will see from the comments below, there was enthusiasm for this manuscript as a companion to the co-submitted manuscript from Chen et al. However, there were also several important weaknesses that need to be addressed before the paper can be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. We realize that we are requesting a substantial amount of work to strengthen the experiments and their conclusions, but given that your manuscript is a co-submission, we considered that it was fairer to give you the opportunity to revise the paper rather than to reject it and keep the door open to a resubmission at a later date.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors provide mechanistic insight into how an mRNA that initiates ~500bp upstream of the <italic>NDC80</italic> gene represses transcription from the NDC80ORF promoter. In the accompanying manuscript, basic features of the <italic>NDC80</italic> regulatory system were described, including demonstration that the long mRNA, termed NDC80luti, and the ORF mRNA appear anti-correlated and that blocking transcription from the NDC80luti promoter derepresses the ORF transcript. In this manuscript, the authors find support for a transcriptional interference mechanism in which transcription from the upstream start inhibits PIC assembly at the ORF promoter and establishes a histone modification pattern at the ORF promoter (enrichment of H3K4me2 and H3K36me3) that has been previously associated with recruitment of two well characterized yeast HDACs, Set3C and Rpd3S. The authors extend their work by showing that the <italic>NDC80</italic> regulatory system is reversible, when cells are switched from sporulation to growth media, and tunable, when the levels of the NDC80luti transcript are systematically elevated through a lexA-ER system.</p><p>Demonstration of the molecular basis of the repression mechanism is a valuable complement to the accompanying paper by Chen et al. However, as the authors acknowledge, involvement of cis-repression of a promoter by an overlapping non-coding transcript via transcription-coupled histone methylation and establishment of repressive chromatin is not a novel mechanism, being established at several other genes in yeast. In addition to the examples for this cited by the authors, there is the case of the upstream ncRNA that represses SER3 by promoting nucleosome assembly over the SER3 promoter, and antisense transcripts that mediate histone methylation of the promoter for the sense transcript at FLO11. Other studies, including recent work from the Buratowski lab on a genome-wide scale, showed that noncoding transcription across promoters leads to enrichment of H3K4me2 and H3K36me3 and repression of the promoters. With that said, the study does provide insight into an interesting example of regulated transcriptional interference.</p><p>In addition to the need for a more thorough coverage of relevant precedents for similar examples of gene regulation (see above), there are some important control experiments lacking, notably a failure to measure by ChIP the total H3 levels in the <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> promoter – to distinguish nucleosomes from non-histone chromatin protein occupancy, and to normalize changes in methylation for changes in H3 occupancy – and lack of quantification of changes in the <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> transcript, which is required to firmly establish the role of Set2/Set3 in repressing this promoter. In addition, there are a number of instances where direct experimental evidence is insufficient to support mechanistic claims made; these instances need to be remedied by inclusion of more data or by significant rewriting of text to soften conclusions and make them more nuanced. Statistical analysis of replicate data is missing for measurements of mRNA levels by northern analysis. Loading and normalization controls are lacking in multiple figures.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p>1) The increase in MNase-resistance in the <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> promoter region is not necessarily due to nucleosomes as it has been shown that non-histone protein binding in NDRs can also confer MNase-resistance (PMID: 28157509). For this reason, a ChIP of the MNase-resistant chromatin with histone antibodies is required to establish nucleosome versus non-histone protein occupancy.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> changes in nucleosome occupancy are inferred upon repression of the downstream promoter (at -100), but there is no evidence for loss of nucleosomes accompanying activation of the upstream promoter. Is this because the upstream promoter is nucleosome free even when repressed or is there another explanation?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Some information on the sequences of the promoters should be presented. Does the Sua7 occupancy profile make sense with respect to positions of core promoter elements?

As presented, the data are insufficient to support the stated conclusions. First, additional factors should be assayed by ChIP, beyond Sua7. In particular, how does <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> expression influence Ndt80 occupancy in the <italic>NDC80</italic> promoter region? Second, what is the effect of blocking <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> transcription on Sua7 and Ndt80 occupancy? What is the effect of blocking <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> on nucleosome occupancy? Note: the additional ChIP experiments suggested in this point are encouraged, but are not considered essential for publication.

The authors use set2∆ as a proxy for removing Rpd3S. The HDAC could be directly tested by performing similar northern and western blots with an rco1∆ strain. The authors argue that loss of the two HDAC systems alleviates transcriptional interference. This could be tested by ChIP of Sua7 in the HDAC mutant strains. Surprisingly, the authors show effects of deleting SET2 and SET3 on nucleosome occupancy but not histone acetylation levels at the ORF promoter. Their model should be tested more directly with better choices of mutants and ChIPs. Note: the additional ChIP experiments suggested in this point are encouraged, but are not considered essential for publication. However, if the authors choose not to strengthen this part of the study, they need to substantially modulate the strength of their statements in the text to be in line with what the data actually demonstrate. For example, without directly testing recruitment of HDACs, which can be tricky to do, they cannot say that their data show recruitment of HDACs via H3K36me3 and H3K4me2. They can merely describe this as a likely scenario. However, they could provide more support for this model by measuring histone acetylation levels, which is not hard to do.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> essentially recapitulates the same or similar experiments described in the accompanying paper by Chen et al., with somewhat different promoter replacements or termination insertions for the <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> transcript.

One explanation is that time course experiments have inherent variability with regards to meiotic kinetics between biological replicates. This makes it tricky to take the average of multiple experiments, because the variation in mRNA level is due to both the biological variation as well as the variation in meiotic synchrony.
