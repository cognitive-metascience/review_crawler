domain and is required for normal intercellular trafficking. Although loss-of-function <italic>atfh2</italic> mutants have no overt developmental defect, PD’s permeability and sensitivity to virus infection are increased in <italic>atfh2</italic> plants. Interestingly, AtFH2 functions in a partially redundant manner with its closest homolog AtFH1, which also contains a PD localization signal. Strikingly, targeting of Class I formins to PD was also confirmed in rice, suggesting that the involvement of Class I formins in regulating actin dynamics at PD may be evolutionarily conserved in plants. In vitro biochemical analysis showed that AtFH2 fails to nucleate actin assembly but caps and stabilizes actin filaments. We also demonstrate that the interaction between AtFH2 and actin filaments is crucial for its function in vivo. These data allow us to propose that AtFH2 regulates PD's permeability by anchoring actin filaments to PD.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36316.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plant cells communicate with each other via narrow channels embedded across adjacent cell walls. These channels, called plasmodesmata, allow molecules to pass between cells, thereby enabling plants to grow normally and develop tissues and organs. But plasmodesmata also serve as passageways that viruses can exploit to infect more and more cells. Given these pros and cons, plants must regulate how permeable their plasmodesmata are so they can transport necessary materials cell-to-cell while still defending against the spread of infection.</p><p>Each cell within plants, animals, and fungi, contains a protein skeleton that helps to stabilize it. A threadlike fiber called actin filament, one of the key components that makes up the cell’s skeleton, presumably extends out to the plasmodesmata, which lie across the cell’s external wall. Previous research has shown that actin helps regulate cell-to-cell traffic through the plasmodesmata and that drug treatments involving actin disturb normal traffic. But techniques to visualize actin at the plasmodesmata are lacking, and both how plants control their plasmodesmata and actin’s involvement remain unclear.</p><p>Diao et al. used a confocal microscope, fluorescent tags, and staining procedures in experiments that analyzed how plasmodesmata and actin interact within a small flowering plant called thale cress. These experiments showed that a protein known to regulate actin, called Formin 2, positions itself at the plasmodesmata where it caps off actin threads and anchors them to the channels. Diao et al. also generated thale cress that cannot produce Formin 2. These mutant plants had more permeable plasmodesmata and were more susceptible to a virus.</p><p>By stably tethering actin to the plasmodesmata, Formin 2 plays a key part in regulating the permeability of these cell-to-cell channels, with unstable actin threads resulting in more penetrable plasmodesmata. These findings provide further evidence that plants rely on actin to regulate plasmodesmata, and they establish that Formin 2 is involved. Further research will clarify how actin and Formin 2 work together to adjust the structure of plasmodesmata channels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>plasmodesmata</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>formin</kwd><kwd>intercellular trafficking</kwd><kwd>size exclusion limit of PD</kwd><kwd>cucumber mosaic virus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31471266; 31671390</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Shanjin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31121065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yule</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cytological and biochemical analyses reveal <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> formin 2 is involved in regulating PD permeability by anchoring actin filaments to PD and stabilizing them through actin filament barbed end capping activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plasmodesmata (PD) function as the intercellular channels in plants and are important for the growth and development of plants, as well as during their interaction with the surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheval and Faulkner, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lucas and Lee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maule, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maule et al., 2011</xref>). The density and size of PD are developmentally controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu and Jackson, 2010</xref>), which allows the formation of spatial symplastic domains in order to establish tissue-specific developmental programs. The permeability of PD must be precisely regulated at specific times during plant growth and development. However, the mechanisms that tightly regulate the permeability of PD are largely unknown.</p><p>The actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in intercellular communication via PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaziz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pitzalis and Heinlein, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">White and Barton, 2011</xref>). In support of this notion, actin and some actin-associated proteins were demonstrated to localize to PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deeks et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Faulkner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Radford and White, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Van Gestel et al., 2003</xref>). However, due to technical problems, the existence of filamentous actin in PD remains controversial, as does the nature of its organization. This has been a barrier to our understanding of the function of the actin cytoskeleton in the regulation of cell-to-cell trafficking via PD. In addition, to date, most of the data regarding the function of actin at PD have been obtained from experiments using actin-based pharmacological treatments, which showed that destabilization of actin filaments increases the permeability of PD, whereas stabilization of actin filaments decreases it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Su et al., 2010</xref>). Given that these actin drugs non-selectively target the actin cytoskeleton within cells, it is hard to assess whether and to what extent the changes in PD permeability depend on the alteration in PD actin dynamics. In view of this point, specific manipulation of the actin dynamics at PD via genetic means is an ideal approach, although it requires the identification of PD-localized actin or actin-associated proteins that can serve as the target for the genetic manipulation. Nevertheless, previous observations suggest that the presence and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are indeed vital for intercellular trafficking via PD. For example, an interesting study showed that <italic>Cucumber mosaic virus</italic> (CMV) Movement Protein (MP) behaves like an actin-binding protein (ABP) that severs and caps actin filaments in vitro and its filament severing activity is required for its function in increasing the size exclusion limit (SEL) of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Su et al., 2010</xref>). The authors therefore argued that actin filaments at PD function as a filter to control the permeability of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). The study of Chen et al. also suggests that some endogenous ABPs may be involved in regulating actin dynamics at PD and consequently in controlling the permeability of PD.</p><p>Formin (formin homology protein) is one type of actin nucleation factor that has been implicated in the generation of linear actin bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchoin and Staiger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chesarone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kovar, 2006</xref>). The formin proteins are characterized by the presence of formin homology domain1 (FH1) and FH2, which are capable of nucleating actin assembly from actin or actin-profilin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchoin and Staiger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chesarone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kovar, 2006</xref>). There are numerous formin genes in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchoin and Staiger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cvrcková et al., 2004</xref>). For instance, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome contains 21 formin genes that are divided into two classes: 11 members in Class I, which encode proteins that contain the characteristic transmembrane (TM) domain except <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> formin 7; and 10 members in Class II, which encode proteins without a TM domain but carry an N-terminal phosphatase and tensin-related (PTEN)-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchoin and Staiger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deeks et al., 2002</xref>). The Formin proteins have been implicated in numerous actin-based cellular processes in plants, such as polarized pollen tube growth and root hair growth, cell division, cytokinesis and cell morphogenesis, and plant defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Favery et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ingouff et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ye et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). However, it remains largely unexplored how different formin proteins evolve and adapt to various actin-based cellular functions in plants.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that AtFH2, along with several Class I formins, localizes to PD and is involved in the regulation of cell-to-cell trafficking via PD. The PD-localization pattern of AtFH2 is determined by its TM domain. Interestingly, we found that several rice Class I formins also target to PD, suggesting that the involvement of Class I formins in regulating actin dynamics at PD may be evolutionarily conserved in plants. We showed that AtFH2 caps and stabilizes actin filaments in vitro, which allows us to propose that AtFH2 regulates actin dynamics and cell-to-cell trafficking by anchoring and stabilizing actin filaments at PD. Loss of function of <italic>AtFH2</italic> increases PD permeability, which supports the notion that the stability and/or the amount of actin filaments at PD is crucial for their role in regulating intercellular trafficking. Our study thus adds formin as an important component of the actin-mediated machinery that regulates PD permeability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of function of <italic>AtFH2</italic> does not cause overt developmental defects in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title><p>To determine the physiological functions of <italic>AtFH2</italic> (At2g43800), two T-DNA insertion mutants of <italic>AtFH2</italic> were obtained and analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). They were shown to be knockout alleles since the full-length <italic>AtFH2</italic> transcript is absent in both <italic>atfh2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). However, no overt developmental defects were observed in young seedlings and mature plants of <italic>atfh2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This might be due to functional redundancy among <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> formin genes. However, considering that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> formin genes exhibit distinct tissue expression patterns and their encoded proteins are quite diverged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cvrcková et al., 2004</xref>), they likely perform some distinct and specialized functions that cannot be uncovered by simply examining the morphology of seedlings and adult plants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>AtFH2 localizes to PD in a manner that depends on its TM domain-containing N-terminus</title><p>Determination of the intracellular localization of AtFH2 may provide hints regarding whether AtFH2 performs specialized cellular functions. We therefore generated an eGFP fusion construct of <italic>AtFH2</italic> driven by its own promoter (<italic>AtFH2p:AtFH2-eGFP</italic>) and demonstrated that it is fully functional (see below), which suggests that AtFH2-eGFP will faithfully indicate the intracellular localization of AtFH2. Initial observations revealed that AtFH2-eGFP decorates dot-like structures along the borders of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Given that AtFH2 contains a TM domain, we speculated that the AtFH2-decorated dot-like structures may be located on the plasma membrane. In partial support of this speculation, the AtFH2-eGFP-decorated structures overlap with the staining of propidium iodide (PI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), a nucleic acid binding dye that cannot cross the membrane of living cells and consequently stays outside the membrane, thus revealing the contours of cells. Interestingly, the AtFH2-eGFP-positive dot-like structures are reminiscent of PD. To demonstrate this, we performed callose staining, which has been used previously to detect PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell and Oparka, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Currier, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fitzgibbon et al., 2010</xref>). We found that the AtFH2-eGFP-decorated structures overlap with dot-like structures revealed by callose staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This result was extended by showing that AtFH2 colocalized with two PD markers, PDLP1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>]) and YFP-PDCB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simpson et al., 2009</xref>]).

We speculated that the PD localization pattern of AtFH2 might be solely determined by its TM domain, which is located near the N-terminus. To quickly test this hypothesis, we adopted the strategy of exogenous expression in tobacco leaves. The feasibility of using this strategy was demonstrated by showing that full-length AtFH2 targets to PD in tobacco leaf epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We generated several fusion constructs in which eGFP was fused with truncated fragments of AtFH2, starting from the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We subsequently demonstrated that eGFP fusion proteins of truncated AtFH2 localize to PD as long as they contain the TM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>). The eGFP fusion protein without the TM domain failed to target to PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Thus, the data suggest that PD-localization of AtFH2 is determined by its TM domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The size exclusion limit (SEL) of PD is increased in <italic>atfh2</italic></title><p>To determine whether cell-to-cell trafficking was altered in <italic>atfh2</italic>, we performed an eGFP diffusion assay as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liarzi and Epel, 2005</xref>). Leaf epidermal cells were transformed by DNA bombardment with an eGFP-expressing construct. After bombardment by plasmids expressing non-mobile HDEL-mCherry along with plasmids expressing eGFP, the HDEL-mCherry signal mainly appeared in one cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which suggests that the eGFP signal outside this cell results from diffusion rather than local expression. The efficiency of eGFP diffusion from bombarded cells into surrounding epidermal layers was assessed by counting the number of cell layers with a diffuse eGFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our results showed that eGFP diffusion across cells is significantly higher in <italic>atfh2</italic> than in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The eGFP diffusion phenotype in <italic>atfh2</italic> is rescued by transforming <italic>AtFH2p:AtFH2-eGFP</italic> into <italic>atfh2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that increased eGFP diffusion is indeed caused by loss of function of <italic>AtFH2</italic>. Consistent with this notion, the number of eGFP-expressing cells within a diffusion cluster is significantly higher in <italic>atfh2</italic> mutant plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We found that loss of function of <italic>AtFH2</italic> does not affect cytoplasmic streaming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), which suggests that loss of function of <italic>AtFH2</italic> specifically alters cell-to-cell trafficking. However, we found that overexpression of <italic>AtFH2</italic> does not affect the overall organization of actin filaments or cell-to-cell trafficking in leaf epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Next, we asked whether loss of function of <italic>AtFH2</italic> also affects specific movement of macromolecules across cells by examining the cell-to-cell movement of an eGFP fusion of the <italic>Cucumber mosaic virus</italic> (CMV) protein MP (MP-eGFP). We found that the cell-to-cell movement of MP-eGFP is also increased in <italic>atfh2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This finding also motivated us to speculate that <italic>atfh2</italic> plants might become more sensitive to virus infection. To test this speculation, we challenged <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants with CMV strain Fny (Fny-CMV), which is known to infect <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2014</xref>). We found that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves became curved and distorted after inoculation with Fny-CMV when compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). The growth of leaves was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C,D</xref>) and the proportion of symptomatic plants increased in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4E</xref>). Infection with Fny-CMV was confirmed by measurements showing that the amount of CMV <italic>MP</italic> RNA increases in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4F</xref>). We next challenged <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants with Fny-CMV and found that the symptoms of infection were more severe in <italic>atfh2</italic> plants than in WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). This was quantified by the time-dependent increase in the relative proportion of symptomatic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) and by the relative accumulation of CMV <italic>MP</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) in <italic>atfh2</italic> mutants. In addition, the growth of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves was inhibited more severely in <italic>atfh2</italic> compared to WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J,K</xref>).

Given that AtFH1 and AtFH2 belong to the same subclass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we generated <italic>atfh1 atfh2</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) to examine whether they redundantly regulate cell-to-cell trafficking via PD. We did not detect overt developmental phenotypes in <italic>atfh1 atfh2</italic> mutants compared to WT, <italic>atfh1</italic> and <italic>atfh2</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, we found that <italic>atfh1 atfh2</italic> mutants have stronger cell-to-cell trafficking phenotypes than <italic>atfh1</italic> and <italic>atfh2</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This suggests that AtFH1 and AtFH2 indeed act redundantly in regulating cell-to-cell trafficking via PD. Given that the accumulation of callose was shown to be involved in the regulation of PD permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui and Lee, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simpson et al., 2009</xref>), we wondered whether loss of function of <italic>AtFH1</italic> and/or <italic>AtFH2</italic> might alter the actin dynamics at PD and consequently affect the accumulation of callose at PD. We therefore performed callose staining with aniline blue and found that the amount of callose accumulated at PD in <italic>atfh1</italic>, <italic>atfh2</italic> and <italic>atfh1 atfh2</italic> mutants was not overtly different to that in WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that the alteration in cell-to-cell trafficking in <italic>atfh1</italic>, <italic>atfh2</italic> and <italic>atfh1 atfh2</italic> mutants is not due to an alteration in the accumulation of callose at PD.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36316.030</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Determination of the intracellular localization of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Class I formins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic analysis of Class I <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> formins.

It was reported that substitution of Ile1431 with alanine (A) or of Lys1601 with aspartic acid (D) within the FH2 domain of the yeast formin Bni1p completely abolished the actin binding activity of its FH2 domain since it fails to form dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore mutated the corresponding residues in AtFH2 in order to inhibit its dimer formation and disrupt its interaction with actin filaments. We found that two residues, Ile519 and Lys672, in AtFH2 correspond to the conserved Ile1431 and Lys1601 in Bni1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We initially replaced Ile519 with A and Lys672 with D in AtFH2-FH2 and generated the recombinant AtFH2-FH2<sup>I519A,K672D</sup> protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; named as AtFH2-FH2M hereafter).

In contrast to AtFH2-FH2, which is mainly in the dimeric form, AtFH2-FH2M is mainly in the monomeric form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). These data together suggest that AtFH2-FH2M fails to dimerize and interact with actin filaments.

Given that AtFH2 is a simple actin filament barbed end capper that stabilizes actin filaments in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), we propose that AtFH2 acts as an anchor that tethers actin filaments to the membrane at PD and stabilizes the filaments through its barbed end capping activity.

These data together allow us to conclude that the stability and/or the amount of actin filaments is crucial for their role in regulating the permeability of PD. Our study thus significantly enhances our understanding of actin-mediated regulation of intercellular trafficking via PD in plants.</p><p>Decades of studies have confirmed the presence of the actin cytoskeletal system at PD and demonstrated its involvement in the regulation of PD-mediated intercellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernandez-Calvino et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Su et al., 2010</xref>), but the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Studies in this area have progressed slowly for at least two reasons. First, we still lack approaches to specifically visualize actin at PD since they are small and buried deeply in the cell wall. Consequently, the existence of filamentous forms of actin at PD remains controversial. Second, we still lack approaches to specifically perturb actin dynamics at PD. Identification of the native components of the actin cytoskeletal system that specifically localize to PD may provide targets for the genetic manipulation of the actin cytoskeleton in this region, which will enhance our understanding of how actin at PD regulates cell-to-cell trafficking.</p><p>Identification of the localization of AtFH2 to PD and demonstration of its involvement in PD permeability open a window for us to dissect the status, organization and functions of actin at PD. Several lines of evidence show that loss of function of <italic>AtFH2</italic> increases the SEL of PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Although we cannot directly visualize the organization of actin at PD in WT or <italic>atfh2</italic> plants, we speculate that the amount of F-actin is reduced at PD in <italic>atfh2</italic> plants since AtFH2 caps and stabilizes actin filaments even though it lacks the characteristic actin nucleation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Our data allow us to propose that PD-localized AtFH2 recruits actin filaments to PD by capping the barbed end of actin filaments and stabilizing them, which consequently regulates cell-to-cell trafficking. Given that AtFH2 is a simple actin barbed end capper that stabilizes actin filaments in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) and loss of function of <italic>AtFH2</italic> increases the permeability of PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), it is likely that there are fewer actin filaments at PD in <italic>atfh2</italic> mutants, so that intercellular trafficking is upregulated. Our results, along with previous data from actin-based pharmacological treatments showing that destabilization of actin filaments increases SEL of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Su et al., 2010</xref>), suggest that actin filaments at PD may act as the physical barrier to regulate its permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). To gain further insights into the function of actin filaments in the regulation of the permeability of PD, it will be necessary in the future to determine where AtFH2-tethered actin filaments localize along the transport path of PD. The reconstructed three-dimensional ultrastructure of post-cytokinesis plasmodesmata using electron tomography showed that the gap between the plasma membrane (PM) and the ER (called the cytoplasmic sleeve) within plasmodesmata pores is less than 10 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicolas et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that there is unlikely to be enough space to fit more actin filaments within the cytoplasmic sleeve of PD. The authors also discovered a second PD morphotype (type I) that lacks a visible cytoplasmic sleeve but is capable of non-targeted movement of macromolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicolas et al., 2017</xref>), which urges us to rethink the relationship between the size of the cytoplasmic sleeve and the permeability. Nonetheless, these findings suggest that the contact between ER and PM is very dynamic. In this regard, AtFH2-tethered actin filaments might be involved in the regulation of the dynamic connection between ER and PM, and may consequently modulate the permeability of PD, although the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown at the moment. Certainly, it might also be possible that AtFH2-tethered actin filaments localize at the neck region of PD to regulate cell-to-cell transportation. Again, it remains to be established how AtFH2-tethered actin filaments at the neck of PD act as a barrier in cell-to-cell trafficking.</p><p>It is intriguing that loss of function of both <italic>AtFH1</italic> and <italic>AtFH2</italic> does not have an overt effect on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> growth and development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H,I</xref>), even though it significantly increases the permeability of PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). The biological significance of formin-mediated regulation of PD permeability is supported by the finding that loss of function of <italic>AtFH1</italic> and/or <italic>AtFH2</italic> increases the sensitivity of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants to infection by Fny-CMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–I</xref>). This suggests that the processes involved in normal plant development may be less sensitive to changes in formin-mediated regulation of PD permeability than the processes involved in coping with biotic stress. Given that AtFH2 is a simple actin barbed end capper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), it is still an outstanding question how the barbed end capping activity of AtFH2 is tightly regulated in response to developmental and environmental cues in order to fine-tune the permeability of PD.</p><p>Surprisingly, and unlike previously characterized formins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchoin and Staiger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chesarone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goode and Eck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kovar, 2006</xref>), AtFH2 lacks actin nucleation activity in the presence or absence of profilin but retains the actin filament barbed end capping activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The crystal structure of the FH2 domain derived from yeast Bni1p showed that it forms a stable yet flexible dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). The later co-crystal of Bni1p FH2 in complex with actin demonstrates the flexibility of the FH2 dimer, which permits the addition of actin monomers onto the barbed end of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otomo et al., 2005</xref>). Based on the structural and biochemical data, it was proposed that the FH2 dimer exists in a dynamic equilibrium between a ‘closed’ and an ‘open’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kovar, 2006</xref>). It is possible that FH2 dimers in AtFH2 might be less flexible, and are able to cap the barbed end of actin filaments but cannot facilitate the further addition of actin or actin-profilin complexes. In the future, careful examination of the molecular details underlying the unique activity of AtFH2 may provide insights into the mechanism of action of formin in regulating actin nucleation and elongation. Nonetheless, based on the unique biochemical properties of AtFH2, we propose that it serves well as an anchor for tethering actin filaments at the membrane of PD by capping the barbed end of actin filaments. Since AtFH2 presumably only interacts with filamentous actin through its barbed end capping activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), and the interaction of AtFH2 with actin filaments was demonstrated to be crucial for its in vivo functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>), this study to some extent provides another piece of evidence supporting the presence of filamentous actin at PD.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that AtFH1, the closest homolog of AtFH2, is also able to target to PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and functions redundantly with AtFH2 in the regulation of intercellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Biochemically, their functional redundancy is likely due to the fact that both have capping activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Michelot et al., 2005</xref>]). Considering that AtFH1 is a non-processive actin nucleation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Michelot et al., 2006</xref>), AtFH1 and AtFH2 might coordinately regulate actin dynamics at PD, with AtFH1 promoting actin polymerization to generate more actin filaments around PD, and AtFH2 subsequently taking over the binding to the barbed end of actin filaments after the dissociation of AtFH1. We cannot completely rule out the possibility that AtFH2 might have actin nucleation activity when bound to other proteins and/or after post-translational modification in vivo. More work needs to be undertaken to examine these possibilities in the future. Nonetheless, our findings provide insights into the functional specification of members of the formin protein family and the functional adaptation of the actin cytoskeletal system in plants in general.</p><p>Our results showed that the localization of AtFH2 is determined by its TM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which suggests that the TM domain of AtFH2 has evolved to allow it to adapt to regulate actin dynamics at PD. Given that the membrane of PD has a unique phospholipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grison et al., 2015</xref>), the TM domains of AtFH1 and AtFH2 may bind preferentially to certain phospholipid(s) when compared to other Class I formins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Strikingly, we showed that several rice Class I formins localize to PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>), suggesting that the involvement of Class I formins in regulating actin dynamics at PD might be evolutionarily conserved in plants.</p><p>In summary, we found that AtFH2 localizes to PD and functions redundantly with AtFH1 to regulate cell-to-cell trafficking in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Based on the in vitro biochemical data that AtFH2 caps and stabilizes actin filaments, we propose that AtFH2 regulates cell-to-cell trafficking by tethering actin filaments to the membrane at PD and stabilizing them through its barbed end capping activity.

In brief, the transient expression of eGFP or CMV MP-eGFP was achieved by a biolistic DNA delivery system in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves. Bombardment of leaves with plasmid DNA was performed basically as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liarzi and Epel (2005)</xref> with slight modifications. Briefly, approximately 2 μg of plasmid DNA were mixed with 0.5 mg gold particles (diameter, 1 μm, Bio-Rad) in the presence of 20 μL of fresh N-[3-aminopropyl]−1,4-butanediamine (spermidine) (0.1 M) and 50 μL of CaCl<sub>2</sub> (2.5 M) before vortexing uninterruptedly for 3 min. The mixture was centrifuged for 10 s before precipitating for 5 min. The pellet was subsequently washed with 70% ethanol and absolute ethanol, and finally resuspended in 15 μL absolute ethanol. Rosette leaves from 3-week-old <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants which had not yet bolted were placed in a petri dish containing 20 mL of MS medium with 0.8% agar before bombardment. The target leaf was placed at a distance of 12 cm from the gene gun. The leaves were incubated for 24 hr or 48 hr at 23°C in the dark. To quantify the number of layers of cells into which eGFP diffused, images of eGFP in the lower epidermis cells were captured by a Zeiss LSM 510 META at 24 hr and 48 hr. Statistical analysis was performed as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levy et al. (2007)</xref>. The cell that was transformed by DNA bombardment was defined as layer 0, and the cells that share a common cell wall with layer 0 were defined as layer 1. Cells that share a common cell wall with layer 1 cells, but not with layer 0 cells, were defined as layer 2 cells. Cells that expressed GFP but showed no diffusion were not counted to avoid the situation in which damage was caused by the bombardment. To indicate the bombarded cell, <italic>pdGN-35S:HDEL-mCherry</italic> plasmid was used for bombardment along with the <italic>pdGN</italic> plasmid expressing eGFP. Both <italic>pdGN</italic> and <italic>pdGN-35S:HDEL-mCherry</italic> plasmids at 2 μg were mixed with 1 μm gold particles (Bio-Rad) for the bombardment.

Your article has been reviewed Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript presents the finding that several <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Class I formins localise to plasmodesmata. Focusing on AtFH2 (targeted to plasmodesmata by its transmembrane domain) the authors find that it does not nucleate actin filaments but rather caps and stabilises actin filaments. AtFH1 is a known nucleator of actin filaments but also localises to plasmodesmata. Both AtFH2 and AtFH1 play a role in the regulation of the movement of GFP and are more susceptible to CMV infection, and mutants in both formins show greater movement of CMV MP between cells. The authors ultimately propose a model in which F-actin is present in the cytoplasmic sleeve of plasmodesmata, anchored by AtFH2. They propose that loss of the AtFH2 anchor increases the movement of GFP between cells by simply removing a physical blockage caused by F-actin. This manuscript presents a new actin-associated protein that associates at plasmodesmata, adding to actin, myosin, NET1A and Arp3. The authors have elegantly shown that AtFH1 and AtFH2 have nucleation/assembly and capping roles respectively, suggesting that there is specific regulation of F-actin at plasmodesmata.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present convincing data that the At formin proteins localize to the plasmodesmata and play a role in controlling size exclusion. The work appears to be well done but the results are over interpreted, especially with regard to the models that they draw from their data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript was reviewed by three knowledgeable reviewers. The consensus was that the paper would be suitable for publication if some revisions were made and a few additional experiments completed. Perhaps the strongest, negative comments related to the model proposed with regard to AtFH2. The feeling was that this model was not well supported by the data presented. Here are some of the specific comments made by the reviewers that relate to this:</p><p>The model in Figure 7J suggests there are multiple F-actin filaments in the cytoplasmic sleeve of a plasmodesma. Given that F-actin has a diameter of ~6nm, and a cytoplasmic sleeve might be only ~10-20nm at its widest point (doi:10.1038/nplants.2017.82), this seems an unlikely model. The authors say they can't directly visualise actin in plasmodesmata, but new advances in high resolution live imaging, or electron microscopy, would allow the domain of localisation of AtFH2 (within the plasmodesma or at the neck) to be assessed. It would further allow the abundance of actin in plasmodesmata to be assessed in the <italic>atfh2</italic> mutant. The model needs better justification, or other models should be considered.</p><p>There is no investigation or discussion of what the role of AtFH2 and actin in plasmodesmata is. Simply blocking up the channel doesn't relate to structure or function of plasmodesmata in any specific way.</p><p>Hence, we suggest removing the model completely from the paper or, at least, toning it down considerably by offering alternative explanations that also fit the dataset.</p><p>Additional major concerns with the paper are as follows:</p><p>1) PD callose is also one of the key factors involved in modulating PD SEL. Have authors checked the PD callose level in different genotypes, single and double mutants along with wild type? It is known that GFP movement from cell to cell can be regulated by callose deposition, does AtFH2 affect this? It's also known that actin regulates cyoplasmic streaming which would influence rate of GFP 'diffusion' between cells, does AtFH2 affect cytoplasmic streaming?</p><p>2) The experiment in which the <italic>atfh2</italic> mutant is complemented by plasmodesmata-targeted FIMBRIM 5 seems confounded. FIM5 and AtFH2 are functionally different – while a similar phenotype may be observed no conclusions can be drawn regarding the mode of action of AtFH2 at plasmodesmata. Show localisation of PDFIM5.</p><p>3) Provide the control showing the arrangement of actin filaments when AtFH2 is ectopically expressed. Please provide information whether AtFH2 over-expression lines showing any PD trafficking-related phenotype?</p><p>4) Authors have used the truncated domain for checking the biochemical properties of AtFH2, I wonder whether these domains individually complement the <italic>atfh2</italic> phenotype in planta. How we know whether this AtFH2△N function in the same way with membrane attached full-length FH2? A related question…is the TM domain sufficient to target proteins to the PD and, if yes, is it also sufficient for the phenotypes seen?</p><p>5) The bombardment experiments should have been executed with a non-mobile fluorescent protein that marks the bombarded cell to ensure that movement is correctly interpreted. If the authors have not done this, we recognise that this would require the data set to be entirely repeated. Therefore, we suggest the following alternative experiment – that the authors provide a control dataset in which the bombardments are performed with and without a transformation marker (e.g. ER-RFP) to provide supporting evidence that misinterpretation of movement is not frequent under their experimental conditions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;<italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Formin 2 Regulates Cell-to-Cell Trafficking by Capping and Stabilizing Actin Filaments at Plasmodesmata&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Christian Hardtke (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>I am happy to see the manuscript revised appropriately according to editor's and reviewers' comments. I have no any major comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>The revised manuscript from Diao et al., has addressed many of my comments and I think it reads well. I am pleased to see they have removed the model. However, some of the points included in the list of concerns have not been addressed and I hope they are before the paper is accepted.</p><p>- I am not convinced by the authors’ argument for including the PDFIM5 experiment. I still consider the experiment is confounded because: (1) the authors have not experimentally shown that PDFIM5 stabilises actin filaments; (2) FIM and AtFH2 function in very different ways and as they haven't demonstrated that both proteins influence the actin at plasmodesmata in the same way they can't draw the conclusion that both proteins influence plasmodesmata by the same process. In my opinion, removing this experiment from the paper does not weaken it.</p><p>- The authors have not addressed the comment that AtFH1 and AtFH2 are not redundant; it is still mentioned in the Abstract that they are and I consider this incorrect interpretation of the data they present. Given that the <italic>atfh1</italic> and <italic>atfh2</italic> single mutants both exhibit phenotypes, and that AtFH1 and AtFH2 have different biochemical functions, the authors can only conclude that they are partially redundant (if at all). With respect to the claim that AtFH1 has capping activity the authors refer to Michelot et al., 2005. This paper makes the statement &quot;The FH2-Cter domain acts like an efficient capper and blocks elongation at the barbed end of actin filaments. However, the presence of the FH1 domain allows the FH1-FH2-Cter protein to bind the barbed ends and allow elongation at the barbed ends.&quot; This implies to me that the full length AtFH1 does not have good capping activity, and therefore that AtFH1 and AtFH2 are unlikely to be fully redundant.</p><p>- The authors are also still referring to CMV MP-GFP movement from cell-to-cell as diffusion. CMV MP-GFP clearly localises at plasmodesmata and is therefore not freely mobile or 'diffusing' in the cell. It is well accepted that viral MPs are active and specific in their translocation from cell to cell via plasmodesmata. The use of the term diffusion here is incorrect and I recommend changing it to cell-to-cell movement CMV MP-GFP.</p><p>- The authors have changed their statistical tests for data they state is not normal. However, details of the test they used to identify that the data are not normal have not been supplied.</p><p>- The source files are simply tables that contain the results from the analysis of the data, not the raw data. They offer nothing new that isn't in the manuscript other than a p-value.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36316.061</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript was reviewed by three knowledgeable reviewers.

This is very likely because the size of PD (with a length of about 150 nm across cells and a width of roughly about 20-30 nm) is too small to be imaged by SIM (which has a resolution of about 85 nm). Therefore, SIM cannot yield any useful information in terms of the precise localization of AtFH2. We also attempted to determine the localization of AtFH2 with immunogold electron microscopy using anti-GFP antibody, but it did not work well in our hands.</p><p>In addition, we found that it is almost impossible to specifically visualize actin filaments at PD with SIM because actin filaments are very dense at the border of cells (see Figure 1—figure supplement 2C; Figure 2—figure supplement 3C). Therefore, we do not have direct evidence to judge whether the density of actin filaments is reduced at PD in <italic>atfh2</italic> mutants. We agree that, with the current set of data, the model is not fully supported, and we therefore deleted the model in this revised manuscript. Accordingly, we rewrote the statement about the potential function of AtFH2 in regulating actin dynamics at PD in the text (Introduction; Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is no investigation or discussion of what the role of AtFH2 and actin in plasmodesmata is.

Besides speculating that actin filaments might function as the barrier in blocking cell-to-cell trafficking as proposed previously, we really do not know how AtFH2 and actin might play any specific role in regulating the permeability of PD. Given that the reconstructed ultrastructure of PD using electron tomography showed that the contact between the PM and ER is highly dynamic and might be crucial for the permeability of PD (doi:10.1038/nplants.2017.82), we speculate that AtFH2-tethered actin filaments might be involved in regulating the contact between PM and ER. The detailed information can be found in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Hence, we suggest removing the model completely from the paper or, at least, toning it down considerably by offering alternative explanations that also fit the dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree with the comments that it is inappropriate to fit more actin filaments (with their diameter of about 7 nm) into the cytoplasmic sleeves of PD (with its diameter of less than 10 nm) (doi:10.1038/nplants.2017.82). Considering this along with the fact that we do not know exactly where AtFH2 is localized in PD, we decide to remove the model. Accordingly, we modified our statement about the potential function of AtFH2 and actin at PD. In this revised manuscript, we simply argue that AtFH2-mediated stability of actin filaments and/or the amount of actin filaments at PD might be crucial for the regulation of SEL of PD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) PD callose is also one of the key factors involved in modulating PD SEL.

In addition, we determined the velocity of cytoplasmic streaming in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> hypocotyl cells and found that it is similar between WT and <italic>atfh2</italic> mutants, which suggests that the increase in SEL of PD does not result from the changes in intracellular trafficking (see the results in the newly prepared Figure 2figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The experiment in which the atfh2 mutant is complemented by plasmodesmata-targeted Fimbrin5 seems confounded. FIM5 and AtFH2 are functionally different – while a similar phenotype may be observed no conclusions can be drawn regarding the mode of action of AtFH2 at plasmodesmata. Show localisation of PDFIM5.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our in vitro biochemical results that AtFH2 caps and stabilizes actin filaments, we speculated that the stability and/or the amount of actin filaments at PD are reduced in <italic>atfh2</italic> mutants. In this regard, we hypothesized that if we could prevent the depolymerization of actin filaments in PD, we might be able to suppress the cell-to-cell trafficking phenotype in <italic>atfh2</italic>. We tested this hypothesis by introducing a PD-targeting actin filament stabilizer. We fused the PD-targeting N-terminus of AtFH2 with an actin filament stabilizer FIM5 and found that the fusion protein called PD-FIM5 indeed targets to PD (Figure 7I). We found that introduction of PDFIM5 into <italic>atfh2</italic> suppressed the cell-to-cell trafficking phenotype, which suggests that the cell-to-cell trafficking phenotype in <italic>atfh2</italic> mutants indeed results to some extent from the instability of actin filaments at PD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Provide the control showing the arrangement of actin filaments when AtFH2 is ectopically expressed. Please provide information whether AtFH2 over-expression lines showing any PD trafficking-related phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>We found that overexpression of <italic>AtFH2</italic> does not have an overt effect on the organization of actin filaments and cell-to-cell trafficking (see the results in the newly prepared Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Authors have used the truncated domain for checking the biochemical properties of AtFH2, I wonder whether these domains individually complement the atfh2 phenotype in planta.

A related question…is the TM domain sufficient to target proteins to the PD and, if yes, is it also sufficient for the phenotypes seen?</p></disp-quote><p>The actin-related function of formin proteins is determined by the FH1FH2 domain. Therefore, colleagues in this field have routinely analyzed the biochemical activity of the formin FH1FH2 domain in regulating actin dynamics in vitro in order to understand the biochemical activity of formin proteins in regulating actin dynamics. In this regard, the FH1FH2 domain can to some extent represent the full-length protein in terms of the activity in regulating actin dynamics.</p><p>We demonstrate that the TM domain of AtFH2 is sufficient and necessary for the targeting of AtFH2 to PD (Figure 1). In further support of this notion, we found that the TM domain-containing N-terminus of AtFH2 is able to direct the heterologous <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> FIM5 to PD (Figure 7I). However, we found that simply targeting AtFH2 to PD is not sufficient for its function, since AtFH2M is able to target to PD but fails to rescue the cell-to-cell trafficking phenotype in <italic>atfh2</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The bombardment experiments should have been executed with a non-mobile fluorescent protein that marks the bombarded cell to ensure that movement is correctly interpreted.

We found that the HDEL-mCherry signal mostly stays in one cell while the eGFP signal appears in other cells besides the cell containing the HDEL-mCherry signal. We conclude that the cell having the non-mobile HDEL-mCherry signal is the bombarded cell. Therefore, the eGFP signal in the surrounding cells results from diffusion. We repeated the eGFP diffusion experiments using HDEL-mCherry to indicate the bombarded cell and compared the PD permeability between WT and the formin loss-of-function mutants and obtained the same results as before (see the results in the newly prepared Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] - I am not convinced by the authors’ argument for including the PDFIM5 experiment.
