mechanistically not well understood. Here, we report a novel disease mechanism and the finding that glial lipid metabolism is critical for axon function, independent of myelin itself. Surprisingly, nerves of Schwann cell-specific <italic>Pex5</italic> mutant mice were unaltered regarding axon numbers, axonal calibers, and myelin sheath thickness by electron microscopy. In search for a molecular mechanism, we revealed enhanced abundance and internodal expression of axonal membrane proteins normally restricted to juxtaparanodal lipid-rafts. Gangliosides were altered and enriched within an expanded lysosomal compartment of paranodal loops. We revealed the same pathological features in a mouse model of human Adrenomyeloneuropathy, preceding disease-onset by one year. Thus, peroxisomal dysfunction causes secondary failure of local lysosomes, thereby impairing the turnover of gangliosides in myelin. This reveals a new aspect of axon-glia interactions, with Schwann cell lipid metabolism regulating the anchorage of juxtaparanodal K<sub>v</sub>1-channels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23332.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23332.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23332.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells transmit messages along their length in the form of electrical signals. Much like an electrical wire, the nerve fiber or axon is coated by a multiple-layered insulation, called the myelin sheath. However, unlike electrical insulation, the myelin sheath is regularly interrupted to expose short regions of the underlying nerve. These exposed regions and the adjacent regions underneath the myelin contain ion channels that help to propagate electrical signals along the axon.</p><p>Peroxisomes are compartments in animal cells that process fats. Genetic mutations that prevent peroxisomes from working properly can lead to diseases where the nerves cannot transmit signals correctly. This is thought to be because the nerves lose their myelin sheath, which largely consists of fatty molecules.</p><p>The nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord are known as peripheral nerves. Kleinecke et al. have now analyzed peripheral nerves from mice that had one of three different genetic mutations, preventing their peroxisomes from working correctly. Even in cases where the mutation severely impaired nerve signaling, the peripheral nerves retained their myelin sheath.</p><p>The peroxisome mutations did affect a particular type of potassium ion channel and the anchor proteins that hold these channels in place. The role of these potassium ion channels is not fully known, but normally they are only found close to regions of the axon that are not coated by myelin. However, the peroxisome mutations meant that the channels and their protein anchors were now also located along the myelinated segments of the nerve’s axons. This redistribution of the potassium ion channels likely contributes to the peripheral nerves being unable to signal properly.</p><p>In addition, Kleinecke et al. found that disrupting the peroxisomes also affected another cell compartment, called the lysosome, in the nerve cells that insulate axons with myelin sheaths. Lysosomes help to break down unwanted fat molecules. Mutant mice had more lysosomes than normal, but these lysosomes did not work efficiently. This caused the nerve cells to store more of certain types of molecules, including molecules called glycolipids that stabilize protein anchors, which hold the potassium channels in place. A likely result is that protein anchors that would normally be degraded are not, leading to the potassium channels appearing inappropriately throughout the nerve.</p><p>Future work is now needed to investigate whether peroxisomal diseases cause similar changes in the brain. The results presented by Kleinecke et al. also suggest that targeting the lysosomes or the potassium channels could present new ways to treat disorders of the peroxisomes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23332.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23332.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>peripheral neuropathy</kwd><kwd>peroxisomes</kwd><kwd>lysosomes</kwd><kwd>metabolic disorders</kwd><kwd>axo-glia interaction</kwd><kwd>myelin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TR43</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nave</surname><given-names>Klaus-Armin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC advanced grant - AxoGLIA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nave</surname><given-names>Klaus-Armin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC advanced grant - MyeliNANO</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nave</surname><given-names>Klaus-Armin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Olivers Army</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Personal grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kassmann</surname><given-names>Celia Michèle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003158</institution-id><institution>Myelin Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Augusto Odone Young Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kassmann</surname><given-names>Celia Michèle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR83</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brügger</surname><given-names>Britta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dysfunctions of myelin peroxisomes cause a lysosomal storage-like disorder associated with alterations in glial and axonal membranes, which is the likely cause of nerve impairment in peroxisomal disorders.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Schwann cells, the myelinating cells of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), contain peroxisomes in distant cytoplasmic compartments, including myelin channels and cytosolic loop regions close to nodes of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kassmann et al., 2011</xref>). Peroxisomes degrade fatty acids derived from myelin lipids and generate precursors of myelin plasmalogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Waterham et al., 2016</xref>). Lysosomal compartments are also present in these nodal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gatzinsky et al., 1997</xref>), and growing evidence from in vitro studies suggests interactions between both types of organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baarine et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thai et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Peroxisomal dysfunction is caused by mutations of genes encoding peroxisomal proteins or peroxisomal biogenesis factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Waterham et al., 2016</xref>). In humans, <italic>loss-of-function</italic> mutations of ABCD1 are responsible for the disease X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). This peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette (ABC-) transporter mediates the import of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) into the organelle. In consequence, ABCD1-deficient peroxisomes are not capable of importing and degrading VLCFA that are specific substrates of peroxisomal β-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kemp et al., 2012</xref>). A more severe impairment of peroxisomes is caused by lack of the <italic>Hsd17b4</italic> gene (also called multifunctional protein 2; <italic>Mfp2</italic> gene) that encodes a central enzyme of peroxisomal β-oxidation. In MFP2-deficient cells, the β-oxidation of virtually all peroxisome-specific substrates, including VLCFA, is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Verheijden et al., 2013</xref>). A complete disruption of the organelle is observed in the absence of peroxisome biogenesis factor peroxin 5 (PEX5). This cycling receptor recognizes proteins with a peroxisomal targeting sequence type 1 (PTS1) and is involved in their transfer into peroxisomes. PEX5-dependent protein import applies to the majority of peroxisomal enzymes. Thus, PEX5-deletion disrupts peroxisomal function substantially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Waterham et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Schwann cell lipid metabolism is rate-limiting for myelination and is important for maintenance of axonal integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Viader et al., 2013</xref>), which requires in addition to membrane wrapping the assembly of nodal, paranodal, and juxtaparanodal membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rasband and Peles, 2015</xref>). The juxtaparanodal domain of myelinated axons harbors voltage-gated <italic>shaker-type</italic> potassium channels, K<sub>v</sub>1.1 (KCNA1) and K<sub>v</sub>1.2 (KCNA2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiu and Ritchie, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Robbins and Tempel, 2012</xref>), which also align the inner mesaxon as a thin band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arroyo et al., 1999</xref>). Associated with connexin-29 hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rash et al., 2016</xref>), their clustering and anchoring at juxtaparanodes requires the neuronal membrane proteins CASPR2 and TAG-1, the latter expressed by glia and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Poliak et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Traka et al., 2003</xref>).

For all stimulus intensities tested, responses of mutant nerves were different from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Compound action potentials (CAPs) and NCV were diminished in mutants (mean: 28 ± 4.7 m/s) compared to controls (41.5 ± 3.6 m/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Thresholds to evoke a signal were only slightly elevated (155µA versus 135µA), but the maximal response was 50% of control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f,g</xref>). Also, in vivo recordings revealed significantly reduced compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) in mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kassmann et al., 2011</xref>). This was more enhanced when stimulating proximally than distally, which clinically defines conduction blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>).</p><p>We suspected that reduced nerve conduction would be explained by demyelination. Surprisingly, by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis structural myelin proteins, including PMP22, MPZ/P0, and P2, were not significantly altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a,b</xref>). Only PLP, a minor PNS myelin protein, showed significant reduction. Also by electron microscopy (EM), myelin thickness, periodicity, and compaction were indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3c</xref>). Next, we determined internodal length in teased fiber preparations, which was shorter in mutant (623 nm) than in control fibers (691 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3d</xref>), but unlikely sufficiently reduced to cause a slower conduction by itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, while the reduced CAP suggested significant axon loss at 2 months, the morphometric analysis of entire nerve cross-sections revealed normal axonal numbers and calibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). Thus, reduced CAPs were most likely caused by functional conduction blocks rather than physical axon loss. Signs of axonal transport defects (APP accumulations) were not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3e</xref>), and also, indirect signs of neurodegeneration (neuroinflammation) were not significantly enhanced in nerves at 2 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a–d</xref>).</p><p>Disruptions of axo-glial junctions might cause leak currents and thus conduction failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arancibia-Carcamo and Attwell, 2014</xref>). Yet, both neurofascin-155 (NF155) and axonal CASPR, that is adhesion proteins that mediate axo-glial contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Desmazieres et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Normand and Rasband, 2015</xref>), were normally localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). By EM, we never found the detachment of paranodal loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k,l</xref>), even where abnormally enlarged by accumulated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kassmann et al., 2011</xref>). Next, we examined the distribution of ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Devaux et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rasband and Peles, 2015</xref>) in sciatic nerve teased fibers from 2- and 9-month-old mutants and controls. Nodal Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 and K<sub>v</sub>7.2, as well as their anchoring proteins, were normally flanked by CASPR-positive paranodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). Surprisingly, the juxtaparanodal potassium channel protein K<sub>v</sub>1.1 displayed an abnormal localization, frequently displaced into the adjacent internodal region, and to a minor extent into paranodes. K<sub>v</sub>1.1 clusters were in the majority of cases still maintained at juxtaparanodes, suggesting that internodal mislocalization is secondary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d,e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Indeed, the pathology of internodal K<sub>v</sub>1 channels progressively increased with age frequently presenting more than one extra cluster along one internode in aged mutants, while shifts into the nodal direction were not progressive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>). We confirmed the observation of displaced juxtaparanodal K<sub>v</sub>1 channels using K<sub>v</sub>1.2 antibody (data not shown). At 9 months, we determined a twofold overall increase of K<sub>v</sub>1.1 in nerve lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). However, as most K<sub>v</sub>1.1 is expressed by unmyelinated fibers, the increase of internodal K<sub>v</sub>1.1 in myelinated axons may be significantly higher. Neuronal CASPR2, the <italic>cis-</italic>anchor for K<sub>v</sub>1 channels in the axonal membrane, and TAG-1 on SC are essential for channel clustering at juxtaparanodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hivert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Poliak et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Savvaki et al., 2010</xref>). Both proteins colocalized with K<sub>v</sub>1.1 at regular and ectopic internodal positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–g</xref>). TAG-1 expression was slightly but not significantly elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). In contrast, staining for myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) did not reveal a connection between Schmidt-Lanterman incisures and the ectopic K<sub>v</sub>1.1/TAG-1/CASPR2-positive clusters (data not shown). Although, we cannot exclude that enhanced expression of TAG-1 contributes to the formation of ectopic protein clusters, the observations suggest that in mutant nerves entire membrane patches of the juxtaparanodal compartment accumulate, break-off, and drift into the internodal region.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23332.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Abnormal distribution of axonal ion channels K<sub>v</sub>1.1, its anchoring proteins, and associated lipids in conditional <italic>Pex5</italic> mutant nerves.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Immune-stained sciatic teased fibers of 2- and 9-month-old mice reveal normally localized nodal sodium channels (Na<sub>v</sub>1.6; blue) flanked by paranodal CASPR (red; scale bar, 10 µm).

For example, gangliosides, which are frequently esterified with VLCFA and 2-hydroxy fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chrast et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sandhir et al., 2000</xref>), must be degraded in lysosomes. However, subsequent β-oxidation of VLCFA and 2-hydroxy fatty acids requires peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foulon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wanders, 2014</xref>). Thus, our mouse model provides first in vivo evidence for functional interactions between lysosomes and peroxisomes, so far only discussed for cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>One consequence of lysosomal impairment is the perturbation of normal ganglioside turnover. Gangliosides are in close association with K<sub>v</sub>1-anchoring proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loberto et al., 2003</xref>) and provide stability to the juxtaparanodal clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Susuki et al., 2007</xref>), which resemble giant membrane 'lipid rafts'. As mechanism for ectopic localization of axonal K<sub>v</sub>1 channels, we suggest the following working model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>): Lack of ganglioside breakdown causes their accumulation in the glial juxtaparanodal membrane. Thereby, clusters of K<sub>v</sub>1 and associated anchoring proteins (TAG-1 and CASPR2) on the axonal side gain abnormal stability, break-off, diffuse into the internodal region, and escape from regular turnover. It is likely that also glial TAG-1 remains anchored to the axonal K<sub>v</sub>1-/CASPR2-/TAG-1 clusters, but this cannot be distinguished by TAG-1 immunofluorescence.</p><p>K<sub>v</sub>1-channels are fast-opening, voltage-gated channels that are activated by mild voltage-shifts and thought to regulate fiber excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glasscock et al., 2012</xref>). The integrity of K<sub>v</sub>1 channels is also impaired in CASPR2-/- mice, but perturbation of nerve function is not a feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poliak et al., 2003</xref>). Unlike PEX5 mutant nerves, CASPR2-/- nerves do not exhibit elevated levels of K<sub>v</sub>1.1 channel protein. Also, the ectopic K<sub>v</sub>1.1+ clusters are situated directly adjacent to juxtaparanodes in CASPR2-deficient fibers, not along the internodes as observed in PEX5 mutants. Considering the severe progressive decline of nerve function in PEX5 mutant mice, which becomes clearly more affected with age (data not shown), it is unlikely that a rather non-progressive pathology, that is the shift of K<sub>v</sub>1 into paranodes, is the underlying cause of conduction slowing. In contrast, the progressive shift of K<sub>v</sub>1 toward internodes correlates well with disease progression. Theoretically, K<sub>v</sub>1-mediated currents in the internode could hyperpolarize the axonal membrane and dampen the conductivity of spiking axons. Such ‘feedback regulation’ might prevent hyperexcitability, which is a feature of mice lacking K<sub>v</sub>1.1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 1998</xref>). On the other hand, a ‘gain-of-function’ effect by opening additional ectopic internodal K<sub>v</sub>1 channels, may contribute to a disturbed equilibrium of axonal ions causing slowed NCV and conduction blocks. Direct proof of this model would require patch clamping single axons underneath myelin, which is impossible at present.</p><p>Peripheral neuropathy has been associated with numerous metabolic diseases, including AMN. In this clinically milder variant of ABCD1 loss-of-function mutations, the reduced NCV was assumed to reflect demyelination, which is a hallmark in the brain of severely affected patients. Similarly, conditional PEX5 knockout mice display a cerebral inflammatory demyelination, while such pathology is absent in sciatic nerves. This remarkable discrepancy between the peripheral and central nervous system pathology is currently unexplained and presumably related to differently responding cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kassmann, 2014</xref>). Also in ABCD1-deficient nerves neither demyelination nor axon degeneration, but ectopic axonal K<sub>v</sub>1 channels was a progressive pathological feature as early as at 2 months of age, preceding the disease onset by more than 1 year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pujol et al., 2002</xref>). Our present findings therefore expand the emerging role of myelinating glial cells in maintaining axonal membrane composition and thereby influencing axonal function, independent of myelin itself.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Cnp1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Pex5<sup>ﬂox/flox</sup></italic> mice with C57/Bl6 genetic background were genotyped as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kassmann et al., 2007</xref>).

Nerve conduction velocity was calculated for each of the stimulus intensities as the mean across trials of the ratio between the length of the nerve and the time between peaks of stimulus-artifact (first small positive peak) and response (third positive peak).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Electrophysiology, in vivo</title><p>Mice aged 9 months were anesthetized with ketaminhydrochloride (100 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>)/xylazin hydrochloride (8 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>). Steel needle electrodes were placed subcutaneously, one pair at sciatic notch (proximal stimulation), a second pair at the tibial nerve above the ankle (distal stimulation). Supramaximal square wave pulses lasting 100 ms were delivered using a Toennies Neuroscreen (Jaeger, Germany). Compound muscle action potential (CMAP) was recorded from the intrinsic foot muscles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Image processing</title><p>Digital images were processed and quantified with ZEN 2012 software (Zeiss) and/or Fiji.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All numerical values are shown as the mean ± s.e.m.; n = 3–6, unless stated otherwise.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this short report, Kleinecke et al. describe the consequences of peroxisome dysfunction upon <italic>Pex5</italic> deletion in Schwann cells. The phenotype is strikingly less severe than that in that observed when <italic>Pex5</italic> is deleted in oligodendrocytes as described in a previous paper from this group, and interestingly suggests peroxisome dysfunction has severe consequences on the function of neighboring lysosomes. Indeed, the authors demonstrate that there is mislocalization of lysosomal proteins, gangliosides and other proteins including K<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels. The authors suggest that these changes have important effects on nerve physiology. Lastly, some of the observed phenotypes were also observed in mice deficient in <italic>Abcd1</italic>. The authors propose an interesting model that suggests lipids on Schwann cell membranes stabilize certain adhesion proteins and their associated ion channels. Disruption of these lipids leads to K<sub>v</sub>1.1 channel mislocalization which in turn is proposed to lead to nerve conduction changes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although the presented data suggest very interesting models, the correlative nature of this data could be strengthened by additional experiments.</p><p>1) The examination of conditional knockouts for the peroxisomal protein <italic>Mfp2</italic> for similar phenotypes that were observed in <italic>Pex5</italic> cKOs would strengthen the conclusions and provide some mechanistic insight. For example, if many of the findings observed in the <italic>Pex5</italic> cKOs, particularly the abnormal CAP recordings, could also be demonstrated in the <italic>Mfp2</italic> cKOs, it could be said with greater confidence that manipulation of lipid metabolism is specifically producing these changes. Similarly, the connection to human disease could be strengthened if the CAP recording abnormalities are also found in <italic>Abcd1</italic> KOs.</p><p>2) Additional studies on nerve physiology are needed. The studies on nerve conduction show clear changes in conduction velocity and CAP amplitude. The authors conclude this is a function of ectopic internodal K<sup>+</sup> channels leading to conduction block. Some additional experiments are needed to support these conclusions. Decreased internodal distance could also decrease conduction velocity, whether this could be a progressive change is unclear, but it should be ruled out. Conduction block is typically defined clinically by stimulating at a distal point and a proximal point, and comparing amplitudes. If the distal amplitude is greater than the proximal, this is evidence of conduction block (increased failure to propagate and action potential with increased distance). This should be tested. It is unclear that the decrease in CAP could not be simply the result of lower amplitude action potentials, or a complete failure in excitability of a subset of axons (larger, faster conducting axons, for example, which could also explain the velocity changes).</p><p>3) Furthermore, examination of the localization of K<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels should be done at an earlier time point. It's not clear from the data whether membrane complexes break off and diffuse into the adjacent internodal and paranodal regions, or if localization is simply misspecified during the initial formation of myelination. Although the progressive mislocalization of K<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels to the internode with age supports the authors' model, it would be helpful to examine an earlier time point when sciatic nerve myelination has just completed.</p><p>4) Lastly, to strengthen the proposal that ganglioside accumulation underlies mislocalization of K<sub>v</sub>1.1, quantitation of the GPI-anchored protein TAG-1 and CASPR2 would be useful to rule out for possible alterations in expression that may be altered by lipid metabolism.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23332.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Although the presented data suggest very interesting models, the correlative nature of this data could be strengthened by additional experiments.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The examination of conditional knockouts for the peroxisomal protein Mfp2 for similar phenotypes that were observed in Pex5 cKOs would strengthen the conclusions and provide some mechanistic insight.

Similarly, the connection to human disease could be strengthened if the CAP recording abnormalities are also found in Abcd1 KOs.</italic> </p><p>We agree that a similar pathology of PEX5 and MFP2 cKO nerves would strengthen our conclusions. We have therefore analyzed sciatic nerves from aged (16 months old) MFP2 mutants, which demonstrated nearly 3-fold lysosomal enzyme activity (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, electrophysiological recordings revealed reduced CAPs of mutants compared to age-matched controls, as predicted. (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>We also performed the requested electrophysiological recordings of ABCD1 animals. At age 2 months, there were no differences yet compared to controls. This was not unexpected, because the mislocalization of K<sub>v</sub>1 potassium channels at that age affected only a minor portion of internodes (original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We note, that in human AMN patients the corresponding PNS symptoms will not manifest before the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> decade of life, and it is well known that mouse and man differ in disease expression and disease kinetics (specifically for mutations of the X-linked ABCD1 gene; Ferrer et al., Brain Pathol., 2010). Indeed, ABCD1 knockout mice showed a significant mislocalization of potassium channels only at 22 months of age (original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), which corresponds to the human 7<sup>th</sup> – 8<sup>th</sup> decade of life. At that age we measured reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) compared to younger mutants, however there was already a major overlap with other aging-dependent changes of conductivity that also affect wild-type mice. Thus, it was not possible to simply separate nerve aging effects from ABCD1 genotype-dependent changes of conductivity. Although, we noted a clear trend (P=0.12) between the groups, we prefer to not add these data into the current manuscript. Waiting for another cohort of ABCD1 mutant with the age of 22 months is unfortunately not possible within the time frame of the revision.</p><p><italic>2) Additional studies on nerve physiology are needed. The studies on nerve conduction show clear changes in conduction velocity and CAP amplitude. The authors conclude this is a function of ectopic internodal K<sup>+</sup> channels leading to conduction block. Some additional experiments are needed to support these conclusions. Decreased internodal distance could also decrease conduction velocity, whether this could be a progressive change is unclear, but it should be ruled out. Conduction block is typically defined clinically by stimulating at a distal point and a proximal point, and comparing amplitudes. If the distal amplitude is greater than the proximal, this is evidence of conduction block (increased failure to propagate and action potential with increased distance). This should be tested. It is unclear that the decrease in CAP could not be simply the result of lower amplitude action potentials, or a complete failure in excitability of a subset of axons (larger, faster conducting axons, for example, which could also explain the velocity changes).</italic> </p><p>As requested, we have addressed the possibility that conduction blocks are responsible for the reduced CAPs in PEX5 mutant nerves. Here, we have turned to in vivo analysis and have assessed the ratio of compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) after proximal and distal nerve stimulation. As shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>, the distal amplitude was significantly (p&lt;0.01) greater than the proximal amplitude, as predicted for axonal conduction blocks. A sentence referring to these new data has been added in the third paragraph of the Results.</p><p>To investigate a possible impact of altered internodal length on conduction velocity (NCV) we analyzed PEX5 mutant nerves at age 2 months. Here, the average internodal length of mutant fibers (623 µm) was approximately 10% shorter compared to controls (691 µm), as summarized in the fourth paragraph of the Results and depicted in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>. Although significant, this length difference should by itself not result in slowed conduction, because shortening the internodal length accelerates nerve conduction to a flat maximum, as shown by the Brophy lab. That paper demonstrated unaltered NCV despite a 30% reduced internodal length in the ΔPDZ-Prx mouse mutant (Wu et al., Curr. Biol., 2012).</p><p><italic>3) Furthermore, examination of the localization of K<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels should be done at an earlier time point. It's not clear from the data whether membrane complexes break off and diffuse into the adjacent internodal and paranodal regions, or if localization is simply misspecified during the initial formation of myelination. Although the progressive mislocalization of K<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels to the internode with age supports the authors' model, it would be helpful to examine an earlier time point when sciatic nerve myelination has just completed.</italic> </p><p>For the original submission we had analyzed K<sub>v</sub>1.1 in PEX5 mutant and control nerves at P19 (original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), i.e. shortly after juxtaparanodes have formed in development. As requested, we have extended the observational time points to P17 and then to P7.</p><p>At P7 and also at P17 K<sub>v</sub>1.1 appeared not yet completely clustered, and in the majority of myelinated fibers (mutants and controls) the staining included a diffuse signal in nodal/paranodal and paranodal/ juxtaparanodal regions. In these immature fibers that lacked regular K<sub>v</sub>1.1-positive juxtaparanodes, we never observed abnormal internodal clusters.</p><p>Likewise, in ABCD1-mutant nerves a comparison of young (2mo) and old (22 mo) sciatic nerves revealed significant internodal clusters only at age 22 months (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This strengthens our model of an initially normal formation of juxtaparanodes and a secondary breaking off. We have added a clarifying sentence in the last paragraph of the Results.</p><p><italic>4) Lastly, to strengthen the proposal that ganglioside accumulation underlies mislocalization of K<sub>v</sub>1.1, quantitation of the GP1-anchored protein TAG-1 and CASPR2 would be useful to rule out for possible alterations in expression that may be altered by lipid metabolism.</italic> </p><p>We agree that alterations of a cell's lipid metabolism could affect (e.g. SREBP-dependent) gene expression and result in overexpression as a hypothetical cause of ectopic protein localization. We have therefore analyzed the mRNA expression levels of TAG-1, which is the K<sub>v</sub>1.1 anchor expressed by Schwann cells, but could not detect significant differences (p=0.42) as shown in NEW <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>. Note that CASPR2 is expressed in the neuronal/axonal compartment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
