In fact, soil gets it characteristic ‘earthy’ smell from a common type of soil bacteria known as <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. Remarkably, <italic>Streptomyces</italic> are also the original sources of most of the antibiotics that are prescribed by doctors to treat bacterial infections. Scientists have been studying <italic>Streptomyces</italic> for over 70 years, and in all this time, there has been unanimous agreement on how these bacteria grow. That is to say that, unlike most other bacteria, <italic>Streptomyces</italic> grow like plants: they don’t move, and instead produce spores that are dispersed like seeds. This stationary lifestyle makes these bacteria somewhat vulnerable to predators, and so it is thought that <italic>Streptomyces</italic> make antibiotics to help protect themselves from other bacteria that are able to move around in the soil.</p><p>However, this established view of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> growth has now been turned on its head because Jones et al. have discovered that <italic>Streptomyces</italic> bacteria can indeed move when grown in the presence of fungi.

They also emphasise that researchers will need to consider such long-range communication strategies if they hope to better understand microbial communities.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21738.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21738.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Streptomyces</kwd><kwd>volatile compound</kwd><kwd>alkaline</kwd><kwd>fungal interaction</kwd><kwd>trimethylamine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vanier Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Stephanie E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ontario Government</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ontario Graduate Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Louis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP133636</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nodwell</surname><given-names>Justin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2015-04681</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elliot</surname><given-names>Marie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Exploratory growth is a newly discovered mode of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> growth that it is stimulated by fungi, is pH responsive, and can be communicated to other – physically separated – streptomycetes through airborne compounds.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our current understanding of microbial growth and development stems largely from investigations conducted using single-species cultures. It is becoming clear, however, that most bacteria and fungi exist as part of larger polymicrobial communities in their natural settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scherlach et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Traxler and Kolter, 2015</xref>). Microbial behavior is now known to be modulated by neighbouring organisms, where interspecies interactions can have profound and diverse consequences, including modifying virulence of human pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peleg et al., 2010</xref>), altering antibiotic resistance profiles of mixed-species biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oliveira et al., 2015</xref>), enhancing bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Romano and Kolter, 2005</xref>), and increasing production of specialized metabolites by fungi and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schroeckh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stubbendieck and Straight, 2016</xref>). Consequently, an important next step in advancing our developmental understanding of microbes will be to expand our investigations to include multi-species cultures, and in doing so, unveil new and unexpected microbial growth strategies.</p><p>The soil is a heterogeneous environment that is densely populated with bacteria and fungi, and as such, represents an outstanding system in which to study the effects of bacterial-fungal interactions. Within the polymicrobial communities occupying the soil, <italic>Streptomyces</italic> represent the largest genus of the ubiquitous actinomycetes group. These Gram-positive bacteria are renowned for both their complex developmental life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elliot et al., 2008</xref>) and their ability to produce an extraordinary range of specialized metabolites having antibiotic, antifungal, antiparasitic, and anticancer properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hopwood, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Streptomyces</italic> life cycle encompasses three developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). First, a spore germinates to generate one or two germ tubes. These grow by apical tip extension and hyphal branching, ultimately forming a dense vegetative mycelial network that scavenges for nutrients. Second, in response to signals that may be linked to nutrient depletion, non-branching aerial hyphae extend into the air away from the vegetative cells. These aerial hyphae are coated in a hydrophobic sheath that enables escape from the aqueous environment of the vegetative mycelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Claessen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elliot et al., 2003</xref>), and their emergence coincides with the onset of specialized metabolism within the vegetative cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kelemen and Buttner, 1998</xref>). Aerial development requires the activity of the ‘<italic>bld’</italic> gene products, where mutations in these genes result in colonies lacking the fuzzy/hydrophobic characteristics of wild type. The final developmental stage involves the differentiation of aerial hyphae into spores through a synchronous cell division and cell maturation event. This process is governed by the <italic>whi</italic> (for ‘white’) gene products, whose mutants fail to form mature, pigmented spores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCormick and Flärdh, 2012</xref>). In addition to being highly stress-resistant, spores also provide a means of dispersing <italic>Streptomyces</italic> to new environments, as all characterized <italic>Streptomyces</italic> cell types are non-motile.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21738.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Physical association with yeast triggers <italic>Streptomyces</italic> exploratory behaviour.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Developmental life cycle of <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. Germ tubes emerge from a single spore, and grow by apical tip extension and hyphal branching, forming a dense network of branching vegetative hyphae. In response to unknown signals, non-branching aerial hyphae coated in a hydrophobic sheath, escape into the air. Aerial hyphae differentiate into chains of dormant, stress-resistant non-motile spores. The <italic>bld</italic> gene products are required for the transition from vegetative growth to aerial hyphae formation, while the <italic>whi</italic> gene products are required for the differentiation of aerial hyphae into spore chains.

As expected, during this time <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> on its own formed a colony of normal size. In contrast, when <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> was grown beside <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, its growth was radically different. During the first five days, the cells appeared to consume <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, before initiating a rapid outgrowth that led to <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> colonizing the entire surface of a 10 cm agar plate after 14 days. Remarkably, growth did not cease when physical obstructions were encountered: <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> cells were able to spread over rocks and polystyrene barriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>To gain insight into this phenomenon, we visualized the leading edge of the rapidly migrating <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). We found it initially progressed at a rate of ~1.5 µm/min. This is an order of magnitude faster than would be explained by growth alone, given that hyphal tip extension has been calculated to occur at a rate of 0.13 µm/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richards et al., 2012</xref>). We refer to this rapid movement as 'exploratory growth', and these spreading cells as 'explorers', based on their ability to effectively transverse both biotic and abiotic surfaces. To further investigate the morphology of these explorer cells, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to visualize <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> grown alone, <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> at the yeast interface, and <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> explorer cells, after 14 days of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We found <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> alone grew vegetatively, albeit without any obvious branches (branching vegetative cells were observed during growth on other media types, as expected), whereas <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> growing on <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> raised aerial hyphae and sporulated. Microscopic analysis of explorer cells revealed that they failed to branch and were reminiscent of aerial hyphae. Unlike aerial hyphae, however, these filaments were hydrophilic, based on their inability to repel aqueous solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-21738-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21738.007</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Leading edge of <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> explorer cells over a 17 hr time course.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21738.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21738.007</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>To determine whether exploratory growth required classic developmental regulators (the <italic>bld</italic> and <italic>whi</italic> gene products), we grew a suite of <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> developmental mutants beside <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to evaluate whether these mutations impacted colony spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Four <italic>S. venezuelae bld</italic> mutants (<italic>bldC,D,M,N</italic>) and five <italic>S. venezuelae whi</italic> mutants (<italic>whiB,D,G,H,I</italic>) were inoculated beside <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Unexpectedly, all developmental mutant strains displayed a similar exploratory behaviour as wild type after 14 days, although the <italic>bldN</italic> mutant exhibited slower exploration than the other strains. The mutant strains did, however, differ in their growth on yeast, with the <italic>bld</italic> mutants failing to raise aerial hyphae, and the <italic>whi</italic> mutants failing to sporulate. This demonstrated that exploratory growth was distinct from the canonical <italic>Streptomyces</italic> life cycle, and represented a new form of growth for these bacteria.</p><p>To determine whether this exploratory behaviour was unique to <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>, we inoculated other commonly studied streptomycetes beside <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.

To rule out the possibility that any liquid-grown culture could promote exploration, we also grew <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> and WAC0566 in YPD (G+) liquid medium, and found these cultures were unable to stimulate exploration. This suggested that VOC production was glucose-repressible, and its production correlated with growth conditions that promoted exploration.</p><p>To determine the identity of the VOC, we grew <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> and WAC0566 in G+ and G- liquid culture for three days. We collected the supernatants of each culture, and assayed them using two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC-TOFMS). From this, 1400 unique compounds were identified. To determine which compound(s) were responsible for promoting exploration, we applied a stringent filter, requiring the compound(s) to be: (i) present in at least 50% of <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> and WAC0566 exploration-inducing (G-) cultures; (ii) present in at least 10-fold greater abundance in exploration-inducing (G-) cultures versus static (G+) cultures; and (iii) have at least a 60% similarity score to known compounds in the 2011 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Mass Spectral Library. We arrived at a list of 21 candidate compounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data"><bold>Supplementary file 1</bold></xref>). Of these, 12 were not detected in the negative controls (G+ cultures). Within this group of 12, only four were detected in 100% of <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> and WAC0566 exploration-promoting cultures: trimethylamine (TMA), thiocyanic acid, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and 2-acetylthiazole. Notably, TMA was &gt;10 fold more abundant than the other three compounds, and thus we focussed our initial investigations on this molecule.</p><p>TMA is a volatile nitrogen-containing metabolite with a high pKa (9.81). As we knew <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> produced a basic VOC, we hypothesized that TMA was responsible for promoting exploration. To test this possibility,we placed commercially-available TMA in a small plastic container at the centre of a YPD (G+) agar plate, and then inoculated <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> at defined positions around this container (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). After seven days, <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> cultured adjacent to the TMA-emitting solutions had initiated exploratory growth, while those grown next to a water-containing control failed to spread. This implied that TMA was the VOC used by <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> and WAC0566 to elicit exploratory growth.</p><p>TMA production is not well understood, although recent work has revealed two mechanisms by which it can be generated from quaternary amines. <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> sp. employ a carnitine oxygenase (product of the <italic>cntAB</italic> gene cluster) in converting L-carnitine into TMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>), while <italic>Desulfovibrio desulfuricans</italic> converts choline into TMA using a choline-trimethylamine lyase (encoded by the <italic>cutCD</italic> genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Craciun and Balskus, 2012</xref>). <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> lacks any gene with similarity to <italic>cntA</italic>, and thus does not use an equivalent pathway to generate TMA. It does possess homologues of <italic>cutCD</italic>; however, these genes were more highly expressed (~5 fold) in static <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> cultures (where no TMA was ever detected), than in spreading cultures. This suggested that these gene products may not direct TMA production in <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>. TMA can also be produced upon biogenic reduction of trimethylamine <italic>N-</italic>oxide (TMAO) by TMAO reductases. Bacteria known to carry out this reaction typically encode one or more TMAO reducase operons, including some combination of <italic>torSTRCAD</italic> (or <italic>torSTRCADE</italic>), <italic>torYZ, dmsABC,</italic> and <italic>ynfEFGH</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunn and Stabb, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McCrindle et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> encodes homologs to some of these genes [specifically <italic>torA</italic> (top hit: <italic>SVEN_1326</italic>), <italic>dmsAB</italic> (top hit: <italic>SVEN_3040-3039</italic>), and <italic>ynfEFG</italic> (top hit: <italic>SVEN_3040, 3040 and 3039</italic>)]. In our RNA seq data, however, all of these genes (along with more divergent homologs) were expressed at extremely low levels, with equivalent levels for each gene being observed in both static and exploratory cultures.

Here, we demonstrate a new developmental behavior for <italic>Streptomyces</italic> that provides them with an alternative means of colonizing new habitats. In response to fungal neighbours and nutrient (glucose) depletion, <italic>Streptomyces</italic> can escape the confines of their classically defined lifecycle, and initiate exploratory growth. Exploratory growth is remarkably relentless: explorer cells are not limited by inanimate barriers, and can grow over abiotic surfaces. Explorer cells alter their local environment through the release of the alkaline, volatile compound TMA. Emitting TMA not only promotes exploratory behaviour by the producing cells, it also functions as an airborne signal that elicits an exploratory response in physically distant streptomycetes, and provides further fitness benefits by inhibiting the growth of other bacteria.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Metabolic cues trigger a developmental switch</title><p><italic>S. venezuelae</italic> exploration is triggered by two key metabolic cues: glucose depletion and a rise in pH.

In low-glucose areas of the soil, <italic>Streptomyces</italic> may initiate exploratory growth in an attempt to colonize environments with more readily available nutrients, whereas in high-glucose areas (<italic>e.g.</italic> near plant roots, or in association with fruit) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kliewer, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lugtenberg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Romano and Kolter, 2005</xref>), exploration may be less advantageous, initiating only after nearby fungi – or other microbes – consume the existing glucose supply. Microbial alteration of nutrient profiles is likely to be common in the soil environment (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Romano and Kolter, 2005</xref>), and we expect that the exploratory growth away from glucose-depleted areas would provide a benefit analogous to that of motility systems in other bacteria.

Consequently, it is possible for <italic>Streptomyces</italic> to respond to TMA produced by other bacteria and initiate exploratory growth under conditions where glucose concentrations are high and/or glucose-titrating organisms are absent. Developmental switching in response to VOC eavesdropping has not been previously reported, but exploiting community goods in this way is not unprecedented. For example, quorum signals and siderophores produced by one organism can be taken up or used by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lyons and Kolter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Traxler et al., 2012</xref>).

Volatile compounds have historically been implicated in the ‘avoidance responses’ of fungi, promoting their growth away from inanimate objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gamow and Böttger, 1982</xref>). Increasingly, these compounds are now being found to have important roles in communication between physically separated microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Audrain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Letoffe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tyc et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wheatley, 2002</xref>). A range of fungi use the volatile alkaline compound ammonia to induce morphological switches in other fungi, and to mediate inhibition of neighbouring colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Palková et al., 1997</xref>). Our observations suggest that VOCs may also be key bacterial morphological determinants, communicating developmental switches both within and between different microbial species.</p><p>In addition to serving as communication signals, VOCs may also provide their producing organisms with a competitive advantage in the soil.

TMA is a particularly potent example. Here, we show that exposure of other bacteria to TMA inhibits their growth, while previous work has revealed that TMA exposure increases bacterial sensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Notably, <italic>Streptomyces</italic> synthesize an extraordinary range of antibiotics, including many aminoglycosides. Thus in the soil, <italic>Streptomyces-</italic>produced TMA may have direct antibacterial activity, in addition to sensitizing bacteria to the effect of <italic>Streptomyces-</italic>produced antibiotics.

This functional differentiation represents an effective bet-hedging strategy, whereby spreading explorer cells scavenge nutrients for the group, while the sporulating cells provide a highly resistant genetic repository, ensuring colony survival in the event of failed exploration. Explorer cells resemble vegetative hyphae, in that their surface is hydrophilic; however, unlike traditional vegetative hyphae, explorer cells do not appear to branch. We presume that explorer cells dispense with frequent branching as a trade-off for the ability to rapidly spread to new environments.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>Streptomyces</italic> exploration is triggered by fungal interactions and volatile signals&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jean Marc Ghigo (Reviewer #2); Matthew Traxler (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper by Jones and colleagues is a fascinating report of a new type <italic>Streptomyces</italic> differentiation induced by the presence of neighboring fungi. Using elegant experimental designs the authors show that rapid glucose consumption by the fungus turns on a deep <italic>Streptomyces</italic> metabolic reprogramming, alkalinization of the surrounding environment and a switch to a new &quot;exploratory&quot; lifestyle. The pH drop seems to be driven by a volatile molecule, TMA, which raises the interesting possibility that <italic>Streptomyces</italic> colonies can exchange differentiation signals at a distance, and possibly use TMA from other bacteria to adapt their lifecycle.</p><p>Overall, the paper is written clearly and concisely. The experiments are well performed and controlled. Nevertheless, the paper should be improved in several instances to be suitable for publication.</p><p>The demonstration that pH alone can induce the exploratory behavior appears to be missing. Can <italic>Streptomyces</italic> switch to exploratory mode simply if the plates are buffered to pH 9.5? The authors show that the TMA effects are reduced when buffered by MOPS but they their model suggests that lowering the pH of the plates alone should be sufficient to induce exploratory growth.</p><p>Is the <italic>cydCD</italic> mutant capable of inducing exploration in the WT in the VOC assay? This would speak to an important question: Does the <italic>cydCD</italic> mutant fail to respond to alkaline conditions or does it fail to make them?</p><p>The authors conclude that none of the <italic>bld</italic> mutants showed altered exploratory phenotypes. Is it really so? It looks like the <italic>bldN</italic> mutant did not spread as much as the WT. Did it later spread like the WT? Could the exploratory cells at least partially require <italic>bldN</italic> to achieve this exploratory morphology?</p><p>The study is somewhat vague regarding the origin of TMA. The authors indicate the lack of carnitine oxygenase able to convert L-carnitine into TMA. In many other organisms, TMA is produced upon biogenic reduction of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO). Does <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> possess TMAO reductase? If so, does <italic>S. venezualae</italic> medium contains TMAO? In addition, in absence of a TMA-producing mutant, it is not known whether TMA is the sole active molecule. For example, ammonia is shown to produce similar phenotypes. Can the authors exclude other molecules?</p><p>Elucidating the molecular and cellular basis of the exploratory lifestyle is not within the immediate scope of this paper but the process itself is very little discussed throughout the paper. Is motility involved? Or is it only growth and why in this case the exceptional spreading? The cells are mentioned to be hydrophilic, is the overall moisture of the colony increased? Is a surfactant involved? Leads into these questions could come from more analysis/description of the 48 mutants that were isolated. Also, why do the authors think that mutants that cannot spread in Glucose-deprived medium can still do so in the presence of yeast?</p><p>The work performed by Zdena Palková (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Zdena+Palkov%C3%A1++ammonia">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Zdena+Palková++ammonia</ext-link>) on how ammonia-dependent medium alkalization induce morphogenetic switch in yeast should at least be mentioned: it is after all the best studied alkaline volatile compounds triggering a morphogenetic switch.</p><p>In the first paragraph of the subsection “The yeast TCA cycle must be intact to stimulate <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> exploratory behaviour” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: The text mentions nine genes affected in TCA cycle =&gt; the figure (diagram part of the figure) only shows eight of them. However, CYT1, involved in oxaloacetate to citrate transition (TCA cycle part of the figure) is not shown: is it the missing one?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21738.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Overall, the paper is written clearly and concisely.

Can Streptomyces switch to exploratory mode simply if the plates are buffered to pH 9.5? The authors show that the TMA effects are reduced when buffered by MOPS but they their model suggests that lowering the pH of the plates alone should be sufficient to induce exploratory growth.</italic> </p><p>To address whether raising the pH of the medium was sufficient to induce exploratory growth, we buffered plates containing YPD medium to pH 9.0 using 0 (control), 50, 100 or 200 mM borate. When <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> alone was grown on each plate, we found it grew slowly on all borate-buffered plates, and did not initiate exploration under any condition. These results suggest that high pH alone cannot induce exploratory behavior.</p><p>When <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> grows beside yeast on YPD, or alone on YP, cells first grow at a neutral pH of 7.0, before transitioning to exploratory growth, when the medium pH rises to 9.5. Given that <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> is unable to explore when grown on plates buffered to pH 9.0, it appears that exploratory growth requires an adaptation phase, during the transition to alkaline conditions.</p><p>We have added a figure to the Supplementary Information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), showing the borate experiments, and discuss the observation that high pH alone cannot stimulate exploration (subsection “Exploration is glucose-repressible and pH-dependent”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>Is the cydCD mutant capable of inducing exploration in the WT in the VOC assay? This would speak to an important question: Does the cydCD mutant fail to respond to alkaline conditions or does it fail to make them?</italic> </p><p>We have conducted a series of experiments aimed at determining whether the <italic>cydCD</italic> mutant fails to respond to alkaline conditions or fails to generate an alkaline environment:</p><p>To address whether the <italic>cydCD</italic> mutant could respond to alkaline conditions, we used our two-compartment assay. Wild type <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> was inoculated beside <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> on YPD (exploration-promoting conditions), and the <italic>cydCD</italic> mutant was inoculated alone on YPD in the adjacent compartment (exploration deficient conditions, except when stimulated by an alkaline VOC). After ten days, we found the mutant strain was able to explore in response to VOCs produced by the wild type strain. We have now included these results as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, and describe this experiment in the first paragraph of the subsection “S. venezuelae exploratory cells use VOCs to induce exploration in other <italic>streptomycetes</italic> at a distance”. Additionally, we placed TMA solutions in a small plastic container in the centre of a YPD agar plate, and found exploration was induced in the <italic>cydCD</italic> strain, although exploration progressed more slowly than for the wild type strain (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21738.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21738.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21738.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21738-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p>Collectively, these experiments show that the <italic>cydCD</italic> mutant can explore in response to alkaline conditions.</p><p>To determine whether the <italic>cydCD</italic> mutant could produce an alkaline VOC, we set up a two-compartment assay with <italic>cydCD</italic> inoculated beside <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> on YPD, and wild type <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> alone in the adjacent YPD compartment. Consistent with our previous observations, the <italic>cydCD</italic> mutant beside yeast did not explore, and wild type <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> in the adjacent compartment was not induced to explore. This suggested that either the <italic>cydCD</italic> mutant did not produce an alkaline VOC, or it was not produced at sufficient levels under these conditions to influence the growth of the wild type strain in the adjacent compartment.</p><p><italic>The authors conclude that none of the bld mutants showed altered exploratory phenotypes. Is it really so? It looks like the bldN mutant did not spread as much as the WT. Did it later spread like the WT? Could the exploratory cells at least partially require bldN to achieve this exploratory morphology?</italic> </p><p>Although the <italic>bldN</italic> mutant did not spread as much as the wild type strain by day 14, it did eventually cover the entire surface of the agar plate in the same way as wild type. Similarly, when the <italic>bldN</italic> mutant strain demonstrated exploratory behavior on other media types – e.g.alone on YP – it did not spread as quickly as wild type, but did eventually colonize the entire agar surface. Thus <italic>bldN</italic> is not necessary for <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> exploratory growth; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that BldN regulon members may contribute to this process. We have now noted the slower spreading of the <italic>bldN</italic> mutant in our Results section (subsection “Physical association with yeast stimulates <italic>Streptomyces</italic> exploratory behaviour”, third paragraph), and address a possible role for BldN regulon members in facilitating rapid exploration in our Discussion (subsection “Ecological implications for exploratory growth within microbial communities”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>The study is somewhat vague regarding the origin of TMA. The authors indicate the lack of carnitine oxygenase able to convert L-carnitine into TMA. In many other organisms, TMA is produced upon biogenic reduction of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO). Does S. venezuelae possess TMAO reductase? If so, does S. venezualae medium contains TMAO? In addition, in absence of a TMA-producing mutant, it is not known whether TMA is the sole active molecule. For example, ammonia is shown to produce similar phenotypes. Can the authors exclude other molecules?</italic> </p><p>The regulation and expression of TMAO reductases have been studied in a number of genera, including <italic>Escherichia, Shewanella, Rhodobacter</italic>, and <italic>Vibrio</italic> (e.g.Dunn and Stabb, 2008, McCrindle et al., 2005). These bacteria typically have two or three TMAO reductase operons, including some combination of <italic>torSTRCAD</italic> (or <italic>torSTRCADE), torYZ, dmsABC</italic>, and <italic>ynfEFGH</italic>. TMAO reductases have not been studied in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> or other actinomycetes. We used BLAST to identify TMAO reductase homologs of all known TMAO reductase genes from other bacteria in <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>. We identified several genes in <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> that were homologous to genes in known TMAO reductase operons [specifically <italic>torA</italic> (top hit: <italic>SVEN_1326), dmsAB</italic> (top hit: <italic>SVEN_3040-3039),</italic> and <italic>ynfEFG</italic> (top hit: <italic>SVEN_3040, 3040 and 3039)</italic>]. We examined the expression of these genes using our RNA-seq data, and found that all of them (along with more divergent homologs) were expressed at extremely low levels. Furthermore, equivalent transcript levels for each gene were observed in both static and exploratory cultures. This suggests these gene products were unlikely to be involved in converting TMAO to TMA in <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>.</p><p>We agree entirely that the conversion of TMAO to TMA is an important means by which TMA can be produced, and we have added this point, and the information on <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> TMAO homologs to the manuscript (subsection “The VOC trimethylamine stimulates <italic>Streptomyces</italic> exploratory behaviour”, last paragraph).</p><p>At this stage, we do not have a TMA production mutant, as TMA production – either from quaternary amines or TMAO – is not well understood in bacteria, and has not been studied in the actinomycetes. While we acknowledge that without such a mutant, it is not possible to definitively conclude that TMA is the exploration-promoting compound, our results provide three strong lines of evidence in support of this proposal:</p><p>1) TMA was one of the most abundant molecules in our GC×GC-TOFMS exploratory cultures. It was also present in <italic>all</italic> explorer cultures, and was completely absent from static cultures. We did not identify any other compound that was absent from static cultures and was highly abundant in the majority of exploratory cultures. We also did not identify any other highly abundant compounds with the ability to raise the pH of growth medium.</p><p>2) Exploration is associated with an increase in pH to 9.5; TMA raises the pH of the medium to a near identical level.</p><p>3) Commercially available TMA could induce <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> exploration in a manner that was virtually indistinguishable from that of <italic>S. venezuelae</italic>+yeast, indicating that TMA on its own could induce exploratory growth.</p><p><italic>Elucidating the molecular and cellular basis of the exploratory lifestyle is not within the immediate scope of this paper but the process itself is very little discussed throughout the paper. Is motility involved? Or is it only growth and why in this case the exceptional spreading? The cells are mentioned to be hydrophilic, is the overall moisture of the colony increased? Is a surfactant involved? Leads into these questions could come from more analysis/description of the 48 mutants that were isolated. Also, why do the authors think that mutants that cannot spread in Glucose-deprived medium can still do so in the presence of yeast?</italic> </p><p>The exploratory phenotype appears to be most similar to sliding motility, where sliding motility is defined as a form of passive surface motility powered by growth and aided by a surfactant. We have preliminary evidence suggesting a surfactant is involved: the surface of the cells is hydrophilic (clarified now in subsection “Ecological implications for exploratory growth within microbial communities”, first paragraph), but underneath, the cells appear to secrete a hydrophobic/amphipathic substance. We have not yet been able to identify this compound, and we are hesitant to label exploration as sliding motility in the absence of surfactant characterization.</p><p>We isolated 45 mutants unable to spread on YP, but able to spread on YPD beside <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (along with three that failed to explore under either condition). This suggested to us that the two spreading processes may be genetically separable. Supporting this proposal (but not described in this manuscript), is our observation that a <italic>crp</italic> mutant has the reciprocal characteristics: it is unable to spread on YPD beside <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> but can explore when grown on YP medium. We have recently isolated a new mutant that fails to spread on both YPD with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and on YP, but is able to spread on a more traditional <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> medium MYM (maltose, yeast extract, malt extract) supplemented with peptone (a condition where wild type also explores). It therefore appears that there are diverse metabolic cues that are sensed in the lead-up to exploration (beyond simply glucose and pH), and it is likely that these mutants differ in their ability to sense/respond to these different nutritional conditions. We are currently working to tease apart the nutritional aspects in more detail, and to understand the genetic responses to these different media conditions.</p><p><italic>The work performed by Zdena Palková (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Zdena+Palkov%C3%A1++ammonia">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Zdena+Palková++ammonia</ext-link>) on how ammonia-dependent medium alkalization induce morphogenetic switch in yeast should at least be mentioned: it is after all the best studied alkaline volatile compounds triggering a morphogenetic switch.</italic> </p><p>We have now included the findings of Palková in our discussion on VOC-induced morphogenetic switches in bacteria (subsection “Volatile compounds promote communication and enhance competition”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>In the first paragraph of the subsection “The yeast TCA cycle must be intact to stimulate S. venezuelae exploratory behaviour” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: The text mentions nine genes affected in TCA cycle =&gt; the figure (diagram part of the figure) only shows eight of them.
