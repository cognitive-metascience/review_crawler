fertilization is an essential process for sexual reproduction. Despite its importance, only three proteins are known to be indispensable for sperm-egg membrane fusion: the sperm proteins IZUMO1 and SPACA6, and the egg protein JUNO. Here we demonstrate that another sperm protein, TMEM95, is necessary for sperm-egg interaction. TMEM95 ablation in mice caused complete male-specific infertility. Sperm lacking this protein were morphologically normal exhibited normal motility, and could penetrate the zona pellucida and bind to the oolemma. However, once bound to the oolemma, TMEM95-deficient sperm were unable to fuse with the egg membrane or penetrate into the ooplasm, and fertilization could only be achieved by mechanical injection of one sperm into the ooplasm, thereby bypassing membrane fusion. These data demonstrate that TMEM95 is essential for mammalian fertilization.</p></abstract><kwd-group

reproducing species, life begins with the fusion of two gametes during fertilization. Mammalian fertilization requires the sperm to pass through a glycoprotein coat that surrounds the egg, termed the zona pellucida, and once in the perivitelline space it must fuse its membrane with that of the egg to deliver the paternal genetic material into the ooplasm. Despite its importance in sexual reproduction, the molecular mechanisms behind the fusion of gamete membranes remain largely unknown. Currently, only three proteins have been demonstrated to be essential for sperm-egg membrane interaction: the sperm proteins IZUMO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>) and SPACA6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lorenzetti et al., 2014</xref>), and the egg protein JUNO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianchi et al., 2014</xref>). The ablation of another egg protein, CD9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaji et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le Naour et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miyado et al., 2000</xref>), also leads to a significant impairment in sperm-egg membrane fusion, but its ablation does not cause complete infertility. Similarly, very recently, the ablation of the sperm protein FIMP has been reported to cause severe subfertility due to gamete fusion defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fujihara et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>IZUMO1 was the first protein to be shown to be critical for gamete fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>). Sperm lacking IZUMO1 exhibit normal morphology and motility and are able to pass through the zona pellucida, but incapable of fusing their membrane with that of the egg. The search for the egg binding partner of IZUMO1 lasted almost a decade, until the protein JUNO was shown to be required for gamete membrane binding through direct interaction with IZUMO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianchi et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we demonstrate by gene editing in mice that besides these two proteins, another sperm protein, TMEM95, plays an essential role in fertilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TTMEM95 is a sperm protein dispensable for embryo development that relocalizes to the equatorial region after acrosomal reaction</title><p><italic>TMEM95</italic> coding region was located in a 1386 kb segment of extended homozygosity in 40 sub-fertile bulls identified in a Genome Wide Association Study carried out on the Fleckvieh breed population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pausch et al., 2014</xref>). Within this segment, containing 80 transcripts, a non-sense mutation in TMEM95 coding region that reduces protein length to 151 amino acids was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pausch et al., 2014</xref>).

The intercross of the heterozygous F1 generation resulted in normal litter sizes, and alleles segregated in a Mendelian distribution (20:43:26 for WT:Hz:KO), indicating that <italic>Tmem95</italic> haploinsufficiency did not impair reproductive performance and that <italic>Tmem95</italic> bi-allelic ablation did not result in embryonic developmental failure.</p><p>Further confirmation of gene ablation was achieved by Western blotting in 3 samples of WT and KO sperm.

The size of the band was compatible with TMEM95 predicted size and peptide sequencing identified TMEM95 protein on that band (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). IZUMO1 protein was expressed exclusively in testis and sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>) and at similar levels in WT and KO sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Immunocytochemistry also demonstrated the absence of TMEM95 protein in sperm obtained from KO males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In WT acrosome-intact sperm, TMEM95 protein was present in the acrosomal cap, in agreement with previous findings in cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandez-Fuertes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pausch et al., 2014</xref>). The specific localization of TMEM95 within the acrosomal cap could not be determined as paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixed sperm untreated with Triton-X100 displayed signals for the inner acrosomal markers PNA and IZUMO1, suggesting that acrosomal membrane was permeable to antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Following acrosome reaction, TMEM95 relocalized to the equatorial segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), the place where gamete membrane fusion occurs. To test the possibility that TMEM95 ablation may impair IZUMO1 translocation, we determined IZUMO1 translocation in acrosome-reacted WT and KO sperm, observing that IZUMO1 translocation also occurred in the absence of TMEM95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Details of peptides identified by MS/MS from 20 kDa gel band.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Protein name</th><th valign="top">Score</th><th valign="top">Spi %</th><th valign="top">Sequence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">TMEM95</td><td valign="top">5.33</td><td valign="top">68.8</td><td valign="top">LLLCIFGIVLLsGVVSLQ</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">TMEM95</td><td valign="top">5.17</td><td valign="top">59.8</td><td valign="top">LLLCIFGIVLLsGVVSLQ</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">TMEM95</td><td valign="top">4.12</td><td valign="top">46.1</td><td valign="top">LLSGVVSLQVEY</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">TMEM95</td><td valign="top">3.42</td><td valign="top">53</td><td valign="top">KTRYP</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Tmem95</italic>-deficient sperm cannot fuse with eggs</title><p><italic>Tmem95</italic> mutant males were healthy, grossly normal and exhibited normal mating behaviour evidenced by the presence of copulatory plugs in females.

In contrast, Hz males exhibited normal fertility, comparable to WT counterparts, indicating that haploinsufficiency had no effect on reproductive performance. To determine whether ejaculated sperm from <italic>Tmem95</italic>-null males were able to fertilize in vivo, we mated 4 WT, Hz or KO males with superovulated WT females and recovered the embryos 1.5 days after mating by oviductal flushing.

These results confirm that TMEM95-null sperm had undergone the acrosome reaction but failed to fuse with the egg membrane.

The number of sperm bound to the egg membrane did not differ between both groups, suggesting that TMEM95 is dispensable for sperm binding to the oolema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We also incubated zona-free eggs with two recombinant Cherry-tagged TMEM95 proteins, failing to detect TMEM95 binding to the egg membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>).

Despite the fact that multiple TMEM95-deficient sperm were bound to the oolema, none were stained by the dye stored in the eggs, confirming that sperm-egg membrane fusion does not occur in the absence of TMEM95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Subsequently, we tested whether gamete membrane fusion was the only process involved in the infertility of <italic>Tmem95-</italic>deficient male mice. TMEM95-null sperm were mechanically introduced inside the egg by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), thereby artificially bypassing gamete membrane fusion. Eggs injected with sperm obtained from KO or WT males cleaved and developed at similar rates irrespective of the male genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Heterozygous blastocysts obtained using KO sperm were transferred to pseudopregnant recipients, and the resulting pups were genotyped confirming that they were fathered by a <italic>Tmem95<sup>-/-</sup></italic> male.

Highlighting these difficulties, a recent article has reported that 30 genes that have a strong bias of expression in the testis are dispensable for reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2019</xref>). Also, on the sperm side, SPACA6 was found to play a role in sperm-egg membrane fusion based on the reproductive phenotype observed in BART97b mutant male mice. The random mutation harboured by these infertile males consists of a large insertion that introduced an 11 kb deletion disrupting <italic>Spaca6</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lorenzetti et al., 2014</xref>). During the revision of this manuscript, the essential role of SPACA6 on fertilization has been confirmed by targeted gene deletion by two independent groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbaux et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noda et al., 2020</xref>). The discovery of TMEM95, a novel sperm protein essential for gamete fusion highlights that IZUMO1-JUNO interaction alone is not sufficient to mediate this process and suggests that more complex molecular interactions are required. Interestingly, IZUMO1-JUNO alone are not able to mediate fusion, as their interaction appears to mediate sperm-egg adhesion, not acting as fusogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianchi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The lack of interaction between TMEM95 and JUNO was an unexpected outcome, as the predicted structure of TMEM95 contains an α-helix equivalent to that found in IZUMO1 domain and the β-hairpin secondary structure, which provides the main platform for JUNO binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ohto et al., 2016</xref>). However, the residues on TMEM95 predicted β-hairpin differ from those present at IZUMO1 at the physicochemical level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that they can be responsible for JUNO recognition. Indeed, Trp-mediated interactions described for IZUMO1-JUNO binding ensure the conserved binding mode, but variable regions in the interface have been suggested to determine species-specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bianchi and Wright, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ohto et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that the structural domains shared by TMEM95 and IZUMO1 constitute a common feature of sperm proteins involved in fertilization, serving as mediators of protein-to-protein interactions. Another possibility would be that TMEM95 plays an architectural role on the sperm membrane similar to CD9. The mechanism by which the egg membrane protein CD9 intervenes in membrane fusion is not yet understood, with most evidence suggesting that it plays an architectural role that does not require a binding partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalbi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jégou et al., 2011</xref>). However, in contrast to CD9 ablation, which only causes complete infertility when combined with CD81 deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rubinstein et al., 2006</xref>), TMEM95 ablation alone completely blocks gamete fusion and thus, subsequent sperm entry into the ooplasm without generating any obvious structural defect in the sperm, thereby suggesting that TMEM95 may not play a major architectural role.</p><p>The role of TMEM95 in post-binding events may require one or several binding partners as, alone, it is unable to promote cell fusion following IZUMO1-JUNO binding in HEK293T cells. The residues located at TMEM95 predicted β-hairpin differing from those present in IZUMO1 β-hairpin could mediate affinity to other sperm or oocyte protein/s required for post-binding events. Given that the AVEXIS assay is performed exclusively using the extracellular domains of cell surface proteins, it is also possible that IZUMO1 and TMEM95 might interact via their transmembrane domains following IZUMO1-JUNO binding. While our manuscript was undergoing review, another article confirming our results on the essential role of TMEM95 in fertilization was submitted and published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noda et al., 2020</xref>). This article uncovered the essential role of a sperm protein termed SOF1 on mammalian fertilization, suggesting that TMEM95, SPACA6 and SOF1 may function cooperatively with IZUMO1. However, the nature of this cooperation remains unclear, as the ablation of any of these three genes does not affect the amount and localization of IZUMO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbaux et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noda et al., 2020</xref> and our results). Besides, whereas co-immunoprecipitation analysis performed on cells overexpressing TMEM95, SPACA6, SOF1 and FIMP suggested interaction of these proteins with IZUMO1, this interaction could not be confirmed on testis lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noda et al., 2020</xref>), and we failed to detect any IZUMO1:TMEM95 interaction on a high avidity binding assay capable of detecting subtle protein interactions.

Finally, the plasmid encoding <italic>Juno</italic> was transfected in the GFP<sub>1-7</sub> cell line and <italic>Izumo1</italic>-encoding plasmid was transfected in the GFP<sub>8-11</sub> cell line. Establishment of stable clones was obtained by selection with 10 µg/ml puromycin and single cell sorting. The expression of JUNO and IZUMO1 was assessed by staining with IZUMO1 and JUNO soluble recombinant pentamers, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianchi et al., 2014</xref>). Cells were incubated with the pentameric probes (preys) for 30 min at 37°C, fixed in 4% PFA and stained with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody Cy3 conjugated (A9594, clone M2, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hr at room temperature. Finally, cells were transferred to a microscope glass in Slowfade Gold mountant with DAPI (S36938 ThermoFisher Scientific) and images were acquired with the Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>IZUMO1 antibody was a generous gift by Dr Masahito Ikawa (Osaka University, Japan).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Polina V Lishko as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While the goal is to provide the essential revision requirements as a single set of instructions, in this particular case we will provide a complete set of the reviews, so you can address all concerns as it is essential for the revision that is necessary for us to publish your work.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Lamas-Toranzo et al., reports an important discovery: the identification of the protein required for sperm and egg fusion, TMEM95. Spermatozoa deficient in TMEM95 lacks sperm-egg recognition/fusion abilities much similar to IZUMO1-disrupted spermatozoa, and its requirement in the process is documented in this manuscript. However, the paper lacks detailed evidence regarding exactly how TMEM95 contributes to the process. Additionally, one of the major claims in the manuscript (absence of interaction between TMEM95 and other sperm/egg binding proteins) is not supported by the data. These data are omitted from the manuscript. Overall, given murine genetics and IVF experiments presented in this manuscript, as well as previously reported data regarding the importance of TMEM95 for bovine fertility and human genetics, TMEM95 could emerge is an important sperm surface receptor required for fertilization. Therefore, the significance of this research is exceptionally high, not only for the basic science and reproductive biology but also for translational applications, such as fertility diagnostics and contraception research.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raise a number of concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted. Some of the required revisions will likely require further experimentation within the framework of the presented studies and techniques.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>1) Experiments showing that TMEM95 recombinant protein acquires appropriate physiological activity and retains the ability to bind to the zona-free egg surface directly must be performed.</p><p>2) Immunoprecipitation experiments with sperm lysates using anti-IZUMO1 and/or anti-TMEM95 antibodies need to be shown.</p><p>3) While it was shown that TMEM95-disrupted spermatozoa express an IZUMO1 protein, it is unclear whether IZUMO1-disrupted sperm still possess a TMEM95 protein.</p><p>4) Additional characterization of TMEM95 expression in testes, epididymis, accessory glands etc on the protein level), as well as the tissue specificity should be performed.</p><p>5) The authors should carry out the localization studies in permeabilized and non-permeabilized intact WT sperm in order to detect in which exact cellular compartment TMEM95 is found.</p><p>6) The analysis of the number of sperm that bind to the egg surface should be performed.</p><p>7) As suggested all experiments must be performed with positive controls that confirm that the technique employed. Data not shown is not permitted.</p><p>8) Many parts of the manuscript (Abstract, Title, Results and Discussion, as well as terminology used: &quot;egg&quot; vs &quot;oocyte&quot;) need to be rewritten and clarified as suggested by reviewers. Overall, the manuscript would benefit from thorough language editing, as well as additional data and experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Lamas-Toranzo et al., reports an important discovery: the identification of the protein required for sperm and egg fusion, TMEM95. The data provided are of good quality, and in vitro fertilization, experiments are very convincing. However, one of the major claims in the manuscript (absence of interaction between TMEM95 and other sperm/egg binding proteins) is not supported by the data. These data were either accidentally omitted from the manuscript or were not intended to be shown. Overall, given murine genetics and IVF experiments presented in this manuscript, as well as previously reported data regarding the importance of TMEM95 for bovine fertility and human genetic data, this reviewer has confidence that TMEM95 is an important sperm surface receptor required for fertilization. Therefore, the significance of this research is exceptionally high, not only for the basic science and reproductive biology but also for translational applications, such as fertility diagnostics and contraception research. However, the manuscript is less polished in regards to its writing style, the data representation, and overall would benefit from thorough language editing.</p><p>1) The first paragraph of the Introduction and throughout the text. Sperm usually do not fertilize an oocyte, they fertilize an egg or ovum. An oocyte is an immature female gamete still inside the follicle (for mammals), once it ovulates, it becomes the egg/ovum. Hence, terminology, such as &quot;sperm-oocyte fusion&quot; is technically incorrect and confusing, and should be replaced with sperm-egg fusion, including in the title.</p><p>2) Introduction: the last paragraph describing bovine genetics seems to be out of place. The authors first describe gene-editing in mice, and immediately jump to bovine genetics- it is hard to follow why such a transition was made.</p><p>3) Figure 1D: the entire western blot for TMEM95 should be shown to evaluate the specificity of the antibody used in the study.</p><p>4) Figure 3. The authors claim that the pull-down assay was performed to explore whether TMEM95 interacts with either IZUMO or Juno. However, the only experimental data that are actually shown is either heterologous expression of TMEM and its truncated form in CHO cells or the pull-down assays probed with anti-TMEM antibody.

The authors first suggest that TMEM95 may not require an oocyte partner. Then, they propose TMEM95 may have affinity to a yet undescribed receptor and then, based on the fact that TMEM95 acts independently from JUNO and IZUMO1 (which is not really demnstarted), they propose that TMEM95 may play an essential role rather than by single protein-to-protein interactions. The authors should more clearly conclude whether their observations support that TMEM95 participates in the first stage of gamete fusion (i.e sperm-egg binding) through a ligand-receptor mechanism or whether the protein could be acting as a fusogenic molecule capable of being intercalated into the egg lipid bilayer.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;ITMEM95 is a sperm protein essential for mammalian fertilization&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Moreover, the studies were performed in collaboration with the researchers that reported the identification of Juno who are now co-authors of the paper. In contrast to the previous immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments, this new study clearly shows that TMEM95 interacts neither with IZUMO1 nor with Juno, representing a key incorporation to the paper.</p><p>To investigate the mechanisms underlying TMEM95 involvement in gamete fusion i.e whether the protein participates in the first stage of sperm binding to the oolemma or in the subsequent stage of membrane fusion itself, the authors 1) carried out an in vitro assay to evaluate the ability of TMEM95 mutant sperm to interact with the egg plasma membrane observing no differences with the controls, 2) analyzed the ability of TMEM95 to interact with the surface of zona-free eggs, detecting no binding of the protein to the egg, and 3) performed transfection studies to analyze the ability of TMEM95 to promote membrane fusion, observing no detectable fusion events in the analyzed cells. According to these observations, the authors concluded that TMEM95 does not participate in sperm-egg binding neither is a fusogenic protein and proposed that the protein must be involved in a post sperm-egg binding event previous to membrane fusion, as reported for IZUMO.</p><p>These studies have certainly fully answered the two main concerns of this reviewer supporting the publication of the manuscript in the journal. Nevertheless, there are some aspects that the authors should take into consideration in order to improve the quality of the manuscript.</p><p>– The authors indicated that the exact localization of the protein (internal or external) could not be analyzed because the employed fixation itself produced a permeabilization of the cells. Whereas this is true for many fixation conditions, the authors should consider carrying out immunolocalization studies in live, non-fixed sperm in suspension. This is an easy approach that will allow the authors to define the protein localization in the cell. This is not a minor point as it is known that the localization of a molecule provides important information regarding the mechanisms underlying its functional role, an issue still not fully resolved for TMEM95. In this regard, the author's claim that TMEM95 likely localizes to the acrosomal membrane because both it relocalizes to the equatorial segment after the acrosome reaction and it has a TM domain are not correct as plasma membrane proteins with or without TM domains do so as well.</p><p>– Whereas the authors have carried out the tissue expression and specificity studies requested by this reviewer, I could not find the description of the results obtained within the text but just in the figure. This should be corrected.</p><p>– I would remove the first section within Results entitled &quot;TMEM95 protein in silico folding suggests a role in gamete fusion&quot; as it describes just an in silico analysis that does not really provide any new information compared to the bull protein and does not deceives an independent paragraph. I would join the results of this paragraph that describes just Figure 1A with the results of the following paragraph describing the rest of Figure 1. The authors may need to change the title of that second paragraph too.</p><p>– The authors indicated that the lack of TMEM95 interaction with IZUMO together with the normal relocalization of IZUMO1 in TMEM95 KO sperm makes it unlikely that IZUMO1 KO would lead to the ablation of TMEM95 and that performing that experiment would delay the publication of these findings. In this regard, I think the authors could contemplate the possibility of sending their anti-TMEM95 antibody to Dr Ikawa who could perform this easy localization study in his lab. Of note in this regard, the authors already have contact with Dr Ikawa's lab which has provided the anti-IZUMO antibody to them.</p><p>– In my opinion, there are several observations which are not sufficiently discussed. The authors may speculate about several issues such as the finding that TMEM95 and IZUMO are both necessary but not sufficient for gamete fusion, how the protein reaches the equatorial segment, potential ways to identify TMEM95 partners, whether TMEM95 is present or not in IZUMO KO cells, among others, which will certainly enrich the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53913.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raise a number of concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted.

Therefore, there is no solid rationale to believe that IZUMO1 disruption would lead to TMEM95 disruption.

Previous experiments showed that TMEM95 was present in the equatorial segment of acrosome reacted sperm, and in the acrosomal cap of acrosome intact sperm, as the TMEM95 signal co-localized with PNA (Figure 1E-F). We have now performed IHC in WT sperm following permeabilizing and non-permeabilizing conditions as requested, observing TMEM95, IZUMO1 (acrosome membrane marker, Inoue et al., 2012) and PNA (internal acrosomal marker, Lybaert et al., 2009 Histol. Histopathol.) signals in both conditions (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A). This result indicates that fixation did not prevent antibody access into the acrosome in the absence of permeabilization (i.e., exposure to Triton X-100) during the whole IHC procedure. Further attempts to “seal” sperm and acrosome membranes, including increasing fixation time in 4 % PFA to 30 min at 4 ºC (following the protocol of Nishimura et al., 2011), were also unsuccessful: both IZUMO1 and PNA signals were clearly visible. These results suggest that signal detection following IHC in non-permeabilizing conditions may not be a solid criteria to exclude acrosomal localization. In agreement, whereas absence of IHC signal following non-permeabilizing conditions proved the intracellular localization of a protein in sperm, the opposite (i.e., IHC signal in non-permeabilizing conditions proving external membrane localization) is not conclusive: PNA, which specifically bounds to the acrosomal content, was also detected following non-permeabilizing conditions (Nishimura et al., 2011). We do not have solid evidence to claim that TMEM95 localizes to the acrosomal membrane, albeit that may be a likely location given 1) its co-localization with PNA and IZUMO1 on intact sperm, 2) its relocalization following acrosome reaction and 3) the presence of a transmembrane domain.

Given the absence of interaction we hypothesized that TMEM95 may be required to induce fusion following IZUMO1 and JUNO interaction. To test this possibility we have performed a GFP-complementation cell fusion assay in HEK293T cells observing that TMEM95 expression did not induce fusion on cells expressing JUNO and IZUMO (Figure 3D).

Then, they propose TMEM95 may have affinity to a yet undescribed receptor and then, based on the fact that TMEM95 acts independently from JUNO and IZUMO1 (which is not really demnstarted), they propose that TMEM95 may play an essential role rather than by single protein-to-protein interactions. The authors should more clearly conclude whether their observations support that TMEM95 participates in the first stage of gamete fusion (i.e sperm-egg binding) through a ligand-receptor mechanism or whether the protein could be acting as a fusogenic molecule capable of being intercalated into the egg lipid bilayer.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide solid evidence regarding the independence of TMEM95 from the JUNO-IZUMO1 interaction (Figure 3A). As TMEM95 ablation did not disrupt sperm binding (Figure 2F), TMEM95 must be involved in post-binding events required for fertilization. To test a possible role of TMEM95 as a cell fusion promoter, we have performed a fusion assay with cells expressing TMEM95 in the presence of JUNO and IZUMO1. We have not observed cell fusion, suggesting that either TMEM95 is not involved in fusion or that, being involved, it requires the intervention of other yet unknown proteins.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been significantly improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. We understand that due to the current pandemic situation additional experiments might not be feasible, therefore, we ask authors to focus on the textual revisions as suggested by reviewers. Here we provide a full review as it contains many suggestions authors might find helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and editors for their positive comments and appreciate the transparent reviewing process that distinguishes <italic>eLife</italic>. We have modified the article to fulfil the requests and have included a very recent article published in PNAS this week (Noda et al., 2020) which reports some aspects of the TMEM95 KO phenotype. We would like to stress that we were unaware of this article during the preparation, submission and revision of our current submitted article. As you will see, Our article was submitted to <italic>eLife</italic> one month earlier than the Noda paper was submitted to PNAS, and 5 months earlier it was submitted to PNAS, where it was editorially rejected (not sent for review) as the finding of an essential protein for gamete fusion was “not considered to have the broad appeal” required for that journal. We honestly thank <italic>eLife</italic> for the opportunity of publishing our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I am almost satisfied with the modifications provided by the authors, however, I still remain some concerns before publication in eLife.</p><p>1) The authors should mention SPACA6 as a gamete fusion related factor not only in Discussion but also in Abstract and Introduction, because I think SPACA6 is an unneglectable factor for this process (Barbaux et al., 2020).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. We have added Barbaux et al., 2020 and Noda et al., 2020, both of which were published during the second revision of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, there is no positive control (e.g. IZUMO1) in this system.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not using IZUMO1 as positive control for binding. The oocytes used for this study were processed as those used for sperm binding assays, proving that the procedure used (both timing after hCG injection and zona removal) did not impair sperm binding ability to the oolema.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I recommend a rat anti-mouse IZUMO1 monoclonal antibody clone 125 (abcam, ab211626 or BioAcademia, 73-045 or anticorps-eligne, ABIN2452040) for detection in western blotting instead of polyclonal antibody because of high reliability.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>These studies have certainly fully answered the two main concerns of this reviewer supporting the publication of the manuscript in the journal. Nevertheless, there are some aspects that the authors should take into consideration in order to improve the quality of the manuscript.</p><p>– The authors indicated that the exact localization of the protein (internal or external) could not be analyzed because the employed fixation itself produced a permeabilization of the cells. Whereas this is true for many fixation conditions, the authors should consider carrying out immunolocalization studies in live, non-fixed sperm in suspension. This is an easy approach that will allow the authors to define the protein localization in the cell. This is not a minor point as it is known that the localization of a molecule provides important information regarding the mechanisms underlying its functional role, an issue still not fully resolved for TMEM95. In this regard, the author's claim that TMEM95 likely localizes to the acrosomal membrane because both it relocalizes to the equatorial segment after the acrosome reaction and it has a TM domain are not correct as plasma membrane proteins with or without TM domains do so as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s concerns about TMEM95 localization, but regretfully we cannot provide more solid evidence regarding the precise localization within the acrosomal cap. Unfortunately, immunolocalization in live sperm is not an option: as TMEM95 antibody required overnight incubation, sperm would die during the incubation time in antibody solution and their membranes would become permeable. We acknowledged that TMEM95 localization within the acrosomal cap is not fully resolved and consequently we did not claim that Tmem95 localizes to the acrosomal membrane in both the previously revised version and this latest version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Whereas the authors have carried out the tissue expression and specificity studies requested by this reviewer, I could not find the description of the results obtained within the text but just in the figure. This should be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included it in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I would remove the first section within Results entitled &quot;TMEM95 protein in silico folding suggests a role in gamete fusion&quot; as it describes just an in silico analysis that does not really provide any new information compared to the bull protein and does not deceives an independent paragraph. I would join the results of this paragraph that describes just Figure 1A with the results of the following paragraph describing the rest of Figure 1. The authors may need to change the title of that second paragraph too.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now joined both sections as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors indicated that the lack of TMEM95 interaction with IZUMO together with the normal relocalization of IZUMO1 in TMEM95 KO sperm makes it unlikely that IZUMO1 KO would lead to the ablation of TMEM95 and that performing that experiment would delay the publication of these findings. In this regard, I think the authors could contemplate the possibility of sending their anti-TMEM95 antibody to Dr Ikawa who could perform this easy localization study in his lab. Of note in this regard, the authors already have contact with Dr Ikawa's lab which has provided the anti-IZUMO antibody to them.</p></disp-quote><p>During this second revision of this manuscript, Ikawa´s group has published an article reporting roles of TMEM95, SPACA6 and SOF1 in fertilization (Noda et al., 2020). In that article they found that the relocalization of IZUMO1 was not impaired by the ablation of any of these three genes (in agreement with our results and Barbaux et al., 2020). Unfortunately, they did not test the opposite (i.e., whether IZUMO1 ablation impaired the other proteins), as sperm localization was only shown for SPACA6 and this analysis was not performed in <italic>Izumo1</italic> KO sperm. As the antibody we used in this article is commercially available, we believe that they will be able to perform this experiment in subsequent publications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In my opinion, there are several observations which are not sufficiently discussed. The authors may speculate about several issues such as the finding that TMEM95 and IZUMO are both necessary but not sufficient for gamete fusion, how the protein reaches the equatorial segment, potential ways to identify TMEM95 partners, whether TMEM95 is present or not in IZUMO KO cells, among others, which will certainly enrich the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now extended the Discussion while avoiding to be too speculative. For instance, we cannot say much about TMEM95 relocalization, as the precise location within the acrosomal cap could not be determined.</p></body></sub-article></article>
