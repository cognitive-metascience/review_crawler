neurocircuit activation causes particular behaviors requires modulating the activity of specific neurons. Here, we demonstrate that magnetothermal genetic stimulation provides tetherless deep brain activation sufficient to evoke motor behavior in awake mice. The approach uses alternating magnetic fields to heat superparamagnetic nanoparticles on the neuronal membrane. Neurons, heat-sensitized by expressing TRPV1 are activated with magnetic field application. Magnetothermal genetic stimulation in the motor cortex evoked ambulation, deep brain stimulation in the striatum caused rotation around the body-axis, and stimulation near the ridge between ventral and dorsal striatum caused freezing-of-gait. The duration of the behavior correlated tightly with field application. This approach provides genetically and spatially targetable, repeatable and temporarily precise activation of deep-brain circuits without the need for surgical implantation of any device.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>magneto thermal</kwd><kwd>neurostimulation</kwd><kwd>TRPV1</kwd><kwd>magnetogenetic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01MH094730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pralle</surname><given-names>Arnd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGP0052/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pralle</surname><given-names>Arnd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01MH111872</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pralle</surname><given-names>Arnd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Magnetothermal neuromodulation providing quick, tetherless, precise on and off switching of neurons deep in the brain of freely moving animals is orthogonal to optogenetics and a breakthrough in remote modulation techniques.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Identifying neural circuitry controlling specific behaviors requires the ability to communicate with specific neurons in the brains of awake, freely moving animals. The most established interface is electrodes implanted in the brain. They provide rapid neuronal stimulation and recording, however, at the cost of being invasive and with limited spatial and cell type targeting. Optogenetics, visible light-based stimulation of neurons genetically engineered to express light-gated channels and ion pumps, provides genetic targeting of specific cell types in combination with rapid stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banghart et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyden et al., 2005</xref>). The method quickly gained popularity and has been used in various animal models to study brain circuits associated with Parkinson’s Disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gradinaru et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>), addictive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stefanik et al., 2013</xref>), depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nieh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>) and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tye et al., 2011</xref>). However, optogenetics requires permanent brain implants to guide the light into the brain, and typically, an optical fiber, tethering the animal to the light source. A third approach, pharmacological neuromodulation using Designer GPCRs Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), provides a tetherless alternative to optogenetics, but generates a much slower response, ranging from tens of minutes to hours, as the drug must diffuse to the location of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Urban and Roth, 2015</xref>). The ideal experimental approach to deep brain stimulation would combine minimal invasiveness - to avoid perturbing the behavior, sufficient speed - to permit real-time response, and cell-specific targeting.</p><p>Magnetic-field-based stimulation has considerable potential to provide fast, tetherless, and implant-free deep brain stimulation because magnetic fields are minimally scattered, minimally absorbed by tissue, and travel freely through space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Walsh and Cowey, 2000</xref>). These characteristics of magnetothermal stimulation simplifies a range of experimental assays, which are challenging to perform using current techniques, and permit new types of experiments: The absence of tethers will permit novel social behavioral assays in a group of animals freely interacting in an arena, while only a subgroup of them gets stimulated. As magnetic stimulation only occurs when the animal resides within the magnetic field, the field geometry can be adapted to coincide with another signal for conditional place preference or feeding assays. Similarly, magnetically stimulating multiple sites in one brain to study network connectivity requires only multiple injections of solutions, possibly along a shared injection path, as opposed to multiple cannula implantations. Furthermore, the absence of any physical connection from brain to skull minimizes tissue damage and immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Lastly, assays using animals easily startled by the flashes of visible light used in optogenetics, such as Zebrafish, would benefit from magnetic stimulation. Therefore, a reliable magnetic field stimulation method would not only simplify experiments, currently performed using existing techniques, but enable a series of novel assays.</p><p>The challenge in implementing magnetic stimulation has been to develop a transducer capable of harnessing the energy of the magnetic field and translating it into a robust biological signal with high temporal and spatial specificity. Magnetic fields only interact with magnetic dipoles. The overall magnetic dipole of a particle is caused by the particle’s intrinsic magnetic moment, which results from the orientation of a large number of spins of the ions making up the nanoparticle. The spins in a ferromagnet interact strongly, causing their parallel alignment to persist over time, and creating a permanent magnetic moment. In ferromagnetic particles, the magnetic moment is fixed to the particle crystal structure, causing a net magnetic dipole of the particle, which interacts strongly with external magnetic fields. However, the permanent dipoles of individual particles interact also in absence of an external field, causing aggregation of particles, rendering them unsuitable for neurostimulation.</p><p>In very small particles made from materials that are ferromagnetic in bulk, the spins interact, but at room temperature the direction of their magnetic moment relative to the particle fluctuates rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown, 1963</xref>). After an external magnetic field aligns the moments, this alignment persists for a brief moment of time to permit the interaction. Such particles are called superparamagnetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bean and Livingston, 1959</xref>). They are the preferred transducers for magnetic biostimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xu and Sun, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pankhurst et al., 2009</xref>). Superparamagnetic particles can been used as a transducer of magnetic field energy exploiting two different mechanisms: In a strong external DC field, the induced magnetic dipoles in neighboring NPs interact sufficiently strongly to aggregate the NPs and a field gradient exerts a small force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mannix et al., 2008</xref>). Alternatively, our group showed that applying an alternating magnetic field (AMF) to superparamagnetic nanoparticles may be used to locally generate heat, which then actives nearby temperature-sensitive TRPV1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). This later approach, when used to stimulate TRPV1<sup>+</sup> neurons, is referred to as ‘magnetothermal genetics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stanley et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Activating a channel requires overcoming an energy barrier slightly larger than the thermal fluctuation energy (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>21</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mi>J</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>at 37°C, with Boltzmann constant <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>).

However, for horse ferritin the magnetic dipole at 0.1 T per particle is so weak that the dipole interaction energy is a lot smaller than the thermal energy even if the ferritin molecules were touching each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">García-Prieto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2015a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>In magnetothermal stimulation, the transducer converts the energy of the external alternating magnetic field into heat.

The synthesized nanoparticles used in this study, heat by 450 W/g at 500 kHz and 15 kA/m, while horse ferritin does not heat in the same AMF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Even if increasing the frequency driving ferritin to 50 MHz and 0.15 kA/m horse ferritin heats less than 1 W/g. In this comparison, the product <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is left constant, as it is a measure for background effects in tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atkinson et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, transducers coupling either via dipole-dipole or magnetothermal mechanism, deliver sufficient energy if using consisting of synthesized superparamagnetic NPs. This is in contrast to the unclear physics of ferritin-based magnetogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meister, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stanley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wheeler et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In magnetothermal genetic stimulation, the heat needs to be delivered to the TRPV1 channel efficiently, avoiding excess heat loss to the surrounding buffer fluid. Classically, magnetic nanoparticle-based hyperthermia heating uses a dense suspension of nanoparticles, a ferrofluid, in which the neighboring MNPs screen the cooling. An isolated MNP delivers only a few femtowatts of heat, which dissipates rapidly into the volume of water. In a two-dimensional dense array of MNPs on the membrane, the neighboring MNPs screen the lateral cooling, leaving only the direction normal to the membrane for heat dissipation. Membrane-bound MNPs deliver sufficient power to raise the temperature in a thin sheet along the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we aimed to use AMF heating of membrane-targeted MNP to evoke behavior in awake animals.</p><p>Here, we report the first robust and repeated magnetothermal genetic activation of motor behavior in awake, freely moving mice using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), attached to the plasma membrane of temperature-sensitized TRPV1<sup>+</sup> neurons, deep inside the brain. We demonstrate successful magnetothermal activation of three separate brain regions, motor cortex, dorsal striatum and the ridge between dorsal and ventral striatum. All three have been previously activated either optogenetically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gradinaru et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>) or chemogenetically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenkiel et al., 2008</xref>). We observed the same behavioral responses as had been reported resulting from optogenetic or chemogenetic neurostimulation in those areas. We were able to achieve successful neurostimulation in vivo without raising the overall tissue temperature by binding MNPs to the neuronal membrane. This magnetothermal method does not require any fixed implants or tethers, thereby permitting repeatable stimulation with real-time response monitoring and recording in awake freely moving mice capabilities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Principles of magnetothermal genetic neurostimulation</title><p>To achieve fast and robust neuronal stimulation in awake, freely behaving mice, we depolarized heat-sensitized (TRPV1<sup>+</sup>) neurons via magnetic-field-induced heating of superparamagnetic MNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,F</xref>).

Conversely, when the MNPs were bound to the cell membrane, only the membrane, and not the bath, was heated by several degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). After removing the AMF, the membrane temperature returned to the initial value within a few seconds. Hence, using membrane-bound MNPs provides a temporal precision of few seconds for terminating the magnetothermal neurostimulation.</p><p>The rates of temperature increase depend on the concentration of MNPs. For various volume concentrations of MNPs we measured rates from 0.1 to 0.5°C/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

We aimed to reproduce these responses, using magnetothermal stimulation of motor cortex neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). While some expression of TRPV1 in the rodent brain has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basbaum et al., 2009</xref>), robust magnetothermal genetic stimulation requires uniform, sustained over-expression of TRPV1 in the targeted neurons. We achieved TRPV1 overexpression in the mouse motor cortex by delivering adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) as a vehicle for the TRPV1 transgene under the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter hSyn (AAV5-hSyn-TRPV1) by stereotactic injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kügler et al., 2003</xref>). However, AAV is too small to package a vector, encoding TRPV1 and a fluorescent protein marker. Hence, for some experiments, we also created a lentivirus carrying the genes for TRPV1 and a red fluorescent protein with nuclear targeting sequence behind an internal ribosome entry site (EF1a-TRPV1-IRES-DSRed). Both, AAV5 and lentivirus, led to robust expression in vivo, permitting stimulation of specific behavior.</p><p>Motor cortex neurons were heat sensitized, by unilaterally injecting AAV5-hSyn-TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carvalho-de-Souza et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lein et al., 2007</xref>).

Repeated sessions on the same mice demonstrate that the sensitization persists over several days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). There is a tight temporal correlation between AMF heating and the observed behavior: Each time, shortly after the AMF is applied, the mouse begins to run. The stimulated ambulation persists throughout the duration of the field application and ends shortly after the AMF is removed. For an AMF strength of 7.5 kA/m rms at 570 kHz, the behavioral response began 22.8 ± 2.6 s (n = 14, 6 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) after the beginning of the AMF. This latency of behavior onset is consistent with the fast in vitro response, because heating depends on the square of the AMF strength, which for the in vivo case was about one third of that in in vitro experiments. Performing AMF heating on MNP decorated HEK cells showed that lowering the field strength by a third increased the required time to reach a two-degree increase to 20 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The delay is comparable to optogenetic stimulations in the motor cortex, also using virus delivered activator genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Airan et al., 2009</xref>). After the AMF is terminated, the ambulation behavior continued for 14.7 ± 2.5 s, likely the time required to cool the membrane-bound MNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Using membrane-bound nanoparticles for magnetothermal neuro-stimulation ensures fast on and off kinetics because only a miniscule volume of space is heated and cooled.</p><p>Mice injected with only AAV5-hSyn-TRPV1 virus or only MNPs showed no response to AMF application (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref> respectively) demonstrating that neither MNP injection nor TRPV1 expression alone is sufficient to evoke the response. Observable stimulation occurred only when AMF was applied in the presence of the temperature-gated ion channel, TRPV1, and the energy transducing MNPs in the same brain locations. For animals lacking either TRPV1 overexpression or MNP, AMF application caused no significant deviation from baseline rotation speedEquation (four individual mice for each, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). On the other hand, in all mice injected with both MNP and TRPV1 at the same brain location, angular speed increased significantly with AMF, 3.17 ± 0.17 rev/min compared to the baseline speed of 0.42 ± 0.07 rev/min (n = 10, p=1.1·10<sup>−5</sup>; unpaired T-test; 95% C.I.

Three different circuits and behaviors have been stimulated magnetothermally and compared to prior opto- or chemogenetic stimulation of the same circuits: running, in response to motor cortex stimulation (prior optogenetic work: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gradinaru et al., 2009</xref>]); rotation around the body axis, after stimulation deep in the striatum (prior chemogenetic work: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenkiel et al., 2008</xref>); and freezing of gait, in response to stimulation on ridge between dorsal and ventral striatum (prior optogenetic work: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>]). We successfully evoked opposing behaviors, running or freezing of gait by targeting the dorsal striatum or the ridge between the dorsal and ventral striatum, respectively, locations in the brain only 1 mm apart. This clearly demonstrates that the evoked behavior is the result of stimulating a specific neuronal circuit, and that the heat generated by the MNPs in response to the AMF is sufficiently localized to the neurons targeted.</p><p>Magnetothermal genetic stimulation leads rapidly to the targeted motor behavior, observable within 15–20 s of AMF activation. This brief delay is not an intrinsic limit of the technique, but rather the result of a weak average field at the site of the mouse head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). As the heating rate is proportional to the square of magnetic field strength, the threefold weaker field caused approximately nine times longer latency in the mouse than observed in the in vitro studies. It is technically feasible to generate AMFs large enough to reduce the latency for magnetothermal stimulation of behavior in mice to times only marginally slower than electrophysiological or optogenetic stimulation, and significantly faster than chemical stimulation using DREADDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>). Likewise, our results show that the evoked locomotor behavior diminished quickly within 15 s after removal of the field. Tight temporal on- and off-control is vital for precise correlation of circuit stimulation with behavioral observation, and thus far had only been achieved using optogenetics, but not magneto- or chemogenetics.</p><p>The short on- and off-time delays of magnetothermal genetic stimulation permit multiple simulations in short observation times. In our experiments, three to four one-minute stimulations were possible within a 10–15 min experiment. Such repeatability is crucial for obtaining statistically significant behavioral data. Other temporal profiles of stimulation are easily achieved, permitting studies of memory formation, or with variations in the assay. Most importantly, stimulation from several seconds to many minutes are easily achievable, filling an important gap between faster optogenetics and slower chemogenetics.</p><p>In this study, MNPs were bound via the A2B5 antibody, which indiscriminately recognizes all glycosylated membrane proteins. It yielded the highest nanoparticle density on the cell surface and accordingly, achieved the most rapid heating. However, we also successfully used anti-CD56 (Thy-1), anti-CD90 (NCAM) for endogenous membrane proteins, as well as anti-GFP to target overexpressing GFP-labeled membrane proteins. Magnetothermal genetics in tandem with membrane-bound nanoparticles provides three major benefits: First, it provides improved localization and neuron-specific targeting. The stimulation region is spatially better confined as the antibody binding limits the distance that the MNP diffuse into the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Also, only cell types with the specific membrane receptor targeted by the antibody bind the nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). Second, the heating is restricted to the vicinity of the membrane. This enables orthogonal targeting in which the TRPV1 channel is expressed in one specific cell type and the MNPs are targeted to a second cell type, and magnetothermal stimulation would only occur at their synapse. Third, membrane targeting provides improved temporal resolution because only a minuscule volume near the membrane is heated which cools off immediately after the AMF is removed. This also delivers less overall heat to the brain. Lastly, we obtained robust activation with as little as 500 ng of nanoparticles, which is 200-fold lower than the volume of nanoparticle suspension for of brain neuron stimulation in anesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>One concern for magnetothermal stimulation may be that the MNPs either directly or via the membrane heating induce cell death. We successfully repeated stimulation of the same animals for seven to eight trials over a few days without observing any change in normal or evoked behavior. Also, histology of brains after 20 one-min AMF applications, spread over three sessions during a 24 hr period, showed intact MNP decorated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>). Hence, if there is any damage, it is undetectable in histology and behavior. Thermal damage can be avoided by choosing the field strength to be sufficiently small so that the cooling to the environment limits the possible temperature rise to a few degrees.</p><p>As magnetothermal genetic stimulation does not require a physical connection to the animal, it offers unprecedented freedom in designing novel behavioral assays. For instance, several animals could share the stimulation arena simultaneously, and only animals injected with MNPs would be affected by the AMF. This provides the ability to study stimulated and unaffected animals simultaneously, either as controls or to study their interaction. Absence of a tether or implant also has the advantage that animals do not carry any external marker, which may interfere with normal social group behavior. Additionally, exclusive to magnetothermal genetic stimulation, stimulation only occurs when the animal is within the magnetic field. Hence, adapting the field geometry allows controlling the stimulation timing and condition. This is ideal for space or location dependent assays such as multi chamber place preference assays when the animals are to be stimulated only when in one chamber.</p><p>One limitation of the current implementation of magnetothermal genetic stimulation is the power required to generate high AMFs over a large volume. In this study, a 7.5 kW power source produced the AMF over a volume of 300 cm<sup>3</sup>. However, stronger power sources are available to produce AMF in larger volumes, sufficient to cover the entire brain of non-human primates as well as humans. Magnetothermal stimulation may provide an alternative to optogenetics for deep brain stimulation in non-human primates. First, large brains move significantly relative to the skull, potentially displacing electrodes and glass fibers from their original target. As the transducer for magnetothermal stimulation is attached to the cells and not the skull, the stimulation location remains with the originally targeted cells. Second, activation of behavior in non-human primates may require coordinated activation of several distinct brain regions and each region may be larger than the volume covered by an optical fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inoue et al., 2015</xref>). Magnetothermal genetic stimulation can stimulate multiple distinct brain locations easily, as the delivery of the MNP is minimally invasive and the magnetic field covers the entire volume. The actual stimulated volume can be controlled by the MNP amount and rate of injection. Therefore, magnetothermal genetic stimulation is well suited for deep brain stimulation in non-human primates.</p><p>Just as for other genetic techniques, one hurdle to application in humans will be safety concerns around injecting virus and nanoparticles into the brain. However, the body’s reaction to nanoparticle injections has been extensively studied and can be minimized by using a biologically compatible nanoparticle surface coating. The invasive brain surgery currently used to inject the MNP may soon be replaced by MNP delivery via the bloodstream as recent research has shown, that focused ultrasound can transiently make the blood-brain barrier permeable to virus particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Price, 2015</xref>). Overall, magnetothermal neurostimulation offers a series of advantages for deep brain stimulation or silencing in non-human primates and primates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Magnetic field generation</title><p>Alternating magnetic fields were generated by water-cooled coils, driven by a 7.5 kW power generator from MSI Automation.

Immunochemical tethering of polymer coated magnetic nanoparticles to neurons is coupled to pan-neuronal Trpv1 expression, which renders neurons sensitive to heating in an alternating magnetic field (AMF). The authors nicely characterize the relationship between magnetic nanoparticle number or field strength and heating, as well as production of calcium transients in neurons. The authors go on to transduce three different brain areas with Trpv1 and demonstrate magnetic-field dependent alterations in movement that are consistent with other neuronal activation studies using different tools. The magnetogenetic system described here appears to be a promising tool for in vivo applications, but additional practical information about repeatability, cell type specificity, and cell health are required before it is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Additional behavioral and histological analyses are required, potentially requiring additional experiments.</p><p>Major revisions:</p><p><italic>Behavior</italic> </p><p>1) The authors show a small number of example perturbation trials (1-4). A larger number of trials (~10) in a single daily session should be shown. Data should be reported for each within session trial to demonstrate the consistency of the response, beyond the anecdotal examples provided.</p><p>2) The effectiveness across multiple sessions (different days) should be demonstrated. What is the timepoint after nanoparticle delivery after which responsiveness declines due to clearance of magnetic particles or antibody degradation? Can an additional injection of nanoparticles renew sensitivity at this point?</p><p>3) The authors make a compelling case that the membrane targeting is more efficient than soluble MNP in culture systems. However, it is not clear how this translates to the in-vivo situation. It could be that normal MNPs (without AB treatment) have the same or even better efficiency in-vivo. A comparison of AB and non-AB treated MNP, for the behavioral effects, would be strengthen this point.</p><p>4) Ex vivo experiments use 5 s AMF stimulation but for in vivo experiments AMF stimulation is longer (the precise stimulus durations seems to be absent).

This included ten minutes habituation, leaving at most 20 minutes for experiments. To avoid any local heat accumulation, each 1 minute stimulation trial was followed by at least 3 minutes break. Therefore, each session contained three to four trials. However, for several animals, we have performed two sessions per day and continued this pattern for multiple days, achieving more than ten trials.</p><p>We now include an overlay of many behavioral responses from multiple trials and animals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>.

Animals consistently respond for more than two days (54 hours). At the 54 hours time point, one field stimulation fails to elicit a response which may hint some clearing of the nanoparticles from the location where TRPV1 is expressed, but further studies will need to confirm this.</p><p>As the histology (see below) shows no cellular damage after twenty AMF stimulations, it may very well be possible to renew sensitivity by an additional injection of nanoparticles. Unfortunately, confirming this requires more time and animals than we had to answer these comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors make a compelling case that the membrane targeting is more efficient than soluble MNP in culture systems.

A comparison of AB and non-AB treated MNP, for the behavioral effects, would be strengthen this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include behavioral data of three animals expressing TRPV1 and injected with the same amount and type of nanoparticles, but without the antibody. These animals do not respond to the application of the AMF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Further evidence for the effectiveness of the AB targeting is seen in the now added histology data (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Ex vivo experiments use 5 s AMF stimulation but for in vivo experiments AMF stimulation is longer (the precise stimulus durations seems to be absent). The effect of these longer AMF stimuli should also be characterized in cultured cells at similar field strength as in the brain.</p></disp-quote><p>The in vivo experiments used one-minute AMF stimulation (which was mentioned in the Results and Discussion section but omitted in the Materials and methods. We have added it there now as well). In ex vivo experiments, the AMF was strong enough that the cells responded within 2-3 s, so that a 5-s AMF stimulation was sufficient. For the in vivo experiments, the field strength was lower and a response was observed only after 15-20s. We share the reviewer’s concern that it is necessary to confirm that the heat remains sufficiently localized when the heating occurs at a slower rate. We now include a series local temperature measurements at the membrane of cells decorated with nanoparticles heated by AMF of two different magnitudes and durations. During the 5 s AMF used for the ex vivo data, the local temperature rises nearly linearly by 2 degrees, showing little evidence of the cooling to the environment. After the field is turned off the temperature cools off quickly. During the 30 s applications of the lower AMF strength used in vivo, the local temperature rises more slowly and the cooling to the environment is apparent as the temperature rise slows. Still, the local temperature does increases by 2 degrees, and cools to baseline after removing the AMF. The data is included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Histology</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Histological analysis should show that AB treatment effectively enhances membrane targeting in-vivo in a cell-type specific manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed extensive histological analysis on mice injected with MNP and AB as well as some without AB. On the macroscale, it is apparent that the presence of the AB reduces how far the MNP diffuse into the brain, indicating efficient binding to cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Without AB, the MNP diffuse further into the brain.</p><p>Stacks of higher resolution confocal images labeled for the MNP and the neuronal marker MAP2 demonstrate specific binding of the MNP to the membrane of neurons, on the soma and along processes of these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>, including videos of z-sections). Without AB treatment, we did not find any examples with MNPs on the membrane of neurons.</p><p>We also include histological images demonstrating overlap of TRVP1 expression in neurons with MNP labeling via AB binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It should be examined that number of nanoparticles per cells and expression level of ion channels are comparable for in vivo and in vitro conditions. It is also important to show that injected TRPV1 virus produces expression in mouse brains.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include confocal images of brain sections showing the expression of TRPV1 in the motor cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), both using AVV5 and lenti-virus to deliver the gene.</p><p>Currently, we confirm TRPV1 expression and nanoparticle targeting using fluorescence imaging. This permits only a rough comparison of the actual expression levels in vivo and in vitro, but they appear comparable. A proper quantification is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A major worry is inflammation and heating. Histology showing healthy, MNP-covered neurons after stimulation would make this more convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We include confocal images of post-experiment brain sections, after 20 AMF applications, showing intact neurons labeled with MNP on their membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). These demonstrate that the heating does not damage the neurons. This is also supported by the ability to repeatedly magnetothermally evoke behavior, and that animals show no abnormal behavior after AMF application.</p><p>While we do not observe wide-spread inflammation, the histology does show some local inflammation at the injection wound and 24 hours post injection some MNP can be found in dendritic immune cells in lymph adjacent to blood vessels (faint dots far from injection in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Another major concern is local heating in the brain. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, it seems that the nanoparticles form aggregates (big red spots). How much stable nanoparticles are in physiological buffer? How clumped are the particles in the brain? Close to clumps the temperature could increase substantially and cause damage.</p></disp-quote><p>The histology sections show that the MNP are stable in the physiological milieu of the brain with minimal clustering. Some minor clustering outside of cells does occur. Some of those clusters do not heat because the MNP magnetically interact and are not in resonance with the AMF anymore. Other clusters may heat more efficiently. However, using histology we found no evidence for damage but cannot completely exclude very local damage affecting individual cells. Any damage would be very local as the temperature drops around them very quickly reaching background levels within 500 nanometers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
