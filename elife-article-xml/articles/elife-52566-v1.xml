homologous recombination (HR), a major DNA double-strand break repair pathway, several auxiliary factors interact with Rad51 to promote productive HR. We present an interdisciplinary characterization of the interaction between Rad51 and Swi5-Sfr1, a conserved auxiliary factor. Two distinct sites within the intrinsically disordered N-terminus of Sfr1 (Sfr1N) were found to cooperatively bind Rad51. Deletion of this domain impaired Rad51 stimulation in vitro and rendered cells sensitive to DNA damage. By contrast, amino acid-substitution mutants, which had comparable biochemical defects, could promote DNA repair, suggesting that Sfr1N has another role in addition to Rad51 binding. Unexpectedly, the DNA repair observed in these mutants was dependent on Rad55-Rad57, another auxiliary factor complex hitherto thought to function independently of Swi5-Sfr1. When combined with the finding that they form a higher-order complex, our results imply that Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad55-Rad57 can collaboratively stimulate Rad51 in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The DNA within cells contains the instructions necessary for life and it must be carefully maintained.

toxic form of DNA damage in which a DNA molecule is broken into two (or more) fragments. A major DSB repair pathway is homologous recombination (HR). During HR, an intact stretch of DNA that shares sequence similarity to the DSB site is identified and utilized as a template for synthesis-dependent repair. Dysregulation of HR results in misrepair of DSBs, resulting in genomic instability, a potent driver of tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeggo et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>HR is initiated by the formation of 3’ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at the DSB site. This ssDNA is first bound by RPA, then by the ubiquitous RecA-family recombinase Rad51, which forms a right-handed nucleoprotein filament. The Rad51 filament is able to capture intact double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and—by assessing the extent of base-pairing with the filamentous ssDNA—identify regions of DNA that share substantial sequence similarity to the DSB site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Prentiss et al., 2015</xref>). After initial pairing with the complementary strand of the dsDNA, the Rad51 filament further displaces the noncomplementary strand by driving strand transfer, resulting in the formation of an intermediate structure known as a displacement loop. The 3’ end of the invading strand is then utilized as a primer for DNA synthesis, leading to its extension and the recovery of lost genetic information. In the simplest case, ejection of this extended strand allows it to anneal with the complementary DNA on the other side of the DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mehta and Haber, 2014</xref>). Following gap filling by further DNA synthesis and ligation of resultant nicks, recombinational DNA repair is complete.</p><p>Efforts to elucidate the underlying biochemistry of HR have typically involved measuring the ability of purified Rad51 to drive pairing and subsequent strand transfer of homologous DNA substrates, a process known as DNA strand exchange. Such experiments established RPA as a critical component of the DNA strand exchange reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sung, 1994</xref>). However, when RPA was added to the reaction concomitantly with Rad51, which more closely reflects the situation in vivo, the stimulatory effect of RPA was abolished. This paradoxical finding led to the discovery that other proteins known to be involved in HR serve as auxiliary factors that interact directly with Rad51 and can negate the inhibitory effect of RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hays et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson and Symington, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sung, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sung, 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsutsui et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsutsui et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Numerous distinct families of recombination auxiliary factors have been identified throughout eukaryotes, including Rad52, BRCA2, Rad54, Rad51 paralogs, Swi5-Sfr1 and the Shu complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zelensky et al., 2014</xref>). Each group is thought to have non-overlapping roles in HR, although the mechanistic differences are yet to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akamatsu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khasanov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martín et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sugawara et al., 2003</xref>). Aside from the Shu complex, all auxiliary factors are capable of binding directly to Rad51, which is thought to be essential for their respective roles in HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zelensky et al., 2014</xref>). Sfr1 was first discovered in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> as an interactor of Rad51, and along with Swi5, was shown to comprise an HR sub-pathway that functions independently of and in parallel to the Rad51 paralogs Rad55-Rad57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akamatsu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akamatsu et al., 2007</xref>). Subsequent biochemical reconstitutions demonstrated that substoichiometric concentrations of Swi5-Sfr1 were able to efficiently stimulate the strand exchange activity of Rad51 and Dmc1, the meiosis-specific RecA-family recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haruta et al., 2006</xref>). This enhancement of strand exchange was attributed to stabilization of the nucleoprotein filaments and stimulation of the recombinases’ ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haruta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kurokawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murayama et al., 2013</xref>). Rad51-driven DNA strand exchange was recently shown to fit a three-step kinetic model with two reaction intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 2018</xref>). Swi5-Sfr1 enhanced transitioning of the first three-strand intermediate (corresponding to a paranemic joint) into the second three-strand intermediate (corresponding to a plectonemic joint), and conversion of the second intermediate into reaction products, thus making it the only auxiliary factor known to potentiate Rad51 in both the presynaptic and synaptic phases of DNA strand exchange. These findings highlight the unique role of Swi5-Sfr1 as an HR regulator.</p><p>Limited proteolysis of Swi5-Sfr1 yielded a stable C-terminal Sfr1 fragment in complex with Swi5 (Swi5-Sfr1C, residues 181–299 of Sfr1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuwabara et al., 2010</xref>), and this, along with the N-terminal half of Sfr1 (Sfr1N, residues 1–176 of Sfr1), could be stably expressed and purified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuwabara et al., 2012</xref>). Whereas Sfr1N was predicted to be intrinsically disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kokabu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saikusa et al., 2013</xref>), crystallographic analyses demonstrated that Swi5-Sfr1C forms a kinked structure that is able to stimulate Rad51-driven strand exchange by stabilizing the presynaptic filament and enhancing the ATPase activity of Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuwabara et al., 2012</xref>). By contrast, Sfr1N had no direct effect on these activities but was seen to co-immunoprecipitate (co-IP) with Rad51. Such complex formation was not detected between Rad51 and Swi5-Sfr1C, despite the stimulatory effect of Swi5-Sfr1C on Rad51. Taken together with the observation that Swi5-Sfr1C was only able to stimulate Rad51 activity when present at much higher concentrations than full-length Swi5-Sfr1, these results led to a model in which Sfr1N keeps Swi5-Sfr1C anchored in close proximity to Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuwabara et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Due to the use of truncated proteins in which entire domains were deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuwabara et al., 2012</xref>), it was not possible to determine whether Sfr1N has any function other than anchoring Swi5-Sfr1 to Rad51. To explore this, we employed an interdisciplinary approach to further characterize Sfr1N. We provide direct evidence that Sfr1N is intrinsically disordered and contains two sites that interact cooperatively with Rad51. Mutation of critical residues within these two sites rendered Rad51 refractory to the stimulatory effects of full-length Swi5-Sfr1, mimicking the results obtained with Swi5-Sfr1C (i.e., when the N-terminus of Sfr1 is absent), indicating that the primary function of Sfr1N is to facilitate the interaction between Swi5-Sfr1 with Rad51. Unexpectedly, and in contrast to the severely impaired Rad51 stimulation observed in vitro, these interaction mutants only showed defects in Rad51-mediated DNA repair in the absence of Rad55-Rad57, implying that these Rad51 paralogs can facilitate Swi5-Sfr1-dependent DNA repair. Consistent with this possibility, purified Swi5-Sfr1 was found to interact with partially purified Rad55-Rad57. Collectively, these results provide a molecular basis for Rad51 stimulation by Swi5-Sfr1 and reveal a novel interplay between recombination auxiliary factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sfr1N is essential for the role of Swi5-Sfr1 in DNA repair</title><p>Since Sfr1N binds to Rad51 but does not stimulate DNA strand exchange, and Swi5-Sfr1C stimulates DNA strand exchange despite not forming a detectable complex with Rad51, it was proposed that Sfr1N functions exclusively to facilitate the interaction between Swi5-Sfr1C and Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuwabara et al., 2012</xref>). However, it remained possible that Sfr1N only exerts a stimulatory effect when in the presence of Swi5-Sfr1C. To test this, strand exchange reactions containing purified Rad51 and plasmid-sized DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) were supplemented with equimolar concentrations of both Sfr1N and Swi5-Sfr1C. Even in this setting, Sfr1N did not have any stimulatory effect on DNA strand exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), raising the possibility that it is dispensable for the physiological function of Swi5-Sfr1. To determine the requirement for these two modules in Rad51-dependent DNA repair, strains lacking the C-terminal or N-terminal half of Sfr1 (<italic>sfr1N</italic> and <italic>sfr1C</italic>, respectively) were constructed. Both strains showed the same sensitivity to DNA damage as a strain in which Sfr1 was completely absent (<italic>sfr1Δ</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

NOE values for all residues was less than 0.44, indicating that the entire protein is flexible with pico-to-nanosecond timescale motions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Such fast motions are typically observed for unstructured proteins. The NOE values were not completely uniform. While the average NOE values for all Sfr1N residues was 0.15, residues E27 to S33 showed slightly increased values with an average of 0.32. Other regions within Sfr1N also showed similarly increased NOE values (e.g., residues F91 to A99, average of 0.32). However, unlike these other regions, several additional lines of evidence pointed toward the possibility that residues E27 to S33 may form an α-helix (see above).

Disorder predictions using DISOPRED3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones and Cozzetto, 2015</xref>) suggest that the disordered state of Sfr1N may have been conserved throughout evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, see Discussion for more details).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Two sites within Sfr1N interact with Rad51</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuwabara et al.

Superimposed <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled Sfr1N with increasing amounts of Rad51 were constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The most prominent spectral changes, defined as a reduction in signal intensity of &gt;80% (Sfr1N:Rad51 ratio of 1:0.25), were observed for 19 out of 142 non-overlapped residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,E</xref>). In addition to these marked changes, 18 and 20 residues experienced signal intensity reductions of 60–80% and 40–60%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The signal intensity of these residues was further attenuated upon incremental addition of Rad51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Most of these attenuated signals did not display obvious chemical shift changes following Rad51 binding. However, five residues (A71, T73, D75, L76, and T146) displayed incremental chemical shift changes and reductions in signal intensity upon addition of increasing amounts of Rad51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

We therefore proceeded to characterize the biochemical activities of the 7A mutant. The 3A and 4A mutants were included to glean further insights into the nature of Rad51 stimulation by Swi5-Sfr1.</p><p>While Swi5-Sfr1C can stimulate Rad51 activity despite the absence of Sfr1N, 5-to-10-fold more of the complex is required to achieve the same level of stimulation as full-length Swi5-Sfr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> lanes 3 and 12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuwabara et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that the interaction between Sfr1N and Rad51 is important for efficient stimulation of strand exchange. Consistent with the observed binding defect, substoichiometric concentrations of the 7A mutant failed to efficiently stimulate Rad51-driven strand exchange, with a higher concentration of mutant protein required to achieve a wild-type level of joint molecules (JM, reaction intermediates) and nicked-circles (NCs, reaction products; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). At 0.25 µM, the defect of the 7A protein was more pronounced for NC (~15 fold reduction) than JM (~5 fold reduction), suggesting that the ability of Swi5-Sfr1 to stimulate both the initial pairing of homologous DNA and the subsequent strand transfer by Rad51 are defective when the interaction with Sites 1 and 2 is ablated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>). By contrast, the 3A and 4A mutants were able to promote efficient JM and NC formation at substoichiometric concentrations. Nevertheless, the loss of Rad51 stimulation observed at higher concentrations of wild-type Swi5-Sfr1 was attenuated in the 3A and 4A mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> lanes 6, 21 and 28), suggesting that this loss of stimulation occurs due to unproductive interactions with Rad51 or sequestration of DNA substrates by Swi5-Sfr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and see Discussion). Consistent with this notion, efficient stimulation of Rad51 was maintained at higher concentrations of the 7A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> lanes 8 and 15) and Swi5-Sfr1C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuwabara et al., 2012</xref>).

At substoichiometric concentrations, Swi5-Sfr1 effectively stabilizes Rad51 presynaptic filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kurokawa et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, it seemed feasible that the observed impairment in strand exchange might be explained by defects in Rad51 filament stabilization. To test this possibility, filament stability was examined by fluorescence anisotropy. When Rad51 binds to a fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide and forms a filament, fluorescence anisotropy increases due to a retardation in the motion of the labeled oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The dissociation of Rad51 is accompanied by a reduction in anisotropy, with the rate of decline reflective of Rad51 filament stability. Rad51-ssDNA filaments were formed in the presence of ATP and filament collapse was induced via dilution into reaction buffer containing ATP but lacking DNA and protein. In the absence of Swi5-Sfr1, the decrement in anisotropy was sharp and reached a value that was observed in the absence of protein (~0.1) within ~500 s. Inclusion of wild-type Swi5-Sfr1 resulted in a slower reduction in anisotropy, indicating that Rad51 filaments had been stabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Strikingly, inclusion of the 7A mutant did not result in any obvious filament stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Furthermore, although both 3A and 4A mutants showed some stabilization of Rad51 filaments, the magnitude of this stabilization was less than that observed for wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). Consistent with these observations, the reaction rate constants for dissociation of Rad51-ssDNA complexes (<italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>) showed a substantial decline in the presence of Swi5-Sfr1, a lesser decline for the 3A and 4A mutants, and only a marginal decline for the 7A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

A prerequisite of this model is that Rad55-Rad57 can bind to both Rad51 and Swi5-Sfr1. While an interaction between Rad57 and Rad51 has been reported by yeast two-hybrid analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsutsui et al., 2001</xref>), a possible interaction between Rad55-Rad57 and Swi5-Sfr1 was never examined due to the genetic evidence suggesting that they comprise independent sub-pathways of HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akamatsu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akamatsu et al., 2007</xref>).

Rad55-Rad57 was then specifically eluted via the addition of 3C protease, which cleaves between Rad55 and resin-bound Protein A. Rad55 and Rad57 constituted the two major bands in this partially purified protein preparation and were present in seemingly stoichiometric amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>), consistent with previous reports in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sung, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Partially purified Rad55-Rad57 was incubated with purified Swi5-Sfr1 (wild type or 7A) and Rad57 was immunoprecipitated.

Moreover, both Swi5-Sfr1 and Swi5-Sfr1-7A coIP’d with Rad57. While partially purified Rad55-Rad57 appeared to be reasonably pure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>), it remained possible that Rad51 had co-purified with Rad55-Rad57 throughout the purification process. If so, Rad51 bound to Rad55-Rad57 could interact with Swi5-Sfr1, leading to indirect co-IP of Sfr1 with Rad57. To test this possibility, the anti-Rad57 immunoprecipitates were probed with an anti-Rad51 antibody. Importantly, Rad51 was completely undetectable in these immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), suggesting that Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad55-Rad57 directly interact in a Rad51-independent manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we characterized the interaction between Rad51, the key protein in HR, and Swi5-Sfr1, a widely conserved recombination auxiliary factor.

This domain was shown to be intrinsically disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and contain two sites that interact with Rad51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Although mutation of the two interaction sites disrupted the physical and functional interaction with Rad51 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), unexpectedly, defects in DNA repair were only observed in the absence of Rad55-Rad57, another auxiliary factor complex with which Swi5-Sfr1 was found to interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cooperative interactions with Rad51 are the primary function of Sfr1N</title><p>Although Sfr1N is not essential for stimulation of Rad51-driven DNA strand exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuwabara et al., 2012</xref>), it is essential for the promotion of Rad51-dependent DNA repair by Swi5-Sfr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). The fact that Swi5-Sfr1C can exert a stimulatory effect on Rad51 in vitro points towards the existence of a physical interaction between the two. However, the inability to detect such a complex, combined with the relative inefficiency with which Swi5-Sfr1C potentiates Rad51, strongly suggests that the interaction is too weak to observe by conventional means. This binding is likely augmented by the N-terminal fragment of Sfr1, which we posit functions as an anchor to keep Swi5-Sfr1C in close proximity to Rad51. Consistent with such a role for Sfr1N, NMR interaction analysis revealed that two domains within Sfr1N interact with Rad51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mutation of Site 1 or 2 weakened the interaction with Rad51, while mutation of both sites resulted in a near-complete loss of interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that two sites within Sfr1N bind cooperatively to Rad51. Interestingly, Rad51-dependent strand exchange and ATP hydrolysis were significantly impaired only when both sites were mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6G</xref>). These results indicate that the reduced interaction in the single site mutants is sufficient for Swi5-Sfr1 to fully stimulate Rad51 in these assays. Although this points toward functional redundancy between Sites 1 and 2, it is possible that these assays are not sensitive enough to detect marginal defects in the stimulation of Rad51. Indeed, the fluorescence anisotropy assay revealed a severe defect in Rad51 filament stabilization for the 7A mutant and a modest defect for the 3A and 4A mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–F</xref>), arguing that interaction of both Sites 1 and 2 with Rad51 is important for efficient filament stabilization. Swi5-Sfr1 has also been shown to stabilize Rad51 filaments against the F-box helicase Fbh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsutsui et al., 2014</xref>). It would be interesting to test whether the interaction mutants can function in a similar capacity.</p><p>The reduction in NMR signals from Sites 1 and 2 in the presence of Rad51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), combined with the gradual chemical shift changes observed for some residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicated that the association and dissociation of Sfr1N and Rad51 is fast on the NMR timescale, suggesting that the Sfr1N-Rad51 interaction is relatively weak. While monomeric Rad51 (~40 kDa) is too small to cause severe line-broadening of NMR signals, the interaction of multimeric Rad51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) with Sfr1N could explain the drastic reduction in NMR signals for Sites 1 and 2.</p><p>These results were largely substantiated by site-specific crosslinking of residues within Site 1, and to a much lesser extent Site 2, to Rad51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Since both sites are involved in electrostatic interactions with Rad51, the more robust crosslinking of Site 1 may be due to the added contribution of hydrophobic interactions between Site 1 and Rad51. One interpretation of these results is that the Site 1-Rad51 interaction is of higher affinity than the Site 2-Rad51 interaction. However, the results of co-IP experiments suggested that mutating Site 2 disrupts the Rad51 interaction to a greater extent than mutating Site 1 (compare 3A and 4A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). When making such comparisons, it is important to note that the NMR and crosslinking experiments only involved Sfr1N, whereas the co-IP analysis involved full-length Sfr1 in complex with Swi5. It is possible that Site 2 plays a more prominent role in the interaction with Rad51 in the context of the full-length complex. The reduced crosslinking of Site 2 residues could also be explained by the fact that replacement of a given residue with the aromatic <italic>p</italic>BPA could itself disrupt the interaction with Rad51, especially since Site 2 is less hydrophobic than Site 1.</p><p>Previous structural analysis indicated that the self-association of Rad51 involves the conserved FxxA motif (where x can be any residue) and that the BRC3 and BRC4 repeats of BRCA2 bind to this motif through Rad51 mimicry, leading to destabilization of the Rad51 filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shin et al., 2003</xref>). This identified destabilization/stabilization of the interactions between Rad51 monomers as one way of regulating filament stability. A distinct method of stabilizing Rad51 filaments was uncovered for budding yeast Rad55-Rad57, which was shown to cap the end of Rad51 filaments and antagonize the filament destabilizing activity of the Srs2 anti-recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, neither Swi5 nor Sfr1 contains an FxxA motif. This is consistent with the identification of Rad51 interaction sites within the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of Sfr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), which has undergone substantial sequence divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We therefore favor the previously proposed model whereby Swi5-Sfr1C inserts into the wide grooves of the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament, locking the filament in an active conformation, with Sfr1N plastering along the outside of the filament to maintain Swi5-Sfr1C within the groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fornander et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kokabu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuwabara et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>While this model could explain how Swi5-Sfr1 stabilizes the filament, it does not explain how Swi5-Sfr1 stimulates ATP hydrolysis and extensive strand transfer by Rad51, which are highly dynamic processes thought to involve dissociation of Rad51 from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that the flexibility of Sfr1N allows Swi5-Sfr1 to remain bound to Rad51 despite conformational changes in the filament. This could also entail release of dissociating Rad51 molecules and re-binding of Sfr1N to molecules incorporated in the filament, thus preventing diffusion of Swi5-Sfr1 from the Rad51 filament. NMR interaction analysis suggested that binding of Sfr1N to Rad51 is relatively short-lived (see above), consistent with a model in which the dynamic association and dissociation of Swi5-Sfr1 from Rad51 plays a role in stimulation of DNA strand exchange. Sites 1 and 2 may comprise a single Rad51 interacting unit in 3D space, although they are unlikely to share the same interface on Rad51, given that Site 1 is more hydrophobic than Site 2. Alternatively, Site 1 may bind to Rad51 with Site 2 acting as a scaffold, consistent with the results of our crosslinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and co-IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) experiments.</p><p>We note that the 7A mutant complex displayed a near-loss of DNA binding and the 4A mutant showed a clear defect in DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A mild impairment in DNA binding became apparent upon closer inspection of the 3A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It is likely that these defects were caused by mutation of the positively charged Lys/Arg residues to Ala residues, leading to neutralization of the electrostatic attraction to DNA. Despite showing different levels of DNA binding, 3A and 4A were indistinguishable in all other aspects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Although it is formally possible that our observations with the 7A mutant are related to a defect in DNA binding, the high similarity of the results obtained with 3A and 4A argues that DNA binding by Swi5-Sfr1 is impertinent to its role in stimulating Rad51 activity or promoting Rad51-dependent DNA repair. Notably, mouse Swi5-Sfr1 (mSwi5-Sfr1) stimulates Rad51 through very similar mechanisms despite being unable to bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). This is in stark contrast to other recombination auxiliary factors such as Rad52, Rad54 and Hop2-Mnd1, whose ability to bind DNA is integral for recombinase stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Seong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wright and Heyer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to its involvement in DNA repair, human Sfr1 (hSfr1) has been implicated in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yuan and Chen, 2011</xref>), raising the possibility that <italic>S. pombe</italic> Sfr1 may also have functions unrelated to DNA repair. In agreement with this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cipak et al. (2009)</xref> reported that Swi5-Sfr1 forms a complex with the XPG-family RNA nuclease Mkt1 (SPAC139.01c), which was recently shown to be involved in RNAi-mediated silencing and establishment of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taglini et al., 2019</xref>). We speculate that the ability of Sfr1 to bind DNA may be related to an as yet uncharacterized function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Rad51 paralogs promote Swi5-Sfr1-dependent DNA repair</title><p>While the <italic>sfr1Δ</italic> and <italic>rad55Δ</italic> single mutants are sensitive to DNA damage, neither is as sensitive as <italic>rad51Δ</italic>, which is epistatic to both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akamatsu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khasanov et al., 1999</xref>). However, because the <italic>sfr1Δ rad55Δ</italic> double mutant shows the same sensitivity as <italic>rad51Δ</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), it was concluded that two independent sub-pathways of HR exist in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akamatsu et al., 2003</xref>). Despite the numerous defects observed in vitro, the <italic>sfr1-7A</italic> mutant strain was proficient for DNA repair, but this repair was dependent on Rad55-Rad57 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>), indicating that a Rad55-Rad57-dependent mechanism overcomes defects in the binding of Swi5-Sfr1 to Rad51.</p><p>To explain these results, we propose that the interaction of Swi5-Sfr1 with Rad51 is enabled by two redundant mechanisms: one through a direct interaction involving Sites 1 and 2 in Sfr1N and the other through Rad55-Rad57, which interacts with Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsutsui et al., 2001</xref>) and acts as a molecular bridge to facilitate the recruitment of Swi5-Sfr1 to Rad51. Hence, although Swi5-Sfr1-7A cannot interact directly with Rad51, Rad55-Rad57 aids the recruitment of Swi5-Sfr1-7A to Rad51, allowing it to exert a stimulatory effect on Rad51; this would explain why <italic>sfr1-7A</italic> is proficient for DNA repair. However, in the absence of Rad55/Rad57, this tethering is lost but Swi5-Sfr1 can nevertheless promote some DNA repair via its direct interaction with Rad51, thus explaining why <italic>rad55Δ</italic> is not as sensitive as <italic>rad51Δ</italic>. It is only when both interaction mechanisms are defective, as in the <italic>rad55Δ sfr1-7A</italic> strain, that the promotion of Rad51-mediated DNA repair by Swi5-Sfr1 is completely lost. Consistent with this possibility, Swi5-Sfr1 was found to form a Rad51-independent complex with partially purified Rad55-Rad57 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>). Critically, Swi5-Sfr1-7A was also able to form a complex with Rad55-Rad57. The apparent absence of Rad51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>)—the major interacting partner of Rad55-Rad57—combined with the reasonably high purity achieved by the one-step purification process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>) implies that this complex formation involves direct binding of Swi5-Sfr1 to Rad55-Rad57, in support of the proposed model. We therefore surmise that, while the Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad55-Rad57 sub-pathways are capable of operating independently of each other, as observed in the <italic>rad55Δ</italic> and <italic>sfr1Δ</italic> backgrounds, Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad55-Rad57 likely collaborate to promote Rad51-dependent DNA repair in wild-type cells.</p><p>Rad55-Rad57 facilitates recruitment of the Shu complex to Rad51 by binding to both and acting as a molecular bridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaines et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khasanov et al., 2004</xref>), so it could plausibly fulfill a similar role for Swi5-Sfr1. However, unlike the Shu complex, Swi5-Sfr1 can interact directly with Rad51, so any contribution made by Rad55-Rad57 to this interaction would enhance rather than enable complex formation with Rad51. The requirement for such a mechanism may stem from the fact that the direct interaction between Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad51 is relatively weak (see above). Indeed, previous attempts by us and others to co-IP Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad51 from yeast extracts has been unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akamatsu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cipak et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that the cellular interaction is too weak to capture. It is tempting to speculate that Rad55-Rad57, Swi5-Sfr1, and the Shu complex exist as a higher-order auxiliary factor complex, perhaps as part of a Rad52-containing DNA repair center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lisby et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lisby et al., 2003</xref>). Evidence for the existence of such a complex, along with the delineation of the relationship between Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad55-Rad57, will be the focus of future research.</p><p>Interestingly, unlike <italic>sfr1-7A</italic>, <italic>sfr1C</italic> showed the same DNA damage sensitivity as <italic>sfr1Δ</italic> even in the presence of Rad55-Rad57 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>).

Since the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal half of Sfr1 shows little conservation compared to the C-terminal half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), it is tempting to ascribe the similarities among species to the C-terminus. However, sequence divergence across large evolutionary distances does not necessarily reflect a lack of functional conservation for intrinsically disordered regions, which accumulate mutations at a higher rate than structured domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2002</xref>). Notably, the large subunit of RPA contains an intrinsically disordered region whose function is conserved despite significant sequence divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daughdrill et al., 2007</xref>), raising the possibility that the structure and/or function of Sfr1N is conserved. While empirical evidence is lacking, disorder predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones and Cozzetto, 2015</xref>) for the N-terminal half of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Sfr1 agree with the data presented here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and similar profiles were generated for Sfr1 from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces japonicus</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces octosporus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). Furthermore, the N-terminal halves of mSfr1, hSfr1 and Mei5 are predicted to be enriched in intrinsically disordered regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>). This analysis also highlighted potential protein binding sites within the N-terminal halves of <italic>S. japonicus</italic> Sfr1, hSfr1 and Mei5. In support of this, the N-terminal half of Mei5 has already been shown to interact with Dmc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayase et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Say et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, in addition to the conserved function of Swi5-Sfr1 in promoting HR, the intrinsically disordered nature of Sfr1’s N-terminus and its role in facilitating interactions with recombinases may be evolutionarily conserved.

This study illuminates the interaction of the conserved Rad51 paralogs complex with Rad51 using biochemical, biophysical, and genetic approaches. Given the unstructured nature of the Sfr1N sequence, it is challenging to resolve the interaction interface between Sfr1N and Rad51 using high resolution structural techniques such as X-ray crystallography. To address this, the authors have beautifully combined NMR and proximity cross-linking to unravel the interaction between Sfr1N and Rad51. The results show that the N-terminal region of Sfr1 interacts with Rad51 through two independent sites. The authors conduct a series of nice biochemical experiments to define these two binding sites and evaluate their functional importance for in vitro recombination. in vitro elimination of the N-terminus or the mutational inactivation of the Sfr1-Rad51 interaction lead to robust phenotypes. Interestingly in vivo, a phenotype of those mutants is only revealed in the absence of a second Rad51 paralog complex Rad55-Rad57. The manuscript is clearly written. The biochemical, biophysical and genetic experiments are of high technical quality. However, the key finding of the in vivo dependence of the Sfr1-7A phenotype on the absence of Rad55-Rad57 is lacking an explanation or potential mechanism. While it seems clear the Sfr1 N-terminus is able to interact with Rad51, the role of Swi5-Sfr1 DNA binding is downplayed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The key observation is that the in vivo phenotype of the Sfr1-7A mutation is revealed only by absence of the Rad55-Rad57 Rad51 paralog complex. What are the mechanisms involved? How does Rad55-Rad57 affect the Swi5-Sfr1 Rad51 (or the Sfr1-Nterm-Rad51) interaction? The key prediction that Rad55-Rad57 interact with Swi5-Sfr1 needs to be addressed experimentally. The functional characterization of this higher order complex is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>2) It is unclear, why the Sfr1-7A mutation would cause a DNA binding defect of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex, based on the model and the other data. Can the authors provide an explanation and/or define a mechanism by which the 7A mutation impacts DNA binding? More discussion and explanation are needed here, but not additional experimentation.</p><p>3) The authors conclude that their designated Site 2 has more transient contacts with Site 1 based on the crosslinking results in Figure 4C, but Figure 5B suggests Site 2 has a higher affinity than Site 1. How do the authors explain this discrepancy? Furthermore, how do the authors rule out the possibility that Site 1 and 2 are not one Rad51 interacting unit in 3D space? Based on the crosslinking results and the fact that mutations of either site results in the same reduction in Rad51 stimulation, Site 1 could be important for making contacts with Rad51, while Site 2 acts as a structural scaffold, hence the lack of crosslinks. More discussion is needed here.</p><p>4) One caveat of the crosslinking experiment in Figure 4 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 is that it entails the replacement of an amino acid residue; thus, it could miss out on a critical interaction site. The discrepancy between the crosslink and NMR data on Site 2 could be explained by this. It should be discussed in the text.</p><p>5) Mouse Swi5-Sfr1 study showed that the Rad51 interaction site in the Swi5-Sfr1 complex resides in the C-terminus of Swi5. This manuscript and previous paper from the Iwasaki group showed that Swi5-Sfr1C has some stimulatory effect on Rad51, suggesting there might be residual interaction between Swi5-Sfr1C and Rad51. Does Swi5-Sfr1C bind DNA, and how does it compare to the various mutants? What is the proposed mechanism for Swi5-Sfr1C stimulation of Rad51 if it does not interact with Rad51 or stimulate ATPase activity? Could it be through an interaction with DNA? Please provide some consideration and discussion of this point.</p><p>6) Figure 6—figure supplement 1A: The DNA binding aspect of the Swi5-Sfr1 was not well addressed experimentally, although the defect in the 7A mutant is apparent. The DNA binding experiments should be run in triplicate and quantified.</p><p>7) In the last paragraph of the subsection “Sites 1 and 2 cooperatively facilitate the physical and functional interaction between Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad51”, the authors conclude that unproductive interactions between Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad51 reduce the amount of strand exchange product, but there is not enough evidence to reach this conclusion, especially considering the 3A and 4A mutants bind dsDNA at those concentrations. Thus, increasing Swi5-Sfr1 concentrations could block strand exchange by sequestering the DNA substrate. This possibility should be discussed as well.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52566.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p></disp-quote><p> <italic>1) The key observation is that the</italic> in vivo <italic>phenotype of the Sfr1-7A mutation is revealed only by absence of the Rad55-Rad57 Rad51 paralog complex.

The key prediction that Rad55-Rad57 interact with Swi5-Sfr1 needs to be addressed experimentally. The functional characterization of this higher order complex is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</italic></p><p>Previous attempts by us and other to demonstrate Sfr1-Rad51 complex formation by in vivo co-IP was unsuccessful (Akamatsu et al., 2003; Cipiak et al., 2009). Since this approach was unable to capture an established protein-protein interaction, it seemed unlikely that it would allow us to address whether Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad55-Rad57 form a complex together. We did attempt a co-IP experiment to test whether Rad55-Rad57 forms a complex with Swi5-Sfr1 but could not detect any interaction, perhaps due to the very low levels of intracellular protein (we were unable to detect endogenous levels of Rad55 or Sfr1 by western blotting). To circumvent this problem, we partially purified Rad55-Rad57 by overexpression in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (Figure 7—figure supplement 1C, D; see Materials and methods for details). This partially purified protein preparation was then incubated with highly purified Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad57 was immunoprecipitated. This analysis revealed that Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad55-Rad57 form a complex together (Figure 7E). Importantly, Rad51 was not detectable in the immunoprecipitate (Figure 7F). The absence of Rad55-Rad57’s major interacting partner in this immunoprecipitation experiment, combined with the reasonable purity of the complex (Figure 7—figure supplement 1D), implies that the complex formation between Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad55-Rad57 is mediated by a direct interaction. A detailed description of these findings can now be found in the Results (subsection “Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad55-Rad57 form a Rad51-independent complex”) and Discussion (subsection “Rad51 paralogs promote Swi5-Sfr1-dependent DNA repair”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is unclear, why the Sfr1-7A mutation would cause a DNA binding defect of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex, based on the model and the other data. Can the authors provide an explanation and/or define a mechanism by which the 7A mutation impacts DNA binding? More discussion and explanation are needed here, but not additional experimentation.</p></disp-quote><p>The simplest explanation is that mutation of the seven positively charged Lys/Arg residues to Ala in the 7A mutant has neutralised the electrostatic attraction responsible for DNA binding, the role of which, however, remains a mystery. There is evidence to suggest that the DNA binding activity of Swi5-Sfr1 may be unrelated to DNA repair. Our reasoning for this is three-fold. First, the 4A mutant was more defective for DNA binding than the 3A mutant, yet both mutants showed similar DNA damage sensitivity and impairment in Rad51 stimulation in vitro. Second, despite potentiating Rad51 through highly similar mechanisms (filament stabilization and stimulation of ATP hydrolysis, as revealed by Peter Chi’s group), mouse Swi5-Sfr1 is devoid of DNA binding activity (see Supplementary Figure 5 in Tsai et al., 2012). Third, human Swi5-Sfr1 has been implicated in transcriptional regulation (Feng et al., 2013). While it is not currently known whether human Swi5-Sfr1 binds to DNA, this at least raises the possibility that <italic>S. pombe</italic> Swi5-Sfr1 could have a similar role in regulating transcription, and it is easy to imagine that DNA binding could be relevant to such a role. Consistent with this possibility, Cipak et al., 2009, reported that <italic>S. pombe</italic> Swi5-Sfr1 and the XPG-family RNA nuclease Mkt1 (SPAC139.01c) form a complex. Interestingly, Mkt1 was recently shown to function in RNAi-mediated gene silencing and heterochromatin formation (Taglini et al., 2019). These points have now been described in the Discussion (subsection “Cooperative interactions with Rad51 are the primary function of Sfr1N”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors conclude that their designated Site 2 has more transient contacts with Site 1 based on the crosslinking results in Figure 4C, but Figure 5B suggests Site 2 has a higher affinity than Site 1. How do the authors explain this discrepancy? Furthermore, how do the authors rule out the possibility that Site 1 and 2 are not one Rad51 interacting unit in 3D space? Based on the crosslinking results and the fact that mutations of either site results in the same reduction in Rad51 stimulation, Site 1 could be important for making contacts with Rad51, while Site 2 acts as a structural scaffold, hence the lack of crosslinks. More discussion is needed here.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the apparent discrepancy, one mitigating factor is that the crosslinking results in Figure 4C only involve Sfr1N whereas the IP results in Figure 5B involve full-length Swi5-Sfr1. It is possible that, in the context of the full-length complex, Site 2 plays a more important role in the interaction with Rad51 (perhaps in combination with very weak/transient interactions between Rad51 and Swi5-Sfr1C, as discussed in point 4), whereas the interaction between the Sfr1N and Rad51 relies more on contacts with Site 1. The latter point is also supported by our NMR results, where not only more residues in Site 1 showed a reduction in signal intensity (31 vs. 17), but a higher proportion of residues showed a substantial reduction in signal intensity (~45% [14/31] vs. ~24% [4/17]; compare red underlined residues in Figure 3E). Furthermore, as we mentioned in the Discussion of our initial submission (also related to point 3-2), it is possible that Site 1, which is more hydrophobic in nature, was better able to tolerate the presence of the aromatic pBPA, whereas the insertion of pBPA into Site 2 could have hindered its binding to Rad51 (subsection “Cooperative interactions with Rad51 are the primary function of Sfr1N”, third paragraph).</p><p>Sites 1 and 2 may comprise a single Rad51 interacting unit in 3D space, and this cannot be excluded by the current data. It is important to note that Site 2 contains far fewer hydrophobic residues than Site 1. This raises the possibility that, even if Sites 1 and 2 act as a single interacting unit in 3D space, they likely occupy different interfaces on Rad51. The suggestion that Site 1 makes direct contact whereas Site 2 acts as a structural scaffold is another plausible explanation for our results. These possibilities have now been described in more detail in the Discussion (subsection “Cooperative interactions with Rad51 are the primary function of Sfr1N”, fifth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) One caveat of the crosslinking experiment in Figure 4 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 is that it entails the replacement of an amino acid residue; thus, it could miss out on a critical interaction site. The discrepancy between the crosslink and NMR data on Site 2 could be explained by this. It should be discussed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the possibility that the replacement of a residue central to the Sfr1N-Rad51 interaction with pBPA could itself disrupt the interaction, leading to a negative result in the crosslinking assay. This caveat has now been described in the Discussion (subsection “Cooperative interactions with Rad51 are the primary function of Sfr1N”, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Mouse Swi5-Sfr1 study showed that the Rad51 interaction site in the Swi5-Sfr1 complex resides in the C-terminus of Swi5. This manuscript and previous paper from the Iwasaki group showed that Swi5-Sfr1C has some stimulatory effect on Rad51, suggesting there might be residual interaction between Swi5-Sfr1C and Rad51. Does Swi5-Sfr1C bind DNA, and how does it compare to the various mutants? What is the proposed mechanism for Swi5-Sfr1C stimulation of Rad51 if it does not interact with Rad51 or stimulate ATPase activity? Could it be through an interaction with DNA? Please provide some consideration and discussion of this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We previously showed that Swi5-Sfr1C does not bind DNA by EMSA (Figure 4A in Kuwabara et al., 2012; also see point 5). In the referenced paper, we demonstrated that Swi5-Sfr1C can promote Rad51-driven DNA strand exchange through stabilization of the Rad51 filament and stimulation of Rad51’s ATPase activity. However, whereas the full-length Swi5-Sfr1 complex could robustly stimulate these aspects of Rad51 at substoichiometric concentrations (Swi5-Sfr1:Rad51, 1:25 or 1:50), 5-10-fold higher concentrations of Swi5-Sfr1C was required to achieve a similar magnitude of stimulation. We therefore concluded that Swi5-Sfr1C must retain some intrinsic level of interaction with Rad51, but this interaction is just too weak/transient to be detected by conventional means (e.g., IP with purified proteins; Figure 4B in Kuwabara et al., 2012). This is also consistent with why Swi5-Sfr1C was only able to stimulate Rad51 when included at higher concentrations. The binding of Swi5-Sfr1C to Rad51 is likely enforced by Sfr1N, which we think functions as an anchor to keep Swi5-Sfr1C in close proximity to Rad51. Based on molecular modelling (Kokabu et al., 2011), we think that Swi5-Sfr1C could fit into the wide groove of the Rad51 filament, thus locking it in the active conformation. These possibilities have now been mentioned in the Discussion (subsection “Cooperative interactions with Rad51 are the primary function of Sfr1N”, first paragraph).</p><p>In assays where direct comparisons have been made (three-strand exchange and ATP hydrolysis), the defects of the Swi5-Sfr1-7A mutant were very similar to those of Swi5-Sfr1C. For example, at 0.25 µM of 7A or Swi5-Sfr1C, the total yield (JM + NC) in the three-strand exchange assay was 10.0 ± 4.3 and 4.4% ± 0.7, respectively; this subtle difference was essentially lost at higher concentrations (e.g., at 5 µM: 7A 44.8% ± 1.5, S5S1C 39.0% ± 1.6). In the ATPase assay, the averaged <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> values were comparable (7A 0.307 min<sup>-1</sup> ± 0.068, S5S1C 0.306 min<sup>-1</sup> ± 0.004), but there seemed to be more variation with the 7A complex, perhaps due to some stochasticity conferred by the presence of the disordered N-terminus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 6—figure supplement 1A: The DNA binding aspect of the Swi5-Sfr1 was not well addressed experimentally, although the defect in the 7A mutant is apparent. The DNA binding experiments should be run in triplicate and quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments have now been conducted in triplicate and quantified (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). The quantified results are consistent with our observation that the 7A mutant is severely defective for DNA binding, the 4A mutant is moderately defective, and the 3A mutant is only mildly defective. This result has now been mentioned in the Results section (subsection “Sites 1 and 2 cooperatively facilitate the physical and functional interaction between Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad51”, last paragraph) and a more detailed analysis has been included in the Discussion (subsection “Cooperative interactions with Rad51 are the primary function of Sfr1N, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the last paragraph of the subsection “Sites 1 and 2 cooperatively facilitate the physical and functional interaction between Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad51”, the authors conclude that unproductive interactions between Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad51 reduce the amount of strand exchange product, but there is not enough evidence to reach this conclusion, especially considering the 3A and 4A mutants bind dsDNA at those concentrations. Thus, increasing Swi5-Sfr1 concentrations could block strand exchange by sequestering the DNA substrate. This possibility should be discussed as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. As mentioned above in point 5, this possibility has now been stated in the Results section (subsection “Sites 1 and 2 cooperatively facilitate the physical and functional interaction between Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad51”, last paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
