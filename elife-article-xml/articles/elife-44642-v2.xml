Here, we show that temperature dramatically changes the splicing pattern of <italic>tim</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We found that at 18°C, TIM levels are low because of the induction of two cold-specific isoforms: <italic>tim-cold</italic> and <italic>tim-short and cold</italic>. At 29°C, another isoform, <italic>tim-medium</italic>, is upregulated. Isoform switching regulates the levels and activity of TIM as each isoform has a specific function. We found that <italic>tim-short and cold</italic> encodes a protein that rescues the behavioral defects of <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> mutants, and that flies in which <italic>tim-short and cold</italic> is abrogated have abnormal locomotor activity. In addition, miRNA-mediated control limits the expression of some of these isoforms. Finally, data that we obtained using minigenes suggest that <italic>tim</italic> alternative splicing might act as a thermometer for the circadian clock.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>circadian</kwd><kwd>timeless</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>temperature</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM125859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kadener</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Temperature controls the circadian clock by directly regulating the alternative splicing of <italic>timeless.</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Circadian rhythms organize most physiological and behavioral processes into 24 hr cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allada and Chung, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pilorz et al., 2018</xref>). The current model postulates that circadian clocks keep time through a complex transcriptional-translational negative feedback loop that takes place in the so-called ‘clock cells’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shafer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Helfrich-Förster, 2003</xref>). It has been proposed that each clock cell functions autonomously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dissel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yoshii et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the master regulators, CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC), activate the circadian system by promoting the rhythmic transcription of several key clock genes. The products of three of these genes, PERIOD (PER), TIMELESS (TIM), and CLOCKWORK ORANGE (CWO), repress CLK-CYC-mediated transcription in an oscillatory manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hardin and Panda, 2013</xref>). These cycles of transcriptional activation and repression lead to 24-hr molecular oscillations, which ultimately generate behavioral rhythms. In addition to transcriptional control, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulatory processes are essential for circadian timekeeping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lim and Allada, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harms et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hardin and Panda, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kojima et al., 2011</xref>). For example, the transcriptional repressors PER and TIM are post-translationally modified; modification status and the rates with which these modifications take place have a significant influence on the degradation of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ozkaya and Rosato, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hardin and Panda, 2013</xref>). Modification of PER may also influence its transcriptional repressor activity or the timing of its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ozkaya and Rosato, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hardin and Panda, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Circadian clocks are extraordinarily robust systems; they are able to keep time accurately without timing cues. In addition, and despite their biochemical nature, they are resilient to large variations in environmental conditions. The robustness of the circadian system is probably the result of multiple layers of regulation that ensure accurate timekeeping and the buffering of stochastic changes in the molecular clockwork. These levels of regulation are physically and/or functionally interconnected and, importantly, they extend beyond the single-cell level. Circadian neurons in the brain are organized in a network that is believed to synchronize the individual neuronal oscillators, thereby contributing to a coherent and robust behavioral output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mezan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weiss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schlichting et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allada and Chung, 2010</xref>). The neuropeptide PDF, which is the main neuromodulator of the circadian neuronal network, is expressed in a small subset of these neurons. PDF is essential for normal activity patterns in light:dark (LD) cycles, as well as for persistent circadian rhythms in constant darkness (DD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Im et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Taghert and Shafer, 2006</xref>). Circadian clocks are also remarkably plastic systems. For example, organisms can quickly adjust to different light and temperature regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roessingh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wolfgang et al., 2013</xref>). The plasticity of the circadian clock results from the existence of very efficient input pathways that can convey external signals into the core oscillator machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ogueta et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>TIM is at the crossroads of the robustness and plasticity of the circadian clock. TIM is a core circadian oscillator component, and mutations in <italic>tim</italic> cause flies to have short, long, or no circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rothenfluh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sehgal et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Myers et al., 1995</xref>). TIM stabilizes PER, which is also essential for circadian rhythmicity, and this complex represses CLK-mediated transcription in an oscillatory manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hall, 2003</xref>). The stoichiometric relationship between PER, CLK, and TIM is tightly controlled and is probably the major regulator of circadian period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hardin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kadener et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fathallah-Shaykh et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, TIM is a key factor for communicating external information to the central core oscillator. For example, upon light stimulus, the protein encoded by <italic>cryptochrome</italic>, CRY, binds to TIM and promotes TIM degradation through the ubiquitin ligase Jetlag, which results in phase advances or delays of the circadian oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Emery et al., 1998</xref>). PDF signaling has also been proposed to synchronize the circadian clock by regulating TIM degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seluzicki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Temperature has diverse effects on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kidd et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afik et al., 2017</xref>). Flies show temperature-dependent changes in the distribution of daily locomotor activity, known as seasonal adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Majercak et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Low et al., 2008</xref>). Flies can also be entrained by daily temperature cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roessingh et al., 2015</xref>) and are phase-shifted by temperature pulses or steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glaser and Stanewsky, 2005</xref>). Flies keep 24 hr periods in a wide range of temperatures, a phenomenon known as temperature compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kidd et al., 2015</xref>). The adaptation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to different environmental conditions relies on the presence of at least two neuronal circuits: one that controls the morning component of locomotor activity (M) and another that controls the evening (E) burst of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stoleru et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grima et al., 2004</xref>). The environment fine-tunes the activity pattern by altering the timing of these oscillators. In the laboratory, mimicking summer by subjecting the flies to hot temperatures and long photoperiods shifts their M activity to pre-dawn and their E activity into the early night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Majercak et al., 1999</xref>). By contrast, under conditions that mimic autumn (shorter day lengths and cooler temperatures), the M and E activity components fall closer together and occur around the middle of the day.</p><p>In 1999, work from the Edery lab first linked the splicing of the <italic>per</italic> 3′ untranslated region (UTR) to seasonal adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Majercak et al., 1999</xref>). The evening advance in locomotor activity at lower temperatures correlates with an advance in the phase of oscillation of <italic>tim</italic> and <italic>per</italic> mRNAs. The authors postulated that this shift of the clock is driven by the alternative splicing of an intron located in the <italic>per</italic> 3′ UTR (dmpi8 intron). Further studies revealed that the efficiency of splicing of this intron is regulated not only by temperature but also by the photoperiod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2004</xref>). The effect of light on <italic>per</italic> splicing does not require a functional clock, and phospholipase C plays a physiological, non-photic role in regulating the production of the alternatively spliced transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Majercak et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, the splicing factor B52 (also called SRp55) binds to <italic>per</italic> 3′ UTR and modulates the splicing of the dmpi8 intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). A study published in 2008 examined the splicing pattern of <italic>per</italic> in the tropical species <italic>Drosophila yakuba</italic>, which faces no significant seasonal variation in day length or temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Low et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Russo et al., 1995</xref>). The <italic>per</italic> gene in <italic>D. yakuba</italic> has a 3′-terminal intron. This intron is removed over a wide range of temperatures and photoperiods, consistent with the marginal effect of temperature on this tropical species. Despite these findings, it is still not clear how the regulation of the 3′ UTR splicing impacts PER levels, or whether other transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional events may also influence the response to temperature changes. A recent report suggests that the effect of the <italic>per</italic> dmpi8 intron on midday siesta might be PER-independent, and that splicing of the <italic>per</italic> 3′ UTR acts in trans to regulate the expression of <italic>daywake</italic> (<italic>dyw</italic>), which encodes an anti-siesta factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yang and Edery, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Post-transcriptional control by miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins is important for circadian timekeeping in flies and other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lerner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kadener et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lim and Allada, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xue and Zhang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Rosbash, 2016</xref>). In addition, several recent reports show a role for alternative splicing in circadian timekeeping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Petrillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sanchez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). This is not surprising, given the prevalence of alternative splicing in the brain and the importance of this process in regulating the amount and type of mRNAs that are generated from a given locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baralle and Giudice, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanchez et al., 2011</xref>). Alternative mRNA processing is co-transcriptional and usually happens because of the presence of suboptimal processing signals (i.e., non-canonical splice sites or polyadenylation sites). Many factors can influence alternative splicing, including RNA structure, RNA-binding proteins, and the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de la Mata et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cáceres and Kornblihtt, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that temperature dramatically and specifically changes the splicing pattern of <italic>tim</italic>. We found that the reduced levels of the canonical TIM protein at 18°C result from the induction of two cold-specific splicing isoforms: <italic>tim-cold</italic> and <italic>tim-short and cold</italic> (<italic>tim-sc</italic>). <italic>tim-cold</italic> encodes a canonical TIM protein, but expression from this mRNA is under strong miRNA-mediated control, as shown by ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO1) immunoprecipitation and in vivo luciferase reporter assays. <italic>tim-sc</italic> encodes a short TIM isoform that can advance the phase of the circadian clock when overexpressed and that is able to partially rescue <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> flies. In addition, we established that TIM-SC binds to but does not stabilize PER. We generated flies that do not produce <italic>tim-sc</italic> using CRISPR technology. These flies display altered patterns of locomotor activity at 18°C and at 25°C, as well as altered expression of the other <italic>tim</italic> isoforms. Interestingly, most of the changes in <italic>tim</italic> splicing patterns are conserved across <italic>Drosophila</italic> species and correlate with the capacity of the species to adapt their activity to temperature changes. Moreover, we showed that the temperature-dependent changes in <italic>tim</italic> alternative splicing are independent of the circadian clock. These findings were reproduced using minigenes that contain the temperature-sensitive introns and two flanking exons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. The latter results strongly suggest that the intronic sequences of <italic>tim</italic> themselves are the temperature sensors that lead to changes in splicing that result in adaptation to a wide range of temperatures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Temperature remodels the circadian transcriptome</title><p>To analyze the effect of temperature on general and circadian gene expression, we evaluated gene expression genome-wide in the heads of flies maintained at 18°C, 25°C, or 29°C. Briefly, we performed 3′ RNA-seq at six time points in flies entrained to 12:12 LD cycles at these three temperatures. We identified hundreds of genes that had oscillating expression over the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Interestingly, most of the cycling RNAs were temperature specific: only a few RNAs had oscillating expression at all of the assayed temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The sets of mRNAs that oscillated at each temperature were enriched for different Gene Ontology (GO) terms, demonstrating that the circadian program is temperature dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a phase advance in several core circadian components at 18°C relative to 25°C or 29°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that the circadian clock gene expression program is advanced at low temperature. The phase advance mirrors the advance of the evening activity component observed at this lower temperature. Despite the clear behavioral differences, we observed smaller phase changes in the expression of circadian clock genes in flies entrained at 29°C compared to those entrained at 25°C than theobserved between 25°C and 18°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Majercak et al., 1999</xref>), <italic>tim</italic> and <italic>per</italic> mRNA profiles were advanced at 18°C compared to those at 25°C. This phase advance is transcriptional, as shown by analysis of chromatin-bound <italic>tim</italic> and <italic>per m</italic>RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This phase advance in the mRNA levels provokes a phase advance in TIM and PER protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Majercak et al., 1999</xref>). Nevertheless, there were no major changes in the overall levels of most circadian components when gene expression at different temperatures was compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Temperature remodels the circadian transcriptome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heat maps of normalized expression of genes that display 24 hr cycling expression at different temperatures.

When comparing to expression at 25°C, we observed both higher and lower abundance transcripts at both 18°C and 29°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

For example, we observed an increase in the expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, genes involved in protein folding, and genes involved in metabolic processes at 29°C compared to that at 25°C. At 18°C, we saw increased expression of proteins involved in cuticle development compared to that at 25°C, which is consistent with previous reports showing that cuticle deposition is temperature dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boothroyd et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ito et al., 2011</xref>).

The canonical transcript (referred to here as <italic>tim-L</italic>) did not significantly change in abundance with temperature, but the other three isoforms did. Two were more abundant at 18°C than at 25°C. One of these isoforms was previously described as being induced by cold temperatures and is called <italic>tim-cold</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boothroyd et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wijnen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Montelli et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>tim-cold</italic> includes an additional intron near the 3′ end of the canonical <italic>tim</italic> mRNA. As a result, it has a longer 3′ UTR than <italic>tim-L</italic>, but a stop codon at the beginning of the intron results in a slightly smaller protein than that produced from the canonical isoform. The other cold-enriched isoform, although previously annotated, had not been characterized. We named this isoform <italic>tim-short and cold</italic> (<italic>tim-sc</italic>), as it putatively encodes a much smaller protein than does <italic>tim-L. tim-sc</italic> mRNA is generated by the usage of an alternative cleavage and polyadenylation site located within intron 10 of <italic>tim</italic>. By contrast, the other isoforms are also generated as the result of intron retention, but the ends of their 3′ UTRs are the same as that of the canonical isoform. The third isoform that we identified potentially encodes a protein that is smaller than those encoded by <italic>tim-L</italic> and <italic>tim-cold</italic> and larger than that encoded by <italic>tim-sc.</italic> This isoform was recently described and named <italic>tim-tiny</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shakhmantsir et al., 2018</xref>). However, to avoid confusion with <italic>tim-sc</italic> (which encodes an even smaller isoform), we will call it <italic>tim-medium</italic> (<italic>tim-M</italic>). This isoform is generated by the inclusion of an intron that contains a stop codon and shares all downstream exons with <italic>tim-L</italic>. Hence, it has the longest 3′ UTR of all <italic>tim</italic> isoforms. The isoform <italic>tim-M</italic> was present at higher abundance in flies entrained to 25°C or 29°C than in those kept at 18°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>As <italic>tim-L, tim-cold</italic>, <italic>and tim-M</italic> share the same 3′ end, they are indistinguishable in the 3′ RNA-seq datasets. Therefore, on the basis of the 3′ RNA-seq data, we were only able to conclude that the overall levels of these isoforms combined do not change with temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By contrast, we detected a significant increase in the levels of <italic>tim-sc</italic> mRNA at 18°C compared to those at 25°C or 29°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We confirmed the temperature-dependent differences by qRT-PCR using isoform-specific primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Unfortunately, the levels of <italic>tim-L</italic> could not be unequivocally assessed by qRT-PCR because its sequence overlaps with that of <italic>tim-M.</italic> These data revealed that the temperature-dependent changes in the splicing patterns of <italic>tim</italic> are at least as impressive as the previously described changes in the splicing of a small intron in the 3′ UTR of <italic>per</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Majercak et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Using the whole-transcript RNA-seq datasets to quantify the relative amounts of each of the four isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Surprisingly, we found that <italic>tim-M</italic> constitutes about 50% of <italic>tim</italic> mRNAs at 25°C, a temperature at which the level of <italic>tim</italic> expression is similar, if not higher, than that of the canonical isoform <italic>tim-L.</italic> This suggests the existence of previously unknown aspects of <italic>tim</italic> regulation, even in canonical conditions. In comparison to the temperature-dependent differences observed in <italic>tim</italic> alternative splicing, the well-characterized changes in <italic>per</italic> alternative splicing are very modest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Low et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>To assess whether the observed changes in <italic>tim</italic> RNA processing that occur as a function of temperature also exist in the fly brain, we dissected the brains of flies entrained at 18°C, 25°C, and 29°C and measured the levels of each <italic>tim</italic> isoform by qRT-PCR. As observed when whole fly heads were analyzed, entrainment of the flies to lower temperatures (18°C) resulted in a strong increase of <italic>tim-sc</italic> and <italic>tim-cold</italic> levels compared to the levels in flies entrained at 25°C, and entrainment to higher temperatures (29°C) promoted <italic>tim-M</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Temperature-specific alternative splicing is conserved across <italic>Drosophila</italic> and correlates with temperature adaptation</title><p>If changes in the splicing pattern of <italic>tim</italic> are necessary for temperature adaptation, then these changes should be conserved among other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species that can adapt to temperature changes.

Although all three species displayed some degree of behavioral adaptation to temperature, we detected differences among them when analyzing the ratio between light and dark activity at the three assayed temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As expected, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> had a temperature-dependent gradient in their light/dark activity ratio, with the highest ratios at 18°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left). For the <italic>D. simulans</italic> strain analyzed, we also observed a significant decrease in light/dark activity ratios as the temperature increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, middle-left; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, upper left panel), suggesting that <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> have similar behavioral adaptation to high and low temperatures.

All transgenes were inserted into the same genomic location, and we expressed these UAS-transgenes using the <italic>tim-Gal4</italic> driver. We assessed luciferase levels on these flies after three days of entrainment to 18°C or 25°C. We observed no significant temperature-dependent (p&lt;0.53) or interaction (p&lt;0.46) effects. However, the luciferase levels of the transgenes carrying the 3′ UTRs of <italic>tim-L</italic> and <italic>tim-sc</italic> were high compared to those of the other two transgenes, suggesting that they are under little (or no) post-transcriptional control. Interestingly, much less luciferase was expressed from the reporter carrying the 3′ UTR of <italic>tim-cold</italic> than from the other reporters, suggesting that the presence of this 3′ UTR strongly diminishes the translation of this isoform, by affecting either the stability or translation of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Although less luciferase was expressed from the <italic>tim-M</italic> 3′ UTR reporter than from the <italic>tim-L</italic> and <italic>tim-sc</italic> reporters, the difference was considerably less than that observed with the <italic>tim-cold</italic> 3′ UTR.</p><p>To further understand the post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>tim</italic>, we analyzed the different 3′ UTRs for potential miRNA-binding sites using TargetScan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agarwal et al., 2015</xref>). The isoforms <italic>tim-L</italic>, <italic>tim-cold</italic>, and <italic>tim-M</italic> have a large number of putative miRNA-binding sites, many of which are evolutionary conserved and highly expressed in fly heads. <italic>tim-sc</italic> only had a handful of predicted miRNA-binding sites and was not bound to AGO-1 at any temperature, strongly suggesting that this isoform is not regulated by miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The miRNAs that are responsible for the association of <italic>tim</italic> isoforms with AGO1 might target only a temperature-specific isoform, might target more than one isoform, might be expressed in a temperature-dependent way, or might act through a combination of these mechanisms. We therefore sequenced AGO1-associated miRNAs from the heads of flies entrained to 12:12 LD cycles at 18°C, 25°C, and 29°C. Expression of most miRNAs was not affected by temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). We first focused on the miRNAs targeting the 3′ UTR region common to <italic>tim-L, tim-cold</italic>, and <italic>tim-M.</italic> Of the 17 miRNAs that are predicted to target this region, the levels of only two differed with temperature. One of them (miR-33) was increased at 29°C in comparison with the level at 18°C. Notably miR-969, which contains what is predicted to be a strong binding site in the 3′ UTR region common to <italic>tim-L, tim-cold</italic>, and <italic>tim-M</italic>, was strongly (~3-fold) upregulated at 18°C compared to 29°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). However, <italic>tim-M</italic> and <italic>tim-cold</italic> contain additional 3′ UTR regions, and these regions are predicted to be targeted by other miRNAs that are strongly regulated by temperature. Half of the miRNAs predicted to bind these <italic>tim</italic> isoforms were highly expressed at 18°C and half were highly expressed at 29°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>). This strongly suggests the existence of a miRNA-mediated mechanism that downregulates the expression of TIM-COLD and TIM-M at all temperatures. That TIM-COLD is indeed present at 18°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boothroyd et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wijnen et al., 2006</xref>) suggests that the main function of the miRNA-mediated regulation of this isoform is to impose a threshold that blocks the expression of this protein at temperatures other than 18°C, when the transcription levels of this isoform are lower.</p><p>In summary, these results strongly suggest that at 18°C, differences in the expression of the canonical TIM protein relative to levels at 25°C are due to the deviation of <italic>tim</italic> transcription toward the production of <italic>tim-sc</italic> and <italic>tim-cold</italic>, which is under strong post-transcriptional regulation. In addition, <italic>tim-L</italic>, <italic>tim-M</italic>, and <italic>tim-cold</italic> are subjected to stronger post-transcriptional control by miRNAs than are the other isoforms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Overexpression of TIM isoforms have different effects on circadian behavior</title><p>We next sought to determine the functionality of the different TIM isoforms. To do so, we generated plasmids to express each TIM protein isoform fused to a C-terminal FLAG tag; all coding regions were fused to the same 3′ UTR and were under the control of the UAS-promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Interestingly, anti-TIM antibodies efficiently detected TIM-L and TIM-COLD but not TIM-SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>, right).

To determine whether TIM-SC bound to PER, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in cells transfected with PER and TIM-SC and/or TIM-L.

Hence, we determined the strengths of the different splice sites in <italic>tim</italic> using publicly available software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reese et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Low et al., 2008</xref>). Almost all <italic>tim</italic> constitutive introns had strong 5′ and 3′ splice sites (scores above 0.6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the introns retained in <italic>tim-M</italic> and in <italic>tim-cold</italic> have a strong 5′ splice site and a weak 3′ splice site. This suggests that these isoforms result from alternative splicing due to the presence of weak 3′ splice sites. However, the splice sites of the intron associated with <italic>tim-sc</italic> have strong 5′ and 3′ splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Hence, it is possible that <italic>tim</italic> alternative splicing itself could be thermosensitive. To test this possibility, we utilized the <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells that do not express most circadian components, including <italic>Clk, per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic>. However, <italic>tim</italic> expression can be induced by expression of CLK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McDonald and Rosbash, 2001</xref>). We transfected these cells with a plasmid that drives the expression of <italic>Clk</italic> under the control of the <italic>metallothionein</italic> conditional promoter. After the induction of <italic>Clk,</italic> we cultured the cells at either 25°C or 18°C for 24 hr. We then collected the cells, extracted RNA, and characterized the splicing pattern of <italic>tim</italic> by qRT-PCR. For each of the alternative isoforms, we measured the ratio between the unspliced and spliced variants and compared the ratios obtained for the cells incubated at the two temperatures. This experiment reproduced the results obtained in vivo: the levels of <italic>tim-cold</italic> and <italic>tim-sc</italic> were higher at 18°C than at at 25°C, whereas <italic>tim-M</italic> expression showed the opposite trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). We did not observe temperature-induced changes in splicing of a constitutive <italic>tim</italic> exon (Control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), demonstrating that this effect is specific for the thermosensitive introns.</p><p>One intriguing possibility is that <italic>tim</italic> splicing itself functions as a thermometer. This could be accomplished if a temperature change, for example, results in the exposure of binding sites for a specific splicing factor. To test the possibility that splicing serves as a temperature sensor, we generated three different <italic>tim</italic> minigene reporters, consisting of the exons and intron involved in each <italic>tim</italic> alternative splicing event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). As observed in vivo and in the context of the whole <italic>tim</italic> gene in S2 cells, we observed a temperature-dependent effect on the splicing of the three different <italic>tim</italic> minigenes. We did not observe any temperature dependence in the splicing of a minigene generated from a constitutive exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), demonstrating a direct and specific effect of temperature on <italic>tim</italic> alternative splicing events.</p><p>To further understand the mechanism by which the different introns sense temperature, we used the algorithm Mfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zuker, 2003</xref>) to model the structure of the temperature-sensitive introns and their flanking exons. Interestingly, we found that the 5′ splice sites of the introns retained at low temperatures (i.e., those included in <italic>tim-sc</italic> and <italic>tim-cold</italic>) are predicted to be engaged in strong secondary structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). As RNA structures are more stable at lower temperatures, we postulate that these 5′ splice sites are less accessible at 18°C than at 25°C or 29°C, rendering these introns temperature-sensitive. There were no differences in the predicted secondary structures of the 5′ splice sites when the cleavage and polyadenylation sites were removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C</xref>). By contrast, the 5′ splice site of the intron retained at high temperature (which is part of <italic>tim-M</italic>) was not predicted to be part of a stable secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The decreased splicing efficiency of the <italic>tim-M</italic> intron at 29°C could be a consequence of the lower general efficiency of splicing at higher temperatures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we show that temperature dramatically and specifically changes the splicing pattern of the core circadian component <italic>tim</italic>. We found that the lower levels of the canonical TIM protein, TIM-L, that occur at 18°C compared to 25°C are due to the induction of two cold-specific splicing isoforms, <italic>tim-cold</italic> and <italic>tim-s</italic>c. The isoform <italic>tim-cold</italic> encodes a protein that is very similar to TIM-L, but its expression is under strong post-transcriptional control, as shown by the analysis of transcripts associated with AGO1 and in vivo luciferase reporter assays. Interestingly, temperature-dependent alterations in <italic>tim</italic> splicing patterns are conserved in several <italic>Drosophila</italic> species and correlate well with the capacity of the species to adapt their activity to temperature changes in the analyzed strains. However, we noticed that the behavioral pattern of <italic>D. virilis</italic> at the tested temperatures is intriguing, and it would be interesting to determine whether other strains of this species show the same patterns of behavior and splicing.</p><p>We found that overexpression of TIM-SC advances the phase and shortens the period of the circadian clock, suggesting that the expression of this isoform might mediate some of the changes seen upon induction of flies at 18°C. In addition, expression of TIM-SC rescues <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> phenotypes in LD (~50% of the flies that express TIM-SC display evening anticipation) and in DD (a similar number of flies show rhythmic behavior, in most flies with a shorter than 24 hr period). Finally, flies in which the production of <italic>tim-sc</italic> is abrogated display altered patterns of locomotor activity at 18°C and 25°C, as well as altered expression of the remaining <italic>tim</italic> isoforms, demonstrating the importance of <italic>tim-sc</italic> production. We attribute the partial rescues observed with both TIM-SC and TIM-L to the fact that these proteins were expressed using the GAL4-UAS system, resulting in high levels of TIM. In any case, our results suggest that TIM-SC is functional, although nearly half the size of the canonical TIM protein. Interestingly, the PER binding region of TIM, which is located within the regions from amino acid 715 through amino acid 914 of the canonical protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saez and Young, 1996</xref>), could be compromised in the short isoform, as TIM-SC is only 892 amino acids long. Indeed, we showed that TIM-SC can bind but cannot stabilize PER. It will be interesting to determine the mechanism of action of TIM-SC and to evaluate how this protein interacts with the CLK-PER transcriptional feedback loop. <italic>tim-cold</italic> is strongly regulated by miRNAs at all temperatures. Analysis of the <italic>tim-sc</italic> null mutant provides support for a specific (and even dominant) function of TIM-COLD. We observed that flies that cannot generate <italic>tim-sc</italic> produce more <italic>tim-cold</italic> and, although to a lesser degree, <italic>tim-L</italic> than wild-type flies. These mutant flies also display altered behavior: the flies seem ‘hyper-adapted’ to cold temperatures with high locomotor activity during the day even at 25°C. It is difficult to rationalize how increased levels of <italic>tim-L</italic> could trigger these cold-like behavioral patterns. We favor the possibility that the behavior observed in these flies at 25°C is due to the increased expression of <italic>tim-cold</italic> mRNA and protein. Previous work showed that TIM-COLD might act differently than TIM-L; indeed it displays weaker binding to CRY in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Montelli et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, the increase in TIM-COLD protein in the mutant flies might be significantly larger than the increase observed at the mRNA level. This could happen if, for example, the increase in <italic>tim-L</italic> mRNA indirectly increases TIM-COLD levels by titrating miR-969 or another miRNA that targets both <italic>tim-L</italic> and <italic>tim-cold</italic> mRNAs. Mutations that abrogate <italic>tim-cold</italic> expression or make it constitutive could help to reveal the mechanism behind this regulation.</p><p>Although <italic>tim-M</italic> is the most abundant RNA isoform, we did not detect TIM-M protein, suggesting that little or no translation of this RNA occurs. This agrees with recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shakhmantsir et al. (2018)</xref> who concluded that the major role of <italic>tim-M</italic> was to regulate TIM-L levels. Alternatively, the protein could be quickly degraded. However, this seems unlikely as we detected large amounts of TIM-M upon overexpression, suggesting that the putative protein is very stable. Moreover, our luciferase reporter experiments suggest that little protein is produced from this RNA, probably because of strong miRNA-mediated regulation (as also suggested by the AGO1 immunoprecipitation experiment). miRNAs exert their regulatory role either by promoting destabilization of mRNA or by inhibiting its translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iwakawa and Tomari, 2015</xref>). In the case of <italic>tim-M</italic>, this miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional control most probably occurs through direct translational repression. This would explain the very high mRNA levels of <italic>tim-M</italic> at certain temperatures (sometimes even greater than those of <italic>tim-L</italic>) and the lack of TIM-M protein expression. It is also possible that this RNA isoform is not exported from the nucleus; nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation experiments could test this possibility.</p><p>Although <italic>tim-cold</italic> and <italic>tim-M</italic> are strongly post-transcriptionally regulated at all temperatures, the RISC also binds strongly to <italic>tim-L</italic> at 18°C. <italic>tim</italic> has been reported to be regulated by miR-276a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Rosbash, 2016</xref>); our miRNA-seq experiments suggest that miR-969 might also be important for <italic>tim</italic> regulation. CRISPR experiments targeting the miR-969 site could help to determine this.</p><p>Despite the large number of RNAs and miRNAs that are regulated in a temperature-dependent manner, the impact of temperature on alternative splicing seems to be quite restricted. Our analysis of the data revealed that few transcripts other than <italic>tim, per</italic>, and <italic>Hsf</italic> appeared to be regulated by temperature (data not shown). Although splicing efficiency in vitro is strongly temperature dependent, flies might have developed mechanisms (such as compensatory changes in chromatin structure, RNA polymerase II elongation rate, or RNA editing; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchumenski et al., 2017</xref>) that make the outcome of alternative splicing largely temperature independent. The specificity of temperature-dependent <italic>tim</italic> splicing strongly suggests that these changes in <italic>tim</italic> splicing are unlikely to be due to the expression or activation of a specific splicing factor. This possibility is supported by the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foley et al., 2019</xref>, who showed that although <italic>psi</italic> regulates <italic>tim</italic> splicing, this factor on its own cannot explain the temperature sensitivity of these alternative splicing events.</p><p>We found that the expression of some miRNAs is affected by temperature, and that levels of several of the temperature-dependent miRNAs correlate with changes in the splicing isoform that they putatively regulate. Hence, the expression of particular miRNAs per se could act as a thermosensor. Our miRNA profiling and AGO1 immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that other mRNAs might also be regulated by miRNAs in a temperature-dependent way. It will be interesting to correlate these datasets that evaluate AGO1-bound miRNA and mRNA expression as a function of temperature in order to understand how the transcriptional and post-transcriptional expression programs are regulated by temperature. Given the central role of RNA structure in the biosynthesis of miRNAs, the production of some miRNAs could be influenced by temperature through effects on secondary structure of the primary transcripts.</p><p>The temperature-dependent changes in the abundance of the <italic>tim</italic> isoforms described here are unlikely to be due to regulation by miRNAs, and our data suggest that these changes are mainly due to differences in alternative splicing. First, <italic>tim-sc</italic> does not seem to be regulated by miRNAs at any temperature and still displays large temperature-dependent changes. Second, the AGO1 immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate a strong post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>tim</italic> at 18°C, when the levels of <italic>tim-cold</italic> are very high. Consequently, the changes in <italic>tim-cold</italic> levels cannot be the result of post-transcriptional control.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that the introns in isolation are able to sense and respond to temperature changes. Interestingly, <italic>tim-cold</italic> and <italic>tim-M</italic> respond in opposite ways to changes in temperatures: the intron found in <italic>tim-cold</italic> is strongly retained at 18°C while that in <italic>tim-M</italic> is more frequently skipped at this temperature. These results suggest that RNA structure probably plays a key role in making these splicing events temperature sensitive. Secondary structure prediction revealed no strong temperature-dependent differences. We found that the 5′ splice sites of the introns that are retained in <italic>tim-sc</italic> and <italic>tim-cold</italic> are highly engaged in secondary structures. As with any RNA secondary structure, these structures should be more stable at lower temperature, and this could hinder their recognition by the spliceosome and promote their retention at 18°C. On the other hand, neither the 5′ nor the 3′ splice sites of <italic>tim-M</italic> display strong secondary structures. As canonical splicing is less efficient in fly heads at higher temperatures (S Kadener, unpublished), the retention of this intron will be increased at 29°C despite the weaker 3′ splice site.</p><p>On the basis of these and previous results, we propose the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> of the effect of temperature on the expression of each <italic>tim</italic> transcript. This model accounts for the temperature-dependent thresholds for protein expression regulated by miRNA for the different <italic>tim</italic> isoforms. Briefly, at 25°C and 29°C, <italic>tim-L</italic> and <italic>tim-M</italic> isoforms represent the majority of <italic>tim</italic> mRNA, whereas <italic>tim-sc</italic> and <italic>tim-cold</italic> are most abundant at 18°C. <italic>tim-M</italic> is also a target of many miRNAs, some that are not differentially regulated by temperature and others that are more abundant at 29°C than at 18°C, or the opposite. We predict that the threshold imposed by miRNAs is high enough at all tested temperatures that no TIM-M is produced. We postulate that the <italic>tim-M</italic> transcript itself has a regulatory role, as recently suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shakhmantsir et al. (2018)</xref>. <italic>tim-cold</italic> is under strong miRNA regulation: at 25°C, when the production of this isoform is low, the miRNA-mediated control is enough to abolish most (if not all) TIM-COLD protein expression. However, at lower temperatures, the strong increase in <italic>tim-cold</italic> overcomes miRNA-mediated repression, and TIM-COLD is produced. In addition, at 18°C, <italic>tim-sc</italic> RNA and protein are produced. We hypothesize that both TIM-COLD and TIM-SC contribute to the phase advance and reduced night activity observed at 18°C. TIM-SC lacks the cytoplasmic retention domain and cannot stabilize PER, so the increased levels of this protein might lead to the phase advance observed at 18°C. At 29°C, <italic>tim-M</italic> levels are higher than at 25°C, but TIM amounts are not altered. This is probably the result of higher translation rates of TIM (<italic>tim-L</italic> association with AGO1 is modestly increased at the lowest temperature). Thus, co- and post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>tim</italic> modulate the amount and type of TIM proteins produced to facilitate temperature adaptation. We propose that this complex control of alternative splicing and miRNA-mediated control regulates the relationship between TIM and PER proteins. Last, but not least, our data suggest that <italic>tim</italic> alternative splicing might act as a thermometer for the circadian clock.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of the effects of thermosensitive alternative splicing of <italic>timeless</italic> in sensing and mediating temperature adaptation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Temperature affects each one of the four <italic>tim</italic> isoforms (<italic>tim-sc, tim-cold, tim-M</italic>, and <italic>tim-L</italic>, represented in dark blue, light blue, red, and gray, respectively) differently. <italic>tim-sc</italic> and <italic>tim-cold</italic> are more abundant at colder temperatures, whereas <italic>tim-M</italic> is expressed at higher temperatures.

at the appropriate 24 h period in the different thermal environments that these organisms inhabit. This temperature adaptation has yet to be understood in terms of mechanisms that convey environmental signals to the conserved core oscillator composed of PER, TIMELESS, CLOCK and CYCLE genes in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, whose individual activities and stoichometry are critical for the period of oscillation, previous work (e.g. Majercak et al., 1999) has implicated temperature dependent splicing of Per as playing a role in seasonal temperature adaptation and more recent observations have shown the involvement of alternative splicing of TIMELESS (e.g. Boothroyd et al., 2007; Shakhmantsir, 2018) in the control of circadian rhythms. In this work, Anduaga et al. examine the relationship between TIM splice isoforms and seasonal temperature-dependent changes in daily locomotor activity. In particular, Anduaga et al. show and characterize the expression of two 19 °C cold-specific splice isoforms: <italic>tim-cold</italic> and <italic>tim-short&amp;cold</italic> as well as a 29 °C warm temperature-selective isoform, tim-medium, with potentially different functions and activities. Key aspects of this alternative splicing pattern are conserved across non-equatorial <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. Further analyses address how these splice isoforms may affect TIM activity and argue that miRNAs could confer isoform-selective, post-transcriptional control of TIM expression. Thus, the work provides interesting new insight to how circadian rhythms remain constant across temperatures.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Thermosensitive alternative splicing senses and mediates temperature adaptation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors examine the relationship between TIM splice isoforms and seasonal temperature-dependent changes in daily locomotor activity, and so demonstrate that cold temperature (18 °C) downregulates the canonical <italic>tim</italic> transcript (<italic>tim-L</italic>) mRNA isoform. More interestingly, the authors report a concomitant induction of two cold-specific splicing isoforms [<italic>tim-short and cold (sc</italic>) and <italic>tim-cold</italic>]. Another isoform <italic>tim-M</italic> is present at high levels at all temperatures and is likely non-functional. TIM-sc is generated by use of an alternative polyA site; TIM-cold (previously reported) generates a shorter protein as it is an intron retained transcript (with premature stop) with a longer 3'UTR. Previous to this study, a number of papers had been published on <italic>per</italic> 3' splicing in the context of thermal adaptation of circadian locomotor rhythms by Edery's group. Some work has already been performed on <italic>tim-cold</italic> and <italic>tim-M (tim-tiny</italic>) by other groups. The more original results here relate to <italic>tim-sc</italic>, as well as its regulation by miRNAs.</p><p>The TIM -sc isoform is conserved and appears only at 18 °C in both <italic>D. simulans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, strongly suggesting a role in adaptation to cold temperatures. At the same time, TIM protein levels are reduced. Taking leads from other work (Chen and Rosbash, 2016) the authors examine post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs. Interestingly, AGO1 associated spliced isoforms clearly showed low-temperature dependent association of Tim-isoforms. Using cell-culture based luciferase reporter assays the 3'UTR of Tim-sc alone was shown to be under strong miRNA dependent regulation. Further, the authors carried out functional studies of locomotor behavior with flies overexpressing <italic>tim-sc</italic> (using <italic>tim-Gal4</italic> driver) and make interesting observation of advanced phase in evening locomotor behavior. The authors examined Crisper edited lines that abrogate processing of the <italic>tim-sc</italic> form. These mutants had a significant delay, at 18 °C, in the onset of evening activity, a phenotype also seen mildly at 25 °C. These data clearly show the functional significance of cold-based induction of Tim-sc isoform. Finally, they investigate the possibility that <italic>tim</italic> splicing per se functions as a thermometer for seasonal dependent adaptation and infer that the intronic sequences of <italic>tim</italic> serve as a thermosensor to modulate the temperature-specific splicing changes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major scientific issues to be addressed pertain to: (a) the need to more clearly establish the function of the <italic>tim-sc</italic> isoform. And (b) deeper consideration of the mechanism by which the <italic>tim-sc</italic> splicing event occurs. In addition, the manuscript could be tightened up and needs to be edited to improve readability and also grammar on occasion.</p><p>1) To test whether the <italic>tim</italic> isoforms are functional they should be put into a <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic> background to test whether they rescue rhythmicity at different temperatures. This is quite fundamental to the story. Sehgal's group have shown that <italic>tim-M</italic> partially rescues the mutant and <italic>tim-cold</italic> also rescues. It would be interesting to see what <italic>tim-sc</italic> does in a <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> background in LD and DD. It is not clear why this has not been done.</p><p>2) The model that temperature specificity of <italic>tim</italic> splicing arises from an intron serving as thermosensor is a particularly interesting aspect of the paper. It would be informative to present and discuss the predicted RNA secondary structures of exonic and intronic sequences involved in various <italic>tim</italic> alternative splicing events. What are the predicted secondary structure changes that occur on transitions from 18, 25 and 29 °C. Further, whether and which features of secondary structure change with polyadenylation and cleavage signal mutations (used for CRISPR based abrogation of <italic>tim-sc</italic>) in intron 10. An attempt should also be made (e.g. via mini-gene exon-intron constructs in S2 cells) to more definitively test if <italic>tim</italic> exon-introns themselves confer temperature dependent splicing pattern.</p><p>3) Considering the alternatively spliced isoform (<italic>tim-sc</italic>) codes for a functional protein, (subsection “Elimination of <italic>tim-sc</italic> results in changes in <italic>tim</italic> processing and locomotor activity”, last paragraph) the implications for its protein interactions are not clearly elucidated. Are the domains important for interaction with PER affected due to the alternative splicing? Is binding and stabilization of PER, and its migration to the nucleus normal?</p><p>Less critical issues:</p><p>4) General statistical point: the authors prefer to use multiple t-testing with the Holm-Sidak correction. Several analyses might be better served with ANOVA (one or two-way) with post hoc tests – far more elegant and informative for main effects and interactions, particularly in a two-way analysis, e.g. for the data in Figure 6D and E and possibly even 3-way for 6F.</p><p>5) Subsection “Temperature remodels the circadian transcriptome”, first paragraph. The authors used JTK cycle for analysis. What was the cut-off for significance and was a correction for multiple testing employed? I can't find this in the Materials and methods.</p><p>6) Subsection “Temperature remodels the circadian transcriptome”, first paragraph. Figure 1A – not obvious that cycling phase is earlier in the cold from these panels.</p><p>7) Subsection “Temperature remodels the circadian transcriptome”, first paragraph. Figure 1C earlier phase of clock genes – some of those clock genes do not show significant cycling – I had a quick look at the raw data in Supplementary file 1, so I am not sure what this figure really represents….It's only OK if you just include, <italic>per, tim</italic> and <italic>vri</italic> which cycle robustly.</p><p>8) Subsection “Cold temperature decreases TIM-L levels by two independent mechanisms”, first paragraph. Shakhmantsir et al., 2018, et al. may have seen a band on a western corresponding to <italic>tim-M</italic> (see their Figure 5B) so it does encode a TIM product.</p><p>9) Figure 4C and subsection “Cold temperature decreases TIM-L levels by two independent mechanisms”, third paragraph. When the authors state that LUC reporter levels were high – compared to what? This suggests not much miRNA involvement for <italic>tim-sc</italic>. However as the endogenous <italic>tim-sc</italic> levels in the flies head are low at 25 °C (Figure 2C), does this mean that these low levels are little to do with miRNAs destabilising the transcript?</p><p>10) Subsection “Overexpression of the different TIM isoforms alters circadian behavior differently”, first paragraph. Is there also a corresponding advance in the M component in <italic>tim-sc</italic> –.…certainly looks like it – maybe also in <italic>tim-cold</italic>?</p><p>11) Subsection “Elimination of <italic>tim-sc</italic> results in changes in <italic>tim</italic> processing and locomotor activity”, first paragraph. Some of the descriptions of the actograms are a bit subjective. I would have described the most obvious difference is the very strong siesta in the mutant at 29 °C. This is not mentioned. Also it appears that there is a reduction in M anticipation of lights on. One striking feature of Figure 6C is the lack of variation in the 40A profiles which makes it quite difficult to compare 40A with the control as the latter profiles seem so sloppy.</p><p>12) The authors conclude that <italic>tim-M</italic> and <italic>tim-cold</italic> are strongly post transcriptionally regulated through miRNAs at all temperatures. While this matches with expression levels for <italic>tim-cold</italic> in Figure 2C, it is unclear with regard to <italic>tim-M</italic> which is relatively highly expressed at all temperatures often higher than the canonical isoform (18&lt;25&lt;29). This needs to be explained.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Thermosensitive alternative splicing senses and mediates temperature adaptation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mani Ramaswami as Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers note that work linking generation of a 18C-specific, timeless splice isoform Tim-Sc to temperature-adaption of the circadian clock has been improved and tightened by several additional experiments. New analysis of Tim-Sc Per interactions and as well as phenotypic effects of <italic>tim-sc</italic> expression in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> flies are consistent with that Tim-sc triggered, PER independent (but yet unspecified) mechanisms in temperature-adaptation of circadian clock.</p><p>However, the manuscript requires extensive text revisions and some simple experimental additions before it can be considered acceptable for publication. The text is dense, difficult to read and appears to have been hastily assembled and needs a fair bit of work to make it more reader-friendly. It also contains several errors including an incorrect description of <italic>tim-sc</italic> which is fundamental to this manuscript and missing references. Further, it includes statements that are not supported by the data. Several very general claims about the <italic>tim</italic> splicing representing general cellular thermometers go way beyond the results – when a simple experiments exist to determine whether this may be true or not. Several, lines of changes are required. First, the manuscript needs to be carefully edited for clarity, grammar and accuracy to be easily accessible and comprehensive to the reader. And second, particularly given that the conclusions, while interesting are not decisive with respect to the mechanism by which Tim-Sc works, some key behavioral experiments (comments 12, 13) should also be conducted at colder temperatures (18 °C) to better test implications that the RNA modelling suggests for stability changes with temperature.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The opening sentence makes no sense – ' degradation of genes'? Maybe 'clock gene products'?</p><p>2) 'little is known…’ appears to be a bit harsh? Others who work in the field such as Ralf Stanewsky and Isaac Edery may disagree with this and perhaps their insights should be acknowledged.</p><p>3) Introduction, third paragraph. TIM is not the key factor, it's a key factor.</p><p>4) Introduction, third paragraph. <italic>tim</italic> is the key factor for light signalling' not 'TIM is the key pathway for conveying external information to the circadian system at the molecular level.' The authors are overplaying the role of TIM in all environmental inputs, light, temperature, social, etc. This is incorrect…</p><p>5) Introduction, fourth paragraph. Majercak et al., 2004, should also be cited along with Collins et al., 2004.</p><p>6) Introduction, fourth paragraph. The Edery group has done a lot of additional work on <italic>per</italic> splicing which has clarified somewhat how <italic>per</italic> splicing might impinge on thermal adaptation. Should be elaborated a little here.</p><p>7) Most figures – the authors need to state what the error bars represent -SEMS?</p><p>8) Subsection “Temperature modulates <italic>tim</italic> alternative splicing”, first paragraph – there is a 3 fold increase at low temperature of <italic>per</italic> spliced, so <italic>tim</italic> is not the only clock gene with a significant thermal splicing pattern. Also Montelli et al., 2015, showed that at 10 °C <italic>per</italic> spliced reflects about 50% of total transcript and <italic>tim-cold</italic> about 90% of <italic>tim</italic> transcript at this temperature even though overall <italic>tim</italic> levels are low. It is surprising that this highly relevant study is not even mentioned or cited. We note that it is mentioned in the third paragraph of the Discussion in a different context but does not appear in the references.</p><p>9) 'In contrast to the other isoforms which are generated by intron retention, <italic>tim-sc</italic> mRNA is generated by the usage of an alternative cleavage and polyadenylation site located within the intron 10 of <italic>tim</italic> which can only be used before this intron is spliced out.'</p><p>10) Apart from being ungrammatical, this sentence makes no biological sense. The authors suggest that the intron is spliced out. If so how can the STOP, cleavage and polyA sites be used? Surely this intron or part of it must also be retained?</p><p>11) 'As mentioned above, this isoform appears only at 18 °C, strongly suggesting that this isoform is responsible for the adaptation to cold temperatures'. This is an intuitive leap based on a correlation – no causation can be implied at this stage. If this was the case would not one expect higher levels of <italic>tim-sc</italic> and <italic>tim-cold</italic> in <italic>D. virilis</italic> at colder temperatures? So why is it 'surprising' that <italic>D. virilis</italic> does show higher levels of <italic>tim-cold</italic> at lower temperatures Doesn't the presence of <italic>tim-cold</italic> in all species at higher levels at colder temperatures argue that this is the conserved, important transcript for cold adaptation?</p><p>12) Figure 5 – Why was the behavioral analysis nor also performed at 18 °C given that all this is done in a WT background? This needs to be done and included and the findings discussed.</p><p>13) Figure 6A to C. Again, might it not be useful to examine rescue of <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> at lower temperature? Perhaps the different UTRs are more or less stable at different temperatures? This appears to be worth a shot perhaps given the last section on RNA structure?</p><p>14) 'These results demonstrate that despite the smaller size, <italic>tim-sc</italic> encodes a fully functional TIM protein'. Why 'fully' with only 42% rescue?</p><p>15) 'Control flies presented two different responses when transferred to 18 °C: a delay of the evening component as well as a decreased night activity in comparison to the flies maintained at 25 °C '(Figure 6C, 6D and 6E).' Do the authors mean Figure 7C, D, E.</p><p>16) 'In addition, the activity patterns of 40A flies are strikingly similar at the different temperatures.' Not really, and no more similar than controls. If one examines panels 7D and 7E the two phenotypes change more in 40A than in controls.</p><p>17) 'Last but not least, our data suggest that <italic>tim</italic> alternative splicing might act as a thermometer for the cell.' This is a very general statement, not even limited to the circadian clock. If this is the case then other temperature dependent phenotypes should also be affected by the <italic>tim</italic>-splicing mutants. Why don't the authors check one of these out, for example the temperature at which temperature-sensitive mutants become paralysed e.g. shits, parats etc? Simple enough to do but unlikely to support the authors general claim.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44642.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major scientific issues to be addressed pertain to: (a) the need to more clearly establish the function of the tim-sc isoform.

To address this issue, we determined whether TIM-SC can rescue the behavioral rhythms of <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> flies. We found that expression of UAS-<italic>tim-sc</italic> using the <italic>Tim-</italic>Gal4 driver rescues the <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> phenotype in LD (Figures 6A, C). Additionally, we observe a partial rescue (~40% of the flies) in DD. Interestingly, we found that the flies in which locomotor rhythms are rescued, the period is shorter than 24hs (23 h, Figure 6B-C). These results demonstrate that despite the significantly shorter size, TIM-SC is functional.</p><p>In addition, and as proposed by the reviewers, we overexpressed <italic>tim-sc</italic> and <italic>tim-L</italic> in <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic> flies. We observed an evening component in a small percentage of the flies (18%) suggesting that TIM-SC can act in a PER-independent fashion. In any case the flies remain arrhythmic in DD (Figure 6—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The model that temperature specificity of tim splicing arises from an intron serving as thermosensor is a particularly interesting aspect of the paper. It would be informative to present and discuss the predicted RNA secondary structures of exonic and intronic sequences involved in various tim alternative splicing events. What are the predicted secondary structure changes that occur on transitions from 18, 25 and 29 °C. Further, whether and which features of secondary structure change with polyadenylation and cleavage signal mutations (used for CRISPR based abrogation of tim-sc) in intron 10. An attempt should also be made (e.g. via mini-gene exon-intron constructs in S2 cells) to more definitively test if tim exon-introns themselves confer temperature dependent splicing pattern.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now utilized a software to predict the secondary structure of the temperature sensitive introns and their flanking exons. Interestingly, we found that the 5’ splice site in the introns whose splicing prevents the generation of <italic>tim-sc</italic> or <italic>tim-cold</italic> are strongly engaged in secondary structures. We postulate that at lower temperatures these structures are more stable (as any RNA secondary structure) and hence less accessible for recognition by the spliceosome. This could explain why these introns are not recognized as such at 18 °C and remain in the mRNA. Interestingly, the cleavage and polyadenylation signal required for the generation of the <italic>tim-sc</italic> isoform is not engaged in secondary structure. On the other hand, the predicted RNA structures of the intron contained in <italic>tim-M</italic> suggest that neither the 5’ or 3’ splice site are engaged in secondary structure. As splicing efficiency is generally increased at lower temperatures, it is not surprising that this intron will be more skipped at 29 °C, leading to larger amounts of <italic>tim-M</italic> RNA. Last, we also showed that the predicted RNA structure of the <italic>tim-sc</italic> intron and flanking exons does not change by the deletion of the cleavage and polyadenylation site sequence in the intron. We believe that these assessments together with the minigene experiments make a strong case for the possibility that the introns themselves act as thermometers. We thank the reviewer for suggesting solving this issue and have included the predicted structures as well as this explanation in the new version of the manuscript (Figure 8—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Considering the alternatively spliced isoform (tim-sc) codes for a functional protein, (subsection “Elimination of tim-sc results in changes in tim processing and locomotor activity”, last paragraph) the implications for its protein interactions are not clearly elucidated. Are the domains important for interaction with PER affected due to the alternative splicing? Is binding and stabilization of PER, and its migration to the nucleus normal?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing this up. Two regions in TIM are known to be crucial for interacting with PER: one that includes the nuclear localization signal and the other one between amino acid 715 and amino acid 914 of the canonical TIM protein (Saez and Young, 1996). As <italic>tim-sc</italic> encodes a truncated version of the TIM protein (892 aalong), it is possible that the ability of TIM-SC to bind or interact with PER is compromised. We therefore tested whether TIM-SC can bind and stabilize PER. Indeed, in experiments performed in S2 cells, we showed that while TIM-L strongly stabilizes PER (as previously reported), TIM-SC expression does not result in PER stabilization. In addition, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments and found that both TIM-L and TIM-SC can bind to PER. Moreover, TIM-SC binding seems to be strong as it can persist in presence of TIM-L. These results show that TIM-SC acts by a different mechanism which involves PER binding but not PER stabilization. We have added these experiments to the new version of the manuscript (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). We thank the reviewers for bringing this up as it has really improved the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Less critical issues:</p><p>4) General statistical point: the authors prefer to use multiple t-testing with the Holm-Sidak correction.

Following their advice, we have reanalyzed the data in Figure 3A, 4B, 6D, 6E, 6F, 7B and 7D using Two-way ANOVA. We incorporated these results in the new version of the manuscript.

Briefly, a gene was considered as cycling if the JTK p-value was less than 0.05 and the amplitude was more than 1.5. In addition, we have now cited Hughes et al., 2010, in the Materials and methods, where it is stated that the JTK test performs a Bonferroni-adjustment for correcting for multiple testing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “Temperature remodels the circadian transcriptome”, first paragraph.

The point we are trying to convey is that there are rhythmic transcripts at all temperatures. However, as you can see in the Venn diagram in Figure 1B, there are not many transcripts that are cycling at all temperatures, which makes this advance on the cycling impossible to see unless you focus in particular genes as it is done in Figure 1C. We have now changed this in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Subsection “Temperature remodels the circadian transcriptome”, first paragraph. Figure 1C earlier phase of clock genes – some of those clock genes do not show significant cycling – I had a quick look at the raw data in Supplementary file 1, so I am not sure what this figure really represents….It's only OK if you just include, per, tim and vri which cycle robustly.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the point raised by reviewers. We originally included <italic>Clk</italic> and <italic>cry</italic> in this analysis but they are not as strong cyclers as <italic>per, tim</italic> or <italic>vri</italic> which could cause confusion. We have now limited the analysis to the strong cyclers (as suggested) and observe a clear advance in their peak of expression at 18 °C compared to 25 °C (Figure 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection “Cold temperature decreases TIM-L levels by two independent mechanisms”, first paragraph.

Indeed, Shakhmantsir et al., 2018 describe a band that corresponds to TIM-M when overexpressing TIM<sup>TINY</sup> (reported as TIM-M throughout our manuscript), but not in the control, suggesting that there not endogenous TIM-M protein. In any case, we favor the hypothesis in which this transcript is under strong post-transcriptional regulation (as shown in Figure 4C) which might prevent its translation in normal conditions (i.e. without overexpression, which could end up going over the miRNA-dependent threshold for translation). Regardless, we agree that non-functional would be more accurate and this has now been corrected in the new version of the manuscript (subsection “Cold temperature decreases TIM-L levels by two independent mechanisms”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 4C and subsection “Cold temperature decreases TIM-L levels by two independent mechanisms”, third paragraph. When the authors state that LUC reporter levels were high – compared to what? This suggests not much miRNA involvement for tim-sc. However as the endogenous tim-sc levels in the flies head are low at 25 °C (Figure 2C), does this mean that these low levels are little to do with miRNAs destabilising the transcript?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this point. In Figure 4C, we compare the levels of luciferase obtained from the flies expressing the different reporters amongst themselves. We observed that the reporters including the <italic>tim-M</italic> or <italic>tim-cold</italic> 3’ UTR are significantly lower than the other reporters (those including <italic>tim-sc</italic> or <italic>tim-L</italic> 3’ UTRs). As all reporters are expressed at the same level (because the transgenes are inserted in the same genomic location) we assume that the differences are due to post-transcriptional control. Our hypothesis would be that the low levels of <italic>timsc</italic> at 25 °C are due to a lower retention of this intron at higher temperatures and not to an increased destabilization of the transcript by miRNAs or other posttranscriptional mechanisms. We have now rewritten this section to simplify and clarify this point (subsection “Cold temperature decreases TIM-L levels by two independent mechanisms”) as well as added a paragraph on the Discussion about this topic (seventh paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Subsection “Overexpression of the different TIM isoforms alters circadian behavior differently”, first paragraph. Is there also a corresponding advance in the M component in tim-sc – certainly looks like it – maybe also in tim-cold?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We had indeed quantified it and, although the trend is similar, we didn’t find statistically significant differences in the advance of the morning anticipation. We now added these results into Figure 5B and added a sentence in the first paragraph of the subsection “Overexpression of the different TIM isoforms alters circadian behavior differently”, to describe this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Subsection “Elimination of tim-sc results in changes in tim processing and locomotor activity”, first paragraph. Some of the descriptions of the actograms are a bit subjective. I would have described the most obvious difference is the very strong siesta in the mutant at 29 °C. This is not mentioned. Also it appears that there is a reduction in M anticipation of lights on. One striking feature of Figure 6C is the lack of variation in the 40A profiles which makes it quite difficult to compare 40A with the control as the latter profiles seem so sloppy.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewers are right. We have repeated this experiment multiple times but this lower variability in the 40A mutants compared to the controls has been consistent. We have modified the text to include the strong mid-day siesta phenotype exhibited by the mutants at 29 °C (subsection “Elimination of <italic>tim-sc</italic> results in changes in <italic>tim</italic> processing and locomotor activity, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The authors conclude that tim-M and tim-cold are strongly post transcriptionally regulated through miRNAs at all temperatures. While this matches with expression levels for tim-cold in Figure 2C, it is unclear with regard to tim-M which is relatively highly expressed at all temperatures often higher than the canonical isoform (18&lt;25&lt;29). This needs to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. Indeed, from the luciferase levels in flies overexpressing <italic>luciferase</italic> fused to the different <italic>tim</italic> 3’ UTRs we conclude that <italic>tim-M</italic> is also under strong post-transcriptional regulation. Additionally, in the AGO1-IP followed by small RNA sequencing we found that some of the miRNAs that have been predicted to bind to <italic>tim-M</italic> change in a temperature dependent manner (some being upregulated while other get downregulated with increasing temperature). This suggests to us that <italic>tim-M</italic> is under a strong post-transcriptional regulation at all temperatures. Although, as the reviewers mention, <italic>tim-M</italic> expression is very high at most temperatures, we argue that this strong posttranscriptional regulation does not conflict with the expression levels shown in Figure 2C as miRNAs can act by destabilizing mRNA and/or inhibiting translation. We have now acknowledged this in the Discussion (fourth paragraph).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers note that work linking generation of a 18C-specific, timeless splice isoform Tim-Sc to temperature-adaption of the circadian clock has been improved and tightened by several additional experiments. New analysis of Tim-Sc Per interactions and as well as phenotypic effects of tim-sc expression in per<sup>0</sup> flies are consistent with that Tim-sc triggered, PER independent (but yet unspecified) mechanisms in temperature-adaptation of circadian clock.</p><p>However, the manuscript requires extensive text revisions and some simple experimental additions before it can be considered acceptable for publication. The text is dense, difficult to read and appears to have been hastily assembled and needs a fair bit of work to make it more reader-friendly. It also contains several errors including an incorrect description of tim-sc which is fundamental to this manuscript and missing references. Further, it includes statements that are not supported by the data. Several very general claims about the tim splicing representing general cellular thermometers go way beyond the results – when a simple experiments exist to determine whether this may be true or not. Several, lines of changes are required. First, the manuscript needs to be carefully edited for clarity, grammar and accuracy to be easily accessible and comprehensive to the reader. And second, particularly given that the conclusions, while interesting are not decisive with respect to the mechanism by which Tim-Sc works, some key behavioral experiments (comments 12, 13) should also be conducted at colder temperatures (18 °C) to better test implications that the RNA modelling suggests for stability changes with temperature.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions. We have now included behavioral and additional luciferase experiments at 18 °C. We have also carefully edited the manuscript to clarify several ambiguous aspects and added the missing references. We thank the reviewers for help us improving the manuscript.</p><p>Please find our point-by-point answer to the reviewers’ comments below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The opening sentence makes no sense – ' degradation of genes'?

We have now modified the Abstract in the new version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) 'little is known…’ appears to be a bit harsh?

The authors are overplaying the role of TIM in all environmental inputs, light, temperature, social, etc. This is incorrect.</p></disp-quote><p>Answer to points 3 and 4: the reviewers are correct and we thank them for bringing this up. We have rephrased these statements in the new version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Introduction, fourth paragraph. Majercak et al., 2004, should also be cited along with Collins et al., 2004.</p></disp-quote><p>We added this citation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Introduction, fourth paragraph. The Edery group has done a lot of additional work on per splicing which has clarified somewhat how per splicing might impinge on thermal adaptation. Should be elaborated a little here.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct. We have added a few new sentences to the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Most figures – the authors need to state what the error bars represent -SEMS?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, the error bars do indeed represent the SEM. We have now corrected this in all the legends of figures and figure supplements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection “Temperature modulates tim alternative splicing”, first paragraph – there is a 3 fold increase at low temperature of per spliced, so tim is not the only clock gene with a significant thermal splicing pattern. Also Montelli et al., 2015, showed that at 10 °C per spliced reflects about 50% of total transcript and tim-cold about 90% of tim transcript at this temperature even though overall tim levels are low. It is surprising that this highly relevant study is not even mentioned or cited. We note that it is mentioned in the third paragraph of the Discussion in a different context but does not appear in the references.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this point. We have described the patterns that we found more in detail now to address this issue. It is important to point out that cold induced isoforms represent more than 50% of all <italic>tim</italic> mRNAs at 18 °C and less than 10% at 25 °C, while the cold-induced isoform of <italic>per</italic> is no more than 30% of the transcripts at 18 °C. Montelli et al., 2015 had been cited a couple of sentences after when we described the <italic>tim-cold</italic> isoform and multiple times throughout the manuscript. However, we agree that adding a sentence clarifying that the patterns of temperature dependent <italic>per</italic> splicing could be amplified in a different temperature range could add to the manuscript. We have added this to the new version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) 'In contrast to the other isoforms which are generated by intron retention, tim-sc mRNA is generated by the usage of an alternative cleavage and polyadenylation site located within the intron 10 of tim which can only be used before this intron is spliced out.'</p></disp-quote><p>See below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Apart from being ungrammatical, this sentence makes no biological sense. The authors suggest that the intron is spliced out. If so how can the STOP, cleavage and polyA sites be used? Surely this intron or part of it must also be retained?</p></disp-quote><p>Points 9 and 10: We thank the reviewers for noticing this mistake. Indeed, <italic>tim-sc</italic> is due to the retention of intron 10. Nevertheless, we wanted to emphasize that, unlike the order isoforms, <italic>tim-sc</italic> has an independent cleavage and polyA site. We have rephrased the sentence now to make it clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) 'As mentioned above, this isoform appears only at 18 °C, strongly suggesting that this isoform is responsible for the adaptation to cold temperatures'. This is an intuitive leap based on a correlation – no causation can be implied at this stage. If this was the case would not one expect higher levels of tim-sc and tim-cold in D. virilis at colder temperatures? So why is it 'surprising' that D. virilis does show higher levels of tim-cold at lower temperatures Doesn't the presence of tim-cold in all species at higher levels at colder temperatures argue that this is the conserved, important transcript for cold adaptation?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. We agree that correlation does not imply causation and have softened the statement. However, only the appearance of <italic>timsc</italic> correlates with differences in the day/night ration between 18 °C and 25 °C. We agree that the wider evolutionary conservation might suggest that <italic>tim-cold</italic> is important for general adaptation of the circadian system to temperature changes. However, we argue that <italic>tim-sc</italic> could be important for the flies to distinguish between 18 °C vs. 25 °C as from the strains analyzed in this study, only <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> (both of which express <italic>tim-sc</italic>) seem to have this defined temperature-dependent activity patterns between 18 °C and 25 °C. Although it is true that <italic>D. virilis</italic> also displays activity differences between these two temperatures, the pattern is the opposite (higher Day/night ratio of activity at 25 °C instead of lower). Additionally, <italic>tim-cold</italic> seems to be highly expressed in this strain, even at high temperatures (29 °C). In any case, we get the point and we modified the text to “important for” instead of “responsible for”, as indeed correlation does not imply causation at this stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 5 – Why was the behavioral analysis nor also performed at 18 °C given that all this is done in a WT background? This needs to be done and included and the findings discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the point raised by the reviewers and have performed the experiment at 18 °C as suggested. However, we would like to point out that the main objective of that experiment was to determine the functionality of the proteins (in particular TIM-SC). In any case we included the new experiment in the new version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Figure 6A to C. Again, might it not be useful to examine rescue of tim<sup>01</sup> at lower temperature? Perhaps the different UTRs are more or less stable at different temperatures? This appears to be worth a shot perhaps given the last section on RNA structure?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the point raised by the reviewers and have performed the experiment at 18 ºC as suggested. However, we would like to point out that all the <italic>tim</italic> overexpression constructs contain the same 3’ UTR (SV40, which is not controlled post-transcriptionally).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) 'These results demonstrate that despite the smaller size, tim-sc encodes a fully functional TIM protein'. Why 'fully' with only 42% rescue?</p></disp-quote><p>We based our assessment on the fact that the canonical TIM-L protein rescues at a similar extent. We interpret this partial rescue to the use of the GAL4 system and not the endogenous promoter to drive TIM expression. In any case, we have softened this statement and added a few sentences to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) 'Control flies presented two different responses when transferred to 18 °C: a delay of the evening component as well as a decreased night activity in comparison to the flies maintained at 25 °C '(Figure 6C, 6D and 6E).' Do the authors mean Figure 7C, D, E.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing this up. We have corrected the mistake in the new version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) 'In addition, the activity patterns of 40A flies are strikingly similar at the different temperatures.' Not really, and no more similar than controls. If one examines panels 7D and 7E the two phenotypes change more in 40A than in controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this up. We have corrected accordingly. As we explain in the text, we interpret the still high day/night activity at 18 °C to the rerouting of transcription towards the <italic>tim-cold</italic> splicing variant (Figure 7F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) 'Last but not least, our data suggest that tim alternative splicing might act as a thermometer for the cell.' This is a very general statement, not even limited to the circadian clock. If this is the case then other temperature dependent phenotypes should also be affected by the tim-splicing mutants. Why don't the authors check one of these out, for example the temperature at which temperature-sensitive mutants become paralysed e.g. shits, parats etc? Simple enough to do but unlikely to support the authors general claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the point raised by the reviewers. We have modified the statement to make it specific to the circadian clock.</p></body></sub-article></article>
