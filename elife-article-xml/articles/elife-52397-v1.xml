We believe that their contribution was underestimated and that they should have been included as authors. For example, after revisiting their contributions Dr. Blanco-Centurion had in fact additionally contributed to revising the manuscript whereas Dr. Luo and Mr. Vidal-Ortiz had also additionally participated in some of the animal surgery and data processing. We believe they meet the criteria for authorship and all authors agree they should be included in the author list.</p><p>Revised author list:</p><p>Ying Sun, Carlos Blanco-Centurion, Emmaline Bendell, Aurelio Vidal-Ortiz, Siwei Luo, Meng Liu</p><p>Original author list for reference:</p><p>Ying Sun, Emmaline Bendell, Meng Liu</p><p>Author details for the omitted authors:</p><p><bold>Carlos Blanco-Centurion</bold></p><p>Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, United States</p><p>Contribution: Conceptualization, Methodology, software, Writing—review and editing</p><p>Competing interests: No competing interests declared</p><p><bold>Aurelio Vidal-Ortiz</bold></p><p>Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, United States</p><p>Contribution: Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p><p>Competing interests: No competing interests declared</p><p><bold>Siwei Luo</bold></p><p>Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, United States</p><p>Contribution: Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p><p>Competing interests: No competing interests declared</p><p>Revised Acknowledgements:</p><p>We thank Dr. Priyattam Shiromani for the advice, guidance, and technical support that made it possible to complete the study.
