Peptides with the right properties, for example Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), can disrupt this protective barrier by formation of leaky pores. Unfortunately, matching peptide properties with their ability to selectively form pores in bacterial membranes remains elusive. In particular, the proline/glycine kink in helical peptides was reported to both increase and decrease antimicrobial activity. We used computer simulations and fluorescence experiments to show that a kink in helices affects the formation of membrane pores by stabilizing toroidal pores but disrupting barrel-stave pores. The position of the proline/glycine kink in the sequence further controls the specific structure of toroidal pore. Moreover, we demonstrate that two helical peptides can form a kink-like connection with similar behavior as one long helical peptide with a kink. The provided molecular-level insight can be utilized for design and modification of pore-forming antibacterial peptides or toxins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>antibiotics</kwd><kwd>membrane structure</kwd><kwd>fluorescent probes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GA17-11571S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tuerkova</surname><given-names>Alzbeta</given-names></name><name><surname>Kabelka</surname><given-names>Ivo</given-names></name><name><surname>Králová</surname><given-names>Tereza</given-names></name><name><surname>Sukeník</surname><given-names>Lukáš</given-names></name><name><surname>Vácha</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19-26854X</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pokorná</surname><given-names>Šárka</given-names></name><name><surname>Hof</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LQ1601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Türková</surname><given-names>Alžběta</given-names></name><name><surname>Kabelka</surname><given-names>Ivo</given-names></name><name><surname>Králová</surname><given-names>Tereza</given-names></name><name><surname>Sukeník</surname><given-names>Lukáš</given-names></name><name><surname>Vácha</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LM2015070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Türková</surname><given-names>Alžběta</given-names></name><name><surname>Kabelka</surname><given-names>Ivo</given-names></name><name><surname>Králová</surname><given-names>Tereza</given-names></name><name><surname>Sukeník</surname><given-names>Lukáš</given-names></name><name><surname>Vácha</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LM2015085</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Türková</surname><given-names>Alžběta</given-names></name><name><surname>Kabelka</surname><given-names>Ivo</given-names></name><name><surname>Králová</surname><given-names>Tereza</given-names></name><name><surname>Sukeník</surname><given-names>Lukáš</given-names></name><name><surname>Vácha</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LM2015042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Türková</surname><given-names>Alžběta</given-names></name><name><surname>Kabelka</surname><given-names>Ivo</given-names></name><name><surname>Králová</surname><given-names>Tereza</given-names></name><name><surname>Sukeník</surname><given-names>Lukáš</given-names></name><name><surname>Vácha</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proline/glycine kink in the helical peptides affects the peptide ability to form membrane pores by stabilising toroidal pore structures but disrupting barrel-stave pore structures.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the greatest threats to global health is the emergence and spreading of bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fair and Tor, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">WHO, 2017</xref>). Despite the many safety measures, resistant bacteria can be commonly found in clinical settings, causing the so-called nosocomial infections. Such infections are associated with higher hospital costs due to extended treatment, life-threatening conditions, and increased mortality. Each year, hundreds of thousands of people die after contracting an infection caused by drug-resistant bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">WHO, 2017</xref>). Moreover, infections by resistant bacteria are projected to become one of the leading causes of premature death in the upcoming decades. Unfortunately, the current rate of introducing novel antimicrobial drugs is very low and new classes of antibiotics have not been approved for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nelson et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, there is a need for the development of new types of pharmaceuticals.</p><p>One of the promising candidates for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). AMPs are naturally occurring peptides that comprise of both (1) host-defense peptides, i.e., components of innate immune system of many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fosgerau and Hoffmann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peters et al., 2010</xref>) and (2) peptide toxins with antimicrobial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zasloff, 2002</xref>). To this day, thousands of AMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) were discovered and many of them exhibit their activity (against bacteria, viruses, fungi, or cancer cells) even at micromolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaspar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Falco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoskin and Ramamoorthy, 2008</xref>). AMPs have not been adopted as widely as conventional antibiotics due to their common toxicity, increased tendency for degradation by proteases, high cost, and decreased activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mahlapuu et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, the rational design is not feasible, because we lack the understanding of the sequence-to-function relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Even a single residue substitution can have profound effect on the peptide activity and its mechanism of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A wide variety of mechanisms of action were proposed for AMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). AMPs can be directly responsible for killing the pathogens or they can act as immunomodulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">van der Does et al., 2019</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). The direct mechanisms include (but are not limited to): (1) agglutination of the pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>), (2) translocation across the membrane and possible interaction with intracellular targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Park et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dougherty et al., 2019</xref>), (3) total solubilization of the membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>), and (4) pore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guha et al., 2019</xref>). The latter mechanism is the main focus of this work. Description of other mechanisms goes beyond the scope of this article and has been reviewed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guha et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dougherty et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Common characteristics of pore-forming AMPs are: (1) amphiphilicity (spatial clustering of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wimley, 2010</xref>), (2) positive net charge, and (3) length ranging from 10 to 50 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). AMPs are typically unstructured in solution and can adopt a secondary structure upon interaction with a membrane. Further on, we consider the most common α-helical peptides. The effect of individual peptide residues on lipid specificity remains unclear, however, positive net charge of AMPs was shown to be responsible for increased selectivity towards bacterial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dathe and Wieprecht, 1999</xref>). The amount and the distribution of hydrophobic residues, which influence peptide self-association and binding into the membrane, can be conveniently represented by a helical wheel projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schiffer and Edmundson, 1967</xref>). For secondary amphiphilic peptides, hydrophobic content can be described as an angle of the sector in the helical wheel. The hydrophobic length (cluster of residues along the peptide long axis) of pore-forming peptides enables them to span the lipid bilayer and determines the peptide orientation within the pore based on hydrophobic mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vácha and Frenkel, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Pore-forming peptides can be further characterized by the structure of the pore they form. There are two well-established pore models: (1) barrel-stave and (2) toroidal. In both pore structures, hydrophobic residues of AMPs are in contact with the membrane core, while hydrophilic residues form a polar channel. Barrel-stave pore is a compact, bundle-like assembly of peptides with only a little effect on the neighboring lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pollard et al., 1995</xref>). In contrast, peptides in toroidal pores are loosely arranged and the lipid headgroups are present in the polar channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sengupta et al., 2008</xref>). Due to the small size and transient nature of the pores, it is challenging to experimentally determine the structure of membrane pores. However, computational methods are able to capture such transient structures and provide molecular-level understanding of the underlying mechanism of action. Thus, considerable number of studies on pore formation employed computational methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leontiadou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sengupta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Illya and Deserno, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mihajlovic and Lazaridis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Santo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vácha and Frenkel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kabelka and Vácha, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirsch and Böckmann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miyazaki et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The topology of a pore structure is determined by peptide properties. Particularly interesting is the presence of proline or glycine residue in a peptide sequence, which can induce formation of a sharp bend (so-called kink) in the regular α-helical structure. The kink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vanhoof et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2013</xref>) and helix-kink-helix motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kozic et al., 2018</xref>) have been shown to be biologically relevant for the activity of AMPs. However, methodologically diverse studies have produced contradictory results, reporting the helical kink to both enhance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xiao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Suh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Suh et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kobayashi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tieleman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rodríguez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corzo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vermeer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amos et al., 2016</xref>) and reduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Park et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gehman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2011</xref>) antimicrobial effects.</p><p>The main objective of this study is to determine and provide molecular understanding of the effect of proline/glycine-induced kink on the peptide pore-forming ability. Our findings were obtained by multi-scale computer simulations and validated by <italic>in vitro</italic> fluorescence experiments. Firstly, we performed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with a mesoscale lipid model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooke and Deserno, 2005</xref>) together with a phenomenological coarse-grained model for amphiphilic helical peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vácha and Frenkel, 2011</xref>). Both of these models were previously shown to capture important peptide properties for pore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vácha and Frenkel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kabelka and Vácha, 2015</xref>). The free energy calculations (performed under various conditions with the Wang-Landau method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang and Landau, 2001</xref>]) provided general explanation of the effect of a peptide kink. Secondly, the conclusions drawn from the MC simulations were confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by using a more detailed MARTINI model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Monticelli et al., 2008</xref>). Sequences of Magainin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matsuzaki et al., 1995</xref>), LL-37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Turner et al., 1998</xref>), Buforin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Park et al., 1998</xref>), δ-lysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Janzon et al., 1989</xref>), Candidalysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moyes et al., 2016</xref>) were altered (single amino acid substitutions) to study the impact of the kink on the pore structure and stability. Both of these distinct models have consistently shown that the presence of a kink disrupts barrel-stave, but stabilizes toroidal pores. Moreover, the position of the kink (with respect to the hydrophobic surface on AMP) was identified as a molecular determinant of peptide arrangement in toroidal pores. Finally, the pore-forming activity of selected peptide variants was verified using fluorescence leakage assay on large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). Collectively, this information can be used to fine-tune peptide sequences to modulate the peptide activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Monte Carlo simulations with phenomenological model</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Free energy of pore opening at various conditions</title><p>We have evaluated the effect of kink-induced flexibility on the stability of barrel-stave and toroidal pore structures. Using a phenomenological (highly coarse-grained) model of amphiphilic peptides, we have calculated the free energy associated with pore formation by peptides with various properties. We modified the peptide length, presence of the kink, hydrophobicity (capping) of the peptide termini, and the hydrophobic content defined as a sector in helical wheel projection (see the Methods section for more information).</p><p>The presence of kink was found to be unfavorable for the formation of the barrel-stave pore, because the (kink-induced) increased flexibility hinders the tight packing of peptides inside barrel-stave pores. This preference is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, which captures the free energy of pore formation for both rigid and flexible (with kink) peptides with the length 5 nm and the hydrophobic content/sector of the 270°. Due to the high hydrophobic content, the flexible peptide variants can still insert into the membrane. However, the peptides are less prone to aggregation in membrane and consequently less likely to form pores. In contrast, peptides forming toroidal pores benefit from the kink-induced flexibility as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, where free energy profiles for half-hydrophobic peptides of length 7 nm are displayed.

In our simulations, we have observed these synergistic pores created by half-hydrophobic peptides with the helix-kink-helix motif. Our peptide was comprised of two 3 nm long helices connected by a rigid kink, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. We have considered two cases where the angle between the peptides was 135° and 90°.

The following parameters were considered: (1) flexibility of peptide kink, (2) hydrophobicity of peptide termini, and (3) peptide concentration. Due to the low binding of some peptides on the membrane, we also considered peptides with an increased interaction strength, that is higher hydrophobic moment (see the Materials and methods section for more information). For peptides that were bound on the membrane at sufficiently high concentration, flexible kink was observed to be favorable for the formation of toroidal pores.

Since these simulations were performed in the sub-critical regime (where peptides do not open a pore spontaneously), a bias was applied on the lipids in order to observe multiple pore opening and closing events. The bias modifies the Monte Carlo acceptance criteria by adding a penalty to already visited states (in our case pore sizes). Importantly, no bias was applied on the peptides. Therefore, the peptides were free to adsorb into the membrane pore and sample the most favorable configurations. Due to the low hydrophobic content, that is ∼50%, the peptides formed various toroidal pores. Summary of the pore morphology for various peptide properties is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.

In our phenomenological model, peptide-peptide interactions are realized solely via hydrophobic interactions. Thus, significant portion of the peptide surface had to be hydrophobic (i.e., sector of at least 270°). Then, each peptide can effectively interact with both lipid tails and neighboring peptides. Moreover, the peptides that formed barrel-stave pores had hydrophilic ends and closely matching hydrophobic length with the membrane thickness.</p><p>Compared to barrel-stave pores, formation of toroidal pores was observed over a broader range of peptide properties.

Furthermore, atomistic simulations of a more hydrophobic Magainin 2 analogue have shown that majority of the pore-forming peptides are lying in a predominantly parallel orientation close to the pore rim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leontiadou et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>δ-lysin is a hemolytic peptide (without antimicrobial activity) expressed by <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alouf et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhople and Nagaraj, 2005</xref>).

Most of our studies were done using a single-component POPC membrane as a general model of a neutral membrane created from a common lipid. Since negatively charged lipids were shown to be important for AMPs, we also tested a mixtures of POPS and POPG lipids, which are negatively charged lipids common in eukaryotic and bacterial cells, respectively. We used the lipid mixtures 1:1 (mol/mol) to be able to capture locally increased concentration of charged lipids in the vicinity of positively charged peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krauson et al., 2015</xref>) and to prevent the studied behavior from being diffusion limited. Note that some bacteria were reported to contain even higher fraction charged lipids (e.g., 70% in <italic>Bacilus subtilis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clejan et al., 1986</xref>]). Furthermore, lipid composition POPC:POPG 1:1 (mol/mol) was suggested as a suitable membrane model of bacteria based on the correlation of the leakage experiments and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements in live bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-2-1"><title>Barrel-Stave pores</title><p>MC simulations highlighted the three conditions for efficient formation of barrel-stave pores: (1) peptide rigidity, (2) strong peptide-peptide interaction, and (3) peptide length.</p><p>Firstly, rigid peptides are more suitable for the formation of barrel-stave pores. The MC simulations with the phenomenological model enabled us to calculate free energy of pore formation for peptides with and without kink (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The peptide without a kink has markedly lower free energy of pore formation, compared to the peptides with a fully flexible kink. The difference originates in an entropic effect because linear peptides fit better into the geometry of barrel-stave pore and the peptide flexibility hinders the necessary tight packing of the peptides. Furthermore, our more detailed MARTINI simulations showed that α-helical variants (WT∗, P11L, and P11A) of Buforin II peptide formed and stabilized the barrel-stave pore structure for the entire duration of the simulations (50 µs). In contrast, Buforin II variants with a kink (i.e., WT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Park et al., 1998</xref>] and P11G) were not able to stabilize any membrane pores and ended up adsorbed on the membrane surface. Together, these simulations suggest that the peptide rigidity is more important than the chemical nature of the kink-forming residue for the stabilization of barrel-stave pores.</p><p>The observed effects of increased peptide rigidity on pore stability is in agreement with previously reported experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kobayashi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Xie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jacob et al., 1999</xref>). An enhanced membrane permeabilization by the more helical P11A variant (compared to WT) of Buforin II has already been experimentally demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kobayashi et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, flexible variants P11A/V12P and P11A/V15P of Buforin II had lower membrane permeabilization activity compared to P11A variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Xie et al., 2011</xref>). HP(2–20) was suggested to form narrow channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Park et al., 2008</xref>) and its antimicrobial activity is rigidity-enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). However, increased rigidity (P14A/G11A variant) of barrel-stave pore forming Alamethicin did not significantly alter the pore characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jacob et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Secondly, strong peptide-peptide interactions are needed to stabilize the bundle-like assembly of peptides. Specifically, the hydrophobic sector of the peptides in our MC simulations had to be at least 270° in order to mediate both peptide-peptide and peptide-lipid interactions, which is in line with previous simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Illya and Deserno, 2008</xref>) and experiments on Alamethicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yang et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Buforin II P11L formed the most stable barrel-stave pores in our MARTINI simulations. Thus, we used this variant to study the effect of lipids. The overall stability of the pore structures was comparable for all considered lipid compositions (POPC, POPC:POPG (1:1 mol/mol), and POPC:POPS (1:1 mol/mol)). However, the presence of negatively charged lipids caused a deviation from the regular barrel-stave pore topology. The origin of this effect is probably in electrostatic attraction between positively charged side-chains of Buforin II (net charge +6) and the negatively charged headgroups of POPG and POPS lipids. This interaction caused tilting of the charged lipid headgroups towards the membrane core and destabilization of the barrel-stave pore structure.</p><p>Lastly, the length of barrel-stave-pore-forming peptides should match the membrane thickness. For the formation of a barrel-stave pore, the peptide should be oriented roughly perpendicular with respect to the membrane plane. Thus, the peptide should comply with the hydrophobic mismatch. Longer peptides did not form barrel-stave pores. The effect of hydrophobic mismatch on pore forming peptides has been demonstrated both theoretically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vácha and Frenkel, 2013</xref>) and experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grau-Campistany et al., 2015</xref>). Hydrophilic or charged residues at the peptide termini further stabilize perpendicular orientation via interactions with charged moieties of lipid heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vácha and Frenkel, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-2"><title>Toroidal pores</title><p>Peptides inside a toroidal pore are not regularly packed and both peptides and lipids are present in the pore lumen. Our simulations revealed several characteristics of peptides in toroidal pores: (1) self-association is not essential, (2) increased flexibility generally improves activity, (3) position of the kink can alter the pore structure, and (4) surface-aligned peptides (outside the pore) can still participate in pore stabilization.</p><p>Toroidal pores were observed over a broader range of peptide properties compared to the peptides forming barrel-stave pores. In many cases, peptide self-association was not very pronounced and hydrophobic content of ∼50% was found to be sufficient for the formation of toroidal pores. Hydrophobic sector higher than ∼310° suppressed the pore-forming activity, as the peptides aggregated in solution or interacted with the membrane (adsorption or insertion) without pore formation.</p><p>Increased peptide flexibility has a positive effect on the stability of toroidal pores. Flexible peptides can more easily adapt to the curved (catenoid) shape of the pore lumen and our MC simulations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) show a decrease in a free energy of pore formation after the introduction of a kink.Furthermore, stronger partitioning of peptides with an imperfect α-helical secondary structure into the membrane core was observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henderson et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, including a flexible proline/glycine kink into a real peptide sequence would also alter the peptide affinity for membrane due to modified hydrophilicity. Indeed, the reduced adsorption was demonstrated for Melittin L16G (a variant with increased conformational flexibility) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krauson et al., 2015</xref>). After compensating for the decreased adsorption by the addition of negatively charged lipids, the variant regained its permeabilization ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krauson et al., 2015</xref>). In this work, however, we only focused on the effect of peptide flexibility. Thus, we took advantage of features of the MARTINI model and used multiple definitions of the peptide secondary structure to circumvented this problem altogether. We used the same peptide sequences and tuned the flexibility of the peptides (these simulations are marked with an asterisk). Nonetheless, the change in peptide adsorption could exceed the effect on the pore stabilization and simple addition of a kink-forming residue may not be always a viable strategy.</p><p>Our MARTINI simulations verified the importance of peptide flexibility predicted by our MC simulations with phenomenological model. LL-37 peptide has a kink-forming glycine at position 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xhindoli et al., 2016</xref>) and disrupts POPC membranes via the formation of toroidal pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, the WT peptide stabilized the toroidal pore for the entire duration of the simulation. When the peptide was kept in a α-helical conformation (WT∗), the stability of the toroidal pore was decreased and pore closing was observed after 10 µs. Similarly, lower pore stability was observed for a more hydrophobic α-helical LL-37 G14L variant. In an another example, flexible Candidalysin (CandK) peptides were able to stabilize small toroidal pores. When the proline residue at position 14 was restrained in a fully helical conformation (WT∗), the pre-formed pores closed.</p><p>AMPs with the helix-kink-helix motif are able to form structurally diverse toroidal pores. Here we focus on two distinct toroidal pore structures with different arrangements of peptides that were described previously: (1) U-shaped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Santo and Berkowitz, 2012</xref>) and (2) hourglass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jung et al., 1994</xref>) pores. The first structure was named after the shape of the peptides which adopt a bent conformation. Each peptide stays on one leaflet with both termini being anchored in the lipid headgroup region, while the peptide kink is inserted deeply in the membrane. In the hourglass pore model, peptides span the membrane and the kink is positioned in the membrane center. Both of these pores were observed in our MC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>) and MARTINI simulations.</p><p>Position of the proline/glycine kink determines the type/structure of toroidal pores. LL-37 peptide was experimentally shown to form toroidal pores with peptides in a perpendicular orientation with respect to membrane plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). In agreement with these findings, we observed LL-37 to form hourglass-shaped toroidal pores. The kink-forming glycine residue in LL-37 peptides is located on the side of the hydrophilic region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). By rearranging two adjacent residues (LL-37 I13G/G14I variant), the kink-forming residue was moved to the center of hydrophobic sector. In our MARTINI simulations, this change resulted in a formation of a U-shaped toroidal pores. In contrast to LL-37, wild type Candidalysin peptides have the proline residue on the side of the hydrophobic sector (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). CandK and CandKR WT peptides were observed to adopt ‘U-shaped’ (bent) structure inside pores in our simulations. Repositioning the kink residue (CandidKR P14Q/Q15P variant) to the center of hydrophilic sector caused the formation of hourglass-shaped toroidal pores with transmembrane peptide orientation. Therefore, the position of the kink-forming residue has been identified as a key structural determinant which can govern the formation of distinct toroidal pores.</p><p>Additional type of toroidal pore was recently suggested to be formed by a pair of associated peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Salnikov and Bechinger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Strandberg et al., 2016</xref>). In this synergistic pore, Magainin 2 peptide was reported to be inserted in the pore and form a polar channel, while the other peptide, PGLa, remained adsorbed on the membrane surface in a parallel orientation with respect to the membrane plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Salnikov and Bechinger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Strandberg et al., 2016</xref>). The peptides are strongly interacting via their C-termini forming a stable flexibly connected pair, which could be analogous to the helix-kink-helix motif within a single peptide. Note that strong self-association via the peptide C-termini is possible even for two highly charged polyarginine peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tesei et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, we observed synergistic pores with our phenomenological model for long helices with a flexible kink (i.e. connection), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. We found that the inner angle of 135° is more suitable for pore formation compared to an angle of 90°. Similar peptide configuration was observed experimentally for Magainin 2 and PGLa peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Strandberg et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The similarity of pores formed by peptides with the helix-kink-helix motif and by peptides associating via termini is more general and includes self-associating peptides. Magainin 2 peptides were reported to form homomeric pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wakamatsu et al., 2002</xref>). In our MARTINI simulations, surface-aligned and transmembrane Magainin 2 peptides cooperatively stabilized a toroidal pore in a structure similar to the synergistic pore of Magainin 2 and PGLa. The peptide pairs interacted via N- and C-termini and the angle between peptides was approximately 135° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Additional example of toroidal pore formed by self-associating peptides was observed for δ-lysin peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). δ-lysin peptides interacted via C-termini and the position of the contact between the peptides was in the middle of the membrane. The pore structure of δ-lysin resembled the hourglass toroidal pore, adopted by peptides with the helix-kink-helix motif. These examples demonstrate the analogy between long flexible peptides and peptides interacting via their termini.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Fluorescent leakage assays of buforin II, LL-37, and their variants</title><p>Our simulations with both the phenomenological and MARTINI model revealed that peptide flexibility modulates the formation of barrel-stave and toroidal pores.

For Buforin II peptides, the largest leakage was observed for P11L, followed by a slightly less hydrophobic P11A variant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Significantly lower leakage was found for Buforin II WT with a proline kink, and the lowest leakage was caused by P11G.

Two independent models (highly-coarse grained phenomenological model and coarse-grained MARTINI model) and fluorescence leakage experiments consistently showed that flexible kink in helical peptides facilitated the formation of toroidal pores but destabilized barrel-stave pores.</p><p>In particular, we found that fully helical variants (P11A and P11L) of Buforin II stabilized barrel pores, while the wild-type sequence and P11G variant with a central kink did not. The formation of toroidal pores was investigated with LL-37, Candidalysin, δ-lysin, and Magainin 2 peptides and their variants. The exact structure of toroidal pores (Hourglass or U-shaped) was modulated by the position of the kink in the sequence. Moreover, we showed that a flexible connection between two helices could have the same effect as a kink within the structure of a single peptide. In other words, toroidal pores can also be stabilized by association between surface-aligned and transmembrane peptides that strongly interact via termini, effectively forming a helix-kink-helix motif. We observed such pore structures Magainin 2 and δ-lysin peptides.</p><p>This study provides a comprehensive molecular rationalization of the effect of a proline/glycine kink in helical peptides in the context of membrane pore formation. As a rule of thumb, most pore-forming peptides could benefit from the inclusion of proline/glycine residue in the middle of the sequence (if the decreased peptide-membrane interaction is accounted for [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krauson et al., 2015</xref>]). Alternatively, self-association between peptide termini can form a kink-like connection with a similar effect. We observed majority of the peptides to form toroidal pores and only highly hydrophobic or strongly self-associating peptides to form barrel-stave pores. The obtained molecular understanding could be used for the design of more potent antimicrobial peptides or less toxic drug-carrying peptides.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Computational simulations</title><p>In this study, two conceptually distinct models with a different level of molecular detail were employed.

The lipid bilayer was assembled in the XY-plane using 500 lipid molecules and kept at zero tension. After membrane equilibration, peptides were added to the system in a random spatial and orientational distribution. The concentration of peptides and lipids was expressed as the Peptide-to-Lipid (P/L) ratio. We simulated systems with P/L 1/250, 1/100, 1/50, and 1/25.

Then, the pore was defined as the largest continuous area (considering PBC) on the grid without lipid tails. The area of the largest pore was selected as a reaction coordinate, which was previously shown to be suitable for the free energy calculations of pore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kabelka and Vácha, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang and Frenkel, 2005</xref>).

Note that no bias is applied on the peptides.</p><p>The WL method repeatedly samples the whole range of the reaction coordinate by discouraging the already visited states. Thus, dozens of pore opening and closing events occur and the peptides can sample many distinct pore configurations.

For comparison with experiments and to determine the effect of lipid composition, we also investigated lipid mixtures with negatively charged 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (POPS) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG) lipids. The lipid ratios were POPC:POPG (1:1 mol/mol) and POPC:POPS (1:1 mol/mol). Lipids were distributed equally among both leaflets.</p><p>The peptide pore-forming activity was evaluated by its ability to stabilize pre-formed pores. Membrane pore was created by removing lipids in a cylinder of defined radius from the box center. Then, the peptides were placed into the pore of fixed size (maintained by zero box compressibility in the XY-plane). The large initial pore diameter enabled the peptides to easily change orientation and assume more preferred configuration. During the subsequent simulation, the pore shrinks. The membrane with peptides was solvated with water and NaCl ions at 100 mM concentration. Excess of ions was added to the neutralize the system net charge. Positional restraints with a force constant of 1000 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> nm<sup>-2</sup> were applied on the peptide backbone beads. The system was energy minimized using the steepest descent algorithm and equilibrated in five steps with increasing simulation time step. The unrestrained system was subsequently simulated for 3 µs to obtain the preferred peptide configurations. Based on the peptide arrangement, up to four distinct starting configurations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>) were prepared (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). The majority of the simulated peptides adopted one particular arrangement in a pore, regardless of the initial configuration used. The only exception were the Candidalysin peptides as they were unable to reorient from a transmembrane starting configuration to an U-shaped conformation. After further equilibration, NpT production dynamics simulations of a minimum length of 20 µs were performed. Pore stability was evaluated using several critera: (1) observed configurations in the trajectory, (2) amount of water beads in the hydrophobic core, and (3) the presence of a continuous water channel.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>MARTINI simulations – initial conditions.</title><p>Based on the preferred peptide orientation within membrane pore, couple of initial configuration were suggested and tested.

LUVs were extruded 50× through 100 nm polycarbonate filter membrane to obtain uniformly sized vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mayer et al., 1985</xref>). Untrapped Calcein was removed on HiTrap Desalting Columns 5 × 5 ml (Sephadex G-25 Superfine matrix, cross-linked dextran) by washing with PBS. The concentration of the lipid suspension was then adjusted to 0.02 mM. Fluorescence measurements were performed with a HORIBA Scientific Jobin Yvon FluoroLog-3 Modular Spectrofluorometer (New Jersey NJ USA), interfaced to a computer using FluorEssence V3.8. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 495 nm and 520 nm, respectively. All measurements were performed under constant stirring at 25°C, well above the phase transition temperature of the lipid mixture. Peptides dissolved in PBS (0.1 mM) were added directly to the cuvette to obtain the desired Peptide-to-Lipid (P/L) ratio. Finally, 50 μl of nonionic surfactant Triton X-100 was added to lyse all remaining LUVs and determine the maximum fluorescence intensity for normalization.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>AT, IK, TK, LS, and RV were supported by the Czech Science Foundation (grant GA17–11571S) and the CEITEC 2020 (LQ1601) project with financial contribution made by the Ministry of Education, Youths and Sports of the Czech Republic within special support paid from the National Programme for Sustainability II funds.

This paper presents results from simulations and in vitro experiments showing the effect of a kink in the structure of the peptide on the architecture of the pores they form in membranes and their ability to induce membrane leakage. This work may inspire the design of new drugs to replace antibiotics.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Effect of helical kink in antimicrobial peptides on membrane pore formation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>We think that the combination of 2 types of simulation and experiments is a positive aspect of your work. But we also have major concerns that prevent considering your paper for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> since we believe that the revisions would take more than2 months. As explained in the detailed reports, your manuscript must better explain your approach and the procedures used in simulations. The simulations have to be repeated many times to be convincing and we had the impression that they were performed only once. Moreover, you should also perform simulations where flexibility of the AMPs is allowed, since modeling AMPs with a fixed kink appears unrealistic. We also consider that more modern model for the peptides (peptides parallel to the surface, pores and lysis due to the disordering of lipids) should be considered or at least, discussed.</p><p>Would you decide to resubmit your manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic> in the future, we recommend to seriously take into account all the suggestions and questions from the reviews.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Overall the work is logically carried out and clearly described but we feel that there are some major concerns and the experimental validation is relatively limited.</p><p>It does not seem clear that the detail of the first very coarse-grained MD is sufficient to capture the behaviour of the system – no validation of the model is presented. In addition, the description of the model simply mentions 'length, hydrophobicity and flexibility of the link'. How is the hydrophobicity encoded? The Results and Discussion confusingly talks about a patch of 180degrees.</p><p>Neither kind of MD seems to have been subjected to repetitions (necessary for a Monte Carlo process) to see if the results are repeatable between different simulations</p><p>The membrane composition that was used is POPC:POPG in 1:1 ratio. This is highly charged and not in agreement with experiments and other studies mainly using POPC:POPG or POPE:POPG in 4:1 or 3:1 ratio as bacterial model membrane. The authors should provide a reference for this 1:1 POPC:POPG composition.</p><p>A further problem is related to the AMP models used in the study. While the authors specify that the flexibility of kink in the super CG model was systematically varied, they do not provide details such as angles/rotations between the two helices that were tested. In Martini models, secondary structure is fixed, and 4 heavy atoms forming one bead is a standard. However, the kink was reported to be modelled as a random coil. The question is how many residues are defined to form this kink, and again, it is not clear here what angles/rotations were used between the two helices. These models are then incorporated into the membrane, but since the AMPs are Martini models, this doesn't allow the relaxation of the structures, meaning the authors can't sample enough conformations because of the rigid backbone. The unflexible AMPs leading to barrel-stave is most likely an artifact of the model. A study by Yang et al., 2001, concluded that &quot;among naturally produced peptides that we have investigated, only alamethicin conforms to the barrel-stave model. Other peptides, including magainins, melittin and protegrins, all appear to induce transmembrane pores that conform to the toroidal model&quot;.

In some places it was hard for me to follow the paper because of its non-sequential order of referring to Figures and Tables (for example, see the Results were the reader is sent to figures 5D and S13 before discussion of previous figures).

The simulations are performed using two types of coarse-grained description of the systems: a very coarse-grained phenomenological model and a more detailed coarse-grained model-MARTINI. The goal is to understand the effect the kink has on the ability to form leaky pores in model membranes. The main question asked is how much of general information can one obtain from coarse-grained models and can this information help us to understand general issues related to AMP action such as morphology and stability of the pores. In my opinion, the authors accomplished their goal. Both coarse-grained models and supporting their conclusion experiments on leakage provided &quot;molecular rationalization of the effect of a proline /glycine kink in helical peptides in the context of membrane pore formation.&quot;</p><p>The authors did a pretty good job of rewriting the manuscript. There are still small issues that make reading somewhat difficult in certain places: the reader needs to move forward from the main text to the section on Methods and Materials and back to understand clearly what is going on. A few sentences placed in the main text about methods can make the flow of reading much smoother. The authors should carefully read the manuscript and see how they can make the reading of the text smoother, so there is no need to go back and forth while reading the paper. Some very small remarks can be helpful; e.g., I got initially confused by notation used to denote figures such as Figure 1A and Figure A1. Just writing Figure A1 (see Appendix) can be very helpful.</p><p>Some other issues: 1) I did not understand what the free energy curve from Figure 1 denoted by dots stands for. 2) In subsection “Effect of Peptide Flexibility and Length on the Structure of Membrane Pores” the authors say that bias was applied to lipids to observe pore formation. What kind of bias?</p><p>Conclusion: The paper accomplished the goal of explaining the role of kinks as seen from the coarse-grained model and confirming leakage experiments.

However, I do feel strongly that the authors should comment on their choice of membrane model and how it relates to in vivo compositions and any potential consequences of using such a highly charged membrane.

In addition, the description of the model simply mentions 'length, hydrophobicity and flexibility of the link'. How is the hydrophobicity encoded? The Results and Discussion confusingly talks about a patch of 180degrees.</p></disp-quote><p>We rewrote the whole manuscript including the description and previous use of the employed models. The first coarse-grained model (phenomenological model) has been developed in 2011 (Vácha and Frenkel,2011) to capture the behavior of amphiphilic helical peptides and has been validated to the existing structures. Since then, we have shown that the model provides valuable data for peptide translocation and pore formation, which has already been experimentally verified (Vácha and Frenkel,2013; Leber et al.,2018). The details of the model are described in brief in the Materials and methods sections now. We agree that the description of the hydrophobic content could have been misleading for a reader. Commonly, the distribution of residues in an α-helix is visualized using the helical wheel projection. We have adopted this description and now we express the hydrophobic content as the angle of a hydrophobic sector. For example, the peptide with the hydrophobic sector of 180 degrees is half hydrophilic and half hydrophobic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Neither kind of MD seems to have been subjected to repetitions (necessary for a Monte Carlo process) to see if the results are repeatable between different simulations</p></disp-quote><p>The information about repetitions of the simulations was not obvious or mistakenly omitted from the previous manuscript. With the MARTINI model, we have first tested the preferred orientation of the peptides in a pre-formed pore of a fixed size starting from various initial conditions. The number of different peptide orientations/conformations at the end of these simulations determined the number of subsequent simulations starting from those distinct configurations. Despite the different starting configurations, the observed behavior was consistent for all but one peptide variant as described in the manuscript.</p><p>In the Monte Carlo simulations, an enhanced sampling method (Wang-Landau) was employed to sample dozens of pore opening and closing events. These simulations are thus very time consuming due to the thorough sampling of all the accessible configurations. In other words, instead of employing number of simulations each capturing one pore opening and closing, this method requires dozens of such events within one simulation for convergence.</p><p>This information is now clearly stated in the Materials and methods section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The membrane composition that was used is POPC:POPG in 1:1 ratio. This is highly charged and not in agreement with experiments and other studies mainly using POPC:POPG or POPE:POPG in 4:1 or 3:1 ratio as bacterial model membrane. The authors should provide a reference for this 1:1 POPC:POPG composition.</p></disp-quote><p>The POPC:POPG 1:1 lipid ratio was used in one of the first studies of the Buforin II peptide (DOI: 10.1021/bi0004549). We included this information in the manuscript. Furthermore, we would like to kindly point out that this proportion of charged lipids is not excessive in general. For some bacteria (e.g., <italic>B. subtilis</italic>), the amount of negatively charged lipids was reported to exceed 70% with majority of phosphoglycerol (PG) (DOI: 10.1128/jb.168.1.334-340.1986).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A further problem is related to the AMP models used in the study. While the authors specify that the flexibility of kink in the super CG model was systematically varied, they do not provide details such as angles/rotations between the two helices that were tested. In Martini models, secondary structure is fixed, and 4 heavy atoms forming one bead is a standard. However, the kink was reported to be modelled as a random coil. The question is how many residues are defined to form this kink, and again, it is not clear here what angles/rotations were used between the two helices. These models are then incorporated into the membrane, but since the AMPs are Martini models, this doesn't allow the relaxation of the structures, meaning the authors can't sample enough conformations because of the rigid backbone. The unflexible AMPs leading to barrel-stave is most likely an artifact of the model. A study by Yang et al. (Biophys J. 2001 Sep; 81(3): 1475-1485) concluded that &quot;among naturally produced peptides that we have investigated, only alamethicin conforms to the barrel-stave model. Other peptides, including magainins, melittin and protegrins, all appear to induce transmembrane pores that conform to the toroidal model&quot;. While both Melittin and Magainin do have a Gly residue in the middle part of the sequence, the structure of Magainin in DPC micelles doesn't show a kink. Nevertheless, the authors claim that it is the flexible peptide kink in the helical structure that causes the instability of barrel pores (BPs). To conclude, the authors should have parametrised AMP models against an atomistic model in order to get the correct dynamics.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point.</p><p>In the phenomenological model, we have considered the kink to be either rigid (i.e., fixed with no way to bend) or fully flexible (free to adopt any orientation). For clarity, the information about the range of motion of the helical segments was added in Figure 10.</p><p>To clarify the effect of the peptide kink, we studied peptides with proline/glycine residues in their sequences.</p><p>In the MARTINI simulations, we considered the central proline/glycine residue and one neighbouring residue on either side to be flexible. In case of Buforin II P11G, we have additionally considered the case of only one kink-forming residue. To further investigate the effect of peptide flexibility, we simulated the same sequences and forced the peptides into a fully helical secondary structure. Therefore, we took advantage of the MARTINI fixed secondary structure and tested both extremes that could happen in all-atom simulations. Moreover, these simulations allowed us to determine the role of the peptide flexibility (without altering the peptide-lipid interactions), which would be challenging to determine without simulations. Table 2 includes information about all simulated sequences and used secondary structures for the studied peptides.</p><p>Note that the secondary structure of antimicrobial peptides is highly dependent on the environment, and thus, the secondary structure from DPC micelles may not be representative. Furthermore, the secondary structure of peptides in solution, adsorbed on membrane, and in the pore can vary a lot. Consequently, it is challenging to determine/separate those structures in experiments. Nevertheless, we observed Magainin 2 (with a glycine kink) to form toroidal pores, which is consistent with the reviewer's comment and previous findings. In simulations with fully helical (without a kink), Magainin 2 forms a &quot;synergistic&quot; toroidal pore with two peptides interacting via C-termini (effectively forming a kink between two peptides).</p><p>In addition, we have included a comparison of the flexibility of both phenomenological and MARTINI models in Figure 10C in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experimental results in Figure 5 are valuable are limited to mutations at one residue (A) and seem to show no significant difference (this should be tested statistically) in (B)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for appreciation of our experiments. Since we already validated our results using two different computational models, we used only two peptides for experimental validation. We selected the peptides based on their availability and effect on membrane. The kink-forming residue has been the main subject of this study, thus in (A) we mutated residues at this position. We selected three different mutants P11L, P11A, and P11G to capture two variants of helix- (L, A) and kink- (P, G) forming residues. The results are in excellent agreement with our simulations and understanding. For LL-37, the induced leakage by the mutant peptide is within the error of the wild type. In this case, however, we cannot distinguish the effect of the peptide flexibility and the increased peptide-lipid interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There should be some justification for the very large pores in Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous work (DOI: 10.1021/la402727a), we have shown that peptides can tilt inside a pore and even adopt a parallel orientation in the pore lumen resulting in fairly large pores.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The weakness of the manuscript is in the description of the simulation work done.

In order to make our results as general as possible, we studied simplified model membranes composed of the most common lipids. Zwitterionic POPC is typical and widely used lipid for single component membranes, which is why we used it in majority of our systems. However, we are aware that various lipids can have a specific role in different membranes. In particular, the negative charged lipids were suggested to be important for antimicrobial peptides. This is why we included membranes with negatively charged lipids in our study. In particular, we selected POPG lipid, which is common in bacteria, and POPS lipid, which is common in eukaryotic cells. To enhance the possible effect of charged lipids we employed 1:1 (mol/mol) lipid mixtures of POPC and charged lipid. The content of charged lipids may seem high, but even more highly charged membranes exist in bacteria. Moreover, antimicrobial peptides are expected to locally increase the concentration of negatively charged lipids because they are usually positively charged. Last but not least, lipid composition POPC:POPG 1:1 (mol/mol) was suggested as a suitable membrane model of bacteria based on the correlation of the leakage experiments and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements in live bacteria.</p><p>Large pores in our MARTINI simulations were used only in the initial stage of simulations, where peptides sampled various orientations and arrangements inside the pore.
