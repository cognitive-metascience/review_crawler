pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20183.001</object-id><p>Prostate cancer is driven by androgen stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR). The next-generation AR antagonist, enzalutamide, prolongs survival, but resistance and lethal disease eventually prevail. Emerging data suggest that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is upregulated in this context, stimulating expression of AR-target genes that permit continued growth despite AR blockade. However, countering this mechanism by administration of GR antagonists is problematic because GR is essential for life. We show that enzalutamide treatment in human models of prostate cancer and patient tissues is accompanied by a ubiquitin E3-ligase, AMFR, mediating loss of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11β-HSD2), which otherwise inactivates cortisol, sustaining tumor cortisol concentrations to stimulate GR and enzalutamide resistance. Remarkably, reinstatement of 11β-HSD2 expression, or AMFR loss, reverses enzalutamide resistance in mouse xenograft tumors. Together, these findings reveal a surprising metabolic mechanism of enzalutamide resistance that may be targeted with a strategy that circumvents a requirement for systemic GR ablation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20183.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20183.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>androgens</kwd><kwd>glucocorticoids</kwd><kwd>nuclear receptors</kwd><kwd>treatment resistance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-16-1-0270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jianneng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000892</institution-id><institution>Prostate Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zhenfei</given-names></name><name><surname>Sharifi</surname><given-names>Nima</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA168899</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharifi</surname><given-names>Nima</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12–038-01-CCE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharifi</surname><given-names>Nima</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA172382</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharifi</surname><given-names>Nima</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA190289</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharifi</surname><given-names>Nima</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharifi</surname><given-names>Nima</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Prostate cancer resistance to androgen receptor antagonist therapy occurs by way of tumors impeding local glucocorticoid metabolism and inactivation and thereby permitting sustained glucocorticoids to stimulate up-regulated glucocorticoid receptor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Metastatic prostate cancer usually responds initially to medical or surgical castration, then eventually progresses as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is stimulated by intratumoral synthesis of testosterone and/or 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and activation of the androgen receptor (AR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attard et al., 2016</xref>;

Enzalutamide is a potent next-generation AR antagonist and prolongs survival for patients with metastatic CRPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Scher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tran et al., 2009</xref>). Unfortunately, enzalutamide resistance almost always emerges, eventually leading to disease lethality.</p><p>Emerging data suggest that potent AR inhibition with enzalutamide leads to a massive up-regulation of GR expression, which then permits the re-expression of about 50% of AR-responsive genes, in turn promoting tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arora et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Isikbay et al., 2014</xref>). A challenge has been reconciling these findings with the therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids in CRPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Montgomery et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sartor et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, targeting such a mechanism with GR antagonists may be problematic because total and systemic GR blockade is incompatible with life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sharifi, 2014</xref>). Treatment directed at a tumor-specific mechanism that regulates GR would therefore be desirable. We hypothesized that similar to metabolic mechanisms that elicit DHT synthesis, which in turn stimulate AR in CRPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Knudsen and Penning, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sharifi, 2013</xref>), a role for GR in enzalutamide resistance would be accompanied by a tumor metabolic switch that provides sustained tissue cortisol concentrations that enable GR activation. Such a scenario and mechanism may furnish a tumor-specific pharmacologic target and thereby avoid adverse effects associated with systemic GR ablation.</p><p>GR stimulation by cortisol in peripheral tissues is physiologically tightly regulated by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11β-HSD2), which enzymatically converts cortisol to inactive cortisone in humans and corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapman et al., 2013</xref>). For example, fetal and placental 11β-HSD2 expression shields against maternal cortisol, thereby restricting GR stimulation and blocking premature fetal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapman et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we show that enzalutamide resistance is marked by sustained cortisol concentrations in the prostate tumor that are attributable to a profound loss of 11β-HSD2 and impaired conversion to cortisone, which together de-repress GR and stimulate glucocorticoid-dependent signaling. Mechanistically, 11β-HSD2 loss is mediated by the ubiquitin E3-ligase autocrine mobility factor receptor (AMFR). Finally, sustained 11β-HSD2 expression reverses the metabolic phenotype of enzalutamide resistance and reinstates the therapeutic response to enzalutamide in vivo.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20183.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>GR stimulation with enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer is tightly regulated by glucocorticoid metabolism in target tissues.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Glucocorticoid metabolism in target tissues.

Tumors appeared to harbor significant resistance to treatment with enzalutamide, as evidenced by the growth of Vector xenografts through enzalutamide therapy. Forced 11β-HSD2 expression significantly reversed enzalutamide-resistant growth and prolonged progression-free survival. In contrast, 11β-HSD2 expression had no significant effect on untreated tumors, supporting a model in which the effect of 11β-HSD2 on tumor growth is specific to the context of resistance to potent AR antagonist therapy. Reinstatement of sensitivity to enzalutamide treatment also occurred in a second (VCaP) xenograft model of CRPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>). In contrast to humans, the mouse adrenal does not express 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase and thus synthesizes corticosterone instead of cortisol as the dominant glucocorticoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which is similarly inactivated to 11-dehydrocorticosterone by 11β-HSD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Miller and Auchus, 2011</xref>).

As 11β-HSD2 is also located in the endoplasmic reticulum, we hypothesized that AMFR is required for enzalutamide-induced loss of 11β-HSD2 protein. A physical association between 11β-HSD2 and AMFR is supported by immunoprecipitation of AMFR, followed by immunoblot for 11β-HSD2, as well as immunoprecipitation of 11β-HSD2, followed by immunoblot for AMFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Expression of 11β-HSD2, Ubiquitin-His, and AMFR-Myc-DDK, followed by Ni-agarose pull-down and anti-11β-HSD2 immunoblot demonstrates the AMFR-dependence of 11β-HSD2 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Enzalutamide treatment did not consistently increase AMFR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). However, Erlin-2, which enables the AMFR-associated endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway (ERAD), was more consistently up-regulated, including in 8 of 11 patient tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Browman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pearce et al., 2007</xref>). The functional consequence of 11β-HSD2 / AMFR interaction and 11β-HSD2 ubiquitination is evidenced by genetically silencing AMFR with stable shRNA expression, which promotes an increase in 11β-HSD2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) but not transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, the enzalutamide-induced metabolic phenotype that sustains cortisol concentrations by way of retarded inactivation is reversed with genetic ablation of AMFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Silencing both 11β-HSD2 and AMFR with enzalutamide treatment negates the effect of genetically silencing AMFR alone, suggesting that the effect of AMFR is mediated through 11β-HSD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Finally, the functional relevance and requirement for AMFR expression on enzalutamide resistance is suggested by suppressed xenograft growth and prolonged progression-free survival in enzalutamide-treated xenografts with stable AMFR knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>). Tumors with AMFR knockdown were confirmed to have sustained 11β-HSD2 protein expression, thus impairing enzalutamide resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

These findings indicate that systemic availability of GR agonists represents only one aspect of tumor GR stimulation in the setting of enzalutamide resistance. Local metabolic regulation of ligand availability by the tumor serves as a second critical aspect and can either oppose the effects of systemic glucocorticoids by spurring enzymatic inactivation, or instead allow unimpeded access to the tumor tissue, enabling sustained GR stimulation to promote tumor progression.</p><p>Glucocorticoid administration has long been recognized to have a therapeutic effect in CRPC. Although the therapeutic effect of glucocorticoids is likely due in part to adrenal androgen suppression, the complete effects of glucocorticoids in prostate cancer have yet to be fully elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attard et al., 2012</xref>). Our observations move us closer to an understanding of the role of glucocorticoid pharmacology and physiology in prostate cancer. It has been recently recognized that GR stimulation may also contribute to prostate cancer progression. Our findings suggest yet another consideration that adds to the complexity of glucocorticoid signaling in prostate cancer, namely susceptibility of the administered glucocorticoid to metabolic inactivation, that is likely relevant to the increased GR expression that may occur alongside enzalutamide resistance and allows direct tumor-promoting effects of glucocorticoids in CRPC. For example, prednisolone is inactivated by 11β-HSD2 to prednisone but dexamethasone is generally thought to be impervious to inactivation by 11β-HSD2. This may be even more important prior to enzalutamide therapy and consequent suppression of 11β-HSD2 loss, because some data suggest that baseline GR expression prior to enzalutamide treatment, where 11β-HSD2 expression is intact, may be associated with enzalutamide resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arora et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, early results from a neoadjuvant clinical trial of castration plus abiraterone suggest that tissue cortisol may be elevated specifically in prostate cancers that up-regulate GR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Efstathiou et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it is possible that altered tumor glucocorticoid metabolism by way of the mechanism we have elucidated occurs not only with enzalutamide but also with abiraterone therapy.</p><p>Metabolic regulation of GR stimulation by the tumor might also be a tumor-specific therapeutic vulnerability. Our data raise the possibility that blocking 11β-HSD2 protein loss, for example by blocking AMFR, or reinstatement of 11β-HSD2 expression in the tumor may be an appropriate strategy to reverse enzalutamide resistance without affecting the systemic availability of glucocorticoids and resultant associated toxicities. Blocking AMFR may also increase 3βHSD1 protein, sustaining androgen synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). However, our in vivo studies with AMFR knockdown suggest that in the context of enzalutamide treatment, the net effect of AMFR ablation is therapeutic, probably because the AR ligand binding domain remains mainly occupied by enzalutamide and glucocorticoid signaling is a major driver of tumor progression.</p><p>Finally, our findings may have general relevance to steroid-dependent disease processes that use alternative steroid receptors. For example, in addition to the involvement of GR in prostate cancer, GR and AR have been implicated in a subtype-specific breast cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ni et al., 2011</xref>). Our results suggest that a switch in steroid receptors that drives disease processes more broadly may be accompanied by perturbed local metabolic regulation of the availability of ligands that stimulate steroid receptor activation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>LAPC4 was a generous gift from Dr. Charles Sawyers (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer, New York, NY), which was maintained in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified incubator.

This is an important question because up-regulation of GR and subsequent cortisol-mediated expression of a large number of androgen receptor responsive genes is believed to contribute to enzalutamide resistance. A key question is how to block cortisol's action locally, in the tumor, because systemic blockade of GR function is likely to be intolerably toxic. Here the authors show that enzalutamide causes a delay of cortisol conversion to cortisone in CPRC cell lines and xenografts. This is associated with increased GR expression and decreased expression of 11β-HSD2, a cortisol-metabolizing enzyme, in cells, primary tumor tissue and tumors treated ex vivo with enzalutamide. Enforced 11β-HSD2 expression is sufficient to decrease residual cortisol levels and decrease expression of cortisol-responsive genes in cell lines. It also reduces cortisosterone levels in xenografts and enhances the therapeutic effect of enzalutamide. Mechanistically, 11β-HSD2 physically interacts with AMFR, an ER-associated E3-ubiquitin ligase, and eliminating AMFR expression enhances 11β-HSD2 expression, increases conversion of cortisol to cortisone, and enhances the effect of enzalutamide on tumor growth. Overall, the authors provide evidence for a new concept in counteracting enzalutamide resistance by reducing local GR signaling in CRPC tumors.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Enzalutamide's effects on cortisol metabolism are largely assessed in LAPC4 cells. Do these effects appear in some of other systems featured in the paper (other cell lines and/or prostate cancer samples treated ex vivo)?</p><p>2) The mechanism of reduced 11β-HSD2 expression in enzalutamide-treated cells should be better defined. The data showing that Erlin-2 increases in enzalutamide-resistant cells is intriguing, but should be functionally linked to resistance. The authors should test whether Erlin-2 over-expression is sufficient to decrease cortisol metabolism and/or whether silencing Erlin-2 after long-term enzalutamide treatment potentiates conversion of cortisol to cortisone.</p><p>3) If the mechanism of Dex and Pred's clinical effects in CRPC is solely through the suppression of adrenal steroid production, how can the investigators claim that altered Dex and Pred metabolism within a tumor cell mediates resistance? They might be better served by suggesting that Dex and Pred exert their clinical benefits in as-yet-unspecified mechanism, and that the new observations in the paper move us closer to understanding this. It may well be true that corticosteroids do not exert all of their clinical effects through suppression of adrenal androgens. The authors cite the Attard data but the interesting thing about these data is that patients with progression on abiraterone (with maximal adrenal androgen suppression already achieved) may still respond to dexamethasone. Thus, steroids may exert both clinical benefits in some settings but may also mediate resistance.</p><p>4) The in vitro experiments are elegant and sufficiently support the hypothesis that alterations in 11β-HSD2 are mechanistically responsible for sustained glucocorticoid levels in the tumor cells. Do the authors think that this effect is specific to enzalutamide, a class effect of AR targeted drugs, or possibly a broader mechanism of CRPC development?</p><p>Title: For improved clarity, we suggest changing the title to &quot;Aberrant corticosteroid metabolism in tumor cells enables GR takeover in enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20183.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential Revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Enzalutamide's effects on cortisol metabolism are largely assessed in LAPC4 cells.

We have changed this section of the Discussion to read, “Although the therapeutic effect of glucocorticoids is likely due in part to adrenal androgen suppression, the complete effects of glucocorticoids in prostate cancer have yet to be fully elucidated. Our observations move us closer to an understanding of the role of glucocorticoid pharmacology and physiology in prostate cancer.”</p><p><italic>4) The in vitro experiments are elegant and sufficiently support the hypothesis that alterations in 11β-HSD2 are mechanistically responsible for sustained glucocorticoid levels in the tumor cells.

We think it is likely those early clinical results may be attributable to the same mechanism we describe in this manuscript, although this would have to be investigated directly. We have included a discussion of this clinical trial in the second paragraph of the manuscript Discussion.</p><p><italic>Title: For improved clarity, we suggest changing the title to &quot;Aberrant corticosteroid metabolism in tumor cells enables GR takeover in enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer.&quot;</italic></p><p>Thank you for this suggestion.
