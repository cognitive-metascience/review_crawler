strictly limited in number and widely spaced along chromosomes (crossover interference). The molecular basis for this chromosome-wide regulation remains mysterious. A family of meiotic RING finger proteins has been implicated in crossover regulation across eukaryotes. <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> expresses four such proteins, of which one (ZHP-3) is known to be required for crossovers. Here we investigate the functions of ZHP-1, ZHP-2, and ZHP-4. We find that all four ZHP proteins, like their homologs in other species, localize to the synaptonemal complex, an unusual, liquid crystalline compartment that assembles between paired homologs. Together they promote accumulation of pro-crossover factors, including ZHP-3 and ZHP-4, at a single recombination intermediate, thereby patterning exchanges along paired chromosomes. These proteins also act at the top of a hierarchical, symmetry-breaking process that enables crossovers to direct accurate chromosome segregation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30789.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes, giving 46 chromosomes in total. When a cell divides, it typically copies all its chromosomes and distributes the copies equally between the two new cells, so that they also have 46 chromosomes. Cells in the reproductive organs undergo a special division process called meiosis, which halves the number of chromosomes. As a result, sperm and eggs have just 23 chromosomes, and so when they combine, the fertilized egg receives a complete set of 46 chromosomes.</p><p>A similar process happens in all species that use sexual reproduction. As the chromosomes prepare to separate, they line up side by side in matching pairs. During this period, DNA from one chromosome will swap with DNA from its partner. These events are called “crossovers,” and because such exchanges can happen at many locations along the chromosomes, no two sperm or eggs are the same.</p><p>Historic studies in fruit flies revealed that chromosomes do not mix their DNA at random. After one crossover occurs, it is less likely that another will happen, and if there are two crossovers, the second one tends be far away from the first. This suggests that there must be a signal that tells the chromosomes about the exchange. However, the nature of the signals and how they are communicated along pairs of chromosomes remain mysterious.</p><p>A structure called the “synaptonemal complex” holds chromosomes together while they mix their DNA. In 2017, researchers found that this structure behaves like a liquid crystal: its molecules are organized into a regular, repeating pattern, but they move freely, like a fluid. If signals could move through this material, this might explain how information spreads along paired chromosomes.</p><p>Now, Zhang et al. – including two researchers involved in the 2017 work – identify some of the signals in the small roundworm, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, as four related proteins named ZHPs. When tagged with fluorescent markers and followed under a microscope, all four ZHP proteins moved to the liquid crystal-like synaptonemal complex during meiosis. Depleting the proteins at this crucial time revealed their roles. Two of the proteins are needed for chromosomes to mix their DNA, while the other two control the number of exchanges between each pair of chromosomes. Successful meiosis depended upon all four ZHPs, and so too did the fertility of the worms.</p><p>The next step is to find the other molecules that interact with the ZHP proteins during meiosis. Since similar proteins appear in other species, including humans, this could help to reveal more about how genetic traits from our parents mix and match. In the future, studies that build on these findings could also help scientists to understand how errors in these processes give rise to birth defects and infertility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>crossover control</kwd><kwd>synaptonemal Complex</kwd><kwd>RING finger ligase</kwd><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd><kwd>Turing pattern</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Liangyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Rillo-Bohn</surname><given-names>Regina</given-names></name><name><surname>Dernburg</surname><given-names>Abby F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM065591</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dernburg</surname><given-names>Abby F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P40 OD010440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dernburg</surname><given-names>Abby F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A regulatory circuit that localizes to the synaptonemal complex, a liquid crystalline compartment between chromosomes, ensures crossing-over while limiting the number of crossovers between homologous chromosomes during meiosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meiosis gives rise to haploid gametes through two sequential rounds of nuclear division. In most eukaryotes, accurate meiotic chromosome segregation requires that every pair of homologous chromosomes attains at least one crossover (CO) recombination product, which creates a stable interhomolog connection known as a chiasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Page and Hawley, 2003</xref>). However, the total number of COs per cell is typically far too low to assure CO formation on each chromosome by a Poisson process; indeed, in many species each homolog pair undergoes only a single CO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mercier et al., 2015</xref>). In cases where multiple COs occur per chromosome pair, they are nonrandomly far apart, a phenomenon known as ‘crossover interference’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Muller, 1916</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sturtevant, 1915</xref>). Despite our longstanding awareness of crossover patterning, the mechanisms that ensure this highly nonrandom process remain poorly understood and controversial.</p><p>Meiotic recombination is initiated by programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalyzed by the conserved topoisomerase-like enzyme Spo11 (SPO-11 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keeney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>). A subset of DSBs is processed to become COs, while the rest are repaired through alternate pathways. In several model organisms, two CO pathways have been elucidated: The ‘class I’ pathway, which is subject to CO assurance and interference, requires two meiosis-specific homologs of the MutS bacterial mismatch repair protein, Msh4 and Msh5, which form a complex known as MutSγ. Components of the synaptonemal complex (SC), an ordered, periodic proteinaceous structure that assembles between homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase, are also required for class I COs. An alternate enzymatic pathway can give rise to both noncrossovers and ‘class II’ COs, which do not show interference.</p><p>In the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, only class I COs normally occur, and only a single CO occurs per chromosome pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martinez-Perez and Colaiácovo, 2009</xref>). No COs occur in the absence of SC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">MacQueen et al., 2002</xref>). Additional factors required for meiotic COs, but not for homolog pairing, synapsis, or other homologous recombination, include MSH-4 and MSH-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kelly et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zalevsky et al., 1999</xref>), the cyclin-related protein COSA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>), and ZHP-3, a RING finger protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jantsch et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>COs act together with sister chromatid cohesion to orchestrate two successive rounds of chromosome segregation. In mammals and most other model organisms, cohesion between sister chromatids is maintained near centromeres during the first division (MI), but arm cohesion must be released to allow homologs to separate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duro and Marston, 2015</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which lacks defined centromeres, cohesion is spatially regulated downstream of CO designation. Late in meiotic prophase, the chromosome region on one side of the designated CO site becomes enriched for several proteins, including HTP-1/2, LAB-1, and REC-8, which act together to maintain cohesion through the first division. Conversely, the reciprocal chromosome region becomes depleted of these proteins but retains a stretch of SC. This ‘short arm’ eventually recruits the Aurora B kinase AIR-2, which is required to release cohesion and allow MI segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Carvalho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferrandiz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaitna et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martinez-Perez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nabeshima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rogers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>). It has been unclear whether the SC that remains along this arm contributes to regulating cohesion. The hierarchy of steps leading to this remodeling, and particularly the initial trigger for this asymmetry, are also poorly understood.</p><p>Several recent studies have indicated that structural proteins within assembled SCs are highly mobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nadarajan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pattabiraman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rog et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Voelkel-Meiman et al., 2012</xref>). We have also presented evidence that this material likely assembles through regulated phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rog et al., 2017</xref>). When SCs cannot assemble between chromosomes, as in <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants lacking the essential chromosome axis protein HTP-3, or in budding yeast lacking DSBs, SC proteins self-assemble to form irregularly shaped, but internally structured, nuclear bodies known as polycomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Roth, 1966</xref>), which do not appear to be associated with chromosomes. Observations of <italic>C. elegans</italic> polycomplexes <italic>in vivo</italic> revealed that they behave as liquid-like droplets, in that they rapidly change shape and fuse to form larger bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rog et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, these observations indicate that SC proteins self-assemble through regulated coacervation to form a liquid crystalline material – defined as an ordered assembly of molecules that diffuse freely relative to each other. Normally this material preferentially assembles as a bilaterally symmetrical lamina between paired axes, but in the absence of the proper chromosomal substrate, it forms polycomplexes.</p><p>Growing evidence has implicated the SC in CO regulation, particularly in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Libuda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">MacQueen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rog et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sym and Roeder, 1994</xref>). The mobility of proteins within assembled SCs suggests that biochemical signals such as enzymes or posttranslational modifications could move through this material to regulate CO formation along paired chromosomes. In support of this idea, a number of crossover factors and DNA damage repair components have been found to associate with both SCs and polycomplexes. In budding yeast, these include Msh4, Msh5, Spo16, Spo22 (Zip4), Zip2, and Zip3, and the 9-1-1 complex component Mec3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shinohara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsubouchi et al., 2006</xref>). Zip3 is unique among these proteins in that it localizes throughout the body of polycomplexes, suggesting that it has an intrinsic affinity for SC proteins, while all other proteins reported to date appear to localize to a ‘cap’ or focus at the surface of polycomplexes. We observed that ZHP-3, a <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of yeast Zip3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal and Roeder, 2000</xref>), similarly localizes throughout polycomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rog et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, ZHP-3 and Zip3 share homology with Hei10 and RNF212, which have been implicated in crossover control across diverse eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chelysheva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Muyt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gray and Cohen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ward et al., 2007</xref>). All of these proteins contain an N-terminal RING finger domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal domain that is predicted to be largely unstructured.</p><p>Three paralogs of ZHP-3 are expressed in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, but their functions have not previously been described. Here we define essential meiotic roles for these proteins. We report that this family of four paralogs, which we designate as ZHP-1–4, likely act as two heterodimeric complexes to regulate CO formation. Like ZHP-3, the other 3 proteins localize throughout SCs in early prophase, and are also recruited to polycomplexes. Together with other known and unknown factors, these ZHP proteins appear to form a signaling network that acts within the SC to ensure CO formation while limiting the number of CO-designated sites, and may thus mediate both CO assurance and CO interference. In addition, the ZHP proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> act upstream of other regulators to direct chromosome remodeling in response to crossover formation, which enables the stepwise removal of cohesion that enables two successive rounds of chromosome segregation during meiosis. Homology between the ZHP proteins and meiotic regulators from other phyla indicate that similar mechanisms likely underlie meiotic CO control in most eukaryotes, and may also play previously-unrecognized roles in regulating sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A family of meiotic RING finger proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>As described in the Introduction, the RING finger protein ZHP-3 was initially identified as a candidate meiotic factor in <italic>C. elegans</italic> based on its homology to Zip3, a component of the ‘synapsis initiation complex’ in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal and Roeder, 2000</xref>).

Pairing and synapsis also occurred normally in the absence of ZHP-1, -2, or -4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Thus, the high frequency of achiasmate chromosomes in the absence of ZHPs reflects defects in CO recombination downstream of pairing, synapsis, and DSBs.</p><p>Prior work has established the existence of a ‘crossover assurance checkpoint’ in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that delays meiotic progression when recombination intermediates or pro-CO factors are absent on one or more chromosomes due to defects in homolog pairing, synapsis, DSB induction, or recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carlton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Activation of this checkpoint prolongs the activity of the CHK-2 kinase, resulting in an extended region and elevated number of RAD-51 foci, and a shift in the pattern of meiotic recombination, but does not perturb CO interference. We observed that phosphorylation of HIM-8 and its paralogs, a marker for CHK-2 activity, was extended when any of the ZHPs was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3G–I</xref>), and RAD-51 foci were more abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–F</xref>).

In the absence of ZHP-3/4, RAD-51 foci reached higher peak numbers than in wild-type animals or in the absence of ZHP-1/2, but depletion of ZHP-1/2 caused a greater delay in both the accumulation and disappearance of RAD-51 foci than depletion of ZHP-3/4. Thus, the two ZHP complexes likely play distinct roles in the processing of recombination intermediates, similar to observations of HEI10 and RNF212 in mouse spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>ZHP-3/4 are essential to stabilize CO intermediates, while ZHP-1/2 restrict pro-CO activities and promote CO maturation</title><p>To probe the role of ZHPs in recombination, we examined the cytological distributions of MSH-5, which can be detected at sites of early recombination intermediates, and COSA-1, which forms bright foci at sites designated for CO formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>).

Together with prior evidence, this suggested that MSH-5 and COSA-1 colocalize at many recombination intermediates in the absence of ZHP-1/2. Indeed, it is likely that these pro-CO factors initially colocalize at all strand exchange intermediates, and that the difference in the number of detected foci of MSH-5 and COSA-1 is due to the relative sensitivity of the available detection reagents.</p><p>To validate the idea that these foci correspond to recombination intermediates, we eliminated recombination by disrupting DSB formation. We AID-tagged SPO-11 and either ZHP-1 or ZHP-2 in the same strain, and found that both proteins could be effectively co-depleted by auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref> and data not shown). This abolished all MSH-5 and GFP-COSA-1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and data not shown), supporting the idea that the dim foci observed in the absence of ZHP-1/2 are indeed recombination intermediates.

Depletion of ZHP-1/2 also resulted in persistence of ZHP-3 and -4 throughout SCs in late pachytene nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref> and data not shown). These observations indicate that ZHP-1/2 are required to restrict pro-CO proteins to a single recombination intermediate along each pair of homologs during late prophase.</p><p>We next sought to understand why oocytes lacking ZHP-1/2 have abundant, dim COSA-1 foci but few bivalent chromosomes. This discrepancy could indicate that the dim foci do not mature as COs, or that they do become COs but fail to give rise to stable chiasmata. To address this, we mapped COs in <italic>zhp-1</italic> null mutants by whole genome sequencing (see Materials and methods). Using this genetic recombination assay, an average of 2.8 ± 1.8 (SD) COs per oocyte were detected in <italic>zhp-1</italic> mutants, compared to 7.3 ± 3.0 (SD) per oocyte (slightly more than the expected number of 6) in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). These data are consistent with the observed number of bivalents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), and indicate that only a small fraction of COSA-1-positive foci in <italic>zhp-1/2</italic> mutants mature to become COs and chiasmata.</p><p>The excess number but weak immunofluorescence of GFP-COSA-1 foci in the absence of ZHP-1/2 suggested that one or more limiting components might be distributed to an excess of recombination intermediates. We therefore wondered whether accumulation of pro-CO factors at specific recombination intermediates could be rescued by restricting the number of these intermediates.

A higher fraction of recombination intermediates become crossovers when breaks are severely reduced, but even when very few DSBs are present, ZHP-1/2 contribute to the accumulation of pro-CO factors, which in turn promotes CO maturation.</p><p>These results indicate that ZHP-1/2 play dual roles: they restrict the accumulation of pro-CO factors to a subset of recombination intermediates and promote their accumulation at a subset of sites. We tested whether these two functions could be separated by reducing the amount of either protein. When strains carrying AID-tagged ZHP-1 or -2 were exposed to low concentrations of auxin, these proteins could be partially depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–B</xref> and data not shown). At very low protein levels, we saw a reduction in the number of GFP-COSA-1 foci, and never observed more than six bright COSA-1 foci per nucleus. Thus, concentrations of ZHP-1/2 required to promote accumulation of pro-CO factors are also sufficient to limit their association with recombination sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref> and data not shown), indicating that these functions are tightly coupled.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>ZHP-1/2 mediate chromosome remodeling in response to CO designation</title><p>As described in the Introduction, stepwise chromosome segregation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiosis requires functional differentiation of the chromosome regions on either side of the crossover.

In early prophase, all 4 ZHPs concentrate within SCs at the interface between homologous chromosomes. DSBs are induced and homologous recombination is initiated through strand invasion. Recruitment or stabilization of MutSγ and COSA-1 at these early intermediates depends on the presence of ZHP-3/4 within the SC. As nuclei progress through mid-prophase, one such intermediate along each chromosome stochastically crosses a threshold activity level. [We note that this is analogous to a ‘cracking’ event posited in a beam-film model for crossover interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kleckner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>)]. This event triggers positive and negative feedback that promotes accumulation of COSA-1, MutSγ, and ZHP-3/4 at this site. These pro-CO activities may be depleted from nearby recombination intermediates through a wave of inhibitory activity that travels outward from a designated CO site; alternatively, local activation and lateral inhibition may give rise to a periodic pattern of pro-CO activity along each pair of chromosomes. In either scenario, diffusion of proteins within the SC permits coordinated behavior of potential CO sites along each pair of chromosomes. (<bold>B</bold>) A circuit diagram for CO control and chromosome remodeling, incorporating the findings of this work. Coupled positive and negative feedback mechanisms mediated by ZHPs and other factors lead to accumulation of pro-CO factors at a single designated crossover site. ZHP-1/2 also act at the top of a hierarchy that leads to PLK-2 enrichment on one side of the crossover and retention of the SC within this domain, creating another positive feedback loop, although how ZHP-1/2 become enriched on one side of the crossover is currently unknown. Activities within the SC antagonize the retention of HTP-1/2 and associated factors along the axis, and vice versa, resulting in the differentiation of two distinct chromosome domains. This leads to eventual removal of REC-8 from the short arm and its retention on the long arm, promoting accurate, stepwise meiotic chromosome separation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30789-fig8-v2"/></fig><p>CO interference in <italic>C. elegans</italic> normally limits COs to one per homolog pair.

Our evidence indicates that ZHP-1/2 are crucial for both positive feedback that promotes accumulation of pro-CO factors, including ZHP-3/4, at a single recombination intermediate, and negative feedback that depletes these factors from other candidate sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Similar feedback loops have been proposed in previous work on crossover regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, coupled positive and negative feedback mechanisms are likely essential for any robust, switch-like decision executed by biological circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pfeuty and Kaneko, 2009</xref>). A full understanding of CO control will clearly require identification of the substrates of the ZHP ligase family and the effects of their modification.</p><p>A single crossover site could be selected, and other sites deselected, via a ‘trigger wave’ that moves rapidly through the SC from an initial site of stochastic CO designation and inhibits selection of nearby recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). However, such a mechanism cannot easily be reconciled with observations that pro-crossover factors, including Zip3, accumulate at recombination intermediates even prior to completion of synapsis in budding yeast, and likely in other organisms. Alternatively, coupled positive and negative regulation may give rise to a periodic standing wave, or Turing pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Turing, 1952</xref>), of CO designation potential along each chromosome. This type of patterning requires interaction between two diffusible activities: an activating activity – or ‘morphogen,’ to use Turing’s term – that acts locally and shows autocatalytic or cooperative behavior, and an inhibitory activity that acts over a greater distance. This type of pattern has intrinsic periodicity that depends on the activities and diffusion rates of the activator and inhibitor. Such a pattern could thus be established prior to full SC assembly, in which case designation of the first CO site would spatially fix one node of the pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). A Turing patterning mechanism is also consistent with evidence presented here and in previous studies that stabilization of recombination intermediates and CO patterning are tightly coupled. Evidence that mammalian RNF212 and Arabidopsis HEI10 act as dosage-sensitive modulators of recombination rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Ziolkowski et al., 2017</xref>) is compatible with either a temporally-dependent or standing wave model, since an increase or decrease in these activities could alter either the rate of signal propagation or the frequency of a waveform along paired chromosomes.</p><p>While the SC is an unusual, liquid crystalline material, liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has been implicated in subcellular compartmentalization of diverse signaling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banani et al., 2017</xref>).

It will be interesting to determine whether ZHP homologs in other organisms also have obligate partners, or perhaps homooligomerize, since this knowledge may help to illuminate their in vivo activities and substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Regulation of sister chromatid cohesion by the ZHP family</title><p>In addition to their roles in CO control, the ZHP family also link COs to chromosome remodeling, which enables the stepwise release of cohesion during the MI and MII divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Specifically, we find that CO designation results in enrichment of ZHP-1/2 along one chromosome arm, which in turn promotes concentration of PLK-2 within this domain, asymmetric disassembly of the SC, and spatial regulation of cohesin function.</p><p>It is not clear whether sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis is regulated in the same fashion in other organisms. In budding and fission yeasts, Drosophila, diverse plants, and mammals, cohesion near centromeres is specifically retained during the first division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duro and Marston, 2015</xref>). Cohesin complexes containing the meiosis-specific kleisin Rec8 are enriched in pericentromeric heterochromatin and sometimes at centromere cores, and Shugoshin/MEI-S332, a Rec8-specific protective factor, is also recruited to these regions. In principle, programmed release of cohesion along arms and its retention near centromeres could suffice to allow homologs to segregate in MI while maintaining a link between sisters until MII. However, experimental evidence from several organisms indicates that CO formation leads to a local disruption of cohesion, which can predispose chromosomes to missegregate when COs occur close to centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brar and Amon, 2008</xref>). In light of other similarities between ZHP-1/2 and HEI10, this raises the possibility that HEI10 may also influence sister chromatid cohesion, perhaps via spatial control of Polo-like kinases, which promote release of cohesion in mitosis and meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Archambault and Glover, 2009</xref>). If so, HEI10 activity may directly impact chromosome missegregation in human oocytes, which has been attributed to compromised cohesion, and also – very recently – to inefficient CO maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), another process that involves HEI10.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>zhp-1</italic></td><td>WormBase/This paper</td><td>WormBase ID: F55A12.10;

Briefly, worms were dissected and fixed essentially according to the immunofluorescence protocol described above. Fixed worm gonads were then washed with 2xSSCT and incubated in 50% formamide/2xSSCT overnight at 37°C. Tissue and probes were denatured at 91°C for 2 min, then hybridized overnight at 37 ˚C. Hybridized gonads were then washed and stained with DAPI. Two chromosome-specific probes were used: an oligonucleotide targeting a short repetitive sequence on the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lieb et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>) and the 5S rDNA repeat on the right arm of chromosome V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>).

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A compartmentalized, self-extinguishing signaling network mediates crossover control in meiosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Bernard de Massy as Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have identified three novel members of the ZHP-3 family (named ZHP-1, -2 and -4) in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, in addition to the previously characterized ZHP-3. The authors analyzed the localization of these proteins, their interactions, the consequence of their depletion (using an AID driven degradation strategy) and their functional relationships with other functions involved in CO formation.</p><p>Altogether, this manuscript reports a novel and important analysis with the evidence for two distinct activities, one mediated by ZHP-3/4 essential for CO designation and one by ZHP-1/2 limiting ZHP-3/4 activity and promoting chromosome remodeling. Interestingly, ZHP-1/2 are the earliest known factors to localize asymmetrically on chromosome arms after COSA-1 foci formation. The DSB-2 depletion and irradiation experiments are notable advances and lend further support to the idea that recombination sites compete for limiting CO components and/or ZHPs stabilize such a factor. DSB-2 depletion experiments also nicely clarify the relationships between excess recombination sites, ZHP-1/-2, CO designation and ZHP-3/-4 dynamics. This is a very interesting paper that provides roles for three new regulators of meiotic recombination and ties in nicely with recent analyses of RING protein in mice (RNF212 and HEI10), Sordaria and Arabidopsis indicating conserved regulatory pathways.</p><p>The data is convincing, and experiments carefully performed. However, the presentation could be improved. Overall the manuscript needs substantial revision.</p><p>Several cytological analyses require better presentation and/or additional quantification. Importantly, the authors should revise several of their interpretations and conclusions which are overstated. This also applies to the title which should relate to the experimental evidence not to hypotheses about a proposed self-extinguishing network. It is essential that they integrate and refer to in their interpretations observations from other related studies (see details below). It would also be helpful to clarify the presentation of some analysis due to the complexity of the different effects or markers that are analyzed. It is not clear why the authors presented effects on bivalents and chiasmata first and why they did not start by reporting synapsis, recombination foci…and then chiasmata.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Introduction. With respect to mobility of SC proteins, cite pertinent studies by MacQueen (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23071451), Villeneuve (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28339470) and Colaiacovo (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28346135) labs.</p><p>Results section. Provide citations for RNF212 and HEI10.</p><p>Subsection “Conservation of crossover control mechanisms”. Please note that similar positive-feedback loop ideas have been proposed by others (Villeneuve and Hunter labs) and should be cited.</p><p>Subsection “Conservation of crossover control mechanisms”. Cite haplo-insufficiency phenotypes of Rnf212 and Hei10 mice as evidence for roles in crossover assurance.</p><p>1) Basic controls: Validation of the signal detected with the antibodies (negative control?).</p><p>Validation of the function of the fusion proteins.

However, the Spo11 dependency does not tell whether these foci are DSB repair sites. Co-staining with DSB repair protein should be tested (RAD-51, RPA). These foci are obviously not converted into CO. MSH5 foci (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) appear substantially brighter in the zhp-1/2 mutants.

The authors analyzed the localization of these proteins, their interactions, the consequence of their depletion (using an AID driven degradation strategy) and their functional relationships with other functions involved in CO formation.</p><p>Altogether, this manuscript reports a novel and important analysis with the evidence for two distinct activities, one mediated by ZHP-3/4 essential for CO designation and one by ZHP-1/2 limiting ZHP-3/4 activity and promoting chromosome remodeling. Interestingly, ZHP-1/2 are the earliest known factors to localize asymmetrically on chromosome arms after COSA-1 foci formation. The DSB-2 depletion and irradiation experiments are notable advances and lend further support to the idea that recombination sites compete for limiting CO components and/or ZHPs stabilize such a factor. DSB-2 depletion experiments also nicely clarify the relationships between excess recombination sites, ZHP-1/-2, CO designation and ZHP-3/-4 dynamics. This is a very interesting paper that provides roles for three new regulators of meiotic recombination and ties in nicely with recent analyses of RING protein in mice (RNF212 and HEI10), Sordaria and Arabidopsis indicating conserved regulatory pathways.</p><p>The data is convincing, and experiments carefully performed. However, the presentation could be improved. Overall the manuscript needs substantial revision.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their positive comments, and for the very detailed, constructive, and perceptive review. We address the individual comments below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several cytological analyses require better presentation and/or additional quantification. Importantly, the authors should revise several of their interpretations and conclusions which are overstated. This also applies to the title which should relate to the experimental evidence not to hypotheses about a proposed self-extinguishing network.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon reflection, we agree with the reviewers that other interpretations of our data are equally viable, and we have extensively revised our Discussion section in response and have changed the title of the paper to focus on the compartmentalized nature of the signaling network. We also added additional quantification for several of our cytological analyses and revised some interpretations according the reviewers’ suggestions and comments (see below for details).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is essential that they integrate and refer to in their interpretations observations from other related studies (see details below). It would also be helpful to clarify the presentation of some analysis due to the complexity of the different effects or markers that are analyzed.

In particular, we feel that the observation that chiasmata depend absolutely on ZHP-3/4 but only partially on ZHP-1/2 helps to contextualize and interpret some of the findings we describe subsequently regarding recombination intermediates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Introduction.

As this is the first description of ZHP-4, those foci should be quantified as well as their colocalization with COSA-1.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantification of immunofluorescent foci, particularly in whole-mount tissues, is inherently challenging and problematic. Differences in the affinity of antibodies or abundance of various proteins make it problematic to compare numbers of foci, since an unknown fraction of foci may be below the limit of detection. For example, we report here that we detect more MSH-5 foci than COSA-1 foci per nucleus in both wild-type and <italic>zhp-1/2</italic> mutants, but this likely reflects a difference in sensitivity rather than a <italic>bona fide</italic> difference in the frequency of their association with recombination intermediates. We have quantified foci in those cases where we felt it would be meaningful to compare between genotypes.</p><p>In response to the reviewers’ specific request regarding ZHP-4 foci, we have now quantified the colocalization of ZHP-4 with COSA-1. We report that in 100% of wild-type oocytes, all GFP-COSA-1 foci at late pachytene colocalized with ZHP-4 puncta (11 row of nuclei from every 8 gonads were scored). We include this data in the revised manuscript. However, we feel quantification of ZHP-4 foci in early prophase would be a very difficult task and would not be informative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Results section. The ZHP signals in the syp-1 mutant should be clarified (late pachytene bright foci).</p><p>The authors conclude that ZHP proteins are not associated with chromosomes in syp-1 mutant.

Is this a reproducible observation?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the question. We have now added statements to clarify that these foci of ZHP proteins do not colocalize with SYP proteins, and are thus not polycomplexes, but rather a distinct type of aggregate. We have also added images to show that ZHPs foci in <italic>syp-1</italic> mutants do not colocalize with recombination intermediates marked by RAD-51 (Figure 1—figure supplement 3D).</p><p>We have examined our 3D data stacks in detail and conclude that doublets of ZHP-3 staining are infrequently observed. Given that we did not observe nuclei at later stages showing more than 6 ZHP-3 foci, we do not think it likely that occasional closely spaced ZHP-3 foci represent multiple sites along the same chromosome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Association of ZHPs with meiotic chromosomes depends on synaptonemal complexes”. The authors should define what they mean by CO designation, how it is monitored and what is the basis for assuming that COSA-1 and MSH-5 are required for CO designation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out these ambiguities in our terminology. Prior work has established that COSA-1, ZHP-3, and MutSƔ are not required for synapsis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> but are all required for the appearance of bright COSA-1 foci along chromosomes at mid-pachytene, which have been convincingly established to correspond to sites of designated crossovers. Operationally, crossover designation is thus defined as the appearance of bright COSA-1 foci after mid-pachytene. COSA-1 and MutSƔ are also interdependent for the appearance of early foci that stain faintly with MSH-5 antibodies (MSH-4 antibodies and tagged transgenes have not produced signals above the limit of our detection). In the revised manuscript we show that ZHP-3/4 are also required for detection of these early, dim foci. Given that the biochemical basis for this designation remains uncertain, we have now largely eliminated the phrase “crossover designation,” and instead used more descriptive phrases such as “bright COSA-1 foci,” throughout the manuscript. Evidence from other organisms suggests that crossover designation and crossover resolution/maturation may be temporally distinct processes, so we have also avoided the use of the term “crossover formation” to describe the sites marked by COSA-1 foci.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “ZHPs act as two heterodimeric complexes”. Head of section should be revised. The data presented does not show that the complexes are heterodimeric.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided complementary lines of evidence that these proteins act as heterodimers: in addition to showing that the four ZHPs show pairwise interdependence for their localization and function, and in some cases for stability, we provide physical interaction data based on yeast 2-hybrid analysis, which is generally regarded as reporting on direct protein-protein interactions (Fields and Song, (1989). A novel genetic system to detect protein-protein interactions PMID: 2547163 DOI:10.1038/340245a0). Based on ample precedents for dimerization of RING finger E3 ligases, our evidence supports the idea that these proteins function as heterodimers or heterooligomers.</p><p>However, to soften the statement, we have revised the section heading to read: “ZHPs likely act as two heterodimeric complexes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “ZHP-3/4 are essential for CO designation, while ZHP-1/2 limit ZHP-3/4 activity and promote CO maturation”. The dim COSA-1 foci observed in zhp-1/2 mutants should be clarified. This is an essential point since the authors conclude based on this observation that ZHPs limit CO. However, the Spo11 dependency does not tell whether these foci are DSB repair sites. Co-staining with DSB repair protein should be tested (RAD-51, RPA). These foci are obviously not converted into CO. MSH5 foci (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) appear substantially brighter in the zhp-1/2 mutants. Is this correct or a matter of image adjustment/exposure? Do they vary in size/brightness? The increase from mid to late pachytene is not visible on Figure 4—figure supplement 1. Their numbers also appear to be higher than previous various estimates of DSB events.</p><p>The authors may consider the possibility that MSH-5 foci are transient or destabilized in zhp-3 (4) mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting this issue, and we provide additional information to clarify this in the revised manuscript. Specifically, we have now co-stained for COSA-1 and RAD-51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and for COSA-1 and MSH-5 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E) in <italic>zhp-1</italic> mutants. We find that COSA-1 foci do not colocalize with RAD-51 (as is also true for wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic>). However, we found that dim COSA-1 foci do colocalize extensively with MSH-5. Together with our findings that these foci are absent or greatly reduced in <italic>spo-11</italic> and <italic>dsb-2</italic> mutants, respectively, this supports the idea that dim COSA-1 foci correspond to recombination intermediates.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30789.027</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30789-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Indeed, MSH-5 foci (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) appear substantially brighter in the <italic>zhp-1/2</italic> mutants, which likely reflects a failure of the “winner takes all” nature of the ZHP circuit. The increase in MSH-5 intensity from mid to late pachytene is much more obvious in <italic>zhp-1</italic> mutants than in WT. The brightness of MSH-5 foci can vary markedly in the same nucleus. While we have quantified the relative numbers of these foci in <italic>zhp-1/2</italic> vs. wild-type animals, we do not feel that these can be regarded as absolute numbers of intermediates, due to the limits of fluorescent detection, particularly for proteins of low abundance (as argued above). We also now report that early MSH-5 and COSA-1 foci are not detected in <italic>zhp-3/4</italic> mutants and suggest that this may be due to a failure of stabilization.</p><p>Quantification of DSBs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> has been challenging and contentious. Again, different markers (e.g., MSH-5 vs. RAD-51) have different sensitivities of detection. Additionally, mutations that block the repair of DSBs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (e.g., <italic>rad-54</italic>) lead to a prolonged period of DSB formation and an increase in their number, making it very difficult to assess this question, and we are not aware of any reliable estimates for the number of DSBs in wild-type animals. (See our discussion of this issue in Yu et al., 2016). We are working to address this important question by immunoprecipitating SPO-11-bound oligonucleotides.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The impact of ZHP-1/2 on axis remodeling is not convincing. The statement that HTP-1 and SYP-1 remain colocalized in zhp-1 mutant (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B) is not seen on the figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B) where only a fraction of the proteins colocalizes in nucleus #2.</p><p>The authors conclude that in the absence of ZHP-1/2, SC remodeling on axis is defective (with persistence on both short on long arms), but this is not the case in the context of DSB-2. Thus, there is a ZHP-1/2 independent remodeling of SC proteins? Please clarify and revise the statement &quot;ZHP-1/2 mediate chromosome remodeling&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize that it can be difficult, particularly for researchers unfamiliar with meiotic cytology in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, to appreciate and interpret the differences in bivalent structure we document for various genotypes. We have tried to clarify the text and figure legends to make the images easier to interpret. Our key findings are that HTP-1 and SYP-1 fail to show reciprocal localization on the few bivalent chromosomes present in <italic>zhp-1/2</italic> mutants, and also colocalize along univalent chromosomes. In contrast, in other mutants lacking COs, univalent chromosomes are usually positive for HTP-1 or SYP-1 staining, but not both (Martinez-Perez et al., ‎2005).</p><p>We used <italic>zhp-1/2; dsb-2</italic> double mutants to analyze this issue further, since in these animals we do observe occasional bright COSA-1 foci at late pachytene. These foci correspond to the number of bivalents observed at diakinesis, indicating that they mature as crossovers. Although ZHP-3/4 were depleted from the corresponding SCs, other hallmarks of remodeling (e.g., PLK-2 localization and SC retention along the short arms) were defective, leading to the hierarchical view of remodeling described in the text and in Figure 8.</p><p>We hope that these clarifications fully address the reviewers’ concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection “Conservation of crossover control mechanisms”. Clarify what is meant by &quot;Evidence presented here[…]&quot;: Which data indicate that ZHP activity is responsible for signal propagation in crossover interference? How does this idea explain the dosage sensitivity of RNF212/HEI10?</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this statement, since we agreed that it was confusing and that other interpretations are equally consistent with our data. We address the dosage sensitivity of RNF212/HEI10 in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 1—figure supplement 2: Western blots: why normalizing by HTP-3 if the level of this protein is not the same in wt and syp1?

We routinely load lysate from an equal number of age-matched worms in each lane, which is probably at least as useful as other normalization methods. The abundance of many proteins, including tubulin, is affected by meiotic mutations such as <italic>syp-1</italic>, presumably due to differential abundance of proliferating and meiotic stages in the germline. Using tubulin and HTP-3 to normalize our ZHP blots gave very similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We chose to include HTP-3 as reference, since this protein is restricted to nuclei in meiotic prophase, while tubulin is present in all germline and somatic cells. Because both HTP-3 and tubulin are more abundant in <italic>syp-1</italic> mutants, our normalized measurements likely underestimate the degree to which the ZHP proteins are reduced/destabilized in the absence of synapsis. However, this is not a central finding of this work.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30789.028</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30789-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Subsection “ZHPs play essential roles in chiasma formation and chromosome segregation”.

However, we feel that this would be impossible to do in a meaningful way due to the sensitivity issues raised above. As we describe, as we exposed animals to increasing doses of radiation, the number of dim foci increased, and bright foci decreased. However, the brightness of the foci in the same nuclei varies widely, making it impossible to classify them. Additionally, it should be noted that all published COSA-1 quantification to date has used a bombarded (multicopy) GFP-COSA-1 transgene, which is likely overexpressed relative to wild-type COSA-1 and may therefore not represent the wild-type situation. That said, we have quantified COSA-1 foci in Figure 5 panel A, which strongly support our conclusion. Figure 5 panel D was included to document the gradual change in both brightness and number of COSA-1 foci, since the images provide a better understanding than any quantification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Subsection “Conservation of crossover control mechanisms”. SUMO or ubiquitin ligase activities of these proteins have not been established. This statement should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there are no published findings that convincingly establish SUMO or ubiquitin ligase activity for the Zip3/RNF212/Hei10/ZHP family. However, interpretations in several prominent publications have led many in the field to accept the idea that these proteins have opposing SUMO and ubiquitin ligase activity. We thus feel that it is relevant and important to highlight prior findings from <italic>C. elegans</italic> that indicate that SUMOylation is dispensable for crossover control in this organism.

To include these ideas while keeping the Abstract within 150 words, it was necessary to remove some of the other statements. We have deleted the sentence regarding the winner-takes-all nature of the circuit, since it requires more space than available in the Abstract to clarify, but we do still mention this idea in the Discussion section. (We note that “winner-take-all” is a well-established term that describes a class of regulatory mechanisms). We also removed the phrase “stepwise segregation” from the Abstract, for similar reasons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) In the main text, change the term « meiotic cohesion » which cannot be understood as such.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers have not explained why they object to this term, but to address this comment we have now replaced the phrase “meiotic cohesion” with “sister chromatid cohesion in meiosis” or similar alternatives throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “A family of meiotic RING finger proteins in C. elegans”, third paragraph. Three data not shown are referred to. Please show homology to mammalian RNF212 and to Hei10 and add the information in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion. However, we made a decision not to include alignments, phylogenetic trees, or other visual evidence for homology between ZHPs, Zip3, RNF212, and HEI10 because we find that these alignments are highly sensitive to the specific algorithms and parameters chosen. Unsurprisingly, the well-conserved RING finger domains dominate any alignments among these proteins. Coiled-coil domains are notoriously refractory to homology recognition and alignment because they have a highly skewed amino acid composition. The highly divergent, probably unstructured, C-terminal domains likely confer the unique activities of these proteins, but are difficult to align meaningfully, in part because such domains do not conform to the same patterns of amino acid substitutions as globular protein domains. The sequences of the ZHP proteins and their homologs are readily available, so interested readers can easily and quickly verify homology by doing their own BLAST or other homology searches and alignments, using the tools they prefer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would help if the authors emphasize that the compartment they refer to is a bivalent with its SC and thus conveys bivalent autonomous properties. This is mentioned in subsection “ZHP-1/2 mediate chromosome remodeling in response to CO designation”, but it could also be mentioned subsection “Compartmentalization of CO regulation by the synaptonemal complex”.</p></disp-quote><p>By &quot;compartment” we actually mean the SC that assembles between a pair of chromosomes (or an individual polycomplex), rather than the bivalent as a whole. We have added additional comments in several places, including the abstract, to clarify our use of this term.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the Introduction, add &quot;likely&quot; heterodimeric to qualify the protein complexes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added “likely” to qualify this statement. We note that the reviewers have not explained their skepticism about the idea that ZHP-1/2 and ZHP-3/4 are heterodimeric complexes, given that we provide extensive physical and functional interaction data and there are many precedents for dimerization of RING finger proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Introduction. Whether it is poorly understood is subjective, the authors should rather acknowledge what is known (work on RNF212 and HEI10) or not.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Data of the quantification of Zhp-4 and Cosa foci should be provided to support the sentence “At late pachynema, all GFP-COSA-1 foci colocalize with ZHP-4 puncta in 100% of nuclei (n=450 nuclei, 11 rows of nuclei from 8 gonads were scored). 3F indicates 3xFLAG. Scale bars, 5μm.” (Figure 1 legend).</p></disp-quote><p>We do not understand what the reviewers are requesting here. Figure 1 includes representative images showing colocalization of COSA-1 with ZHP-3 and ZHP-4 at late pachytene. The legend describes our quantification of the extent of colocalization between COSA-1 and ZHP-4 at this stage (as previously requested by the reviewers), including the numbers of nuclei and gonads analyzed. We felt that including this statement in the main text disrupted the flow, so we chose to put it in the figure legend, but we can move it to the main text if preferred.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Ambiguity persists on the use of CO designation and maturation and the criteria used for monitoring this.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now replaced most of the remaining instances of the phrase “CO designation” with the more objective “accumulation of pro-CO factors at a single site” or similar.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “ZHP proteins exhibit two distinct patterns of dynamic localization during meiosis”: CO designation is thought to occur at mid pachytene</p><p>However, the criteria for CO designation is bright COSA-1 foci which are fully detected at late pachynema (It should be mentioned that the criteria for CO maturation is chiasma or genetic exchange). (Subsection “Subsection “ZHP proteins exhibit two distinct patterns of dynamic localization during meiosis”: Upon the appearance of GFP COSA-1 foci, which mark designated crossover sites).</p></disp-quote><p>In this particular context, our statements summarize the conclusions of Yokoo et al., (2012). While COSA-1 foci normally become brighter from mid to late pachytene, the accumulation of COSA-1 at a single site initiates by mid-pachytene, indicating that the site has been selected/designated at that time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of « robust » CO designation is also confusing (subsection “ZHP-3/4 are essential to stabilize CO intermediates, while ZHP-1/2 restrict pro-CO activities”) because it is also used to relate to the brightness of COSA-1 foci (Subsection “ZHP-1/2 mediate chromosome remodeling in response to CO designation”: COs were robustly marked by COSA-1).</p><p>In Zhp-1 mutant bright COSA-1 foci are absent but still some low level of CO is detected. I assume the authors want to suggest that CO designation is not completely abolished in Zhp-1 mutant (robust is also used to qualify interference and maturation).</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the adjective “robust” from our descriptions of the crossover designation process, and we have also eliminated the phrase “crossover designation,” as noted above. It remains unclear why some COs are detected (by both genetic recombination analysis and the presence of bivalents at diakinesis) in <italic>zhp-1/2</italic> mutants, even though we do not observe accumulation of pro-CO factors at a subset of recombination intermediates. It may be that sufficient pro-CO factors stochastically accumulate at a subset of sites to promote CO maturation through the Class I pathway, or these COs may instead be Class II COs, which have been observed in some <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants. This ambiguity makes it difficult to say whether “CO designation” in the presence of excess DSBs strictly depends on <italic>zhp-1/2</italic>. Our experiments with <italic>dsb-2</italic> mutants indicate that the roles of <italic>zhp-1/2</italic> are less essential for accumulation of pro-CO factors at recombination intermediates when competition between these intermediates is reduced or eliminated.</p></body></sub-article></article>
