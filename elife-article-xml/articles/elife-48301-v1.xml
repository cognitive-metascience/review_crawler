darkness and are driven by intracellular transcription-translation feedback loops. Although these cellular oscillators communicate, isolated mammalian cellular clocks continue to tick away in darkness without intercellular communication. To investigate these issues in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we assayed behavior as well as molecular rhythms within individual brain clock neurons while blocking communication within the ca. 150 neuron clock network. We also generated CRISPR-mediated neuron-specific circadian clock knockouts. The results point to two key clock neuron groups: loss of the clock within both regions but neither one alone has a strong behavioral phenotype in darkness; communication between these regions also contributes to circadian period determination. Under these dark conditions, the clock within one region persists without network communication. The clock within the famous PDF-expressing s-LNv neurons however was strongly dependent on network communication, likely because clock gene expression within these vulnerable sLNvs depends on neuronal firing or light.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>network communication</kwd><kwd>activity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schlichting</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name><name><surname>Díaz</surname><given-names>Madelen M</given-names></name><name><surname>Xin</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosbash</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schlichting</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Network silencing experiments and cell-specific CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts suggest that network communication is necessary for generating robust rhythms within the clock neuron network.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal networks make myriad contributions to behavior and physiology. By definition, individual neurons within a network interact, and different networks also interact to coordinate specialized functions. For example, the visual cortex and motor output centers must coordinate to react properly to environmental changes. In a less immediate fashion, sleep centers and circadian clocks are intertwined to properly orchestrate animal physiology. The brain clock is of special interest: it not only times and coordinates physiology within neuronal tissues but also sends signals to the body to keep the entire organism in sync with the cycling external environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mohawk et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The small, circumscribed <italic>Drosophila</italic> clock network is ideal to address circadian communication issues. The comparable region in mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, is composed of thousands of cells depending on the species. There are in contrast only 75 clock neurons per hemisphere in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These different clock neurons can be divided into several subgroups according to their location within the fly brain. There are 4 lateral and three dorsal neuron clusters, which have different functions in controlling fly physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Helfrich-Förster et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The four small ventro-lateral neurons (sLNvs) are arguably the most important of the 75 clock neurons. This is because ablating or silencing these neurons abolishes rhythms in constant darkness (DD). They reside in the accessory medulla region of the fly brain, an important pacemaker center in many insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Helfrich-Förster, 1997</xref>), and express the neuropeptide PDF. In addition, they are essential for predicting dawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Depetris-Chauvin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nitabach et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>). A very recent study suggests that the sLNvs are also able to modulate the timing of the evening (E) peak of behavior via PDF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Renn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schlichting et al., 2019a</xref>). The other ventral-lateral group, the four large-ventro-lateral neurons (lLNvs), also express PDF and send projections to the medulla, the visual center of the fly brain; they are important arousal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheeba et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with the ablation experiments mentioned above, the absence of <italic>pdf</italic> function or reducing PDF levels via RNAi causes substantial arrhythmic behavior in DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Renn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shafer and Taghert, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Other important clock neurons include the dorso-lateral neurons (LNds), which are essential for the timing of the E peak and adjustment to long photoperiods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kistenpfennig et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>). Two other clock neuron groups, the lateral-posterior neurons (LPN) and a subset of the dorsal neurons (DN1s), were recently shown to connect the clock network to sleep centers in the fly central complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lamaze et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ni et al., 2019</xref>). The DN2 neurons are essential for temperature preference rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>), whereas no function has so far been assigned to the DN3s.</p><p>Despite these distinct functions, individual clock neuron groups are well-connected to each other. At the anatomical level, all lateral neuron clusters and even DN1 dorsal neurons send some of their projections into the accessory medulla, where they can interact. A second area of common interaction is the dorsal brain; only the lLNvs do not project there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Helfrich-Förster et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have investigated interactions between different clock neurons. Artificially expressing kinases within specific clock neurons causes their clocks to run fast or slow and also changes the overall free-running period of the fly, indicating that network signaling adjusts behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dissel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rieger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>). Similarly, speeding up or slowing down individual neurons is able to differentially affect behavioral timing in standard light-dark (LD) cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stoleru et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yao et al., 2016</xref>). A high level of neuronal plasticity within the network also exists: axons of individual cells undergo daily oscillations in their morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernández et al., 2008</xref>), and neurons change their targets depending on the environmental condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gorostiza et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>How neuronal communication influences the fly core feedback loop is not well understood. The latter consists of several interlocked transcriptional-translational feedback loops, which probably underlie rhythms in behavior and physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hardin, 2011</xref>). A simplified version of the core feedback loop consists of the transcriptional activators Clock (CLK) and Cycle (CYC) and the transcriptional repressors Period (PER) and Timeless (TIM). CLK and CYC bind to E-boxes within the <italic>period</italic> (<italic>per</italic>) and <italic>timeless</italic> (<italic>tim</italic>) genes (among other clock-controlled genes) and activate their transcription. After PER and TIM synthesis in the cytoplasm, they form a heterodimer and enter the nucleus toward the end of the night. There they interact with CLK and CYC, release them from their E-box targets and thereby inhibit their own transcription. All 75 pairs of clock neurons contain this canonical circadian machinery, which undergoes daily oscillations in level. Indeed, the immunohistochemical cycling of PER and TIM within these neurons is a classic assay to visualize these molecular oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menegazzi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Silencing PDF neurons stops their PER cycling, indicating an important role of neuronal firing in maintaining circadian oscillations. However, only two time points were measured, and the results were possibly confounded by developmental effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Depetris-Chauvin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nitabach et al., 2002</xref>). PDF neuron silencing also phase advances PER cycling in downstream neurons, suggesting that PDF normally serves to delay cycling in target neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). This is consistent with experiments showing that PDF signaling stabilizes PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, neuronal activation is able to mimic a light pulse and phase shift the clock due to firing-mediated TIM degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To investigate more general features of clock neuron interactions on the circadian machinery, we silenced the majority of the fly brain clock neurons and investigated behavior and clock protein cycling within the circadian network in a standard light-dark cycle (LD) as well as in constant darkness (DD). Silencing abolished rhythmic behavior but had no effect on clock protein cycling in LD, indicating that the silencing affects circadian output but not oscillator function in a cycling light environment. Silencing similarly abolished rhythmic behavior in DD but with very different effects on clock protein cycling. Although protein cycling in the LNds was not affected by neuronal silencing in DD, the sLNvs dampened almost immediately. Interestingly, this differential effect is under transcriptional control, suggesting that some <italic>Drosophila</italic> clock neurons experience activity-regulated clock gene transcription. Cell-specific CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts of the core clock protein PER further suggests that network properties are critical to maintain wild-type activity-rest rhythms. Our data taken together show that clock neuron communication and firing-mediated clock gene transcription are essential for high amplitude and synchronized molecular rhythms as well as rhythmic physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate the effects of clock network communication on fly behavior, we silenced most adult brain clock neurons using UAS-<italic>Kir</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johns et al., 1999</xref>).

In this system, GAL80 is active at low temperatures (18°C) and inhibits GAL4 expression. By increasing the temperature to 30°C, GAL80 is inactivated, GAL4 is then functional and the <italic>clk856</italic> network silenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGuire et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>At the low temperature, the controls and experimental lines show a typical wild-type bimodal activity pattern, which disappeared in experimental flies after switching to the high temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This effect was already visible on day one of high temperature exposure which shows that the <italic>clk856&gt;Kir</italic> phenotype is not caused by defects during development. However, we cannot rule out chronic effects due to the prolonged period of network silencing.</p><p>We next compared the behavior to flies with silenced PDF neurons. Adult-specific silencing of the PDF neurons using the gene-switch system significantly advanced the timing of the E peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>), which reproduces previously published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Depetris-Chauvin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nitabach et al., 2002</xref>). However, the comparison with the <italic>clk856</italic> results shown above indicates that silencing the whole clock neuron network causes a much more severe behavioral phenotype than only silencing the PDF cells, that is network silencing completely abolishes rhythmic LD behavior, similar to clock mutant flies.</p><p>How does network silencing affect the circadian molecular feedback loop? To address this issue, we assayed PER as well as PDP1 protein levels in individual clock neuron clusters at four different times during the LD cycle. Both proteins show robust cycling: PER peaks at the end of the night (ZT0), and PDP1 peaks slightly earlier than PER as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hardin, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–1N</xref>). This indicates that network silencing has no detectable effect on clock protein timing or cycling amplitude in LD. These data further suggest that either the different neuron clocks are self-sustained, comparable to the mammalian liver, or that light can drive rhythmic gene expression even in absence of neuronal communication.</p><p>To distinguish between these possibilities, we assayed behavior and molecular cycling in constant darkness (DD). Only 17% of the silenced flies were rhythmic, indicating that network silencing causes high levels of DD arrhythmicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To rule out developmental effects, we applied the <italic>tub-GAL80ts</italic> system as described above: 80 percent of the experimental flies were rhythmic at 18°C, but they were profoundly arrhythmic at 30°C with only two rhythmic flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, adult-specific silencing of only the PDF neurons more weakly reduced rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and also caused a short period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), phenotypes that are essentially indistinguishable from those of the classical <italic>pdf<sup>01</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Renn et al., 1999</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48301.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Silencing the clock network strongly affects behavior and molecular rhythms in DD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Percentage of rhythmic flies in DD. Silencing most of the clock neurons significantly reduces rhythmicity to less than 20 percent, suggesting that clock neuron activity is essential for rhythmic behavior output.

As expected, all assayed clock neurons from control strains maintain robust and coordinated cycling in DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–H</xref>); the sLNvs, LNds and DN1s peak slightly sooner than in LD, consistent with the slightly less than 24 hr circadian period in DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>In striking contrast, silencing the clock network causes clock protein cycling within the individual neuronal subgroups to differ strongly from each other, in amplitude and in phase. Clock protein cycling in the LNds is least affected by neuronal silencing and with little to no change in phase or amplitude, suggesting a robust and possibly self-autonomous clock in these neurons; see Discussion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and G</xref>). The sLNvs in contrast dampen and rapidly become arrhythmic, suggesting that these cells are rather weak oscillators and require network activity or light for proper molecular rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and F</xref>). The DN1s also dampen but less strongly. They manifest low amplitude cycling, which is phase-advanced; this intermediate situation suggests a fast and somewhat network dependent clock in DN1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and H</xref>). The DN2s were similar to the DN1s (data not shown). A comparable set of effects were observed in adult-specific silencing experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To compare the contribution of network communication with the release of PDF to PER protein cycling, we also silenced only the PDF neurons in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This slightly decreased the cycling amplitude in the sLNvs (p&lt;0.01) but to a much smaller extent than silencing the entire brain clock (p&lt;0.01). The LNds appeared unaffected by PDF neuron silencing, whereas the shape but not the amplitude of the PER cycling curve was altered in the DN1s (p=0.1628).

Similarly, a PERKO in the cells important for controlling E activity (E cells: 3 LNds and the 5<sup>th</sup> sLNv) with <italic>MB122B</italic>-split-GAL4 had no effect on rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>).

In contrast, a PERKO in most of the lateral neuron clusters gave rise to a short period. These two sets of period phenotypes taken together suggest that the clocks in the two different key neuron subgroups collaborate to achieve the intermediate and close to 24 hr period characteristic of wild-type flies.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48301.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>KO of PER in subsets of neurons changes free-running period.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Changes of free-running period upon KO.

Knocking out core clock components such as <italic>period</italic> or <italic>Clock</italic> severely disrupts circadian behavior as well as molecular clock properties in flies and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gekakis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Konopka and Benzer, 1971</xref>). Here we show that similar behavioral effects occur when we silence the central clock neurons and thereby abolish communication within this network and with downstream targets, that is fly behavior becomes arrhythmic in LD as well as DD conditions and resembles the phenotypes of core clock mutant strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Konopka and Benzer, 1971</xref>).</p><p>Despite the loss of all rhythmic behavior, silencing did not impact the molecular machinery in LD conditions: PER and PDP1 protein cycling was normal. These findings suggest that 1) rhythmic behavior requires clock neuron output, which is uncoupled from the circadian molecular machinery by network silencing, and 2) synchronized molecular rhythms of clock neurons do not require neuronal activity. These findings are in agreement with previous work showing that silencing the PDF neurons had no effect on PER cycling within these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Depetris-Chauvin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nitabach et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). The results presumably reflect the strong effect of the external light-dark cycle on these oscillators.</p><p>In DD however, the individual neurons change dramatically: the different neurons desynchronize, and their protein cycling damps to different extents. Interestingly, sLNv cycling relies most strongly on neuronal communication: these neurons cycle robustly in controls but apparently not at all in the silenced state. sLNvs were previously shown to be essential for DD rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>). Unfortunately, the sensitivity of immunohistochemistry precludes determining whether the molecular clock has actually stopped or whether silencing has only (dramatically) reduced cycling amplitude. However, a simple interpretation of the adult-specific silencing experiment favors a stopped clock: decreasing the temperature to 18 degrees after a week at high temperature failed to rescue rhythmic behavior. A similar experiment in mammals gave rise to the opposite result, suggesting an effect of firing on circadian amplitude in that case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamaguchi et al., 2003</xref>). However, we cannot at this point exclude different explanations, for example chronic effects of neuronal silencing or a too large phase difference between the different neuronal subgroups to reverse after a week without communication.</p><p>In either case, a stopped clock or an effect on clock protein oscillation amplitude, these results make another link to the mammalian literature: modeling of the clock network suggests that different neurons resynchronize more easily if the most highly-connected cells are intrinsically weak oscillators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Webb et al., 2012</xref>). The sLNvs are essential for DD rhythms, known to communicate with other clock neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>) and are situated in the accessory medulla; this is an area of extensive neuronal interactions in many insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reischig and Stengl, 2003</xref>). These considerations rationalize weak sLNv oscillators.</p><p>An important role of interneuron communication in DD is in agreement with previous work showing that altering the speed of individual neuron groups can change the phase of downstream target neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>). An important signaling molecule is the neuropeptide PDF: its absence changes the phase of downstream target neurons, and silencing PDF neurons causes an essentially identical phenotype to the lack of PDF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Im et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). However, the effects reported here are much stronger and show different levels of autonomy than PDF ablation, suggesting that other signaling molecules and/or the neuronal activity of additional clock neurons are essential to maintain proper rhythmic clock protein expression.</p><p>To address these possibilities, we took two approaches. First, we investigated clock gene RNA levels after silencing. The goal was to assess whether the damping of silenced neurons is under gene expression control, likely transcriptional control. Indeed, <italic>tim</italic> mRNA profiles nicely reproduced the protein cycling profiles: robust cycling of all (assayed) clock neurons was maintained in LD even with silencing, but <italic>tim</italic>-mRNA levels in the sLNvs stopped cycling in DD; in contrast, robust cycling was maintained in the LNds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref>). This suggests that the changes in protein cycling amplitude and also possibly phase are under transcriptional control. Importantly, the <italic>tim</italic> signal in the sLNvs disappeared upon silencing, suggesting that neuronal activity promotes clock gene transcription at least in this subset of neurons. This recapitulates for the first time in <italic>Drosophila</italic> the robust positive relationship between neuronal firing and clock gene transcription in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shigeyoshi et al., 1997</xref>). To date, <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuronal firing had only been connected to post-transcriptional clock protein regulation, namely TIM degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). Conceivably, these two effects are connected: TIM degradation might be required to relieve transcriptional repression and maintain cycling.</p><p>The second approach was a cell-specific knockout strategy, applied to the clock neuron network. We generated three guides targeting the CDS of <italic>per</italic> and also expressed CAS9 in a cell-specific manner. The guides caused double strand breaks in the <italic>per</italic> gene, which in turn led to cell-specific <italic>per</italic> mutations. This adult brain knockout strategy worked reliably and specifically, in glial cells as well as neurons, with high efficiency and with no apparent background effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–G</xref>). We have successfully used this strategy to knock out most if not all <italic>Drosophila</italic> GPCRs (data not shown) and believe it will be superior to RNAi for most purposes. Importantly, expression of the guides with the <italic>clk856</italic>-GAL4 driver phenocopied <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic> behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and H</xref>). To focus on individual clock neurons, we generated cell-specific knockouts in different clock neurons. PERKO in the PDF cells did not increase the level of arrhythmicity, only a PERKO in most lateral neurons, E cells as well as PDF cells, generated high levels of arrhythmic behavior.</p><p>This result is surprising given previous rescue or knockdown experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herrero et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>)<italic>: per</italic> rescue in all neurons except the PDF neurons (<italic>elav-GAL4 pdf-GAL80</italic>) did not restore wildtype behavior. However, this rescue significantly improved the rhythmicity index compared to control flies, which can be interpreted as lower rhythm power, a feature we also observed in our <italic>pdf</italic> PERKO. Knockdown experiments further suggested an importance of the clock in PDF cells. As knockdowns strongly depend on GAL4/RNAi strength, it can generate variable levels of knockdown in different cells. This can cause phase differences among different neurons, which would lead in turn to arrhythmicity. From this point of view, the guide strategy appears to be superior; it mutates DNA sequences and should be more robust to differences in expression strength. This is exemplified by successful PERKO using split-GAL4 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Even though a clock in the PDF neurons appears to be dispensable for rhythmicity, the cell bodies still appear essential. This is because ablating the PDF cells causes high levels of arrhythmicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>). The data shown here therefore suggest that the LNds can drive the rhythmic output of key sLNv genes like PDF even in the absence of a clock in these neurons. Consistent with this interpretation, recent data indicate that the LNds project dendritic as well as axonal arborizations into the accessory medulla, the location of the sLNvs, indicating extensive communication between these two important subgroups of clock neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schlichting et al., 2019b</xref>). This interpretation is further supported by examining the free-running period of the cell-specific knockouts: Ablating <italic>per</italic> in the LNds causes a long period, whereas ablating PER in most lateral clock neurons causes a short period phenotype. These data suggest that interactions between the sLNvs and other clock cells, perhaps within the accessory medulla, are essential for the close to 24 hr speed of the overall brain and behavioral clock.</p><p>While this manuscript was being written, we became aware of two other studies addressing the contribution of different circadian subgroups and neuronal interactions to <italic>Drosophila</italic> rhythms. The strategy, results and conclusions in the first study overlap extensively to what we report here (Delventhal et al., cosubmitted paper). That work exploited guides against <italic>tim</italic> as well as against <italic>per</italic> and thoroughly characterized the efficacy of the cell-specific knockout strategy, including effects on mRNA cycling.</p><p>The second study is recently published and similarly highlights the dependence of DD rhythms on network properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bulthuis et al., 2019</xref>). However, they report a decrease in rhythmicity upon knockout of the circadian clock in PDF cells, an effect that neither we nor Delventhal observed. This difference may be due to their knockout strategy, namely, overexpression of a dominant negative Cycle isoform within PDF cells. This protein may have effects on gene expression beyond knocking out the circadian clock. The distinction furthermore suggests that the conceptually simpler PERKO strategy has fewer side effects and is therefore superior.</p><p>Some of the communication properties described here resemble what has been found in mammalian systems. For example, decreasing neuronal interactions by creating sparse SCN cultures changes the free-running period and activity phase of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Welsh et al., 1995</xref>). This suggests that communication is also critical for circadian phase and period determination in mammals. Nonetheless, fly clock cells may be even less cell-autonomous and more dependent on communication than what has been described for mammals (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evans, 2016</xref>). First, the fly system may be particularly dependent on light. For example, peripheral fly clocks appear strongly light-dependent in contrast to what has been described for mammalian liver (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ito and Tomioka, 2016</xref>). Although much of the fly data could reflect cellular asynchrony in constant darkness, circadian cycling in the periphery crashes rapidly under these conditions and resembles the strong and rapid non-cycling that occurs in the sLNvs upon silencing in DD. Notably, fly cryptochrome but not mammalian cryptochrome is light-sensitive (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michael et al., 2017</xref>) and probably contributes to the light-dependence of fly peripheral clocks. This is also because light can directly penetrate the thin insect cuticle, which probably contributes to making the fly brain less dependent on ocular photoreception than the mammalian brain. However, some fly clock neurons do not express cryptochrome, suggesting that the fly clock system is dependent on network interactions even in a light-dark cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benito et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoshii et al., 2008</xref>). These considerations suggest that the fly circadian network is an attractive object of study not only because of its limited size of 75 neuron pairs but also because of its strong dependence on neuronal communication.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Neuron-specific knockouts indicate the importance of network communication to <italic>Drosophila</italic> rhythmicity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Schlichting et al. investigates the mechanisms by which clock cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain generate rhythmic behavior. Using cell-specific CRISPR, the authors show that a clock in ventral lateral neurons (LNds), generally thought of as the central clock cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, is not necessary for behavioral rhythms. Loss of rhythms only occurs when clocks are disrupted in ventral and dorsal lateral (LNd) neurons. In addition, molecular circadian cycling in LNvs appears to depend upon network connectivity as it is lost when clocks cells are silenced, even though cycling in LNds is maintained. In general, network connectivity is critical for function in the clock circuit in flies.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers found the manuscript of significant interest and noted the potential conceptual advance in our understanding of circadian mechanisms in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, the conclusions need to be substantiated by additional experiments:</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The result that molecular cycling in LNvs (PDF cells) is eliminated when all clock neurons are silenced does not preclude the possibility that silencing in PDF cells alone is sufficient for this effect. If so, the data would not support loss of communication between neuronal groups as the source of the molecular defect in PDF neurons. The authors infer, from previous studies of PDF-cell manipulations, that adult-specific silencing of these cells alone will not disrupt cycling, but a direct comparison is required.</p><p>2) The authors claim that abolishing the clock in PDF cells with targeted per CRISPR has no effect compared to controls. However, the <italic>pdf</italic>-GAL4 controls for CRISPR flies show only 40% rhythmicity. This is rather far from the other control, which shows about 95% rhythmicity, and it strongly weakens the conclusion. The results do not allow the conclusion that killing the clock in PDF cells has no discernable effect, although it probably has less effect than killing the clock in LNv + LNd (20% rhythmicity according to Figure 4K). Given that the conclusions here contradict previous findings – for instance, this lab (Stoleru et al., 2004) showed that flies are arrhythmic when PER is rescued in all except PDF cells, and Herrero et al., 2017, showed that targeted per/tim RNAi in PDF cells strongly affects DD rhythms – it is important that the authors repeat their CRISPR experiments in a background with wild type rhythms.</p><p>3) The authors state that CRISPR/Cas9 mediated period knockout was 90% efficient, but the basis for this conclusion is not clear. How was this assessed? It is important to document the efficacy of the CRISPR knockout, not only for all the positive data, but also for the negative behavioral results with PER KO in the visual system, glia and DNs.</p><p>4) The manuscript lacks information regarding experimental details and statistical analysis. Figure legends do not include relevant information such as the number of animals or brains evaluated, how many times (if any) a particular experiment was repeated, or alternatively, whether what is shown is a representative experiment. Rhythmicity of each line is represented as a percentage plotted in a bar graph, but how was rhythmicity determined and how many flies were tested in each experiment? The average activity plots are not described. Are several days for a single fly plotted or a specific day for a number of flies? Please clarify. In addition, given that control lines show differences in the M/E anticipation peaks, some quantitative measurement of this behavioral clock output is necessary/ highly recommended to compare the relevance of different neuronal clusters to the M/E peak.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48301.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The result that molecular cycling in LNvs (PDF cells) is eliminated when all clock neurons are silenced does not preclude the possibility that silencing in PDF cells alone is sufficient for this effect.

Consistent with our previous results, we found that silencing the whole clock network lead to a strong reduction of cycling amplitude in the sLNvs and DN1s, whereas the LNds were not affected. Silencing the PDF neurons caused a shift of PER staining maximum and only a slight reduction of cycling amplitude in the sLNvs. The LNds were unaffected, and the DN1 neurons changed phase like before. These data confirm the findings we referred to in our first submission and support the notion of network communication being critical for molecular rhythms even in the PDF neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors claim that abolishing the clock in PDF cells with targeted per CRISPR has no effect compared to controls.

We repeated the experiment as suggested. In both repeats the percent of rhythmic flies significantly increased and ranged between 82-90 percent suggesting that the low percentage in our previous results was indeed a genetic background problem. We also want to mention again that Delventhal et al. (this manuscript was submitted back to back with ours) found exactly the same using the guide-based strategy but independent guide sequences.</p><p>To address the results from these previous publications (we agree that discussing this is important), we modified our Discussion and included a paragraph discussing the cell-ablation, RNAi and rescue experiments. It is also worth noting that the analysis performed in this paper is based on chi<sup>2</sup> analysis of 6-7 days of behavior in DD. Many labs use shorter periods of darkness, which makes this way of analysis less powerful and can cause higher levels of arrhythmicity. In addition, we did not distinguish between strong and weakly rhythmic flies as some labs do. If we calculate the power of the rhythm, <italic>pdf</italic>-mediated PER KO has a power of 32 compared to 41 and 44 in the controls, suggesting that the flies’ rhythms are indeed weaker. Delventhal et al. sees a similar trend using a different way of analysis: even though they also see a high level of rhythmic flies, the rhythms are weaker than in controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors state that CRISPR/Cas9 mediated period knockout was 90% efficient, but the basis for this conclusion is not clear.

To obtain this value of 90%, we counted the lateral neurons of 10 brains. We neglected to state this clearly in this section but do so now.</p><p>We also included representative images of a <italic>repo</italic>-KO and a <italic>GMR-ss00681</italic> knockout, which eliminated most of the PER+ glial cells or PER in the sLNvs, respectively. Most of the dorsal neuron drivers (including the split lines) function in poorly defined subsets of DN1 neurons. As we could not label the guide/cas9 expressing neurons, this precluded us from determining efficiency. Similar efficiencies were also found in Delventhal et al. who did a more thorough job in describing the efficacy of the method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The manuscript lacks information regarding experimental details and statistical analysis.
