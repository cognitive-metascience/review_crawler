transmission into gametes, defying Mendelian inheritance. Despite the significant impact of these genomic parasites on evolution and infertility, few meiotic drive loci have been identified or mechanistically characterized. Here, we demonstrate a complex landscape of meiotic drive genes on chromosome 3 of the fission yeasts <italic>Schizosaccharomyces kambucha</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic>. We identify <italic>S. kambucha wtf4</italic> as one of these genes that acts to kill gametes (known as spores in yeast) that do not inherit the gene from heterozygotes. <italic>wtf4</italic> utilizes dual, overlapping transcripts to encode both a gamete-killing poison and an antidote to the poison. To enact drive, all gametes are poisoned, whereas only those that inherit <italic>wtf4</italic> are rescued by the antidote. Our work suggests that the <italic>wtf</italic> multigene family proliferated due to meiotic drive and highlights the power of selfish genes to shape genomes, even while imposing tremendous costs to fertility.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26033.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26033.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26033.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals, plants and fungi produce sex cells – known as gametes – when they are preparing to reproduce. These cells are made when cells containing two copies of every gene in the organism divide to produce new cells that each only have one copy of each gene. Therefore, a particular gene copy usually has a 50% chance of being carried by each gamete. There is a group of genes that selfishly increase their chances of being transmitted to the next generation by destroying the gametes that do not carry them. These “gamete killer” genes can lead to infertility and other health problems.</p><p>Fission yeast is a fungus that is widely used in research. Previous studies revealed that the yeast are likely to have several gamete killers, but the identities of these genes or how they work were not clear. Nuckolls, Bravo Núñez et al. sought to identify at least one gamete killer gene and understand how it works.</p><p>The experiments found that a gene called <italic>wtf4</italic> acts as a gamete killer in fission yeast. This gene encodes two different proteins, one that acts as a poison and one that acts as an antidote. The antidote remains inside the gametes that contain the <italic>wtf4</italic> gene, while the poison is released in the surrounding environment. The poison is capable of killing all of the gametes, but the antidote protects the gametes that contain the <italic>wtf4</italic> gene. Further experiments show that <italic>wtf4</italic> is just one member of a large family of genes that are also likely to play roles in selectively killing gametes.</p><p>A separate study by Hu et al. found that two other members of the <italic>wtf</italic> family also act as gamete killers in fission yeast. Together, these findings expand our understanding of the nature of gamete killers and how they can contribute to infertility. This may guide the search for gamete killers in humans and other organisms. In the future, gamete killers could potentially be used to eradicate populations of pests that damage crops or spread diseases in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26033.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26033.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Meiotic drive</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>infertility</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>selfish genes</kwd><kwd>genetic conflict</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM118120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Gerald R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM031693</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Gerald R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007795</institution-id><institution>Stowers Institute for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaspersen</surname><given-names>Sue L</given-names></name><name><surname>Zanders</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001229</institution-id><institution>G Harold and Leila Y.

For example, more than one out of every seven human couples are infertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Thoma et al., 2013</xref>). This high infertility is at odds with the fundamental requirement of reproductive success for Darwinian fitness. A potential solution to this infertility paradox is the presence of selfish genes that subvert meiosis to increase their transmission into gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ségurel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Presgraves, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnson, 2010</xref>); such selfish genes might explain a subset of cases of human infertility. Gamete-killing meiotic drive alleles are one such class of selfish genes that can directly cause infertility. These genes act by killing the gametes that do not inherit them, increasing their transmission into up to 100% of the progeny of a heterozygote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lindholm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sandler and Novitski, 1957</xref>). Meiotic drivers can also indirectly result in infertility or other disease states by interfering with natural selection’s ability to choose the most well-adapted alleles. Natural selection cannot harness the fitness benefits of alleles carried in gametes destroyed by drive. Furthermore, meiotic drivers can promote the spread of maladapted alleles that are genetically linked to the drive locus within a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sandler and Novitski, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crow, 1991</xref>). Because drive can be harmful to the overall fitness of a species, suppressors of drive often evolve in response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crow, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Gamete-killing meiotic drive has been observed in eukaryotes ranging from plants to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lindholm et al., 2016</xref>). With the broadening implementation of high-throughput sequencing of both meiotic products and cross progeny to measure allele transmission, the presence of meiotic drive is being observed at an accelerated rate, and it is hypothesized that these selfish genes are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lindholm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Didion et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ottolini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burt and Trivers, 2006</xref>). However, only a handful of genes involved in meiotic drive have been identified. Lack of homology among these genes makes it nearly impossible to identify novel drive loci from genome sequences alone. Instead, rigorous genetic analyses are required to detect and map meiotic drive loci. These efforts are frequently impeded by the complexity of many drive systems; they often have multiple components and are found within chromosome rearrangements that are recalcitrant to genetic mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Larracuente and Presgraves, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2012</xref>). Even in the case of well-studied meiotic drive systems where one or more components have been identified, a complete understanding of the mechanistic basis of drive and its suppression has been elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Larracuente and Presgraves, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauer et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hammond et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The prospect of characterizing meiotic drivers in a genetically tractable system spurred our study of a pair of fission yeasts, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> strain 972 (<italic>Sp</italic>) and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces kambucha</italic> (<italic>Sk</italic>). Despite being 99.5% identical at the nucleotide level, <italic>Sp/Sk</italic> hybrids are nearly sterile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rhind et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>); a reproductive barrier between these yeasts must have arisen very recently. This rapid evolution of infertility is common amongst fission yeasts that are generally categorized as isolates of the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avelar et al., 2013</xref>). In the case of <italic>Sp/Sk</italic> hybrids (and likely other pairings), the infertility is caused by both chromosomal rearrangements and multiple meiotic drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avelar et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, we previously found that genes on each of the three <italic>Sk</italic> chromosomes are capable of enacting gamete (spore)-killing meiotic drive against their <italic>Sp</italic> homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>).

For the statistical analyses (G-tests), we compared the observed heterozygous disomy and allele 2 transmission to the values observed in diploid 10, which is a pure <italic>Sk rec12∆</italic> control (columns 11 and 13).

Because <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic> have different karyotypes on chromosomes 2 and 3 due to a translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>), we could not generate such a strain as it would lack essential genes.

We then backcrossed this haploid strain to <italic>Sk</italic> to generate a series of haploid strains that have mosaic (<italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic>-derived DNA sequences) versions of chromosome 3 generated by recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We then crossed the recombinant haploids to <italic>Sk</italic> to generate a series of ‘introgression diploids’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, diploids 1–8). The introgression diploids were all homozygous null mutants for <italic>rec12,</italic> the fission yeast ortholog of <italic>Sachharomyces cerevisiae SPO11</italic>, which is required for inducing DNA breaks to initiate meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Phadnis et al., 2011</xref>). As meiotic recombination is not induced in the introgression diploids, we could use any genetic marker on chromosome 3 to assay this chromosome for the presence of drive loci. We used the codominant markers <italic>ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>ade6∆::hphMX4</italic> to follow transmission of each chromosome into viable gametes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>We observed three phenotypic classes amongst our introgression diploids (diploids 1–8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In the first class (diploids 1–3), the allele from the pure <italic>Sk</italic> chromosome exhibited drive over the allele from the <italic>Sp/Sk</italic> mosaic chromosome. In the second class (diploids 4–7), we were surprised to observe the opposite phenotype: the allele from the <italic>Sp/Sk</italic> mosaic chromosome exhibited drive over that from the pure <italic>Sk</italic> chromosome. In the third class (diploid 8), we observed unbiased allele transmission.</p><p>Our finding of three distinct phenotypic classes amongst our introgression diploids (diploids 1–8) is inconsistent with the simple model of a single drive locus on <italic>Sk</italic> chromosome 3. A single gene model predicts two phenotypic classes: (1) introgression diploids in which the pure <italic>Sk</italic> chromosome exhibits drive because the <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> mosaic chromosome lacks the <italic>Sk</italic> drive allele and (2) introgression diploids in which the chromosomes show Mendelian transmission because the <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> mosaic contains the <italic>Sk</italic> drive allele.</p><p>Instead, our data are more consistent with the presence of a meiotic drive allele (or alleles) found on both <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Sp</italic> chromosome haplotypes and the existence of at least one genetically separable drive suppressor. The drive of the <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> mosaic chromosome over the pure <italic>Sk</italic> chromosome in class 2 (diploids 4–7) is consistent with the presence of an <italic>Sp</italic> drive allele in these strains. The full effects of this <italic>Sp</italic> drive locus could have been missed previously in <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrid crosses due to the actions of an <italic>Sp</italic> drive suppressor not found in the class 2 introgressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Similar to what we previously observed in crosses between pure <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids (both <italic>rec12<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>rec12∆</italic>), we found that viable gametes produced by diploids of all three classes frequently inherited both alleles at the <italic>ade6</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>). This indicates that they are not haploid at this locus, as is expected for gametes. These gametes likely represent a mix of heterozygous diploids and heterozygous chromosome 3 aneuploids. In diploid 8, the phenotype was extreme, with almost all the viable gametes inheriting both <italic>ade6</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Although the frequency of meiotic chromosome missegregation is elevated in <italic>rec12∆</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Phadnis et al., 2011</xref>), we see significantly higher levels of viable gametes that inherit both alleles in diploids 1–8 than we did in a homozygous <italic>Sk rec12∆</italic> control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, diploid 10).</p><p>The high level of chromosome 3 aneuploidy and/or diploidy we observe in the viable progeny of <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrid crosses and our introgression diploids (1-8) is also consistent with the existence of both <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Sp</italic> active meiotic drive loci. We previously showed in <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids that this phenotype was not due to elevated chromosome missegregation in meiosis, but rather preferential death of haploid gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>). As we proposed previously, this phenotype could result from distinct competing <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Sp</italic> driver loci on chromosome 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bomblies, 2014</xref>). In the absence of recombination, a given haploid gamete can inherit only the <italic>Sk</italic> or <italic>Sp</italic> drive locus and is thus sensitive to being killed by the one it does not inherit. Heterozygous diploids and heterozygous aneuploids, however, would inherit both loci and be resistant to both killers.</p><p>To map driver location(s) from the phenotypic data described above, we sequenced the haploid strains that contributed the <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> mosaic chromosomes to the introgression diploids (diploids 1–8) and combined genotype information with the phenotypic data described above. We determined which regions of chromosome 3 were derived from <italic>Sk</italic> and which were from <italic>Sp</italic> in each strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). It was clear from our data that one or two loci are not sufficient to explain the phenotypes of all these strains.</p><p>We chose to focus on the <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> mosaic chromosome found in diploid 1. This strain has the smallest amount of <italic>Sp</italic> DNA (~180 kb), and drive of <italic>Sk</italic> in the introgression/<italic>Sk</italic> diploid suggested the strain lacks a drive allele found in <italic>Sk</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We crossed a haploid isolate containing this chromosome to a <italic>rec12<sup>+</sup> Sk</italic> strain to generate recombinant progeny containing smaller segments of <italic>Sp</italic>-derived DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and Materials and methods). We SNP-genotyped those recombinants and tested their phenotypes by mating them to <italic>Sk</italic> to generate additional introgression diploids (see Materials and methods). We selected diploid 9 for further analysis, as it contains the <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> mosaic chromosome with the smallest region of <italic>Sp</italic>-derived DNA (~30 kb) that a pure <italic>Sk</italic> chromosome can drive against (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). After excluding aneuploid/diploid progeny (those that inherit both <italic>ade6</italic> markers), the allele from the pure <italic>Sk</italic> chromosome shows essentially the same transmission bias in diploids 1 and 9. These results suggest the <italic>Sk</italic> drive allele active in diploid 1 is found in this ~30 kb region. Curiously, this locus is in a region that is transmitted in a Mendelian manner (to ~50% of progeny) in pure <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that other loci can mask the effects of the driver within this ~30 kb region. In addition, it is unclear why the fraction of viable progeny that inherit both <italic>ade6</italic> alleles drops between diploids 1 and 9. These puzzles likely reflect the complexity of the multiple drivers and suppressor loci acting in these yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We next wanted to verify the candidate drive locus using a recombination-competent (<italic>rec12<sup>+</sup></italic>) diploid. We generated introgression diploid 11 which contains the same <italic>Sk/Sp</italic> mosaic chromosome as diploid 1, but is <italic>rec12<sup>+</sup></italic>. To follow the transmission of the candidate locus, we needed a closely linked marker gene, so we engineered heterozygous markers at the linked <italic>ura4</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We found that the <italic>ura4</italic> allele from the pure <italic>Sk</italic> chromosome is transmitted to 87% of the viable gametes produced by diploid 11, which is not significantly different from the 88% transmission of the <italic>Sk</italic> allele in diploid 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Under one model, meiotic drivers kill gametes containing a particular target locus.

An <italic>Sp</italic> diploid that is hemizygous for <italic>Sk wtf4</italic> (<italic>Sk wtf4<sup>+</sup></italic>/<italic>ade6<sup>+</sup></italic>) produced fewer viable spores (54% PI-excluding spores, versus 96% in the vector-only control) and showed a marked transmission bias (96%) favoring <italic>Sk wtf4<sup>+</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, diploids 16 and 17).

Like the <italic>Spok</italic> family of drivers found in <italic>Podospora</italic>, <italic>wtf4</italic> is an autonomous drive system that confers both the ability to kill gametes that do not inherit the gene and the ability to protect the gametes that do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>). We show that <italic>wtf4</italic> achieves these disparate functions by a previously undescribed mechanism in which the gene encodes a poison protein from one transcriptional start site and an antidote protein from an alternative transcriptional start site. We show that the poison protein is trans-acting and has the capacity to destroy all gametes, but that the antidote remains in the gametes that inherit the <italic>wtf4</italic> locus and specifically rescues them from destruction.</p><p>The poison-antidote mechanism of <italic>Sk wtf4</italic> is comparable to the bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. These systems are found in most prokaryotes and have been extensively studied. TA systems consist of a toxin that will prevent cell growth or viability and an antitoxin that neutralizes the toxin using a wide variety of mechanisms, typically being classified into six different types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee and Lee, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, some toxins are stable, transmembrane proteins that act by disrupting membrane integrity and are counteracted by either an unstable small RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee and Lee, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Unterholzner et al., 2013</xref>) or a protein that degrades the toxin mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). In our poison-antidote meiotic drive system, <italic>Sk wtf4</italic> creates two putative trans-membrane proteins: a trans-acting poison and spore-specific antidote. While the exact mechanism of toxicity of Wtf4<sup>poison</sup> is unknown, we hypothesize that it could be disrupting membrane integrity in a similar manner to the membrane-lytic toxins of some TA systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee and Lee, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Unterholzner et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, we speculate that Wtf4<sup>antidote</sup> protects the spores that inherited <italic>Sk wtf4</italic> by sequestering the poison for degradation. The spore specificity of Wtf4<sup>antidote</sup> could be due to late translation or a spore retention signal within exon 1, because that is the only region that Wtf4<sup>poison</sup> is lacking. In addition, work by Hu <italic>et al.</italic> suggests that the C-termini of Wtf proteins may be more important for the poison than for the antidote functions, despite both proteins being generated by a single given <italic>wtf</italic> gene sharing a common C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Outside of its role in meiotic drive, <italic>wtf4</italic> has no apparent role in promoting fertility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, diploid 15). Instead, the gene causes about half of all gametes to be destroyed in heterozygotes. In other words, the wild-type allele of <italic>wtf4 causes</italic> infertility to promote its own fitness. This puts <italic>wtf4</italic> into a state of genetic conflict with the rest of the genome because infertility is clearly bad for fitness of loci unlinked to <italic>wtf4</italic>. Unlinked variants that can suppress drive would be favored by natural selection because they increase fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crow, 1991</xref>). Novel <italic>wtf4</italic> variants that can evade this suppression to reestablish drive would then be favored. This evolutionary dynamic is analogous to that observed between viruses and host immune systems and is well known to foster a ‘molecular arms race’ in which both sides must continually innovate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daugherty and Malik, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McLaughlin and Malik, 2017</xref>). Consistent with the idea that the gene is locked in such an arms race, the DNA sequence divergence between <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Sp</italic> at the <italic>wtf4</italic> locus is more than 20-fold higher than the genome-wide average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rhind et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The evolution of <italic>wtf4</italic> elicits the question of how the gene can rapidly evolve while maintaining specificity between the poison and antidote it encodes. Uncoupling these components leads to sterility, an evolutionary dead end. It is possible that such variants do arise and are quickly purged from populations. We propose, however, that the coding sequence overlap between the poison and antidote could promote specificity between the two components, for example, by the antidote acting as a dominant suppressor of the poison. In this manner, the poison could diverge without losing the self-protection conferred by the antidote. Using a shared sequence to confer specificity between drive components may be a recurring theme amongst gamete-killers. In their analyses of <italic>Podospora Spok</italic> genes, Grognet and colleagues found that they could generate antidote-only alleles and a partial poison-only allele via C- and N-terminal tagging of the proteins, respectively. They were not, however, able to generate separation of function alleles of <italic>Spok1</italic> by making N- or C- terminal deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>). Future work identifying the molecular mechanisms of both families of drivers will be required to test the idea that the fact that the poison and antidote are encoded by overlapping sequences minimizes the probability of disrupting their specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Could the expansion and rapid evolution of the <italic>wtf</italic> gene family be a result of meiotic drive?</title><p>Combined with our previous work, the varied phenotypes of our <italic>Sp</italic> chromosome 3 introgressions reveal a complex landscape of meiotic drive loci in the <italic>Sk</italic> and <italic>Sp</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>). As <italic>Sk wtf4</italic> is a member of the large <italic>wtf</italic> gene family, the most likely candidates underlying these other drive loci are <italic>wtf</italic> genes. For example, there are &gt;20 <italic>wtf</italic> loci on <italic>Sp</italic> (and likely <italic>Sk</italic>) chromosome 3 that could contribute to the complex drive phenotypes we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowen et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with the idea that the <italic>Sk wtf4</italic> is not unique in its ability to drive, we showed that <italic>Sk wtf28</italic> can also cause drive and Hu and colleagues demonstrate that two additional <italic>wtf</italic> genes from another isolate of the <italic>Sp</italic> family also cause meiotic drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although not all <italic>wtfs</italic> are capable of autonomously causing meiotic drive, their rapid evolution is still consistent with their involvement in meiotic drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McLaughlin and Malik, 2017</xref>). We propose that different <italic>wtf</italic> genes represent distinct evolutionary stages. The putative ancestral type (<italic>Sk wtf4</italic> and <italic>wtf28</italic>) are still active as meiotic drivers and encode both poison and antidote proteins. The next stratum represents genes (<italic>Sk wtf2</italic>, <italic>wtf5</italic>, <italic>wtf6</italic> and <italic>wtf26</italic>) that have lost poison, but not antidote function. As we have shown for the <italic>Sk wtf4<sup>antidote</sup></italic> allele, such alleles are unlikely to cause meiotic drive as they have lost their poison-coding capacity, but they still have protective function against the ancestral drive allele and thus may have been selectively retained as ‘domesticated parasites.’ Over time, when the protective function is no longer beneficial and selected for (e.g. if the ancestral drive allele is lost from the population), such antidote genes may also eventually degenerate. Therefore, the final stratum represents putative <italic>wtf</italic> pseudogenes such as <italic>Sk wtf21</italic>, in which both the poison and antidote function have decayed.</p><p>There are 25 <italic>wtf</italic> loci in the <italic>Sp</italic> genome and this work combined with that of Hu and colleagues implicates these genes in causing and/or modifying meiotic drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2017</xref> ). Meiotic drive has therefore played a significant role in the evolution of the <italic>Sp</italic> group of fission yeasts, despite the heavy fitness costs these selfish loci can levy. It is striking to consider how long these selfish genes went undetected in such a simple and intensely studied organism. How many more such parasites are lurking undetected in eukaryotic genomes?</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Crosses</title><p>For the mapping crosses, fertility and meiotic drive assay, the crosses were carried out similar to the description in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al. (2014</xref>). This required making stable diploids, because many of the strains used are homothallic (h<sup>90</sup>) and their self-mating would generate many non-informative spores. Briefly, we mixed ~200 µL of overnight culture from each haploid parent in a microcentrifuge tube, spun down the cells and plated them on either SPA (1% glucose, 7.3 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, vitamins, agar) or MEA (3% malt extract, agar) for 12–15 hr at room temperature to allow the cells to mate. We observed no differences in meiotic drive phenotypes for diploids generated on SPA vs. MEA. We generally use SPA, but for some matings have more success isolating stable diploids from MEA. We scraped off the mated cells and spread them on a medium to select heterozygous diploids (generally minimal yeast nitrogen base plates). We grew diploid colonies overnight in 5 mL of rich YEL broth (0.5% yeast extract, 3% glucose, 250 mg/L of adenine, lysine, histidine, leucine, and uracil). We then plated a small amount of the cultures ≤100 µL onto SPA to induce sporulation, and plated a diluted sample onto YEA (same as YEL, but with agar). We screened the colonies that grew on the YEA plate via replica plating to diagnostic media to verify that the culture was comprised of heterozygous diploid cells. If not, the culture was not assayed further. After 3–7 days, we scooped up the mixture of cells, asci, and spores from the SPA plates, treated it with glusulase and ethanol to kill vegetative cells and to release spores from asci, and plated the spores on YEA. We then phenotyped the spore colonies using standard approaches. For some control loci, we could not easily verify heterozygosity in the diploid test described above. For these loci, we verified heterozygosity of the parent diploid in the progeny. If the parent diploid proved not to be heterozygous, the diploid was eliminated. For each cross, we assayed at least two independently created diploids. The number of progeny we scored varied between experiments. To map <italic>Sk wtf4</italic>, we assayed at least 100 viable progeny per cross. To characterize <italic>Sk wtf4</italic>, we assayed at least viable 200 gametes per cross. The one exception was the <italic>Sk wtf4<sup>poison</sup></italic>/ <italic>Sk wtf4<sup>antidote</sup></italic> cross in which we had to assay allele transmission by PCR and sequencing (described below). For that cross, we assayed 50 viable progeny.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mapping <italic>Sk wtf4</italic> region</title><p>All strains used and their genotypes can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>. We deposited sequencing data from all high-throughput sequencing to GenBank accession number PRJNA376152. We chose to map first a drive allele present on <italic>Sk</italic> chromosome 3 via recombination mapping. To eliminate the effects of drivers and gross chromosomal rearrangements from chromosomes 1 and 2, we began the mapping effort using a strain (SZY558) that contains chromosomes 1 and 2 from <italic>Sk</italic>, but in which most of chromosome 3 was derived from <italic>Sp</italic> (the mosaic chromosome illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> is from SZY558). We could not use a complete <italic>Sp</italic> chromosome 3 because such a strain lacks essential genes due to a translocation between chromosomes 2 and 3 that occurred in the <italic>Sk</italic> lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>). Sequencing revealed that chromosome 3 in SZY558 was generated by a crossover event between <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic> chromosomes somewhere between positions 1,804,477 and 1,810,659 on the <italic>Sp</italic> chromosome. The region to the right of this point contains <italic>Sk</italic> alleles and the strain has the <italic>Sk</italic> karyotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The generation of SZY558 is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. We first crossed SZY201 (<italic>Sp</italic>) to SZY208 (<italic>Sk</italic>) to generate SZY239 and SZY247. Although no recombination was expected in this cross because the two parental strains are <italic>rec12∆</italic>, both SZY239 and SZY247 must contain a recombinant chromosome 2 and/or a recombinant 3 because they inherited non-parental combinations of markers on chromosomes 2 and 3, and the two species karyotypes are incompatible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Veaux et al., 1992</xref>). Such recombinant spores are quite rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>) but were obtained via selection for a nonparental combination of markers on chromosomes 2 and 3 (e.g. His<sup>+</sup> hygromycin resistant). Most such selected progeny are chromosome 3 aneuploids, so we then streaked the strains to single colonies to allow them to lose the additional copy of chromosome 3. We crossed SZY239 to SZY247 to generate a strain (SZY382) that contained the recombinant chromosome 3, but also had the <italic>lys1-37</italic> and <italic>his5<sup>+</sup></italic> markers on chromosomes 1 and 2, respectively. The <italic>lys1-37</italic> and <italic>his5<sup>+</sup></italic> markers in this strain were useful for following chromosomes 1 and 2 in a subsequent cross. We transformed SZY382 with a PCR fragment generated with oligos 255 and 256 using plasmid pAG32 as a template to generate a strain (SZY547) with <italic>arg12∆::hphMX4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldstein and McCusker, 1999</xref>). The <italic>arg12</italic> locus is on chromosome 3 in <italic>Sk</italic> and in strain SZY547, which has the <italic>Sk</italic> karyotype. We then crossed SZY547 to SZY192 (<italic>Sk</italic>) to generate strain SZY558. The purpose of this cross was to move the recombinant chromosome 3 into a strain background with pure <italic>Sk</italic> chromosomes 1 and 2 (marked with <italic>lys1<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>his5∆::natMX4</italic>).</p><p>For mapping <italic>Sk wtf4</italic>, we crossed SZY558 to a differentially marked <italic>Sk</italic> strain (SZY210) to generate recombinant haploid progeny (introgression strains) that contained a smaller fraction of chromosome 3 from <italic>Sp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We used genetic markers (<italic>ura4</italic>, <italic>ade6</italic> and <italic>arg12</italic>) to select only true haploid recombinants for our introgression strains. We mated the introgression strains and <italic>Sk</italic> (SZY196) to generate diploids 1–8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The mapping scheme was designed such that diploids generated by these matings were homozygous <italic>rec12∆</italic>, so recombination would infrequently separate the drive allele from the genetic markers used to distinguish the introgression and <italic>Sk</italic> chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Veaux et al., 1992</xref>). We sequenced at least one introgression representing each phenotype we observed amongst these strains and distinguished <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic> SNPs as in (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>SZY565 (the haploid parent that contributed the mosaic chromosome 3 to diploid 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) is the introgression strain that contains the smallest region of <italic>Sp</italic>-derived DNA, from position 55,555 to 237,572 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The <italic>Sk</italic> chromosome drove against this introgression in test crosses. We assumed that whatever feature of the <italic>Sp</italic> genome (either the presence of a target of killing or the absence of an antidote to killing) that conferred the sensitive phenotype (i.e susceptibility to being destroyed by the <italic>Sk</italic> driver) must be within that region and, correspondingly, that the <italic>Sk</italic> drive allele must also be within or very near that region. This is because a drive allele that acts to kill gametes that do not inherit it should target the homologous locus or a closely linked site to prevent self-killing. A drive allele that killed gametes that inherit a locus not linked to the drive allele would be an evolutionary dead end because it would kill gametes bearing the drive allele as often as it would kill gametes bearing the competing allele.</p><p>To narrow in on the key drive locus, we crossed SZY565 to SZY196 (<italic>Sk</italic>) to get a strain (SZY649) with the same chromosome 3 as SZY565, but with <italic>his5<sup>+</sup></italic> rather than <italic>his5∆::natMX4</italic> on chromosome 2. The <italic>ura4</italic> locus, at position 116,726–115,589 on chromosome 3, is within the <italic>Sp</italic>-derived region. We added an additional marker (<italic>kanMX4</italic>) within the <italic>Sp</italic>-derived region at position 214,491 to generate strain SZY659. To do this, we first generated plasmid pSZB134 which contains ~1 kb of DNA (amplified from <italic>Sp</italic> genomic DNA with oligos 380 and 381) upstream of the target site (214,491) cloned into the BamHI and BglII sites of pFA6a, and ~1 kb of DNA (amplified with oligos 382 and 383) downstream of the target site cloned into the SacI and SpeI sites of the pFA6a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wach et al., 1994</xref>).

We tested nine such haploids by test crossing them to <italic>Sk</italic> (SZY196). Two haploids had an <italic>Sk</italic>-like phenotype in that they showed Mendelian transmission of the <italic>ura4</italic> locus; the other six showed the sensitive phenotype. We genotyped SNPs of the haploids at a few sites within the region to roughly estimate where the recombination event(s) occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>).

The <italic>Sp</italic> DNA begins between positions 210,312 and 214,500 and ends before 215,926. Comparing these two classes suggested that the key drive locus is located between positions ~ 210,000 and 237,572 (but not within the small region surrounding ~214,000).

We cut each cassette with SacI and cloned them into the SacI site of pSZB188 to generate: pSZB209 (<italic>wtf21+wtf26</italic>), pSZB212 (<italic>wtf2</italic>), pSZB217 (<italic>wtf5</italic>), and pSZB215 (<italic>wtf6+wtf28</italic>). We subcloned <italic>Sk wtf6</italic> and <italic>Sk wtf28</italic> from pSZB215 by first amplifying the individual genes using oligo pairs 732 and 652, and 651 and 733, respectively. We then cloned the genes into the SacI site of pSZB188 to generate pSZB252 (<italic>wtf6</italic>) and pSZB254 (<italic>wtf28</italic>). All sequences of these genes have been deposited in GenBank, accession numbers KY652739-KY652742.

We generated diploids and spores as described above. We then plated the spores on YEA, picked the colonies to a YEA master plate and replicated to score control markers. We also prepared lysates for PCR from the master plate by scraping cells off the master plate into 20 µl of 20 mM NaOH. We boiled the cells for 5 min, froze them in liquid nitrogen, boiled again for 10 min, and spun the debris down. Using the supernatant lysate, we amplified the <italic>wtf4</italic> region using oligos A01112 and 678. We then sequenced the exon 1 region using oligo 861. We analyzed the exon 1 region for the start codon mutations mentioned above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). If the exon 1 mutations were present, we quantified this as a poison allele; if not present, as an antidote.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Introducing <italic>ade6</italic><sup>+</sup> at <italic>his5</italic></title><p>To avoid <italic>ade6<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant auto-fluorescence in cytology, we introduced <italic>ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> at the <italic>his5</italic> locus.

We then incubated the yeast plus PI mixture at room temperature for 20 min. We took the images on a Zeiss (Germany) Observer.Z1 wide-field microscope with a 40x (1.2 NA) water-immersion objective and collected the emission onto a Hamamatsu ORCA Flash 4.0 using µManager software. We acquired the PI images with BP 530–585 nm excitation and LP 615 emission, using an FT 600 dichroic filter.</p><p>For all other fluorescence microscopy, we imaged on a LSM-700 AxioObserver microscope (Zeiss), with a 40x C-Apochromat water-immersion objective (NA 1.2), with 488 and 555 nm excitation. We collected GFP fluorescence through a 490–55 nm bandpass filter and mCherry fluorescence through a 615-nm longpass filter. The continuously variable secondary dichroic filter was positioned at 578 nm. We also imaged using a LSM-780 (Zeiss) microscope, with a 40x C-Apochromat water-immersion objective and 100x alpha Plan-Apochromat oil-immersion objective (NA 1.2 and 1.46, respectively), in photon-counting channel mode with 488 and 561 nm excitation. We collected GFP fluorescence through a 481–552 bandpass filter and mCherry through a 572 longpass filter. For all images acquired on the LSM-780 (Zeiss) microscope, using the same objectives as described above, we also imaged in photon-counting lambda mode, with 488 and 561 nm excitation. We collected fluorescence emission over the entire visible range. After acquisition, we linear unmixed the images using an in-house custom written plugin for ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). Unmixing was achieved using spectra obtained from control cells. We did unmixing to verify that there was no auto-fluorescence in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) we scored. We did not score auto-fluorescent cells. Brightness and contrast is not the same for all images. We assayed at least 35 asci (but usually &gt;100) for each genotype represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to T Levin and J Zeitlinger for comments on the manuscript, M Miller for assistance with the figures, Li-Lin Du for sharing results prior to publication, and three thoughtful reviewers (including Nick Rhind and Michael Lichten) for guiding improved data presentation.

The first column represents the diploid number, which matches the numbers shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>. In columns 2–5, the two haploid parent strains (SZY#s) are indicated as are the alleles contributed by those parent strains at the experimental locus monitored for drive. Alleles derived from <italic>Sp</italic> are green whereas those from <italic>Sk</italic> are purple. For diploids 11–15, transmission of the <italic>wtf4</italic> locus was followed using alleles of <italic>ura4</italic>, which is fortuitously closely linked to <italic>wtf4</italic>. Columns 9 and 10 indicate which phenotypes were followed at the drive loci and the number of progeny that displayed each phenotype. Some progeny inherited both alleles at a given drive locus and when the markers were codominant we could detect those disomes. The number of those disomes, which are likely heterozygous diploids or aneuploids, are shown in column 11 and their overall frequency is shown in column 12. If we did not have codominant markers, columns 11 and 12 are filled with ---. Column 13 is a measure of meiotic drive. It shows the fraction of the non-disomic progeny that inherited allele 1 (column 3). Column 14 shows the total number of progeny assayed for each diploid and column 15 is the p value calculated from a G-test comparing the allele transmission of allele 1 to a control. Diploid 13 served as the control for diploids 11, 12, 14 and 15. Diploid 16 served as the control for the rest of the diploids. Columns 6–8 are internal controls for each diploid. These controls represent an additional heterozygous locus unlinked to the meiotic drive locus that should undergo Mendelian allele transmission. The <italic>lys</italic> locus is <italic>lys4</italic>, the <italic>ade</italic> locus is <italic>ade6</italic>, and the <italic>ura</italic> locus is <italic>ura4</italic>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Nick Rhind (Reviewer #2) and Michael Lichten (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This article reports analysis of a gene family that shows meiotic drive behavior. It's an extension of a previous paper by the senior author, who demonstrated the existence of meiotic drive elements in <italic>S. pombe/S. kambucha</italic> hybrids, but did not characterize these elements in detail. The current paper (and an accompanying paper from Hu et al.) identifies at least a subset of these drive elements as belonging to the <italic>wtf</italic> gene family, a group of repeated genes that tend to be found near transposable elements or their LTR remnants. This paper focuses on one of these genes, <italic>wtf4</italic>, and shows that the <italic>S. kambucha</italic> allele encodes a protein with two isoforms, a short form that encodes a spore-killing toxin that is expressed in meiotic cells before spore formation, and a long form that encodes an antidote that is expressed in a spore-specific manner. Further analysis identifies a second <italic>wtf</italic> locus in <italic>S. kambucha, wtf28</italic>, with similar gene structure and meiotic drive behavior. This, in combination with an accompanying paper (Hu et al.), provide a convincing case for the existence of multiple single-locus, toxin/antidote-type meiotic drive elements in the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces</italic> clade. Because of the novelty of this system, and because this work provides the first mechanistic insight into how a single-locus drive element can work, the paper is of considerable interest.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the science in this paper is really exciting, the writing and presentation are sloppy and obtuse-it often feels as if the authors are having a conversation with themselves, and are focused on presentation rather than communication (these are <italic>not</italic> the same thing). This makes it a frustrating paper to read at more when one has an in-depth interest. More seriously, underlying experimental data are often needlessly absent or obscured.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. One really has to hunt to figure out what the introgression diploids really are or how they were made. Since this is an online journal, why not illustrate their construction, and the chr 3 configuration within each diploid? This figure, like many others, uses terminology that is distant from the actual data. For example, &quot;% aneuploid or diploid&quot; &quot;gametes&quot; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) is not what was assayed – which was the fraction of viable spores that contain both parental chr 3 markers (but what were those markers?) and is thus a subset of possible disomic/diploid progeny (think uniparental disomy)?</p><p>In addition, part of the reason for the high level of chr 3 &quot;disomy&quot; among viable spores is because these are <italic>rec12-/rec12</italic>- diploids, which normally have a high degree of chr3 &quot;disomy&quot;. This should be clearly communicated, and an Sk/Sk control (with suitably marked chrs 3) included to show the base level of chr 3 &quot;disomy/diploidy&quot; in <italic>rec12</italic>- mutants in the absence of any drive.</p><p>Another example – &quot;% transmission Sk&quot; – actually the fraction viable spores that only display one parental set of chr 3 markers, that display the &quot;Sk&quot; markers – but what were those markers? It's almost impossible to figure this out. Finally, data underlying <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> are not presented at all, and need to be included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> (that is, once <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> is modified to make it clear and accessible, see below).</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>. The term &quot;% fertility&quot; is a misnomer. What is assayed is spores that fail to exclude PI; it's not even spore viability, since there are many ways a spore could not give rise to viable progeny yet still exclude PI. If authors can show that the vast majority of spores that exclude π give rise to colonies, then &quot;fertility&quot; is OK, but otherwise an operative term (i.e. &quot;PI excluding&quot;) should be used.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>. This table should include data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (see above). It absolutely requires a legend that explains what each column means (for example, N means 2 different things) and how the numbers were determined.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. RNAseq data underlying the identification of two <italic>wtf4</italic> transcripts should be presented.</p><p>5) Subsection “Expansion and rapid evolution of the <italic>wtf</italic> family is consistent with a role in meiotic drive”. Data and methods underlying the conclusions about the other <italic>wtfs</italic> that were tested should be presented, as these are important in vivo tests of the hypothesis. If diploids similar to diploid 9 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were made for the other <italic>wtfs</italic>, that data would be sufficient. It would also be nice (although not essential) if the authors could make a supplementary file that aligns all of the <italic>wtfs</italic> examined, to show where the two start sites are or are not. Since the RNAseq data for all the Sp <italic>wtfs</italic> are available, it would be interesting to know if the &quot;tamed&quot; <italic>wtfs</italic> only make the longer antidote mRNA, or if they still express both mRNAs. It would also be useful to ask which of the <italic>wtfs</italic> identified by Hu et al. (i.e. <italic>cws</italic> in CBS5557) are extant toxin-antidote systems using the dual start-site criterion, and which, if any, have degenerated to antidote-only; the same request will be made of Hu et al., so perhaps the two sets of authors could coordinate on this. It would also be useful to mention that Hu et al. have identified the C-termini of two <italic>wtf/cws</italic> loci in CBS5557as being important for toxin but not for antidote function.</p><p>6) There is a long history of toxin/antidote system in bacteria, which has been extensively reviewed. Adding a brief discussion of this to the Introduction or Discussion would add perspective to the article, and might offer some insight into possible <italic>wtf</italic> mechanisms.</p><p>7) Given that what the authors describe are gamete / spore killers, wouldn't it be more accurate to refer to the process as &quot;drive&quot; instead of as &quot;meiotic drive&quot; (following the recommendation of Burt &amp; Trivers from their Genes in Conflict book – see page 16)? The phenomenon described has nothing to do with meiosis.</p><p>8) The authors need to be more sophisticated in their use of the concept of species. <italic>S. kambucha</italic> was so named on the basis of hybrid sterility &lt;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12399374">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12399374</ext-link>&gt; but is actually itself a mosaic of two strains of <italic>S. pombe</italic> (represented by 972 and NCYC132) which show greater sequence divergence from each other than either do from <italic>S. kambucha</italic> &lt;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21511999">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21511999</ext-link>&gt;. Thus, none of the three populations are genetically isolated on an evolutionary timescale. Therefore, be any modern definition of the term, <italic>S. pombe</italic> 972, <italic>S. pombe</italic> NCYC132 and <italic>S. kambucha</italic> are not separate species.</p><p>9) It would be of great interest to readers to have some speculation of how a putative trans-membrane protein could function in a toxin-antidote system and how the toxin comes to be distributed differently than the antidote.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26033.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>While the science in this paper is really exciting, the writing and presentation are sloppy and obtuse-it often feels as if the authors are having a conversation with themselves, and are focused on presentation rather than communication (these are not the same thing).

We also added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> to describe the generation of the strain we used to generate the introgressions. We also expanded <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to illustrate how the introgression strains were made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>).

We also agree with the reviewers’ complaints about the terminology – we have changed the labels we used on the tables in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and elsewhere in the paper where similar data are displayed. We also changed the table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to make it more clear which markers we assayed.</p><p><italic>Finally, data underlying <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> are not presented at all, and need to be included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> (that is, once <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> is modified to make it clear and accessible, see below).</italic> </p><p>We agree, and omission of these data was an oversight.

The PI assay works well for spores killed by meiotic drive (because they essentially pop), but we did not intend to present it as a general fertility assay. We have also added a new table (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) that compares% PI-excluding cells to a more standard measure of fertility in fission yeast, the viable spore yield assay.

If diploids similar to diploid 9 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were made for the other wtfs, that data would be sufficient</italic></p><p>We now present these methods and data in our revision.</p><p><italic>It would also be nice (although not essential) if the authors could make a supplementary file that aligns all of the wtfs examined, to show where the two start sites are or are not. Since the RNAseq data for all the Sp wtfs are available, it would be interesting to know if the &quot;tamed&quot; wtfs only make the longer antidote mRNA, or if they still express both mRNAs.</italic> </p><p>We agree that these are interesting questions, but we have not added this information as we believe it is beyond the scope of this paper. It is not a straightforward comparison to make as the <italic>wtf</italic> gene family is very rapidly evolving. We are currently undertaking detailed bioinformatic analyses of the <italic>wtf</italic> gene family and its remarkable evolution, with the intention of presenting this analysis in the near future.</p><p><italic>It would also be useful to ask which of the wtfs identified by Hu et al. (i.e. cws in CBS5557) are extant toxin-antidote systems using the dual start-site criterion, and which, if any, have degenerated to antidote-only; the same request will be made of Hu et al., so perhaps the two sets of authors could coordinate on this. It would also be useful to mention that Hu et al. have identified the C-termini of two wtf/cws loci in CBS5557as being important for toxin but not for antidote function.</italic> </p><p>Consistent with our model, both of the driving <italic>wtf</italic>s identified by Hu et al. appear to have alternate start sites within exon 2, similar to <italic>Sk wtf28</italic>. We now mention this as additional support for our model in the paper. We also mention Hu et al.’s result regarding the function of the C-terminus.</p><p><italic>6) There is a long history of toxin/antidote system in bacteria, which has been extensively reviewed. Adding a brief discussion of this to the Introduction or Discussion would add perspective to the article, and might offer some insight into possible wtf mechanisms.</italic> </p><p>We have added a section on these bacterial systems to the Discussion. We note that only the general evolutionary principles of toxin-antidote systems are conserved and relevant to the <italic>wtf</italic> genes. Even among bacteria, they are myriad means to accomplish inheritance via the toxin/antidote mechanism. We therefore point to recent reviews where this topic and diversity has been extensively discussed.</p><p><italic>7) Given that what the authors describe are gamete / spore killers, wouldn't it be more accurate to refer to the process as &quot;drive&quot; instead of as &quot;meiotic drive&quot; (following the recommendation of Burt &amp; Trivers from their Genes in Conflict book – see page 16)? The phenomenon described has nothing to do with meiosis.</italic> </p><p>We disagree with this point but acknowledge lack of a scientific consensus regarding what to call ‘meiotic drive’. Although <italic>wtf</italic> genes do not participate in meiotic drive as originally envisioned to occur in asymmetric (female) meiosis (Sandler and Novitski, 1957), this term has, however, long been accepted to describe genetic elements that bias allele transmission by acting after the meiotic divisions by some of the original pioneers in this field (Zimmering et al., 1970): <italic>“</italic>Meiotic drive has been defined by Sandler &amp; Novitski as any alteration of the normal process of meiosis with the consequence that a heterozygote for two genetic alternatives produces an effective gametic pool with an excess of one type; such a pattern of behavior will drastically alter the frequency of alleles in a population in such a way that a driven allele may increase in frequency in spite of deleterious physiological effects. This general concept has, however, been taken to include transmissional anomalies that are not strictly meiotic, but with similar populational consequences [see, for example, Lewontin]; this extended meaning seems justified and thus the more general definition will be used in this review.”The <italic>wtf</italic> genes have as much to do with ‘meiotic drive’ as other mechanisms of post-meiotic dysfunction such as the SD-Responder system in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and the t-locus in mice, which have been classically referred to as meiotic drive systems in the literature. We, therefore, favor the term ‘meiotic drive’ for gamete-killers in general and <italic>wtf</italic>s specifically.</p><p>We also disagree with the comment that the phenomenon has nothing to do with meiosis. Indeed, one could imagine that toxin-antidote systems could be manifest in mitosis in eukaryotes just as they are in prokaryotes. However, <italic>wtf</italic> systems specifically exploit the kinetics of alternate, dual expression in meiosis to manifest their action. Indeed, <italic>wtf</italic> genes are highly transcribed in meiosis and we know that the <italic>wtf</italic> poison is present in cells prior to the completion of the meiotic divisions. Given that we do not fully understand the molecular mechanisms of these genes and their evolutionary implications, it seems premature to say they have no effect on meiosis.</p><p><italic>8) The authors need to be more sophisticated in their use of the concept of species. S. kambucha was so named on the basis of hybrid sterility &lt;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12399374">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12399374</ext-link>&gt; but is actually itself a mosaic of two strains of S. pombe (represented by 972 and NCYC132) which show greater sequence divergence from each other than either do from S. kambucha &lt;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21511999">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21511999</ext-link>&gt;. Thus, none of the three populations are genetically isolated on an evolutionary timescale. Therefore, be any modern definition of the term, S. pombe 972, S. pombe NCYC132 and S. kambucha are not separate species.</italic> </p><p>Here again, we disagree with the reviewers. <italic>S. kambucha</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> are reproductively isolated and fit the Ernst Mayr definition of ‘biological species’. The fact that they are a mosaic of two strains of <italic>S. pombe</italic> is interesting but inconsequential to the fact that they are reproductively isolated. We also point to famous examples of ring species (e.g. butterflies), many of which are themselves a result of hybridization, in which reproductive isolation is not a fully commutative phenotype.</p><p>Although not within the purview of our paper, we note that many other isolates grouped under the umbrella label “<italic>S. pombe</italic>” have clear reproductive barriers. There are many routes to generating reproductive barriers and thus distinct biological species and there is no set timescale during which these changes occur. What is remarkable about the <italic>S. pombe</italic> isolates is the fast rate at which reproductive boundaries have arisen.</p><p><italic>9) It would be of great interest to readers to have some speculation of how a putative trans-membrane protein could function in a toxin-antidote system and how the toxin comes to be distributed differently than the antidote.</italic> </p><p>We agree, and we have now added our hypothesis in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
