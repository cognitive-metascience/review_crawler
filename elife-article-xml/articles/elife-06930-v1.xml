pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06930.001</object-id><p>The production of offspring is energetically costly and relies on incompletely understood mechanisms that generate a positive energy balance. In mothers of many species, changes in key energy-associated internal organs are common yet poorly characterised functionally and mechanistically. In this study, we show that, in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> females, the midgut is dramatically remodelled to enhance reproductive output. In contrast to extant models, organ remodelling does not occur in response to increased nutrient intake and/or offspring demands, but rather precedes them. With spatially and temporally directed manipulations, we identify juvenile hormone (JH) as an anticipatory endocrine signal released after mating. Acting through intestinal bHLH-PAS domain proteins Methoprene-tolerant (Met) and Germ cell-expressed (Gce), JH signals directly to intestinal progenitors to yield a larger organ, and adjusts gene expression and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity in enterocytes to support increased lipid metabolism. Our findings identify a metabolically significant paradigm of adult somatic organ remodelling linking hormonal signals, epithelial plasticity, and reproductive output.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06930.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06930.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06930.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Producing offspring places extra energy demands on individuals. Female animals—which generally invest more time and resources than the males—need to ensure that sufficient nutrients reach their offspring during pregnancy and lactation. The small intestines of many female animals increase in size during this period, but it is not clear to what extent these changes help to maximise reproduction, or how they are regulated.</p><p>Reiff, Jacobson, Cognigni, Antonello et al. investigated what happens to the middle section of the gut in female fruit flies after mating. A fly's ‘midgut’ performs a similar role to the small intestine in humans and other mammals. The experiments show that mating increases the numbers of cells in the midgut so that it increases in size.</p><p>These changes are due to a hormone called ‘juvenile hormone’, which is released after the fly mates. In particular cells of the midgut, juvenile hormone also regulates some genes involved in the metabolism of lipids. If the activity of juvenile hormone is blocked in these cells, the female flies produce fewer eggs. These changes in the midgut still happen in mutant flies that cannot produce eggs and don't increase their food intake after they mate. Therefore, the changes appear to prepare flies for the increased nutritional demands rather than being caused by it.</p><p>Altogether, these findings reveal that changes in the midgut play an important role in the ability of female fruit flies to reproduce. Similar changes to the gut may also increase reproductive success in humans and other mammals. However, if the changes are maintained after reproduction, it is possible that they may contribute to weight gain and an increased risk of cancer in females after pregnancy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06930.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06930.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>intestine</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>organ plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT083559</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miguel-Aliaga</surname><given-names>Irene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERCStG 310411</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miguel-Aliaga</surname><given-names>Irene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>intramural</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miguel-Aliaga</surname><given-names>Irene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2009-09074</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dominguez</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Botin Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dominguez</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001381</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation-Prime Minister's office, Republic of Singapore (NRF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF2010-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yew</surname><given-names>Joanne Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003359</institution-id><institution>Generalitat Valenciana (Regional Government of Valencia)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PROMETEO II/2013/001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dominguez</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSD2007-00023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dominguez</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2012-35181</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dominguez</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A hormone released after mating acts directly on adult intestinal progenitors and differentiated epithelial cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to change their homeostatic setpoint and maximise fecundity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reproduction is energetically costly. Mothers can adjust their energy balance to maximise their reproductive success through well-established neural mechanisms that match food intake to their enhanced energy requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Roa and Tena-Sempere, 2014</xref>). However, less well-understood changes also occur in many animals during reproduction; internal organs, such as the liver, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract, increase their size and adapt their physiology, potentially contributing to an increased generation and delivery of nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hammond, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Speakman, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Establishment of a positive energy balance may be particularly important to animals with a reproductive strategy that involves rapid production of large numbers of progeny. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> females can lay up to 100 eggs per day at the peak of their fertility in early life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">David et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klepsatel et al., 2013</xref>).

We focused on the midgut epithelium because of its major digestive/absorptive roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lemaitre and Miguel-Aliaga, 2013</xref>). In the midgut epithelium, long-lived progenitors (intestinal stem cells (ISCs)) divide to self-renew and to give rise to committed progenitors (called enteroblasts (EBs)), which directly differentiate into two types of progeny: absorptive enterocytes (ECs) and enteroendocrine cells (EECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang and Edgar, 2012</xref>). We found that mating increases the number of both dividing and differentiating midgut cells, as revealed by phospho-Histone H3 (pH3) stainings and temporal analyses of progenitors and their descendants using the dual-labelling system <italic>escargot</italic>-Repressible Dual Differential Marker (<italic>esgReDDM</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonello et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C,E</xref>).

Concurrent with midgut re-sizing, we observed mating-dependent activation of the single <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of the mammalian family of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Theopold et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shimano, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Seegmiller et al., 2002</xref>], also known as <italic>HLH106</italic> in flies, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), using a reporter subject to the same physiologically regulated proteolytic processing as wild-type SREBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kunte et al., 2006</xref>). SREBP activation after mating was accompanied by upregulation of midgut transcripts involved in fatty acid synthesis and activation (<italic>SREBP</italic>, the long-chain fatty acid CoA ligases <italic>bubblegum</italic> (<italic>bgm</italic>) and <italic>Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain</italic> (<italic>Acsl</italic>) and, depending on genetic background, <italic>Fatty acid synthase</italic> (<italic>FAS</italic>) and <italic>Acetyl-CoA carboxylase</italic> (<italic>ACC</italic>)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>), many of which are known SREBP targets in flies and/or mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Seegmiller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horton et al., 2003</xref>).

Downregulation of any of these three genes fully prevented both the proliferative response to mating and midgut re-sizing, whereas overexpression of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> led to mating-like responses in virgin females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating direct actions of JH on intestinal progenitors. Intestinal progenitors with downregulated JH receptors were found in numbers comparable to those of controls in virgin females and were able to increase their proliferation in response to a JH-unrelated stimulus: the ROS-inducing compound paraquat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biteau et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that they remain competent to respond to the well-studied homeostatic machinery that maintains gut integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang and Edgar, 2012</xref>), and suggests that mating- and damage-induced proliferative mechanisms may differ and can be uncoupled.

This ‘cost of mating’ on lifespan is not relieved by sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ueyama and Fuyama, 2003</xref>), suggesting that physiological effects in non-reproductive tissues are responsible. The intestinal reprogramming that we describe here represents a novel physiological target of postmating plasticity ideally placed at the interface between nutrition and reproduction. Ageing in flies is accompanied by reduced fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Economos et al., 1979</xref>) and intestinal dysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biteau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Choi et al., 2008</xref>), and genetic manipulations that affect intestinal progenitors can affect lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biteau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rera et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it will be informative to explore the links between JH-triggered postmating responses in lifespan, age-dependent intestinal and reproductive dysfunction, and lifetime fertility.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Hormonal remodelling of adult organs</title><p>In larvae, the <italic>corpora allata</italic> integrate age and metabolic status information to optimise developmental progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mirth and Shingleton, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sarraf-Zadeh et al., 2013</xref>). Increasing evidence is revealing that, in adults, this insect endocrine organ acts as a nexus that detects changes in the organism's circumstances and condition to alter its metabolic and/or reproductive set points. It does so through regulated release of JH, with pleiotropic effects on ovarian maturation, adipose tissue, learning and memory, diapause, innate immunity, and ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nijhout and Riddiford, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jowett and Postlethwait, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fahrbach and Robinson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wyatt and Davey, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flatt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Riddiford, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yamamoto et al., 2013</xref>). Some of these effects may be modulated by crosstalk between JH and other systemic signals such as insulin-like peptides and ecdysteroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jindra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koyama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mirth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rauschenbach et al., 2014</xref>), but the cellular and molecular targets of JH action remain incompletely understood. Our findings have uncovered a direct and functionally significant effect on adult organ plasticity by showing that JH promotes proliferation and resets gut size through its actions on intestinal progenitors and activates expression of lipid metabolism genes in ECs. Based on structural and functional similarities, insect JH has been compared to mammalian thyroid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flatt et al., 2006</xref>): key energy balance regulators often associated with gastrointestinal alterations when pathologically dysregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Middleton, 1971</xref>). Given the well-established changes in thyroid function during human pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glinoer, 1997</xref>), it will therefore be of interest to explore their contribution to reproductive intestinal remodelling. Downstream of its receptor(s), relay of JH signalling in the intestine may differ from the classical model in which <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>gce</italic> act redundantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jindra et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, downregulation of either gene alone is sufficient to prevent the mating-induced changes in intestinal progenitors: a finding that we confirmed by observing that viable <italic>Met</italic><sup><italic>27</italic></sup> mutants also fail to undergo mating-induced remodelling (data not shown). The actions of Met and Gce may also be cell-specific, as suggested by a preferential requirement for <italic>gce</italic> in ECs, and may result from different Met/gce expression levels (our unpublished observations) and/or interacting partners. Candidates to consider include Taiman, homologous to the mammalian steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1)/NCoA-1/p160 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Charles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>) and, more intriguingly, circadian clock proteins: Met-binding partners recently shown to coordinate the switch from diapause to reproduction in other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajgar et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Adult organ plasticity, obesity, and cancer</title><p>Adult organ plasticity is not a peculiarity of <italic>Drosophila</italic> reproduction; examples of changes in intestinal size and nutrient utilisation are widespread across the animal kingdom in response to both environmental and internal challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carey, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hammond, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Piersma and Lindstrom, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Speakman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O'Brien et al., 2011</xref>). Although intestinal remodelling has not been assessed in human pregnancy, it could be one of the major drivers for the changes in gut microbiota observed during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koren et al., 2012</xref>) and could contribute to changes in gastrointestinal physiology, common during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keller et al., 2008</xref>). Resetting of anatomical or metabolic features of internal organs may thus be a broadly used strategy to achieve a positive energy balance which, when matched to the developing offspring's demands, will contribute to reproductive success. However, if deployed in the absence of such demands, organ remodelling could contribute to the weight gain and increased fat mass that has been observed upon gonadectomy of multiple species including mice, rats, cats, monkeys, and other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hansen et al., 2013</xref> and references therein). In a more physiological context, inappropriate persistence of such metabolic remodelling beyond pregnancy and lactation could similarly contribute to post-pregnancy weight retention in humans—a phenotype that, at least in mice, is correlated with enhanced intestinal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Casirola and Ferraris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gore et al., 2003</xref>). Similarly, inappropriate persistence of JH-like mechanisms that change the homeostatic set point of adult stem cells and their progeny to transform an organ may also help explain why pregnancy changes the susceptibility to certain cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gwinn et al., 1990</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>For wild-type experiments, the genetic backgrounds <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup>, OregonR, and CantonS were used as indicated in the figures and/or full genotypes list (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

All experimental flies were kept at 25°C expect for those containing temperature-sensitive regulation (<italic>tub-Gal80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup>), which were set up at 18°C (restrictive temperature) and transferred to 29°C (permissive temperature) at the time when activation was needed in the specific experiment. For all experiments, experimental and control flies were handled in parallel and experienced the same temperature shifts and treatments.</p><p>For the analysis of mating and JHa effects, virgin female flies were collected at eclosion, aged for 4–5 days on standard food and then transferred for 3 days (7 days for flies harbouring the <italic>esgReDDM</italic> transgenes, as these flies show a delay in mating responses at 29°C) into new tubes in the presence of wild-type males (typically 4–5 females + 6 males) or food supplemented with 1.5 mM methoprene (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, PESTANAL 33375, racemic mixture), added to freshly prepared food when still liquid but &lt;50°C. This concentration was chosen in a pilot dilution test from 0.5 to 7.5 mM as the one that induced activation of the <italic>SREBP-Gal4</italic> reporter to levels comparable to mating, and corresponds to approximately half of the concentration used in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flatt and Kawecki, 2007</xref>).

For the acquisition of gut images in these samples, a single 1392 × 1040 field was acquired posterior to the midgut–hindgut boundary using QCapture software (QImaging). Progeny dynamics were analysed using the <italic>esgReDDM</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonello et al., 2015</xref>), which has the genetic makeup <italic>esg-Gal4, UAS-mCD8::GFP; tub-Gal80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup><italic>, UAS-H2B::RFP</italic>. At the permissive temperature of 29°C, the GFP reporter is expressed in <italic>esg-Gal4</italic> positive cells (ISCs and EBs), but due to the perdurance of the RFP-tagged histone H2B::RFP the <italic>esg-Gal4-</italic>negative progeny (including ECs and EECs) generated from these progenitors since the shift to permissive temperature is additionally labelled in red. To restrict progeny analysis to mating-induced changes, <italic>esgReDDM</italic> flies were maintained at 18°C, such that Gal4 expression is suppressed by <italic>tub-Gal80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup>, and moved to 29°C only at the time of mating. After 3 days of mating at 29°C, guts were dissected and stained for GFP and pH3 (the endogenous RFP signal was detected directly). EC number in the posterior midgut was assessed by imaging the entire gut of <italic>caudal &gt; H2B::RFP</italic> flies and counting the number of RFP-marked cells. Confocal images were obtained with a Leica TCS SP5 inverted confocal microscope using a 20× air objective for <italic>esgReDDM</italic> and a 10× air objective for <italic>caudal &gt; H2B::RFP</italic>. Stacks were typically collected every 1 µm, and the images (1024 × 1024) were reconstructed using maximum projection. Bright-field images or confocal maximum projections were loaded into ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) and the line tool used to quantify the width of the gut across the centre of the image. ImageJ was also used to outline the guts of <italic>esgReDDM</italic> flies using the polygon tool before analysing the resulting region of interest (ROI) with a custom MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc.) script optimised for the ReDDM method. Extended details about this analysis are available from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonello et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, maximum projections were adjusted for levels and offsets and filtered to remove noise (using always the same parameters for scans within one experiment), then the area of the gut was identified by background staining and the cell nuclei by DAPI signal. The size of nuclei can be used to discriminate between diploid cells (ISCs, EBs, and EECs) and polyploid ECs. The red-labelled nuclei (persistent H2B::RFP) and green-labelled cells (mCD8::GFP) were identified by segmentation and compared to the pattern of nuclei defined by DAPI to generate a report of total ECs (large DAPI cells), total progenitors + progeny (RFP signal), total ISCs and EBs (GFP signal), and total area. The same script was also used to count the number of <italic>caudal &gt; H2B::RFP</italic> cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analysis of reporter gene expression</title><p>For <italic>SREBP &gt; mCD8::GFP</italic> and <italic>bgm-lacZ</italic> experiments, confocal images were obtained with a Leica SP5 upright confocal microscope using a 20× glycerol immersion objective. A single 20× field (1024 pixels wide) immediately posterior to the midgut–hindgut boundary was acquired with a Z resolution of 1.5 µm. ImageJ was used to generate a maximum projection for each sample and all images pertaining to one experiment were loaded as separate layers into a single Adobe Photoshop CS6 file. The layers were then ranked blindly on the basis of their relative intensity in the relevant channel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>qPCR</title><p>To quantify mating-induced changes in gene expression, posterior midguts from at least 10 adult female flies were dissected, discarding Malphigian tubules and the hindgut.

The needle tip was placed into the gap between the anepisternum and anepimeron of anesthetised flies, and haemolymph was collected using a slight vacuum (0.2–1.0 mPa) for ∼30 s. Haemolymph from 45 to 50 flies was collected in the same needle. The contents were ejected into a 0.1 ml glass vial insert (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) by applying pressurised air (∼5–6 kPa) with a Femtojet microinjector (Eppendorf, NY, USA), and weighed prior to extraction. 20 μl of MeOH was added to the haemolymph followed by extraction with 20 μl of hexane, repeated four times. Pooled hexane extract was evaporated under a gentle stream of N<sub>2</sub> and reconstituted in 10 μl of hexane. All extracts were prepared and measured immediately after collection.</p><p>Mass spectra were acquired with an atmospheric pressure ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometer (AccuTOF-DART, JEOL USA, Inc.) equipped with a DART interface and operated with a resolving power of 6000 (FWHM definition). The RF ion guide voltage was set at 600 V. The atmospheric pressure ionisation interface potentials were as follows: orifice 1 = 15 V, orifice 2 = 5 V, ring lens = 5 V. Mass spectra were stored at a rate of one spectrum per second with an acquired m/z range of 60–1000. The DART interface was operated in positive-ion mode using helium gas with the gas heater set to 200°C. The glow discharge needle potential was set to 3.5 kV. Electrode 1 was set to +150 V, and electrode 2 was set to +250 V. Helium gas flow was set to 2.0 l/min. Calibration for exact mass measurements was accomplished by acquiring a mass spectrum of polyethylene glycol (average molecular weight 600) as a reference standard in every data file. Analysis was done with JEOL MassCenter software (version 1.3.0.1). Accurate mass measures and isotope pattern matching by MassMountaineer (FarHawk Marketing Services, Ontario, CA) were used to support elemental composition assignments.</p><p>2 μl of the haemolymph hexane extract was placed on the tip of a borosilicate glass capillary. The capillary was introduced to the DART ion source with a micromanipulator, thus allowing for reproducible placement of the sample. Each extract was measured 4–5 times. The averaged signal intensity was normalised to the total weight of the haemolymph and converted to absolute quantities after establishing a calibration curve with a JHIII standard (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA, CAS 24198-95-6). Analysis of JHIII by DART produces two signature ions at m/z 267.20 (intact molecule) and at m/z 249.18 (loss of water), consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Navare et al., 2010</xref>). The abundance of the [M-H<sub>2</sub>O + H]<sup>+</sup> signal peak was used for all measurements because the parent ion at m/z 267.20 could not be consistently resolved due to interference from other signals. To detect other juvenoid compounds, the following mass signatures were used: methylfarnesoate ([M + H]<sup>+</sup> 251.20) and JHIII Bisepoxide ([M + H]<sup>+</sup> 283.19). DART MS was previously shown to be an effective method for quantitative and high-sensitivity measurements of JHIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Navare et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Fecundity and egg viability experiments</title><p>Flies for fecundity and egg viability experiments were raised at 18°C to prevent the expression of the RNAi transgenes during development, then shifted to 29°C in late pupariation (after ∼20 days). Virgin females were collected upon eclosion and after 4 days mated overnight to OregonR males (10 males, 10 females per vial). Males were then removed, individual female flies were transferred to a new single vial of yeast-supplemented standard food (cornmeal/agar diet with 5% yeast content) every 48 hr, and eggs were counted from the vacated vial to quantify fecundity. To assess egg viability, a fraction of the egg-containing vials were then maintained at 29°C, and the number of eclosed progeny was counted and compared with egg counts. Each genotype cross was performed three times, and egg production from each fly was assessed over three 48 hr repeats, covering a total of 6 days of egg laying.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Thin-layer chromatography (TLC)</title><p>Ovaries and guts were removed from flies immobilised on ice and the remaining carcasses (three flies per sample) were immediately homogenised in a mixture of methanol (60 μl), chloroform (150 μl), and water (75 μl), following previously described procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Anzi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hildebrandt et al., 2011</xref>). After an extraction period (1 hr at 37°C), aqueous and organic phases were separated by the addition of a 1:1 mixture of 1 M potassium chloride and chloroform (75 μl each). Samples were briefly centrifuged and 120 μl of the organic phase was transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes and left to air-dry for 3 hr. The resulting dessicated lipids were resuspended in 16 μl of a 1:1 chloroform:methanol mixture. 3 μl of each sample was applied to TLC plates (Merck Millipore116487) and lipid species were separated by standing the plates in ∼1 cm of a mobile phase consisting of 69.5% hexane, 29.5% diethyl ether, and 1% acetic acid. Once the mobile phase had traversed the plates, they were briefly dried and then dipped in a cerium-ammonium-molybdate stain (ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate 2.5 g, cerium (IV) sulphate hydrate complex with sulphuric acid 1 g, water 90 ml, sulphuric acid 10 ml). The TLC plates were developed at 80°C for 25 min and then imaged on a digital scanner.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agree that this is an original, interesting and broadly convincing paper that is suitable in principle for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, in addition to a number of minor points, there were a few more significant issues that should be addressed before the paper can be accepted.</p><p>Both the Abstract and the main text are so brief that background and experimental details are omitted. Without adding too much extra text, it should be revised so that it is a complete document. The Abstract should contain important keywords for searching.</p><p>The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,J</xref>, in which depletion of either of the two JH receptors completely blocks ISC mitoses and gut growth, is strange enough that it might be an artefact. If these gene products are both bona fide JH receptors then we might expect them to have overlapping, redundant functions, and that depleting both (not just one) of them would be necessary to fully block JH action. The authors need to do some controls to ensure that these RNAis are not just killing the stem cells, in a JH independent manner; or they need to explain clearly why this is not necessary.</p><p>The fecundity assays should also be done with the <italic>esgReDDM</italic> driver to test directly the relevance of gut resizing to fertility. Without some kind of direct test, they will probably have to weaken the argument for this interesting model, which would be a pity.</p><p>To understand the corpus allatum ablation experiment, it's important to refer explicitly to the reduction of JH titers that this causes, as described in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yamamoto et al. (2013)</xref> paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 minor comments</italic>:</p><p>Title: “Direct endocrine remodeling…”—is it necessary/relevant to claim that this is direct? How can the authors be sure about this?</p><p>Title and elsewhere: “maximizes reproductive success”—maximization relative to what? To really assess this, I suppose one would need to measure reproductive success among a large number of wild-type genotypes from natural populations. Is the claim here that reproductive success is maximized/optimized in the wild-type (as measured/defined here) and that any deviation from this state reduces reproductive success? The authors should be careful with their phrasing, especially with regard to any putative adaptive interpretation of their findings. For example, in the Abstract/Summary, they state that the “midgut is dramatically remodelled to maximise reproductive success”, and I am wondering how certain one can be about this rather strong claim. I would say that their results are consistent with such an adaptive interpretation but they do not prove it.</p><p>Title and elsewhere: “reproductive success”—again, here I think the authors should be a bit more careful. Many of their results pertain to fecundity rather than fertility. Reproductive success in the strict sense refers to the number of surviving offspring (thus to fertility, not to fecundity). From the Methods section it appears that the authors have indeed also measured fertility but, alas, I cannot find these data: all the plots seem to show fecundity (at least that is what the axes say), not fertility. Also note that, unlike defined in the Methods (in the subsection headed “Fertility and fecundity experiments”), viability (=egg to adult survival, which is a proportion or percentage) is <italic>not</italic> the same as fertility. Fertility is the number of total eggs produced times viability, giving the total number of eggs produced from which adult flies eclose. Moreover, importantly, as far as I can tell, the authors have measured fecundity only over the first 6 days of adulthood. This is hardly an accurate measure of (lifetime) reproductive success! It might very well be that minor early differences in fecundity will vanish with age so that there won't be any net difference between two groups claimed to be different. On the other hand, since pek fecundity is reached within 3–4 days after eclosion, the authors can argue that they have focused on the most important part of the age-dependent fecundity profile. Nonetheless, the authors should be more careful when talking about “reproductive success”.</p><p>Throughout manuscript, especially in the introductory parts: The literature on the connection between fat metabolism and reproduction is not very well covered; many key references are missing. See, for example, the review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hansen et al., 2013</xref> in Cell Metabolism and references therein. There is lots of evidence, for example, that curtailing or abolishing reproduction increases fat storage (which is not necessarily inconsistent at all with the notion that mating increases fat metabolism), and that lipids are one of the main energetic currencies of trade-offs between reproduction and somatic maintenance.</p><p>Results and Discussion: “also occur in many mammals”—rephrase perhaps, as this implies that the previous sentence was not about mammals?</p><p>Results and Discussion: “adaptations”—do the authors mean here “adaptation” in the physiological sense of the word or do they mean evolutionary adaptation? It is unclear. The authors must be careful here.</p><p>Results and Discussion, end of the first paragraph: Interestingly, both mating (as reported here) and curtailing reproduction (e.g., via gonadectomy) increase lipid levels, so have equivalent effects, and this is of course not necessarily a contradiction. Remarkably, the same appears to be true for plastic changes in organ size: similar to the increased organ size upon mating, the size of organs is sometimes also observed in some sterile fly mutants, for instance, with the fat body and the corpus allatum being hypertrophied and with transplanation of wildtype ovaries into the sterile flies restoring normal organ size (papers by Winifred Doane, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>). I think that some of these connections should be discussed.</p><p>Results and Discussion, second paragraph: The results regarding JH III are very interesting, but what about the potential effects of JH3-bisepoxide and of methylfarnesoate? Potential effects of these other juvenoid compounds produced by the corpus allatum should at least be mentioned as a caveat, i.e. while JH III is clearly involved in the phenomena observed here, the authors cannot exclude effects also of JH3B and MF.</p><p>Results and Discussion, same paragraph: Was it not possible to simultaneously downregulate/silence Met and Gce? As far as I understand these two paralogs only function as an operational JH receptor in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a heterodimer.</p><p>Results and Discussion, third paragraph: <italic>ovo</italic><sup><italic>D1</italic></sup><italic>—</italic>this is an interesting set of results but, as far as I can tell, the authors did not include a fertile wildtype control for <italic>ovo</italic><sup><italic>D1</italic></sup> in this experiment, so the only statement can be made from this experiment is about non-mating vs mating. A properly controlled experiment should include 4 groups: WT control vs <italic>ovo</italic><sup><italic>D1</italic></sup>, both mated vs unmated.</p><p>Results and Discussion, same paragraph: “might accumulate… peripheral fat stores in the absence of the local (ovary) sink”. Two reactions to this statement: (1) we already know that in many animals sterility (gonadectomy, castratation) causes increased fat accumulation or obesity (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hansen et al., 2013</xref> and references therein), (2) the <italic>ovo</italic><sup><italic>D1</italic></sup> mutants are, as far as I know, not properly ovary-less, they just have smaller ovaries than wild-type. Thus, with regard to (1) there is indeed published evidence for the authors’ statement. Similarly, the important result in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yamamoto et al. (2103)</xref>, that corpus allatum ablation impedes fat body development, should be cited and discussed. This result is consistent with the authors' findings.</p><p>Results and Discussion: (Endcrine regulation of) Organ size plasticity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>—the authors should cite the papers by Alexander Shingleton here.</p><p>Results and Discussion, fourth paragraph, especially the last two sentences: this is interesting and well-written but perhaps a bit on the speculative side.</p><p>In the figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and elsewhere: what is a negative binomial ANOVA? By definition an ANOVA is general (not a generalized) linear model which assumes a normal distribution of the errors/residuals. Here the authors seem to have used a generalized linear model with a negative binomial error structure, but I cannot be sure. Please clarify.</p><p>In general: In some of their experiments, the authors have used TLC and a (semi-quantitative) quantification of TLC to assess peripheral fat. Why did the authors not use one of the well-established and commercially available kit-based TAG assays?</p><p>In the subsection headed “Fly strains”: I am worried that apparently none of the experiments has involved fully co-isogenic, backcrossed wild-type controls which are co-isogenic with the <italic>Gal4</italic> and UAS-RNAi lines used. I think this is probably not a big concern for the majority of experiments, but this might play a role for the fecundity assays since this trait is notoriously quantitative and sensitive to genetic background.</p><p>In the subsection headed “Fly strains” and following: did the authors verify the efficiency of RNAi silencing via qRT-PCR? The fact that many manipulations did have phenotypic effects suggests that RNAi has worked but this is of course no proof. In general, I think that if one uses RNAi one should demonstrate that it has indeed reduced mRNA transcript (or even better protein levels).</p><p>In the subsection headed “Fly husbandry”: methoprene—how was this dosage determined? Is the methoprene used the pure enantiomere or a racemic mixture of s- and r-methoprene? More details on the product from Sigma should be given.</p><p>In the subsection headed “Detection of circulating JH hormone by DART-MS”: synthetic JH III—I am not aware that there is synthetic JH III but I may of course be wrong. Is this not simply proper JH III isolated from Manduca sexta?</p><p>In the subsection headed “Fertility and fecundity experiments” and following: I failed to find the fertility experimental data—where are these? Note (see my comment above) that viability is <italic>not</italic> the same as fertility. I am also a bit worried about the temperature shift effects on fecundity: this is rather unnatural. Of course I see the reason for doing this but: (1) were there no GeneSwitch-<italic>Gal4</italic> constructs available that could have been used to restrict silencing to the adult stage? (2) were the (wildtype) controls in these experiments also subjected to the temperature shift? Finally, as mentioned above, measuring fecundity over 6 days may not be a good, accurate predictor of (lifetime) reproductive success.</p><p>In the subsection headed “Statistics and figure preparation”: I am confused about “assuming unequal deviances”. Do the authors mean “variances”? “Deviances” is <italic>not</italic> the same as variances; deviances have a special statistical meaning which does not make sense in the context of a <italic>t</italic>-test.

If these gene products are both bona fide JH receptors then we might expect them to have overlapping, redundant functions, and that depleting both (not just one) of them would be necessary to fully block JH action. The authors need to do some controls to ensure that these RNAis are not just killing the stem cells, in a JH independent manner; or they need to explain clearly why this is not necessary</italic>.</p><p>We have tested this by quantifying the number of intestinal progenitors (as the number of <italic>esgReDDM</italic> GFP-positive cells) upon downregulation of <italic>gce</italic>. No changes in the number of progenitors were observed, ruling out stem cell death as a possible reason for the reduction in mitoses. This is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>, panel D. To further confirm that the health of intestinal progenitors in which <italic>gce</italic> has been downregulated is not compromised, we tested their ability to respond to an unrelated proliferative stimulus by treating guts with the ROS-inducing compound paraquat (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biteau et al., 2008</xref> Cell Stem Cell). Both the number of <italic>gce</italic>-downregulated progenitors and their pH3 counts were comparable to those of controls in response to paraquat. These results further indicate that downregulation of JH signalling in adult intestinal progenitors does not compromise their viability or function—at least within the timeframe of our experiments—and are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> panels E-F.</p><p>Gain-of-function experiments further show the specificity of the stem cell JH phenotypes; both methoprene treatment and overexpression of the JH target <italic>Kr-h1</italic> specifically in adult intestinal progenitors lead to increased proliferation/gut size in virgin females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> panels I and J respectively).</p><p>We have also used a viable <italic>Met</italic><sup><italic>27</italic></sup> mutant to confirm RNAi phenotypes, and to further confirm that the actions of <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>gce</italic> in the intestine are not redundant.

However, the lack of <italic>Met</italic> expression in these mutants is constitutive and in all tissues, and, possibly as a result, their basal intestinal proliferation and midgut size seem higher than those of wild-type flies, so we feel that the RNAi experiments described in the manuscript are more rigorously controlled for potential temporal and/or non-cell autonomous effects.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06930.013</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06930.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06930.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06930-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>Met has been shown to bind both itself and Gce (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jindra et al.

Hence, it is conceivable that the mating-induced increase in ISC proliferation requires (at least transient) Met-Gce heterodimers, in light of the full phenotype resulting from depletion of either one alone. Alternatively, even if Met and Gce carry out equivalent functions independently, they may be haploinsufficient in the intestine; in this situation, a partial reduction in overall Met/Gce function resulting from loss of either gene would render the intestine unable to undergo postmating remodelling.</p><p>The intestinal progenitor quantifications, responses to paraquat and the <italic>Kr-h1</italic> experiments are described in the revised Results section: “Juvenile hormone signals directly to adult intestinal progenitors and enterocytes via Met and Gce receptors”.

However, during the course of these experiments, we also noticed that, unlike the enterocyte driver <italic>mex-Gal4</italic>, two routinely used <italic>esg-Gal4</italic> intestinal progenitor drivers are also expressed in a few cells in the ovary (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 2</xref>, images by Bruno Hudry and Jake Jacobson, Miguel-Aliaga lab). Another routinely used driver, <italic>GS5961</italic>, is also expressed outside the intestine (Nicholson et al (2008) Genetics 178:215) Hence, although our experiments do suggest that intestinal-progenitor-driven resizing also contributes to increased egg production, we do not feel that we can make such a statement in the manuscript, given that the driver may not be exclusively expressed in the intestine – a finding that we mention in this revised version (last Results section). We do, however, disagree that the model is weakened as a result; the enterocyte data clearly shows that at least some of the mating-induced intestinal changes do affect egg production.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06930.014</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06930.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06930.014</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06930-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>To understand the corpus allatum ablation experiment, it's important to refer explicitly to the reduction of JH titers that this causes, as described in the</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88"><italic>Yamamoto et al.

How</italic> can <italic>the authors be sure about this</italic>?</p><p>We conclude that the action of juvenile hormone on the intestine is direct based on the fact that 1) downregulation of the juvenile hormone receptors specifically in adult intestinal progenitors or enterocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,J and K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1L</xref>), and 2) activation of the pathway specifically in these cells by <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1 I, J</xref>) both recapitulate phenotypes resulting from changes in systemic JH signalling and/or or JH analogue feeding. We believe that this is an important finding because it shows that intestinal remodelling is not secondary to the effects of JH on organs such as the ovary or the fat body. We do, however, agree that “direct endocrine remodelling” may not necessarily convey this information, and have revised the Title and Abstract so that “direct” is now absent from the title, but is more extensively explained in the Abstract.</p><p><italic>Title and elsewhere: “maximizes reproductive success”—maximization relative to what? To really assess this, I suppose one would need to measure reproductive success among a large number of wild-type genotypes from natural populations. Is the claim here that reproductive success is maximized/optimized in the wild-type (as measured/defined here) and that any deviation from this state reduces reproductive success? The authors should be careful with their phrasing, especially with regard to any putative adaptive interpretation of their findings. For example, in the Abstract/Summary, they state that the “midgut is dramatically remodelled to maximise reproductive success”, and I am wondering how certain one</italic> can <italic>be about this rather strong claim. I would say that their results are consistent with such an adaptive interpretation but they do not prove it</italic>.</p><p>We did not mean to imply success in ecological/evolutionary terms, but acknowledge that the phrasing may be misleading. Therefore, we have amended the relevant sentences and have replaced “success” throughout the manuscript with more neutral/generic (“reproductive output”), or specific/descriptive (e.g. “egg production at the time of peak fertility”) terms throughout the manuscript. We have also included two additional paragraphs (Introduction, second paragraph, and Discussion, first section in the revised manuscript) providing more information regarding the dynamics of egg production in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and discussing possible long-term effects of intestinal remodelling on reproductive output.</p><p>We have also replaced the word “maximise” with “sustain” or “enhance” throughout the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Title and elsewhere: “reproductive success”—again, here I think the authors should be a bit more careful. Many of their results pertain to fecundity rather than fertility. Reproductive success in the strict sense refers to the number of surviving offspring (thus to fertility, not to fecundity). From the Methods section it appears that the authors have indeed also measured fertility but, alas, I cannot find these data: all the plots seem to show fecundity (at least that is what the axes say), not fertility. Also note that, unlike defined in the Methods (in the subsection headed “Fertility and fecundity experiments”), viability (=egg to adult survival, which is a proportion or percentage) is</italic> not <italic>the same as fertility. Fertility is the number of total eggs produced times viability, giving the total number of eggs produced from which adult flies eclose. Moreover, importantly, as far as I</italic> can <italic>tell, the authors have measured fecundity only over the first 6 days of adulthood. This is hardly an accurate measure of (lifetime) reproductive success! It might very well be that minor early differences in fecundity will vanish with age so that there won't be any net difference between two groups claimed to be different. On the other hand, since pek fecundity is reached within 3-4 days after eclosion, the authors</italic> can <italic>argue that they have focused on the most important part of the age-dependent fecundity profile. Nonetheless, the authors should be more careful when talking about “reproductive success”</italic>.</p><p>All instances of reproductive success have now been amended as described above. In addition, we now provide additional data showing a specific effect of these genetic manipulations on egg production rather than egg quality/viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>, panels H and I), and explain these terms whenever they are used in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Throughout manuscript, especially in the introductory parts: The literature on the connection between fat metabolism and reproduction is not very well covered; many key references are missing. See, for example, the review by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30"><italic>Hansen et al. 2013</italic></xref> <italic>in Cell Metabolism and references therein. There is lots of evidence, for example, that curtailing or abolishing reproduction increases fat storage (which is not necessarily inconsistent at all with the notion that mating increases fat metabolism), and that lipids are one of the main energetic currencies of trade-offs between reproduction and somatic maintenance</italic>.</p><p>We apologise for this oversight. The links between reproduction, lipid metabolism and ageing are more extensively discussed in the revised manuscript (first and third Discussion sections).</p><p><italic>Results and Discussion, first paragraph: “also occur in many mammals”—rephrase perhaps, as this implies that the previous sentence was not about mammals</italic>?</p><p>“Mammals” has been replaced with “animals”.</p><p><italic>Results and Discussion: “adaptations”—do the authors mean here “adaptation” in the physiological sense of the word or do they mean evolutionary adaptation? It is unclear. The authors must be careful here</italic>.</p><p>We meant physiological adaptations. We have replaced “possible intestinal adaptations” with “possible intestinal changes occurring during the phase of peak fertility”.</p><p><italic>Results and Discussion, end of the first paragraph: Interestingly, both mating (as reported here) and curtailing reproduction (e.g.,</italic> via <italic>gonadectomy) increase lipid levels, so have equivalent effects, and this is of course not necessarily a contradiction. Remarkably, the same appears to be true for plastic changes in organ size: similar to the increased organ size upon mating, the size of organs is sometimes also observed in some sterile fly mutants, for instance, with the fat body and the corpus allatum being hypertrophied and with transplanation of wildtype ovaries into the sterile flies restoring normal organ size (papers by Winifred Doane, cited in</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30"><italic>Hansen et al. 2013</italic></xref><italic>). I think that some of these connections should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>Hansen et al. is now mentioned in the revised manuscript. However, we feel that there is a difference between the hypertrophy examples listed by the reviewer (which may passively result, for example, from increased stores in the case of the fat body) and the organ resizing we have reported, which involves an increase in the number of cells and reprogramming of their metabolic state driven by active signals.</p><p><italic>Results and Discussion, second paragraph: The results regarding JH III are very interesting, but what about the potential effects of JH3-bisepoxide and of methylfarnesoate? Potential effects of these other juvenoid compounds produced by the corpus allatum should at least be mentioned as a caveat, i.e. while JH III is clearly involved in the phenomena observed here, the authors cannot exclude effects also of JH3B and MF</italic>.</p><p>We looked for signals corresponding to JH3-bisepoxide and methylfarnesoate in the hemolymph extracts and were unable to detect them, suggesting that their concentration is very low. However, the review is right that we cannot formally exclude effects from these two juvenoid compounds and we now mention this explicitly in the revised manuscript (in the Results section “Intestinal remodelling is mediated by increased levels of circulating juvenile hormone X” and in the Materials and methods section “Detection of circulating JH hormone by DART-MS”).</p><p><italic>Results and Discussion, same paragraph: Was it not possible to simultaneously downregulate/silence Met and Gce? As far as I understand these two paralogs only function as an operational JH receptor in Drosophila as a heterodimer</italic>.</p><p>We did not see this as a priority because, as discussed earlier, downregulation of either receptor alone fully prevented the mating-triggered increase in proliferation and resizing. Furthermore, although Met can bind itself and Gce, these dimers dissociate in the presence of methoprene or JHIII. Currently available data suggests that Met may mediate its actions by interaction with other nuclear proteins such as Taiman (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jindra et al. (2013)</xref> Annu Rev Entomol for a comprehensive review). Given the different effects of <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>gce</italic> downregulation on enterocytes and stem cells, these proteins may differ depending on cell type, and their identification is beyond the scope of this manuscript. These considerations are now discussed in the revised manuscript (second Discussion section: “Hormonal remodelling of adult organs”).</p><p><italic>Results and Discussion, third paragraph:</italic> ovo<sup>D1</sup>—<italic>this is an interesting set of results but, as far as I</italic> can <italic>tell, the authors did not include a fertile wildtype control for</italic> ovo<sup>D1</sup> <italic>in this experiment, so the only statement</italic> can <italic>be made from this experiment is about non-mating versus mating. A properly controlled experiment should include 4 groups: WT control versus</italic> ovo<sup>D1</sup>, <italic>both mated versus unmated</italic>.</p><p>We have conducted the experiments in these four groups as requested by the reviewer. The experiments confirm that both the increases in proliferation and midgut diameter and the activation of SREBP occur to a comparable degree in sterile and fertile flies, and are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4figure supplement 1</xref>, panels A to E.</p><p><italic>Results and Discussion, same paragraph: “might accumulate… peripheral fat stores in the absence of the local (ovary) sink”. Two reactions to this statement: (1) we already know that in many animals sterility (gonadectomy, castratation) causes increased fat accumulation or obesity (cf.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30"><italic>Hansen et al. 2013</italic></xref> <italic>and references therein), (2) the</italic> ovo<sup>D1</sup> <italic>mutants are, as far as I know, not properly ovary-less, they just have smaller ovaries than wild-type.

This result is consistent with the authors' findings</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these relevant references. Point 1 is now discussed in the last section of the revised Discussion. Point 2 has been addressed by amending the sentence to “we used sterile <italic>ovo</italic><sup><italic>D1</italic></sup> females to quantify lipid content, reasoning that it might accumulate in gut and/or peripheral fat stores in the absence of the local ovarian sink” in the revised Results section “Mating-triggered intestinal remodelling maximises reproductive output”.

By definition an ANOVA is general (not a generalized) linear model which assumes a normal distribution of the errors/residuals. Here the authors seem to have used a generalized linear model with a negative binomial error structure, but I cannot be sure. Please clarify</italic>.</p><p>We apologise for this mistake. Because pH3 experiments yielded count (discrete) data with a distinctly non-normal distribution, we fitted these data with a negative binomial generalised linear model (R function glm.nb from MASS package), which takes into account the asymmetric nature and overdispersion of count values (Bliss and Fisher (1953) Biometrics 9, 176–200), and then used likelihood ratio tests (R function anova.negbin from MASS package) to obtain p values. We have explained this analysis in Materials and methods (under “Statistics and Figure Preparation”) and have replaced ANOVA with GLM in the relevant figure legends.</p><p><italic>In general: In some of their experiments, the authors have used TLC and a (semi-quantitative) quantification of TLC to assess peripheral fat. Why did the authors not use one of the well-established and commercially available kit-based TAG assays</italic>?</p><p>The kit-based TAG assays are subject to experimental error from two sources:</p><p>1) Pigmentation from the eyes or cuticle in the extract can contribute to the colorimetric read-out used for kit-based assays.</p><p>2) The kits do not strictly measure TAGs alone. The enzymatic reaction used to produce the colour signal also cleaves other molecules with glycerol backbones such as diacylglycerides and monoacylglycerides. Thus, by using a kit, the colorimetric signal would reflect released glycerol from TAGs as well as other glycerides.</p><p>TLC used under the conditions described in the manuscript is capable of separating TAGs from other classes of glycero-lipids. Pigmentation also does not contribute to the TAG signal since the pigments do not have the same retention index (i.e., they do not migrate in the same band) as TAGs.</p><p>Previous work comparing commercial kits to TLC for TAG quantitation found the latter to be less sensitive and less accurate. For details see Al-Anzi et al. (2010) PLoS One (doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0012353).</p><p><italic>In the subsection headed “Fly strains”: I am worried that apparently none of the experiments has involved fully co-isogenic, backcrossed wild-type controls which are co-isogenic with the</italic> Gal4 <italic>and UAS-RNAi lines used. I think this is probably not a big concern for the majority of experiments, but this might play a role for the fecundity assays since this trait is notoriously quantitative and sensitive to genetic background</italic>.</p><p>We agree that fecundity is very sensitive to genetic background, which is why we avoid working with isogenic genetic backgrounds that might give phenotypes that cannot be replicated in other genetic backgrounds.

This is now explicitly stated in the Materials and methods section under “Fly strains”.</p><p><italic>In the subsection headed “Fly strains” and following: did the authors verify the efficiency of RNAi silencing</italic> via <italic>qRT-PCR? The fact that many manipulations did have phenotypic effects suggests that RNAi has worked but this is of course no proof.

Note (see my comment above) that viability is</italic> not <italic>the same as fertility</italic>.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, in addition to testing egg production, we have also tested egg viability in a subset of experiments, and have included these data in the revised manuscript in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref> (panels H and I). As requested by the reviewer, we have also amended all references to fertility throughout the manuscript, either replacing them with terms such as “progeny viability” in our experiments and in the Materials and methods section, or explaining the concept further in the revised Introduction and Discussion (e.g. “lifetime fertility” or “at the time of peak fertility”).</p><p><italic>I am also a bit worried about the temperature shift effects on fecundity: this is rather unnatural. Of course I see the reason for doing this but: (1) were there no GeneSwitch-</italic>Gal4 <italic>constructs available that could have been used to restrict silencing to the adult stage? (2) were the (wildtype) controls in these experiments also subjected to the temperature shift? Finally, as mentioned above, measuring fecundity over 6 days may not be a good, accurate predictor of (lifetime) reproductive success</italic>.</p><p>In our experience, the RU486 ligand used to activate GeneSwitch constructs can also have other effects, independent of the transgene. Depending on the genetic background, RU486 feeding of control flies causes variability in egg laying and lifespan. Indeed, concerns regarding RU effects in mated female flies in particular have been recently reported (Landis et al. (2015) Aging 7(1):53–69), and may well stem from RU interfering with this intestinal remodelling. For these reasons, we favour the use of adult-specific, temperature -inducible downregulations. In response to the reviewer’s question, absolutely, the controls are also subjected to the same temperature shifts. This is now clearly stated in the revised Materials and methods under “Fly husbandry”. Finally, the point regarding reproductive success has also been addressed as described earlier.</p><p><italic>In the subsection headed “Statistics and figure preparation”: I am confused about “assuming unequal deviances”.

(2006)</xref> Cell metabolism 3, 439–448 for details). So by quantifying GFP levels, as the Y axis of the graph shows (“Ranked GFP levels”), we obtain information about activity. We feel that it is important to highlight that we are visualising activity in the image heading so as to distinguish it from transcript levels, which we have also quantified (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). However, we acknowledge that it can be confusing and, for this reason, we are providing a more detailed explanation including the Kunte et al. reference in both the revised Results section and the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
