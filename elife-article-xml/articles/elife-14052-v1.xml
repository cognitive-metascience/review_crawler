cilia and flagella. The cAMP dynamics in these subcellular compartments are ill-defined. We introduce a novel FRET-based cAMP biosensor with nanomolar sensitivity that is out of reach for other sensors. To measure cAMP dynamics in the sperm flagellum, we generated transgenic mice and reveal that the hitherto methods determining total cAMP levels do not reflect changes in free cAMP levels. Moreover, cAMP dynamics in the midpiece and principal piece of the flagellum are distinctively different. The sole cAMP source in the flagellum is the soluble adenylate cyclase (SACY). Although bicarbonate-dependent SACY activity requires Ca<sup>2+</sup>, basal SACY activity is suppressed by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Finally, we also applied the sensor to primary cilia. Our new cAMP biosensor features unique characteristics that allow gaining new insights into cAMP signaling and unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying ciliary function <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14052.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14052.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14052.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells can change the way they grow, move or develop in response to information from their environment. This information is first detected at the surface of the cell and then the information is relayed around the interior of the cell by signaling molecules known as “second messengers”. A molecule called cAMP is a well-known second messenger that is involved in many different signaling pathways. Therefore, the levels of cAMP in specific areas of the cell need to be precisely regulated to enable different signaling pathways to be activated at specific times and locations.</p><p>Some cells have hair-like structures called cilia or flagella on their surface. Cilia and flagella are able to move the fluid that surrounds the cells or even move the cells themselves. The second messenger cAMP plays an essential role in making cilia move, but it is challenging to analyze the dynamics of cAMP – that this, how the levels of this molecule change over time – in these structures. The levels of cAMP in live cells can only be measured using fluorescent biosensors. Introducing these biosensors into specific cell structures is difficult and they are not sensitive enough to respond to low levels of cAMP. Furthermore, it is difficult to measure cAMP activity inside such tiny structures using these biosensors.</p><p>Mukherjee, Jansen, Jikeli et al. now address some of these challenges by creating a new cAMP biosensor that has several unique features. Most importantly, it can respond to very low levels of cAMP, making it more sensitive than previous biosensors. Mukherjee et al. test this new biosensor in the flagella of sperm cells from mice, which reveals how the production of cAMP is regulated in the flagellum. The new biosensor also shows that different parts of the flagellum can have different cAMP dynamics. In the future, this new biosensor could be used to study cAMP in other structures and compartments within cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14052.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14052.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cAMP</kwd><kwd>ciliary</kwd><kwd>flagella</kwd><kwd>FRET</kwd><kwd>sperm</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bonn Excellence Cluster ImmunoSensation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alvarez</surname><given-names>Luis</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaupp</surname><given-names>U Benjamin</given-names></name><name><surname>Wachten</surname><given-names>Dagmar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003390</institution-id><institution>Fritz Thyssen Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wachten</surname><given-names>Dagmar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB645 (INST 217/555-2)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strünker</surname><given-names>Timo</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaupp</surname><given-names>U Benjamin</given-names></name><name><surname>Wachten</surname><given-names>Dagmar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jansen</surname><given-names>Vera</given-names></name><name><surname>Wachten</surname><given-names>Dagmar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new FRET-based cAMP biosensor with nanomolar sensitivity makes it possible to measure cAMP dynamics in miniscule subcellular compartments like cilia and flagella.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cyclic adenosine 3’,5’-monophosphate (cAMP) controls various physiological functions, such as the heart beat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zaccolo, 2009</xref>), learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morozov et al., 2003</xref>), olfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaupp, 2010</xref>), and fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buffone et al., 2014</xref>). cAMP is synthesized by adenylate cyclases (ACs) and degraded by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Francis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanoune et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Steegborn, 2014</xref>). Local cAMP signaling is achieved by targeting of signaling components to subcellular compartments and assembly of signaling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Willoughby and Cooper, 2007</xref>). A prime example of a subcellular compartment is the cilium, where cAMP translates external stimuli into cellular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Johnson and Leroux, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Cilia come in two different flavors: primary cilia and motile cilia. A prominent example of a motile cilium is the sperm flagellum that serves as a sensory antenna and propels sperm forward. cAMP-signaling pathways control different functions during the sperm’s journey to the egg. The principal cAMP source in sperm, the bicarbonate- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive soluble adenylate cyclase SACY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Esposito et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hess et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vacquier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xie et al., 2006</xref>), is activated by increasing bicarbonate concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Luconi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wennemuth et al., 2003</xref>) after sperm are released from the epididymis. Sperm lacking SACY are immotile, which causes male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Esposito et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hess et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xie et al., 2006</xref>). The elevated cAMP levels activate protein kinase A (PKA) - the primary cAMP target in sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nolan et al., 2004</xref>). PKA activation in turn accelerates the flagellar beat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hess et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wennemuth et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xie et al., 2006</xref>). cAMP is also involved in a maturation process of sperm called capacitation that is essential for fertilizing the egg; stimulation of cAMP synthesis by bicarbonate seems to be required for protein tyrosine phosphorylation, which is a hallmark of capacitated sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Visconti et al., 1995</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these cAMP-signaling pathways in sperm are not well understood.</p><p>Components of cAMP signaling have also been identified in immotile cilia, e.g. in the specialized cilium of mammalian olfactory neurons, where cAMP stimulates the electrical signal evoked by odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaupp, 2010</xref>). Primary cilia also host several cAMP-signaling components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Johnson and Leroux, 2010</xref>): the somatostatin 3 receptor (SSTR3), various adenylate cyclases (AC3, AC4, AC6, AC8), PKA, and Epac2 (<italic><underline>e</underline>xchange <underline>p</underline>rotein directly <underline>a</underline>ctivated by <underline>c</underline>AMP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bishop et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Händel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kwon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Masyuk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ou et al., 2009</xref>). An important signaling pathway in primary cilia is controlled by Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which determines neuronal cell fate during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ericson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huangfu et al., 2003</xref>). Shh signaling relies on PKA activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tuson et al., 2011</xref>). However, the physiological function of cAMP signaling in primary cilia and the underlying molecular mechanisms are ill-defined.</p><p>Analyzing cAMP dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic> became feasible by the advent of genetically-encoded cAMP biosensors that rely on FRET (<italic><underline>F</underline>örster <underline>r</underline>esonance <underline>e</underline>nergy <underline>t</underline>ransfer</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sprenger and Nikolaev, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Willoughby and Cooper, 2008</xref>). The most advanced cAMP sensors are based on the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) of Epac1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nikolaev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ponsioen et al., 2004</xref>) or HCN channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nikolaev et al., 2006</xref>). The CNBD is sandwiched between the fluorescent donor CFP (cyan fluorescent protein) and the fluorescent acceptor YFP (yellow fluorescent protein). The K<sub>D</sub> values of the Epac1/2- or HCN2-based cAMP sensors range between 1–15 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sprenger and Nikolaev, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Willoughby and Cooper, 2008</xref>), suitable to detect basal cAMP concentrations and changes in cAMP levels in the micromolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Börner et al., 2011</xref>). In some cell systems, these sensors were able to report a cAMP increase, but their sensitivity was not sufficient to determine basal cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Börner et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The analysis of cAMP dynamics in cilia and flagella is challenging for several reasons. First, the cAMP biosensor must be targeted to this cellular compartment; second, measuring low cAMP concentrations requires the affinity of the sensor to be high, in particular, in a subcellular compartment with only a few cAMP molecules present. Finally, quantitative characterization and calibration in cilia is technically demanding due to their small size compared to the cell soma.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>dynamics have been measured in primary cilia using genetically-encoded biosensors. These studies revealed that the cilium represents a unique Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling compartment that is functionally distinct from the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delling et al., 2013</xref>). Whether cAMP signaling in cilia and flagella is also functionally distinct from the cytoplasm, is ill-defined.</p><p>Here, we describe a new FRET-based cAMP biosensor (mlCNBD-FRET) that is built from the CNBD of the bacterial <italic>Mloti</italic>K1 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nimigean et al., 2004</xref>) and binds cAMP with nanomolar affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cukkemane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peuker et al., 2013</xref>). This biosensor features unique characteristics that enable its application in solution, in cell lines, and <italic>in vivo</italic> using kinetic, fluorometric, and live-cell imaging techniques. To target the sensor to cilia and flagella, we designed a cilia-specific targeting approach, and we generated transgenic mice expressing mlCNBD-FRET exclusively in the sperm flagellum. Our results reveal that the dynamics of total and free cAMP levels in sperm and the cAMP dynamics in the midpiece and principal piece of the flagellum are distinctively different. We investigated the regulation of cAMP dynamics in sperm and obtained new insights into the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent control of cAMP synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of the mlCNBD-FRET protein</title><p>The CNBD from the bacterial <italic>Mloti</italic>K1 channel (mlCNBD) consists of a prototypical eight-stranded beta roll (β1–8) flanked by three alpha helices (αA-C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clayton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cukkemane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nimigean et al., 2004</xref>).

In the following, changes of the cerulean/citrine emission ratio (△F) are used; an increase of this ratio reflects a cAMP increase and vice versa. We characterized cAMP binding to mlCNBD-FRET by measuring the change in △F caused by increasing cAMP concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The dose-response relationship was fitted with a single binding-site model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cukkemane et al., 2007</xref>).

This demonstrates that the two fluorophores do not interfere with cAMP binding, and that the sensor detects cAMP concentrations in the low to medium nanomolar range.

Therefore, we measured the emission spectrum of mlCNBD-FRET (while exciting cerulean) at different pH values. The citrine emission peak at 529 nm increased at higher pH values and saturated at pH ≥ 7.5, whereas the cerulean emission at 475 nm was largely pH-insensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). The K<sub>D</sub> for cAMP binding was only modestly affected by changes in pH (pH 6: 101 ± 5 nM, pH 7: 98 ± 21 nM; pH 7.5: 66 ± 15 nM, pH 8: 50 ± 13; n = 3), indicating that the cAMP affinity might increase upon alkalization.

The fluorescence lifetime of the donor decreases during FRET. Because cAMP binding to mlCNBD-FRET reduces FRET, the cerulean lifetime should increase upon binding. The decay of cerulean fluorescence alone was fitted with a bi-exponential function (weighted mean of the two lifetime constants τ<sub>wm</sub> = 2.52 ± 0.09 ns,n = 12). In mlCNBD-FRET, the cerulean lifetime decreased (τ<sub>wm</sub> = 2.38 ± 0.04 ns, n = 11). Saturating cAMP (5 μM) decreased FRET and, thereby, the cerulean lifetime increased (τ<sub>wm</sub> = 2.44 ± 0.03 ns, n = 5). In summary, the mlCNBD-FRET sensor is suitable for both intensity- and lifetime-based approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Response kinetics of the FRET sensor</title><p>The response time of the sensor to rapid changes in cAMP was determined using the stopped-flow technique.

NKH477/IBMX treatment increased △F, reflecting an increase of cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Of note, the changes in citrine and cerulean emission are of opposite sign but similar time course, demonstrating that the changes in fluorescence were owing to FRET and not to fluorescence artefacts. The FRET change commenced within a few seconds after stimulation and reached a steady-state after 10 min (ratio increase: 43 ± 4%, n = 31, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). HEK293 control cells expressing the cAMP-insensitive mlCNBD-FRET-R307Q mutant did not respond (n = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We also studied whether the mlCNBD-FRET sensor reports a cAMP increase mediated by G protein-coupled receptors: stimulation with 20 µM isoproterenol, an agonist of beta-adrenergic receptors, rapidly changed △F by 47 ± 3% (n = 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). mlCNBD-FRET also reports changes in cGMP; stimulation with 3 mM SNP, which releases nitric oxide (NO) that activates soluble guanylyl cyclases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Denninger and Marletta, 1999</xref>), changed △F by 25 ± 5% (n = 36, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Similar results were obtained using cell populations: NKH477/IBMX and isoproterenol treatment both evoked a larger change than SNP (n = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). The twofold difference in the maximal changes evoked by drugs that stimulate cAMP- or cGMP-synthesis factors seems small, considering that the respective K<sub>D</sub> values differ by 10fold. Probably, at rest, the sensor is partially occupied by cAMP and stimulation with NKH477/IBMX or isoproterenol saturates the response. To test the sensor with submaximal agonist concentrations, we stimulated cells with increasing concentrations of NKH477 and analyzed the dose-response relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The EC<sub>50</sub> for NKH477 was 3.6 ± 0.6 μM (n = 4).</p><p>Moreover, we analyzed whether mlCNBD-FRET also reliably reports a decrease of cAMP levels. HEK293 cell populations were pre-stimulated with NKH477 until steady-state before permeabilizing with 1 μM digitonin to release cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In turn, the FRET ratio decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), demonstrating that mlCNBD-FRET registers both, an increase and decrease of the intracellular cAMP concentration. To rule out any unspecific effects during permeabilization, we used mlCNBD-FRET-R307Q-expressing cells as a control. Here, the FRET ratio remained constant after NKH477 stimulation; only a small decrease occurred upon addition of digitonin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, we tested the reversibility of the sensor by alternatingly stimulating with isoproterenol followed by a wash-out step. Stimulation with 500 nM isoproterenol increased the FRET ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). When reaching a maximum, the stimulus was removed and in turn, the FRET ratio decreased. Afterwards, a second stimulus of 500 nM isoproterenol was applied, which resulted in a similar increase as observed for the first stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we also tested the performance of mlCNBD-FRET in a cellular environment by two different lifetime-based techniques. First, using FLS, we calibrated the sensor with defined cAMP concentrations in permeabilized, mlCNBD-FRET-expressing HEK293 cells. The cerulean lifetime increased after cAMP addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The K<sub>D</sub> for cAMP derived from the dose-lifetime relationship was 99.0 ± 10.1 nM (n = 3), which is similar to the K<sub>D</sub> derived from fluorescence intensity-based FRET (73 ± 20 nM). Furthermore, the basal free cAMP concentration in HEK293 cells, calculated from lifetime and intensity-based measurements, was similar (48.7 ± 11.0 nM vs. 35 ± 1 nM, respectively, n = 3). To evoke cAMP changes in intact cells, cells were treated with NKH477/IBMX, which also prolonged the cerulean lifetime compared to controls (τ<sub>wm</sub> = 1.88 ± 0.04 ns vs. τ<sub>wm</sub> = 1.98 ± 0.03 ns, n = 9).</p><p>Second, we used FRET Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM). In mlCNBD-FRET-expressing HEK293 cells, the cerulean lifetime decreased as a result of FRET (τ<sub>wm</sub> =2.44 ± 0.02 ns vs. τ<sub>wm</sub> =3.28 ± 0.07 ns for cerulean only, n = 9). Upon addition of NKH477/IBMX, the cerulean lifetime increased when FRET decreased (τ<sub>wm</sub> =2.50 ± 0.02 ns, n = 9). To explore the dynamic range, we first permeabilized cells to release intracellular cAMP, followed by addition of a saturating cAMP concentration (5 μM). The shift of lifetime upon changes in cAMP is illustrated in the color-coded FLIM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). The cerulean lifetime decreased after digitonin treatment from τ<sub>wm</sub> = 2.44 ± 0.02 ns to τ<sub>wm</sub> =2.38 ± 0.04 ns (n = 8), reflecting a cAMP decrease. Upon addition of cAMP, the lifetime increased to τ<sub>wm</sub> =2.47 ± 0.05 ns (n = 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>). In summary, mlCNBD-FRET is an exquisitely sensitive biosensor for measuring cAMP dynamics in the nanomolar range, preferably using fluorescence intensity techniques, but also using lifetime-based techniques.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Expression and analysis of mlCNBD-FRET in mouse sperm</title><p>To study cAMP dynamics in sperm flagella, we generated transgenic mice expressing mlCNBD-FRET under the control of the protamine 1 promoter (<italic>Prm1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

However, total cyclic nucleotide concentrations in cells are several orders of magnitude larger than free concentrations. Moreover, large volume ratios between the soma and small compartments like flagella might obscure the extent and time course of changes in cAMP. Therefore, we compared the dynamics of total and free cAMP in sperm upon stimulation with bicarbonate. Bicarbonate (25 mM) increased the FRET ratio, reflecting an increase of the free cAMP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). cAMP commenced to rise within seconds, reached a steady-state after about 5 min, and persisted during bicarbonate stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, total cAMP levels, after a rapid rise (1 min), declined again to basal levels within 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Previous studies also reported a transient increase of cAMP during bicarbonate stimulation, although the extent and speed of recovery varied among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Battistone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenker et al., 2012</xref>). In essence, the changes in total cAMP concentration unsatisfactorily reflect the changes in free cAMP levels in mouse sperm.</p><p>Of note, we tested whether the bicarbonate-induced increase in FRET ratio reflects a change in cAMP levels and not a change in the intracellular pH<sub>i</sub>. Wild-type sperm were loaded with the fluorescent pH indicator BCECF and changes in pH<sub>i</sub> were measured after stimulation with 25 mM bicarbonate or 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl as a control. Stimulation with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, evoked a pronounced alkalization and, in turn, decreased the FRET ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The kinetics of both changes were similar, indicating that the change in FRET is evoked by the change in pH<sub>i</sub>. In contrast, stimulation with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> did not dramatically change pH<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results support the notion that the changes in FRET evoked by NaHCO<sub>3</sub> reflect changes in cAMP rather than pH<sub>i</sub>.</p><p>Expression of mlCNBD-FRET also allows spatially resolving cAMP dynamics in sperm. The mlCNBD-FRET biosensor is predominantly expressed in the flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Although the major if not only cAMP source is SACY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Esposito et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hess et al., 2005</xref>), a debate continues about the presence and function of transmembrane adenylate cyclases (tmACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buffone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vacquier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wertheimer et al., 2013</xref>), for a comprehensive discussion see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenker et al., 2012</xref>). To gain more insight, a spatio-temporal analysis of tmAC- and SACY-dependent changes in cAMP is required. Stimulation by NKH477 and bicarbonate discriminates between tmACs and SACY activity, respectively. Thus, we measured cAMP dynamics in the freely beating flagellum of mlCNBD-FRET sperm upon perfusion with 40 μM NKH477 or 25 mM bicarbonate. mlCNBD-FRET is equally distributed along the flagellum, which allows distinguishing between the cAMP dynamics in the midpiece and principal piece (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; blue and green region, respectively). Invariably, no cAMP change in either the midpiece or principal piece was detected after perfusion with NKH477 (0 ± 3%, n = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, our results rule out the presence of tmACs in the sperm flagellum. However, perfusion with bicarbonate increased cAMP levels in both, midpiece (26 ± 3% ) and principal piece (22 ± 10% ) (n = 7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To compare the response kinetics in the two compartments, individual traces were fitted using a logistic regression (Origin 9.0) and average data were plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

The analysis has been hampered by the lack of suitable tools to manipulate and analyze cAMP signaling in such a tiny cellular compartment. We set out to target mlCNBD-FRET to primary cilia. Protein import into the cilium is tightly regulated by the intraflagellar transport machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002</xref>). For targeting to cilia, we fused the mlCNBD-FRET sensor to the C-terminus of the ciliary somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Händel et al., 1999</xref>); as control, we fused a green-fluorescent protein (eGFP) to SSTR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Both constructs were expressed in IMCD3 cells, which carry primary cilia. In fact, both constructs were targeted to primary cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>). To test whether fusion of mlCNBD-FRET to SSTR3 affects the sensor properties, SSTR3-mlCNBD-FRET was expressed in HEK293 cells. Compared to mlCNBD-FRET, SSTR3-mlCNBD-FRET was localized to intracellular membranes rather than uniformly distributed throughout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B vs. 8D</xref>). Stimulation with isoproterenol (20 μM) increased the FRET ratio by approximately 25% compared to 40% for the non-tagged sensor (n = 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E vs. 8E</xref>). Thus, the SSTR3-mlCNBD-FRET fusion protein allows measuring cAMP dynamics. The functionality of mlCNBD-FRET in primary cilia of IMCD-3 cells was tested by acceptor photobleaching experiments. Upon bleaching, the cerulean emission increased (n = 11, 43 ± 21%), demonstrating that the SSTR3-fusion protein undergoes FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). In summary, mlCNBD-FRET is a versatile tool that can be used to measure cAMP dynamics with nanomolar sensitivity in solution, in different cell types, and small cellular compartments like the cilium or flagellum.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14052.015</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Targeting mlCNBD-FRET to primary cilia.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Strategy to target a protein to cilia.

The sensor is quite versatile. First, unlike any other cAMP biosensor, the purified mlCNBD-FRET protein can be used in solution. Remarkably, the properties in solution and inside cells are by and large similar. Second, mlCNBD-FRET can be selectively targeted to subcellular compartments like primary cilia or sperm flagella to directly measure cAMP dynamics. Third, the sensor exhibits a significantly improved cAMP sensitivity compared to other single-protein biosensors, e.g. Epac-based FRET sensors. Thereby, it extends the range of accessible cAMP concentrations to the low nanomolar range. In fact, other cAMP sensors are unable to quantify resting cAMP levels in some cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Börner et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, the sensor is compatible with fluorescence intensity and lifetime-based approaches. These favorable characteristics prompted us to revisit a lingering debate about cAMP signaling in sperm.</p><p>One issue concerns the presence, localization, and function of tmACs in sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buffone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vacquier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wertheimer et al., 2013</xref>); for a detailed account of pros and cons see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenker et al., 2012</xref>). SACY is the major source for cAMP in sperm and total cAMP levels in SACY<sup>-/-</sup> sperm are below the detection limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xie et al., 2006</xref>). Members of the tmAC family and the corresponding G proteins reportedly localize to the sperm head, i.e. they are spatially segregated from SACY and PKA in the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wertheimer et al., 2013</xref>). Our result that bicarbonate, but not NKH477, increases flagellar cAMP levels strengthens the notion that SACY represents the only cAMP source in the flagellum. Furthermore, considering that the head volume is much larger than that of the flagellum, our results also argue that the flagellum either is sealed up and that cAMP in the head does not propagate to the flagellum, or that NKH477-sensitive tmACs are absent altogether. A physical barrier that restricts diffusion of cAMP between midpiece and head is unlikely to exist, because Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering the flagellum via CatSper channels propagates to the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Servin-Vences et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xia et al., 2007</xref>). However, PDEs might serve as gatekeepers that prevent rapid cAMP exchange between head and flagellum.</p><p>Another conundrum concerns the relationship between cAMP signaling and tyrosine phosphorylation during capacitation. An important requisite for capacitation <italic>in vitro</italic> is bicarbonate and the ensuing rise of cAMP followed by PKA activation. PKA activity must be maintained for at least 30 min to initiate tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morgan et al., 2008</xref>), which requires 90 min to complete. However, in mice, total cAMP levels return to basal values within 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This begs the question how PKA activity is sustained when cAMP levels recover during bicarbonate stimulation. We resolve this conundrum in mouse sperm by showing that the free cAMP concentration stays up during measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, total cAMP levels do not properly reflect free cAMP concentrations in live cells. This might be due to compartmentalization of cAMP signaling in sperm, similar to what has been shown for cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zaccolo et al., 2006</xref>), or due to buffering by cAMP-binding proteins. A case in point is the rod photoreceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yau, 1994</xref>). The free cGMP concentration in the dark is approximately 1 μM, whereas most of the total cGMP content (50 μM) is bound to high-affinity sites of PDEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cote et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">1986</xref>). Light stimulation activates PDE, cGMP levels drop, and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels close, giving rise to a hyperpolarizing light response. Notably, a drop of the total cGMP concentration (maximally 50% ) requires light intensities that are orders of magnitude larger than those that saturate the light response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cote et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">1986</xref>). Likewise, the total cGMP concentration in sea urchin sperm is a few µM, whereas, at rest, the free cGMP must be ≤3 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bönigk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaupp et al., 2003</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in sea urchin sperm saturates at ≤20 pM of the chemoattractant, whereas approximately 5 nM chemoattractant are required to detect a noticeable rise of total cGMP concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaupp et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>A third issue concerns the regulation of SACY by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. SACY activity is stimulated by bicarbonate in buffer containing 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but not in low micromolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Navarrete et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wennemuth et al., 2003</xref>). Recent findings suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> has a biphasic role in the regulation of cAMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Navarrete et al., 2015</xref>): at micromolar Ca<sup>2+</sup>-conditions, bicarbonate does not stimulate PKA activity or increase tyrosine phosphorylation; however, chelating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> using EGTA in the presence of bicarbonate relieves the inhibition, stimulating PKA activity, and increasing tyrosine phosphorylation. Similarly, in CatSper1<sup>-/-</sup> sperm, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is lower than in wild-type sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ren et al., 2001</xref>), yet tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of bicarbonate is enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). One interpretation of these seemingly puzzling results suggests that bicarbonate can stimulate SACY at normal and very low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, but not at intermediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Navarrete et al., 2015</xref>). However, such a biphasic control by Ca<sup>2+</sup> has not been observed <italic>in vitro</italic>. Instead, the activity of isolated SACY protein upon bicarbonate stimulation is steadily enhanced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jaiswal and Conti, 2003</xref>). Alternatively, Ca<sup>2+</sup> might control cellular signaling downstream of cAMP. Here, we show that cAMP levels do not significantly change during bicarbonate stimulation at very low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (2 nM); thus, a bicarbonate-dependent cAMP increase is not underlying the stimulation of PKA activity and tyrosine phosphorylation under these conditions. However, under conditions that are expected to significantly lower [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, basal SACY activity is stimulated, indicating that SACY activity is controlled by a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent negative feedback that operates in intact sperm, but is absent on the isolated or heterologously expressed protein. Regulation of SACY activity via another negative feedback has been described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burton and McKnight, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nolan et al., 2004</xref>). In sperm lacking the catalytical PKA subunit Cα2, both basal and bicarbonate-stimulated cAMP levels are higher than in wild-type sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burton and McKnight, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nolan et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that PKA-dependent phosphorylation indirectly or directly down-regulates SACY activity.</p><p>cAMP-signaling components are not uniformly distributed throughout sperm: PKA and SACY are exclusively localized to the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hess et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nolan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wertheimer et al., 2013</xref>). However, even along the flagellum, cAMP signaling is compartmentalized; the cAMP dynamics stimulated by bicarbonate is different in the midpiece and the principal piece. We favor the idea that distribution and activity of PDEs is different in the midpiece and principal piece. PDE are targeted to distinct domains in sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajpai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lefièvre et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, at least two PDE isoforms and splice variants, PDE4 (cAMP-specific) and PDE1 (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent) are involved in the control of sperm motility and tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fisch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leclerc et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lefièvre et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Visconti et al., 1995</xref>). Using mlCNBD-FRET mice, it will now be possible to analyze cAMP dynamics in different subcellular compartments and unravel the mechanisms underlying the differential regulation of cAMP signaling.</p><p>Finally, primary cilia constitute a unique Ca<sup>2+</sup> compartment that is functionally distinct from the cytoplasm of the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (PKD-Like1/2) in the plasma membrane of primary cilia maintain a higher resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration compared to the cell body, despite steady Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux via the ciliary base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>). Considering that primary cilia also host cAMP-signaling components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Johnson and Leroux, 2010</xref>), we hypothesize that cAMP signaling in primary cilia might also be functionally distinct from the cell body. The combination of sensitive genetically-encoded cAMP biosensors and light-driven actuators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jansen et al., 2015</xref>) provides the high spatial and temporal resolution that is needed to unravel cAMP-signaling pathways in cilia and flagella.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning of mlCNBD-FRET</title><p>The mlCNBD cDNA sequence (cyclic nucleotide binding-domain) of the cyclic nucleotide-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel from <italic>Mesorhizobium loti</italic> (MAFF303099, mll3241) was amplified via PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cukkemane et al., 2007</xref>).

To increase the intracellular cAMP concentration, cells were stimulated for 5 min using 40 µM NKH/500 μM IBMX. As a control, 0.05% DMSO was used. To permeabilize the cells and reduce the intracellular cAMP concentration, cells were treated with 20 μM digitonin for 10 min. To measure the maximal response, cells were incubated with 5 μM cAMP. Time constants of fluorescence decay were calculated using the FLIMfit software tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Warren et al., 2013</xref>). The fitting function consisted of a double exponential decay model that was convolved with the IRF. Pixels below 20 counts were excluded from the analysis. 15x15 pixels were then binned to increase photon count and improve the accuracy of the fit. The analysis generated two time constants (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) associated with the double exponential decay. Individual amplitudes (a<sub>1</sub> and a<sub>2</sub>) reflecting the magnitude of each decay constant were used to calculate the weighted average <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for every pixel using the following equation:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy</title><p>Decay curves were recorded by Time-Correlated Single-Photon Counting (TCSPC) using the FluoTime 300 (PicoQuant). Cells in solution (10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in ES) or purified protein (1 μM) were measured in a cuvette and excited by a pulsed diode laser at 440 nm (PicoQuant) and fluorescence emission was detected at 480/20 nm. The IRF was obtained using Ludox suspension. The cerulean lifetime decay was measured for cells in ES before stimulation with 40 µM NKH/500 µM IBMX. Cells were suspended in 1 ml ES in a cuvette. To calibrate mlCNBD-FRET in cells using FLS, the decay of the cerulean lifetime was first recorded in ES followed by the addition of 20 µM digitonin to permeabilize the cells and then by addition of increasing cAMP concentrations. Fitting was performed using the PicoQuant FluoFit software. A double-exponential function was chosen for the analysis with iterative reconvolution using the IRF obtained from Ludox.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Cloning ciliary constructs</title><p>The full-length mouse SSTR3 cloned into pEGFP-N1 was kindly provided by Greg Pazour (UMass Medical School). For expression of SSTR3-tagged mlCNBD-FRET, the SSTR3 coding sequence was amplified by a recombinant PCR reaction to delete the internal <italic>NheI</italic> site. The fragment was subcloned into pc3.1-mlCNBD-FRET vie <italic>NheI/HindIII</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Acceptor photobleaching</title><p>During acceptor photobleaching, the fluorescence of the FRET donor is recorded while bleaching the FRET acceptor. IMCD-3 cells (ATCC CRL-2123, authentication method: STR profiling, mycoplasma test negative) were transfected with pc3.1-SSTR3-mlCNBD-FRET using the Neon 100 µl kit (Invitrogen) and the MicroPorator (Digital Bio) according to the manufacture’s protocol. Afterwards, cells were plated on coverslips and the experiment was performed on an inverted microscope (eclipse Ti, Nikon, Düsseldorf, Germany), equipped with EMCCD camera (iXON Ultra 897, Andor, Berlin, Germany), using 100x oil objective (CFI Apo TIRF, NA 1.49, Nikon). First, an image of the cilium was obtained in the donor channel using 405 nm laser excitation and 480/40 nm emission and an image in the acceptor channel using 488 nm laser excitation and 560/40 nm emission. Photobleaching was performed at 510/20 nm using a mercury lamp (C-LHGFIE, Nikon) for 2 min. This was followed by the acquisition of two images, one in the donor channel and another in the acceptor channel. The donor channel was compared to the images before and after acceptor photobleaching and the increase in intensity was quantified after background subtraction. The amount of bleaching was assessed by comparing citrine fluorescence before and after bleaching.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>FRET measurement using dual-view imaging</title><p>For spatial-temporal-resolved measurements, sperm from transgenic mice were imaged with a dual-view microscopic setup. Cerulean was excited at 440/20 nm (Lumencor Spectra X light engine) combined with a 438/24 nm excitation filter (Semrock). In addition, a dichroic mirror 455 nm DRLP and an additional filter with 460 nm ALP (Edmund optics, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used. Emission light was collected with an objective (40x, NA 0.95; Olympus, USA) and detected with an EMCCD Camera (iXon Ultra 897, Andor). In the dual-view emission path, a beam splitter (DV2, 515 dxcr, Mag Biosystems, Exton, PA) with a cerulean and citrine emission filter (475/28 nm and 535/50 nm, respectively; Semrock) was used. Thereby, both channels were acquired simultaneously with an acquisition frequency of 1 Hz. The resulting video was analyzed with a self-developed image analysis plugin for ImageJ. First, the citrine and the cerulean channel was registered (MultiStackReg, ImageJ). Second, the flagellum was tracked and the signal intensity of the citrine and the cerulean channel was determined along the flagellum. By using the pre-determined bleed-through value for the citrine channel (0.69 ± 0.01), changes in FRET ((emission<sub>cerulean</sub> – 0.69 x emission<sub>citrine</sub>)/emission<sub>citrine</sub>) was calculated, normalized to the baseline, and plotted versus time for each position along the arc length. The droplet separates the midpiece and the principal piece; thus, both regions were selected at a distance 5–10 µm apart from the droplet. The mean signal intensity and the standard deviation was determined in both regions for 20 µm along the arc length. The values were plotted over time and a logistic regression (Origin 9.0) was used to determine the kinetics within the two regions. The parameters of the logistic regression for different experiments were used to determine the average kinetics within the two regions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank JH Krause, R Pascal, J Hierer, D Herborn, and I Lux for technical assistance, W Bönigk for cloning, H-G Körschen for his guidance performing measurements at the FLUOstar, Greg Pazour (University of Massachusetts) for providing SSTR3-eGFP, R Braun (Jackson Laboratory) for providing the pPrCExV vector, and the transgenic service at LIMES for generating the transgenic mice.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>SM, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>VJ, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>JFJ, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>HH, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>LA, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>MD, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>MB, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>TS, Conception and design, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>RS, Conception and design, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>UBK, Conception and design, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>DW, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the LANUV (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz).

They generate transgenic mice expressing it in sperm flagellae and primary cilia. The results suggest that free cAMP in the flagellum is distinct from that in midpiece or head, and is dominated by soluble bicarbonate-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (AC10). This is a useful tool for monitoring free cAMP in sperm and cilia. This work is exciting because it represents a completely new type of cAMP sensor that doesn't rely on sequences from mammalian PKA, Epac or cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. An important feature of mlCNBD-FRET is its high affinity for cAMP. Null-point calibration estimated that resting cytosolic cAMP is around 35nM. This is perhaps the first accurate measurement of resting free cAMP, although this may reflect a mixture of resting cGMP and cAMP. Another useful feature is that the sensor protein can be isolated and used <italic>in vitro</italic> to monitor cAMP. The experiments in sperm cell and cilia nicely demonstrated the feasibility of using the probe <italic>in vivo</italic>, but these studies are preliminary and yielded less well-supported new information. All reviewers felt the paper was most appropriate as a 'Tools and Resource' paper.</p><p>1) The authors should extend the range of changes in K<sub>d</sub> for cAMP binding to pH 8, since this can be achieved in alkaline environments in sperm flagella. Also the results with 25mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub> are ambiguous. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> indicates a strange pH sensitivity of the reporter, and it's not certain how pH changes upon NaHCO<sub>3</sub> addition. A control experiment to measure pH upon NaHCO<sub>3</sub> treatment, and an independent test of FRET changes of mlCNBD-FRET using a maneuver known to change pH in a defined manner (e.g. NH3 or lactate) would be helpful. Does the cAMP-insensitive mlCNBD-FRET-R307Q respond to NaHCO<sub>3</sub>? One reviewer noted that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, D</xref>, in the experiments where [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> is manipulated, the authors interpret the changes of FRET signals as changes in [cAMP]. It is possible that the reduction/increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> also changes intracellular pH or [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], which in turn affects the FRET signal independent of changes in [cAMP] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). A simple &quot;negative&quot; control is perhaps to repeat the experiment in the presence of NKH477. The inhibitor presumably should also block the FRET changes induced by increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>.</p><p>2) The data presented indicate that mlCNBD-FRET has quite high affinity for cAMP (66nM purified protein, 73nM in situ in cells) and is saturated at around 3µM cAMP. Of note, the probe also has relatively high affinity for cGMP (504nM), which is similar to some other reporters designed expressly for this purpose. The high affinity for cAMP is very useful for assessing subtle variations in resting cAMP, but is buffering of cAMP a problem?

However, only maneuvers expected to saturate the sensor are shown. Since low affinity probes based on Epac are also saturated by these treatments that produce massive amounts of cAMP (probably 50- 100µM), it is not surprising that mICNBD-FRET also becomes saturated. It would be nice to see the response to physiological stimulation with sub-maximal agonist concentrations, and also the reversibility of the probe (not by permeabilization with digitonin, but through PDE activity). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> shows that the cAMP-insensitive mlCNBD-FRET-R307Q also demonstrates a modest decrease when digitonin is applied, calling into question whether the decreased baseline shown for the parent sensor reflects a true decrease in cAMP/cGMP below baseline.</p><p>4) The FLIM data are weak, with cerulean lifetime changes only from 2.44+/-02 to 2.38 +/-04 ns after large change in free cAMP.

The K<sub>d</sub> at pH 8 is 50 ± 13 nM, indicating that the affinity for cAMP increases upon alkalization. Of note, it has been reported for other CNBDs that the affinity for cAMP depends on the pH (Gordon et al., 1996; Kaupp &amp; Seifert, 2002).

As the reviewer also pointed out, Prm1-mlCNBD-FRET males are fertile, indicating that sperm function is not severely altered by the sensor. The flagellar beat frequency of wild-type and transgenic sperm was similar: wild-type: 8.4 ± 2.1 Hz, n = 8, 58 cells total; mlCNBD -FRET: 7.3 ± 3.0 Hz, n = 4, 40 cells total.
