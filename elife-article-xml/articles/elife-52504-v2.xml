provide a unique experimental platform of cell fate decisions during pre-implantation development, but their lineage potential remains incompletely characterized. As naïve hPSCs share transcriptional and epigenomic signatures with trophoblast cells, it has been proposed that the naïve state may have enhanced predisposition for differentiation along this extraembryonic lineage. Here we examined the trophoblast potential of isogenic naïve and primed hPSCs. We found that naïve hPSCs can directly give rise to human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) and undergo further differentiation into both extravillous and syncytiotrophoblast. In contrast, primed hPSCs do not support hTSC derivation, but give rise to non-self-renewing cytotrophoblasts in response to BMP4. Global transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analyses indicate that hTSCs derived from naïve hPSCs are similar to blastocyst-derived hTSCs and acquire features of post-implantation trophectoderm. The derivation of hTSCs from naïve hPSCs will enable elucidation of early mechanisms that govern normal human trophoblast development and associated pathologies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The placenta is one of the most important human organs, but it is perhaps the least understood. The first decision the earliest human cells have to make, shortly after the egg is fertilized by a sperm, is whether to become part of the embryo or part of the placenta. This choice happens before a pregnancy even implants into the uterus. The cells that commit to becoming the embryo transform into ‘naïve pluripotent’ cells, capable of becoming any cell in the body. Those that commit to becoming the placenta transform into ‘trophectoderm’ cells, capable of becoming the two types of cell in the placenta. Placental cells either invade into the uterus to anchor the placenta or produce hormones to support the pregnancy.</p><p>Once a pregnancy implants into the uterus, the naïve pluripotent cells in the embryo become ‘primed’. This prevents them from becoming cells of the placenta, and it poses a problem for placental research. In 2018, scientists in Japan reported conditions for growing trophectoderm cells in the laboratory, where they are known as “trophoblast stem cells”. These cells were capable of transforming into specialized placental cells, but needed first to be isolated from the human embryo or placenta itself.</p><p>Dong et al. now show how to reprogram other pluripotent cells grown in the laboratory to produce trophoblast stem cells. The first step was to reset primed pluripotent cells to put them back into a naïve state. Then, Dong et al. exposed the cells to the same concoction of nutrients and chemicals used in the 2018 study. This fluid triggered a transformation in the naïve pluripotent cells; they started to look like trophoblast stem cells, and they switched on genes normally active in trophectoderm cells. To test whether these cells had the same properties as trophoblast stem cells, Dong et al. gave them chemical signals to see if they could mature into placental cells. The stem cells were able to transform into both types of placental cell, either invading through a three-dimensional gel that mimics the wall of the uterus or making pregnancy hormones.</p><p>There is a real need for a renewable supply of placental cells in pregnancy research. Animal placentas are not the same as human ones, so it is not possible to learn everything about human pregnancy from animal models. A renewable supply of trophoblast stem cells could aid in studying how the placenta forms and why this process sometimes goes wrong. This could help researchers to better understand miscarriage, pre-eclampsia and other conditions that affect the growth of an unborn baby. In the future, it may even be possible to make custom trophoblast stem cells to study the specific fertility issues of an individual.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>naive pluripotency</kwd><kwd>primed pluripotency</kwd><kwd>trophectoderm</kwd><kwd>trophoblast stem cells</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>ATAC-seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Children's Discovery Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDI-LI-2019-819</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Solnica-Krezel</surname><given-names>Lilianna</given-names></name><name><surname>Theunissen</surname><given-names>Thorold W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>McDonnell Center for Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22-3930-26275D</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Theunissen</surname><given-names>Thorold W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH Director's New Innovator Award DP2 GM137418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Theunissen</surname><given-names>Thorold W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shipley Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program for Innovation in Stem Cell Science</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Theunissen</surname><given-names>Thorold W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012643</institution-id><institution>Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Theunissen</surname><given-names>Thorold W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Naive hPSCs can readily give rise to human trophoblast stem cells, thus demonstrating their extraembryonic lineage potential and providing a new model system to study human trophectoderm specification.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian pluripotency spans a continuum of discrete but interconvertible states, each with a distinct set of molecular and functional attributes. Prior to implantation, the pluripotent epiblast compartment within the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst constitutes a naïve or ground state of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nichols and Smith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stirparo et al., 2018</xref>). This naïve state can be captured in vitro in the form of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). After implantation, transcription factors associated with naïve pluripotency are downregulated and pluripotent cells become primed for differentiation in response to signals from the surrounding extraembryonic tissues. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) derived under conventional conditions are thought to represent a primed pluripotent state, and were shown to correspond transcriptionally to the late post-implantation epiblast in a non-human primate model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nichols and Smith, 2009</xref>). Much effort has been made in recent years to develop strategies for capturing hESCs in a naïve pluripotent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gafni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takashima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Theunissen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ware et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zimmerlin et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, two transgene-free culture systems, 5i/L/A and t2i/L/Gö, were shown to induce defining transcriptional and epigenetic features of the human pre-implantation epiblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stirparo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takashima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Theunissen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Theunissen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The isolation of naïve hESCs provides a cellular experimental platform to interrogate aspects of human pre-implantation development that are difficult to study in primed hESCs. For example, naïve hESCs have offered insights into the mechanisms governing X-linked dosage compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sahakyan et al., 2017</xref>), the role of human-specific transposable elements that are expressed in the pre-implantation embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pontis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Theunissen et al., 2016</xref>), and the mechanisms leading to activation of naïve-specific enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pastor et al., 2018</xref>). Naïve hESCs may also afford a platform for dissecting cell fate decisions in the early human embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2019</xref>). While naïve hESCs are unresponsive to direct application of embryonic inductive cues, they acquire the capacity to undergo efficient multi-lineage differentiation upon treatment with a Wnt inhibitor, a process called ‘capacitation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rostovskaya et al., 2019</xref>). This process is thought to reflect the requirement for dismantling of the naïve transcriptional program upon implantation in vivo, and the acquisition of a differentiation-competent formative phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Molecular profiling of naïve hESCs has suggested that these cells may harbor a predisposition towards human extraembryonic cell fates. Gene expression studies revealed a pronounced upregulation in naïve relative to primed hESCs of trophoblast-associated transcription factors, including <italic>ELF3, GCM1,</italic> and <italic>TFAP2C</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Theunissen et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, chromatin accessibility studies indicated that naïve hESCs share a broad panel of open chromatin sites with first-trimester placental tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pontis et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, embryonic and extraembryonic lineage markers are briefly co-expressed in the late morula and early blastocyst according to single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) studies of human pre-implantation embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petropoulos et al., 2016</xref>). This is precisely the stage of human development that displays the closest correspondence to naïve hESCs based on the expression patterns of transposable elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Theunissen et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we surmised that current methodologies for inducing naïve human pluripotency may yield a pre-implantation identity that is competent for both embryonic and extraembryonic differentiation. Here, using three independent methodologies, we find that naïve hPSCs have enhanced capacity for differentiation along the trophoblast lineage relative to primed hPSCs. In particular, we show that when cultured in human trophoblast stem cell (hTSC) media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Okae et al., 2018</xref>), naïve hPSCs can directly give rise to hTSCs, as confirmed by morphological, molecular, and transcriptomic criteria. We have also profiled the chromatin accessibility landscape of hTSCs for the first time, thus providing a valuable resource to identify potential regulatory elements and transcriptional determinants of human trophoblast development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Naïve hESCs exhibit increased trophoblast potential during embryoid body formation</title><p>As a first step toward examining the trophoblast potential of naïve and primed hESCs, we measured the expression levels of trophoblast-associated markers during embryoid body (EB) formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which provides a rapid assessment of spontaneous differentiation capacity into early lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison et al., 2018</xref>).

Finally, clusters 5 and 6 include genes that are enriched in either EVTs or STBs derived from naïve hTSCs, respectively. EVT-specific genes include <italic>FN1, HLA-G, ITGA1, ITGA5,</italic> and <italic>MMP2</italic>, while STB-specific genes include <italic>CGA, CGB1, INHA, PSG1, SDC1,</italic> and <italic>TBX3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Notably, <italic>CGA</italic> and <italic>CGB1</italic> encode the α and β chains of the placental hormone hCG, while TBX3 was recently identified as a transcriptional regulator of STB differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lv et al., 2019</xref>). EVT-specific genes are enriched in GO terms related to cell migration and invasion, while STB-specific genes are enriched in terms related to membrane fusion and interferon signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Many, if not all, of the genes highlighted in these clusters have the same specific gene expression profiles reported for primary hTSCs, EVTs, and STBs derived from human blastocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Okae et al., 2018</xref>). We conclude that the derivation of hTSCs from naïve hPSCs and their subsequent, cell-type-specific differentiation recapitulate the processes of hTSC derivation from the human embryo and its differentiation into EVT and STB cell types.</p><p>We examined whether hTSCs generated by direct derivation from naïve hPSCs share molecular signatures with human trophectoderm (TE) at pre- or post-implantation stages. In a recent study, human embryos were cultured in vitro past implantation, and single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) was performed at days 6, 8, 10, and 12 post-fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). This work identified genes that are specifically expressed in the human TE, EPI, and primitive endoderm (PE) lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). We assayed the expression of these genes in naïve and primary hTSCs, then correlated their expression patterns to that of human TE, EPI, and PE at distinct time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We found that hTSCs cluster the most closely amongst themselves, as well as with day 10 and day 12 TE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), while showing the best correlation with day 12 TE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, the hTSCs correlate poorly with the EPI or PE lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). To further uncover the genes and biological processes that contribute to the similarities between naïve hTSCs and post-implantation TE, we selected those genes that are specifically expressed in the TE or EPI at day 10 or day 12, and examined their expression in naïve hTSCs relative to naïve hPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). We observed significant correlation between naïve hTSC/naïve hPSC in vitro, and TE/EPI at day 10 or day 12 in vivo (r = 0.61) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Additionally, we performed GO term analysis on the top 10% most highly upregulated genes in naïve hTSCs relative to naïve hPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). These genes include placenta-associated factors such as <italic>CGB7, EGFR, ITGA2, LHB</italic> and multiple pregnancy-specific glyocoproteins (<italic>PSG2-6</italic>), and are enriched in biological processes such as female pregnancy, reproductive processes, and positive regulation of NF-kappa B transcription factor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This provides additional validation that the process of hTSC derivation from naïve hPSCs activates genes and pathways that are relevant to human trophoblast biology. We conclude that hTSCs derived from naïve hPSCs are comparable to <italic>bona fide</italic>, blastocyst-derived hTSCs, and are transcriptionally the most similar to human post-implantation TE at day 12.</p><p>Finally, we profiled the chromatin accessibility landscape of two naïve-hPSC derived hTSC lines and a blastocyst-derived hTSC line, BT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Okae et al., 2018</xref>), using the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq). Overall, we found ATAC-seq peaks in all three hTSC lines to be highly correlated globally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), which indicates that derivation of hTSCs from naïve hPSCs induces a similar epigenomic profile as hTSC derivation from the human blastocyst. We identified differentially accessible regions (DARs) between naïve hESCs (9,059) and naïve hTSCs (12,132), and found that naïve hESC-specific open chromatin sites are more enriched over promoter regions (1,084) and tend to be in closer proximity to the nearest transcriptional start site relative to hTSC-specific open chromatin sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). In hTSCs, only 208 DARs are located in gene promoter regions, and a higher percentage of hTSC-specific DARs are located in intronic and intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), suggesting the importance of distal regulatory elements during differentiation of naïve hPSCs into hTSCs. We further analyzed the ATAC-seq signal at the promoter regions of genes within differentially expresses genes (DEG) cluster 1 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which are genes more specifically expressed in naïve hPSCs and hTSCs, respectively. Consistent with DAR analysis, we noticed that genes in clusters 1 and 3 are associated with higher ATAC-seq signals at the promoter regions in naïve hESCs and hTSCs, respectively. However, the ATAC-seq signal at the promoter regions of cluster 3 (hTSC-specific) genes was only slightly increased in naïve hTSCs relative to naïve hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This indicates that the promoter regions of hTSC-specific genes are already accessible in naïve hESCs, which is consistent with previous findings that naïve hPSCs share open chromatin regions with first-trimester placental tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pontis et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To identify transcription factors that may differentially regulate naïve hESCs vs. naïve hTSCs, we examined enrichment for known transcription factor motifs in differentially accessible ATAC peaks. Naïve hESC-specific enrichment was observed for the POU5F1:SOX2 and KLF4 motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), consistent with the roles of these transcription factors in regulating naïve pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wong et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, we observed significant enrichment for motifs associated with TEAD4, CEBP, GATA, and TFAP2 over non-promoter regions in naïve hTSCs, while motifs associated with TFAP2, GATA, SP1, ELK1, and GRHL were enriched over promoter regions in naïve hTSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Similar motif enrichments were observed for naïve hESCs vs. BT5 hTSC DARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Among these transcription factors, TEAD4 and TFAP2 are known to be expressed in human TE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petropoulos et al., 2016</xref>), while CEBP and GATA factors have been implicated as regulators of trophoblast-specific HLA-G expression at the maternal-fetal interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferreira et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The strong enrichment of the TEAD4 binding motif in hTSCs is especially significant, as it suggests that TEAD4 may play a significant role during TE specification in both mouse and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nishioka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nishioka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yagi et al., 2007</xref>). To explore the role of TEAD4 in hTSC derivation from naïve hPSCs, we treated the cells with Verteporfin, an inhibitor that disrupts YAP-TEAD4 interactions and was recently shown to prevent cavity formation in blastocyst-like structures generated from mouse extended pluripotent stem (EPS) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Verteporfin treatment induced widespread cell death within several days when applied during hTSC derivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). We then tested the effect of Verteporfin on the maintenance of naïve hPSCs and found that it had a similar detrimental effect on viability. This suggests that YAP-TEAD4 signaling may be important for both the maintenance of naïve hPSCs and their transition into a trophoblast fate. On the other hand, these experiments may also indicate that Verteporfin is simply toxic at the examined concentration. A recent study has pointed to species-specific differences in requirements for YAP-TEAD4 signaling between mouse and human. Unlike in the mouse embryo, where YAP is nuclear in the TE and cytoplasmic in the EPI compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nishioka et al., 2009</xref>), YAP is nuclear in both the TE and EPI in human blastocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qin et al., 2016</xref>). We confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis that YAP shows nuclear localization in both naïve hPSCs and hTSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Thus, YAP-TEAD4 may contribute to both EPI and TE development in human, potentially by targeting different regulatory elements and transcription factors. In support of this interpretation, we detected ATAC-seq peaks containing TEAD4 transcription factor binding motifs at key pluripotency regulators in naive hESCs, including <italic>KLF4</italic>, <italic>NANOG</italic>, and <italic>DPPA2/4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Meanwhile, naïve hTSC-specific DARs containing TEAD4 binding motifs are enriched at loci encoding key trophoblast marker genes such as <italic>ITGA2</italic>, <italic>KRT7</italic>, and <italic>EGFR</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>), suggesting that TEAD4 is involved in hTSC specification. Hence, the transcription factor binding motifs that become enriched at open chromatin sites during hTSC derivation from naïve hESCs provide a resource for identifying candidate regulators of early trophoblast specification.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have demonstrated that naïve, but not primed, hPSCs can give rise to self-renewing hTSCs capable of undergoing further differentiation into specialized trophoblast cell types. Furthermore, by performing RNA-seq, we have shown that naïve hPSC-derived hTSCs - ‘naïve hTSCs’ are comparable with blastocyst-derived hTSCs and share the strongest transcriptional correlation with human TE at day 12 post-fertilization. By performing ATAC-seq analyses on hTSCs for the first time, we established that naïve hTSCs and human blastocyst-derived hTSCs have a similar chromatin accessibility landscape, and identified transcription factor binding motifs at sites that become accessible during hTSC derivation. We believe that this work has three major implications, as outlined below.</p><p>First, our results give insight into the lineage potential of naïve hPSCs. We previously reported that naïve hPSCs exhibit expression of transcription factors and open chromatin sites associated with the trophoblast lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pontis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Theunissen et al., 2016</xref>). Our data now provide functional evidence that naïve hPSCs indeed have enhanced potential to access trophoblast fates during both spontaneous differentiation assays and upon treatment with recently devised conditions for hTSC isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Okae et al., 2018</xref>). While naïve hPSCs can directly give rise to bipotent hTSCs, primed hPSCs instead give rise to cells with a neuroectodermal gene expression profile when exposed to the same signaling milieu. This is reminiscent of the mouse paradigm where CDX2 transgene expression allowed for mouse trophoblast stem cell (mTSC) differentiation from naïve mESCs, but not from primed mouse epiblast stem cells (mEpiSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blij et al., 2015</xref>). We propose that the enhanced, transgene-independent extraembryonic potential of naïve hPSCs is a distinctive functional attribute of naïve human pluripotency, which may reflect the co-expression of embryonic and extraembryonic genes in the human pre-implantation embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petropoulos et al., 2016</xref>). This conclusion is further corroborated by recent work demonstrating that naïve, but not primed, hPSCs can give rise to human extraembryonic endoderm (XEN) cells in response to XEN media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Linneberg-Agerholm et al., 2019</xref>). It will be instructive to define the exact time window when extraembryonic differentiation potential is acquired or lost during the interconversion between naïve and primed states. The capacity to attain an hTSC-like state does not, however, appear to be restricted to the naïve state. hTSC-like cells have also been obtained from human expanded potential stem cells (hEPSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2019</xref>), while another study reported that putative hTSCs can be derived from primed hPSCs after transition into a CTB-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mischler et al., 2019</xref>). It will be important to compare the quality of hTSCs derived from these distinct sources, and define transcriptional and/or epigenomic similarities between the various cell types that are capable of differentiation into hTSCs. Such a comparative analysis may reveal the precise molecular characteristics that impart competence for hTSC derivation.</p><p>Second, our study provides a cellular model system of early mechanisms governing human trophoblast specification. Previous methodologies for directing human trophoblast differentiation from pluripotent cells have relied on primed hPSCs treated with BMP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horii et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2002</xref>). However, primed hPSCs are most closely aligned with the late post-implantation epiblast based on scRNA-seq studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>), when TE and EPI lineages have already segregated. Primed hPSCs also have substantially elevated levels of DNA methylation compared to pre-implantation embryos, naïve hPSCs, or hTSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Okae et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Theunissen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, it has been proposed that putative CTB progenitors derived from primed hPSCs upon BMP4 treatment may actually correspond to an extraembryonic mesoderm identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernardo et al., 2011</xref>). Recent work from the Parast lab confirms that BMP4 treatment alone induces a mixture of trophoblast and mesoderm fates in primed hPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horii et al., 2019</xref>). Our data indicate that naïve hPSCs are unresponsive to BMP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), in accordance with recent findings that naïve hPSCs are recalcitrant to direct application of some lineage-inductive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rostovskaya et al., 2019</xref>), and may in fact suggest that the BMP4-mediated differentiation protocol is primed-state specific. However, unlike primed hPSCs, naïve hPSCs when cultured in hTSC media can directly give rise to hTSCs that share transcriptional signatures with human post-implantation TE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). We propose that the derivation of hTSCs from naïve hPSCs presents a novel experimental paradigm to identify early determinants of human trophoblast specification.</p><p>Our analysis of transcription factor binding motifs in open chromatin regions enriched during hTSC derivation provides a blueprint for exploring candidate regulators of this transition. Intriguingly, the TEAD4 binding motif is significantly enriched at the open non-promoter regions specific to naïve and primary hTSCs. This suggests that TEAD4 plays an important role in human TE development. It may also indicate that the HIPPO/YAP signaling pathway, a known regulator of TEAD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>), is involved in mouse as well as human TE specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nishioka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nishioka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yagi et al., 2007</xref>). However, unlike in the mouse blastocyst, YAP is also localized to the nucleus in human EPI cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qin et al., 2016</xref>), and we show here that YAP is nuclear in both naïve hPSCs and hTSCs. This points to a possible species-specific difference with HIPPO/YAP/TEAD4 signaling being involved in both TE and EPI development in human. This divergence is not unprecedented: TFAP2C, a trophoblast-specific transcription factor in mouse, was shown to play an essential role in naïve human pluripotency as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pastor et al., 2018</xref>). How HIPPO/YAP/TEAD4 signaling differentially regulates EPI versus TE development in human, and how that differs from the mouse paradigm, will be of interest for future studies.</p><p>Third, our work provides a robust methodology for a renewable, patient-specific source of hTSCs. Thus far, the isolation of hTSCs has required the use of blastocysts or first-trimester placental tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Okae et al., 2018</xref>), neither of which are readily accessible or amenable to genetic manipulation. In contrast, naïve hPSCs can be conveniently derived from any pre-existing line of hPSCs and can undergo efficient genetic modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, naïve hPSCs provide a scalable source of cellular material for hTSC derivation. Furthermore, several groups have recently described protocols for direct reprogramming of human somatic cells into naïve pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giulitti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kilens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). The derivation of naïve iPSCs from patient-specific cells and their subsequent differentiation into hTSCs may provide a pathway to uncover the genetic origins of common pathologies afflicting the trophoblast lineage, such as miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, and fetal growth restriction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-KRT7 (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell signaling</td><td valign="top">4465</td><td valign="top">1:100</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-TP63 (Goat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">R and D system</td><td valign="top">AF1916</td><td valign="top">1:20</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-TEAD4 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">ab58310</td><td valign="top">1:400</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-SDC1 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">ab34164</td><td valign="top">1:100</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-ZO1 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">33–9100</td><td valign="top">1:100</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-hCG (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">14650882</td><td valign="top">1:100</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-MMP2 (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling</td><td valign="top">40994</td><td valign="top">1:800</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-SUSD2-PE</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">327406</td><td valign="top">1:100</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-CD75-eFluor 660</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="top">50-0759-42</td><td valign="top">1:100</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-ITG6-FITC</td><td valign="top">Miltenyi</td><td valign="top">130-097-245</td><td valign="top">1:100</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-EGFR-APC</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">352905</td><td valign="top">1:20</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-HLA-G-PE</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">ab24384</td><td valign="top">1:100</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-YAP (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling</td><td valign="top">14074</td><td valign="top">1:100</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-mouse-Alexa 488</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">A-21202</td><td valign="top">1:500</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-rabbit-Alexa 647</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">A-31573</td><td valign="top">1:500</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-goat-Alexa 555</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">A-21432</td><td valign="top">1:500</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (Human)</td><td valign="top">H9 hESC</td><td valign="top">WashU GEiC</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (Human)</td><td valign="top">AN_1.1 iPSC</td><td valign="top">WashU GEiC</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (Human)</td><td valign="top">WIBR3 hESC</td><td valign="top">Whitehead Institute</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Dr. Jaenisch</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (Human)</td><td valign="top">BT5 hTSC</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Okae et al., 2018</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Drs.

EVTs or hTSCs were single cell dissociated, and seeded at density of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well into the upper chamber of Matrigel-coated transwells in 200 μl EVT basal medium or TS medium. The lower chamber was filled with 800 μl of the same type of medium containing 20% FBS. Cells were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 20% O<sub>2</sub>. After 36 hr, cells on the upper chamber were carefully removed with a cotton swab. The lower chamber was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and then stained with crystal violet. Invaded cells were imaged on a Leica DMi1 microscope. Thereafter, the stained cells from five random fields were counted to calculate the relative fold change in the number of invading cells. Student’s t test was performed for statistical analysis. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>Total RNA was isolated using the E.Z.N.A. total RNA kit I. Library construction was performed using the SMARTer Directional cDNA Library Construction Kit (Clontech, 634933). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq3000 1 × 50 platform. RNA-seq reads were aligned to the human genome hg38 with STAR version 2.5.4b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). Gene counts were derived from the number of uniquely aligned unambiguous reads by Subread:featureCount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 2013</xref>), version 1.4.6, with hg38 gene annotation ENCODE V27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrow et al., 2012</xref>). All gene-level transcript counts were then imported into the R/Bioconductor package DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Transcripts with CPM &gt; 1.0 were converted into a DESeq2 dataset and then regularized log transformed using the rlog function from the DESeq2 package. Adjusted p-values for DGE were determined by DESeq2 using the R stats function p.adjust using the Benjamini and Hochberg correction to determine the false discovery rate with a 2- fold expression change and FDR &lt; 0.05 required to consider a gene differentially expressed. Principal Component Analysis was performed using plotPCA also from the DESeq2 package and plotted using ggplot2. The differentially expressed gene lists from pairwise comparisons between conditions were merged along with their RPKMs. RPKMs were z-score scaled for each gene, and k-means clustering was performed using the kmeans function from the R stats package to separate genes into six clusters with options ‘iter.max=1000’ and ‘nstart = 1000’ specified to maximize reproducibility of clustering.</p><p>Human pre- and post-implantation embryo single cell gene expression data (transcript per million, TPM) were downloaded from GEO with accession number GSE109555 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Gene expressions of single cells in the TE, EPI, and PE lineages were further averaged for days 6, 8, 10, and 12 based on cell identification. The bulk RNA-seq gene expressions data of BT5 hTSC, naïve hTSC, and naïve hPSC were scaled to TPM and combined with the human embryo single cell gene expression data based on the common gene symbols. The expression of TE, EPI, and PE marker genes (from Zhou et al. supplemental table 5) in all the samples was isolated to calculate the Pearson correlation between all sample pairs. The correlation coefficients were plotted in R using gplots heatmap.2 function. The gene expression ratios of TE and EPI marker genes in naïve hTSC/naïve hPSC and TE/EPI (days 10 and 12) were calculated and plotted in R using gplots heatmap.2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>ATAC-seq</title><p>ATAC-seq was performed as previously described with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corces et al., 2017</xref>). Cells were harvested by TrypLE Express dissociation and centrifuged at 500 RCF for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was aspirated. Cells were washed once with cold PBS. Cell pellets were then lysed in 100 µL ATAC-seq RSB [10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>] containing 0.1% NP40, 0.1% Tween-20, and 0.01% Digitonin by pipetting up and down and incubating on ice for 3 min. 1 mL of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% Tween-20 was added and mixed with the lysis reaction. Nuclei were then pelleted by centrifuging at 800 RCF for 5 min at 4°C. Supernatant was removed, and the nuclear pellets were resuspended in 20 µL 2x TD buffer [20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20% Dimethyl Formamide]. Nuclei were counted, and 50,000 counted nuclei were then transferred to a tube with 2x TD buffer filled up to 25 µL. 25 µL of transposition mix [2.5 µL Transposase (100 nM final) (Illunina, 20034197, 16.5 µL PBS, 0.5 µL 1% Digitonin, 0.5 µL 10% Tween-20, 5 µL H2O) was then added. Transposition reactions were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 30 min with gentle tapping every 10 min. Reactions were cleaned up with the Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research, D4014). The ATAC-seq library was prepared by amplifying for nine cycles on a PCR machine. The PCR reaction was purified with Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63880) using double size selection following the manufacturer’s protocol, in which 27.5 µL beads (0.55X sample volume) and 50 µL beads (1.55X sample volume) were used based on 50 µL PCR reaction. The ATAC-seq libraries were quantitated by Qubit assays and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq platform. QC and analysis on ATAC-seq libraries was performed using AIAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). The generated peaks files for each library were merged using bedtools merge, and counts on each peak were quantified for all libraries using bedtools coverage. Differentially accessible region (DAR) analysis was performed as described above for DEG analysis on RNA-seq libraries with the following modifications: peaks with an average read density &lt; 5 CPM across all libraries were excluded and a significance cutoff of |L2FC| &gt; 1 and padj &lt; 1×10<sup>−3</sup> was required for a region to be considered differentially accessible. DARs were split based on the direction of increased accessibility and annotated using the annotatePeaks.pl function from HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). Annotated DARs were classified as promoter or non-promoter peaks DARs on their distance to the nearest transcription start site (TSS) using a cutoff of 2 kb from a TSS. Motif analysis was performed on these DARs using the findMotifGenome.pl function from HOMER with the option ‘-size given’. The transcription factor (TF) motifs were selected if the motif can be identified in at least 10% of input DARs and the matching score of TF motif is &gt; 0.9. The motif occupancy heatmap was plotted in R using pheatmap function. Promoter regions for genes from the RNA-seq k-means clustering were determined by their genomic location in the GENCODE gene annotation file (hg38, V27).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Genome Technology Access Center in the Department of Genetics at Washington University School of Medicine for help with genomic analysis.

I only have a few comments:</p><p>- A recent manuscript (Mischler et al., 2019) has reported the formation of human TSCs from primed ESCs. The authors should comment on these findings in relation to their findings.

This means that given the appropriate conditions primed human ESCs are also competent for TSC specification.</p><p>- The most problematic aspect of this manuscript is the final identity of the cells. Human TSCs derived from human blastocysts or human placentas following the protocol of Okae et al. acquire a cytotrophoblast (post-implantation) character. However, here the authors report that naïve human ESCs treated with Okae's media acquire a TE (pre-implantation) character. To support this conclusion they should compare the gene expression profile of their naïve human TSCs and the canonical human TSCs. Moreover, although they compare the naïve human TSCs to pre-implantation human embryos they are missing the comparison between naïve human TSCs and post-implantation human embryos (Zhou et al., 2019). Are the naïve human TSCs more similar to pre-implantation TE than post-implantation TE?</p><p>- The authors report that naïve human ESCs are not readily competent to respond to the BMP4 treatment, but they can respond to the human TSC medium without previous capacitation. This is a very interesting difference and the authors could comment on it further in the Discussion.</p><p>- At the end of the Introduction the authors state that they have characterized the human TSCs functionally but no functional experiments (e.g. human-mouse chimeras) are presented. The authors should remove this claim or perform the appropriate experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study demonstrates for the first time that naïve-state human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can generate trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) in culture. The work is important because it provides a compelling demonstration that functional differences exist between naïve and primed states of human pluripotency with naïve cells uniquely having the developmental capability to form TSCs. In addition, this relatively straightforward route to producing TSCs will make it much easier to study human trophoblast and other placental cell types. Overall, the study has been well carried out with appropriate methods and the use of multiple cell lines. The data are clear and mostly convincing. Current weaknesses of the manuscript are that the work stops short of using the TSCs for anything particularly new and interesting, and there are individual areas where the results need to be better supported.</p><p>1) The manuscript would clearly be strengthened if the cell model (PSC to TSC) was used to uncover new aspects of stem cell or trophoblast biology. One possibility would be to test at what point along the naïve to primed capacitation (or re-priming) process do the cells lose their capability to derive proliferative TSCs. This would tell us useful information about the timing of lineage restriction events, and this should be relatively straightforward to test. Another possibility is to focus on the role of TEAD4 in TSC specification that the authors allude to at the end of the manuscript. Along these lines, experiments aimed at uncovering the role of TEAD4 through the identification of target sites or using available small molecular inhibitors to test the requirement for TEAD4 function in PSC to TSC conversion could be suitable.</p><p>2) In the Introduction, the authors mention that naïve PSCs maintained in 5i/L/A and t2i/L/Gö have transcriptional and epigenetic features of the human preimplantation epiblast. There are also some subtle differences between naïve PSCs cultured in the two conditions, particularly related to the exact stage of human development that show the closest correspondence. Because of this, I think it is important that the authors test whether naïve PSCs maintained in t2i/L/Gö can also generate proliferative TSCs.</p><p>3) Although unlikely, it is formally possible that naive PSC cultures contain a mixed population with a small number of pre-existing trophoblast progenitor cells. Can the authors provide evidence to support or refute this possibility? Expanding single-cell naïve PSC clones and demonstrating the capability of these clonally-derived lines to form TSCs would be sufficient.</p><p>4) It would be useful to see how the naïve TSCs compare to the blastocyst-derived TSCs. The authors should add the published RNA-Seq data sets from Okae et al. into their PCA plot in Figure 4A.</p><p>5) Figure 2E: images are poor quality and it is difficult to tell if there is much signal in the cells.</p><p>6) Related to Figure 4I, if you call differentially accessible regions between blastocyst-derived TSCs versus naive PSCs and also between naive TSCs versus naive PSCs, do you get the same TF motifs? (My understanding is that current Figure 4I data show merged data sets).</p><p>7) I think some of the text could be better balanced to help interpret the results and to communicate how the various cell types might correspond to embryo development. The authors start out by showing primed PSCs undergo differentiation in response to BMP signalling, whereas naïve PSCs do not. Based on a set of markers, and in line with previous studies, the authors conclude that primed PSCs retain some capacity to form trophoblast. This has never made much sense from a developmental point of view and in some ways detracts from the more novel finding here that naïve PSCs really can make trophoblast. Whether the BMP4-treated primed PSCs are trophoblast is a matter of debate with at least one paper suggesting that they are more similar to extraembryonic mesoderm, which share many of the marker genes to trophoblast (PMID: 21816365). The other point is related to the comparisons between TSCs and preimplantation trophectoderm (TE) later in the manuscript. This is a reasonable comparison to make, but it is very unlikely that TE contain a highly proliferative trophoblast progenitor, and so I think it is important to communicate that the TSCs are not expected to align too closely with TE.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Dong and colleagues evaluates the potential of human pluripotent stem cells to give rise to trophoblast stem cells. The strengths of the study include: comprehensive evaluation of transcriptional (qPCR, RNA-seq), chromatin (ATAC-seq), and functional (self-renewal, and bipotent differentiation) readouts of the trophoblast stem cell phenotype, systematic comparison of trophoblast differentiation potential between naive and primed pluripotency starting cell states, clear and convincing presentation, and highly significant work.</p><p>The main weakness of the manuscript is that the authors did not take the opportunity to directly compare pluripotent stem cell-derived trophoblast stem cell lines with human embryo-derived stem cell lines (derived by Okae et al., 2018) in the majority of their assays (including self-renewal and differentiation potential). The authors did, however, compare chromatin states between pluripotent stem cell-derived trophoblast stem cells and embryo-derived trophoblast stem cells, which revealed numerous differences. They also compared their own RNA-seq data analyses with those published by Okae et al., which is an excellent start, but not as fleshed out as it could be. For these reasons, it is probably premature to state, as the title does, that the authors have, indeed, derived &quot;trophoblast stem cells from naïve human pluripotent stem cells.&quot;</p><p>Nevertheless, the authors present an abundance of compelling data that they have achieved something new and important.</p><p>For these reasons, I am less concerned with whether embryo-derived and stem cell-derived trophoblast stem cell lines are identical, which leads my evaluation to focus instead on addressing the question of whether the authors' major conclusions are supported by the data presented. In the Discussion, the authors state the manuscript's major conclusions:</p><p>1) Conclusion 1: Naïve, but not primed, pluripotent stem cell lines give rise to self-renewing trophoblast stem cell lines capable of undergoing differentiation to specialized cell types.</p><p>I agree with this statement with a couple of caveats. A) The authors have not shown that pluripotent stem cell-derived trophoblast stem cell lines are equivalent to bona fide, embryo-derived trophoblast stem cell lines, especially given the report that human embryo-derived trophoblast stem cell lines do not express CDX2 (Okae et al., 2018), while the authors putative trophoblast stem cell lines do (Figure 2D). The authors should address this difference and label their new cell line more carefully throughout the manuscript. B) The authors have shown that the population of apparent trophoblast stem cells can give rise to specialized cell types, but I am sure the authors would agree that they do not know whether the cells are bipotent (as stated in the subsection “hTSCs derived from naïve hPSCs have bipotent differentiation potential”) on an individual level, as they have not performed differentiation assays clonally. This distinction should be stated explicitly.</p><p>2) Conclusion 2: Naïve pluripotent stem cell-derived trophoblast stem cell lines share transcriptional similarities with preimplantation trophectoderm.</p><p>This may be true, but the transcriptional similarities are not profound (r = 0.52). How would mouse trophoblast stem cells and mouse trophectoderm transcriptomes stack up in this analysis? Additionally, I would caution the authors to consider whether a comparison between trophectoderm and epiblast, as they have performed in Figure 4E, would result in genes that are truly trophectoderm-specific. Since the authors have excluded the inner cell mass cell type called primitive endoderm from this analysis, they are not able to know to what extent the trophectoderm-specific subset is, in fact, trophectoderm-specific. Additional discussion of the nature of the genes/pathways that exhibit similar expression dynamics between embryo and ES-derived trophoblast, and their possible relevance to trophoblast biology, could help the authors make a more persuasive case.</p><p>3) Conclusion 3: Naïve pluripotent stem cell-derived trophoblast stem cell lines share chromatin similarities with embryo-derived trophoblast stem cell lines.</p><p>Again, the authors reported differences too, and it is not yet clear to me which/how many differences are important/unimportant, nor is it clear exactly which aspects of the ATAC-seq data are being correlated in Figure 4G.</p><p>I believe that the authors could address these concerns by using more balanced language, and additional computational analyses, rather than performing additional wet-lab experimentation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52504.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The majority of the suggestions raised by all three reviewers seem fairly straightforward to address with bioinformatic analyses and changes to the text.

These primary hTSCs clustered together very closely with our naïve hTSCs in the PCA analysis (Figure 4A). In addition, naïve hTSCs displayed similar or elevated expression of key trophoblast marker genes as compared to primary hTSCs (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). High similarity between naïve and BT5 hTSCs had also been shown in regard to chromatin accessibility landscape (Figure 4F). We conclude that naïve hTSCs have a very similar gene expression profile compared to primary, blastocyst-derived hTSCs.</p><p>2) We also compared our naïve hTSCs to the Zhou et al. scRNA-seq dataset, which contains both pre- and post-implantation human TE, EPI, and PE samples. We found that naïve and primary hTSCs cluster the most closely amongst themselves, as well as with day 10 and day 12 TE (Figure 4E). The hTSCs do not share many common transcriptomic characteristics with the EPI or PE lineages (Figure 4E). This analysis revealed the most significant correlation between naïve hTSCs and day 12 TE (Figure 4E and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B), which has a post-implantation identity.</p><p>We have modified our manuscript in light of these new data to reflect the conclusion that naïve hTSCs adopt a bona fide hTSC fate as reported by Okaeet al., and possess a post-implantation identity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript is very well written, the data is clearly presented, the conclusions are well supported by the experimental data and the findings will be very relevant to the stem cell community.

It will also be important to compare the quality of hTSCs derived from these distinct sources, and define transcriptional and/or epigenomic similarities between the various cell types that are capable of differentiation into hTSCs. Such a comparative analysis may reveal the precise molecular characteristics that impart competence for hTSC derivation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The most problematic aspect of this manuscript is the final identity of the cells.

As we mentioned above in response to Essential revisions, we have modified our manuscript in light of these new data to reflect the conclusion that naïve hTSCs are highly similar to bona fide hTSCs as reported by Okaeet al., and possess a post-implantation identity that most closely resembles day 12 TE according to the scRNA-seq analysis performed by Zhou et al.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors report that naïve human ESCs are not readily competent to respond to the BMP4 treatment, but they can respond to the human TSC medium without previous capacitation. This is a very interesting difference and the authors could comment on it further in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and commented on this observation in the third paragraph of the Discussion: “It has been proposed that putative CTB progenitors derived from primed hPSCs following BMP4 treatment may actually correspond to a mesodermal phenotype (possibly extraembryonic mesoderm) (Bernardo et al., 2011). […] Our data indicate that naïve hPSCs are unresponsive to BMP4 treatment (Figure 1C), and may in fact suggest that the BMP4-mediated differentiation protocol is primed-state specific.” This is consistent with recent findings from the Smith laboratory that naïve hPSCs require exit from the naïve state before acquiring the capacity to respond to embryonic lineage cues (Rostovskaya et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- At the end of the Introduction the authors state that they have characterized the human TSCs functionally but no functional experiments (e.g. human-mouse chimeras) are presented. The authors should remove this claim or perform the appropriate experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have removed this claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This study demonstrates for the first time that naïve-state human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can generate trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) in culture. The work is important because it provides a compelling demonstration that functional differences exist between naïve and primed states of human pluripotency with naïve cells uniquely having the developmental capability to form TSCs. In addition, this relatively straightforward route to producing TSCs will make it much easier to study human trophoblast and other placental cell types. Overall, the study has been well carried out with appropriate methods and the use of multiple cell lines. The data are clear and mostly convincing. Current weaknesses of the manuscript are that the work stops short of using the TSCs for anything particularly new and interesting, and there are individual areas where the results need to be better supported.</p><p>1) The manuscript would clearly be strengthened if the cell model (PSC to TSC) was used to uncover new aspects of stem cell or trophoblast biology. One possibility would be to test at what point along the naïve to primed capacitation (or re-priming) process do the cells lose their capability to derive proliferative TSCs. This would tell us useful information about the timing of lineage restriction events, and this should be relatively straightforward to test. Another possibility is to focus on the role of TEAD4 in TSC specification that the authors allude to at the end of the manuscript. Along these lines, experiments aimed at uncovering the role of TEAD4 through the identification of target sites or using available small molecular inhibitors to test the requirement for TEAD4 function in PSC to TSC conversion could be suitable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions, and performed several experiments to begin to explore the role of YAP-TEAD4 in hTSC specification. Verteporfin, a YAP inhibitor that disrupts YAP-TEAD4 interactions, was recently shown to prevent cavity formation in mouse extended pluripotent stem (EPS) cell derived blastoids (EPS-blastoids) (Li et al., 2019). Therefore, we asked whether Verteporfin also affects the derivation of hTSCs from naïve hPSCs. Verteporfin treatment induced widespread cell death within several days when applied during hTSC derivation (Figure 4—figure supplement 2D). We then tested the effect of Verteporfin on the maintenance of naïve hPSCs, and found that it had a similar detrimental effect on viability. This suggests that YAP-TEAD4 signaling is important for the maintenance of naïve hPSCs and possibly also during their transition into a trophoblast fate. These findings may point to species-specific differences in requirements for YAP-TEAD4 signaling between mouse and human. Unlike in the mouse embryo, where YAP is nuclear in the TE and cytoplasmic in the EPI compartment (Nishioka et al., 2009), YAP is nuclear in both the TE and EPI in human blastocysts (Qin et al., 2016). We confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis that YAP shows nuclear localization in both naïve hPSCs and hTSCs (Figure 4—figure supplement 2E). Thus, YAP-TEAD4 may contribute to both EPI and TE development in human, potentially by targeting different regulatory elements and transcription factors. In support of this interpretation, we detected ATAC-seq peaks containing TEAD4 transcription factor binding motifs at key pluripotency regulators in naive hESCs, including <italic>KLF4, NANOG</italic>, and <italic>DPPA2/4</italic> (Figure 4C; Supplementary file 5). Meanwhile, naïve hTSC-specific DARs containing TEAD4 binding motifs are enriched at loci encoding key trophoblast marker genes such as <italic>ITGA2, KRT7</italic>, and <italic>EGFR</italic> (Supplementary file 6), suggesting that TEAD4 is involved in hTSC specification. This divergence is not unprecedented: TFAP2C, which is a trophoblast-specific transcription factor in mouse, was shown to play an essential role in naïve human pluripotency as well (Pastor et al., 2018). How HIPPO/YAP/TEAD4 signaling differentially regulates EPI versus TE development in human, and how that differs from the mouse paradigm, will be of interest for future studies.</p><p>With respect to the reviewer’s other suggestion, we agree that it will be of interest to define the exact time window when competence for hTSC derivation is acquired and lost during the interconversion between naïve and primed states, and have incorporated a statement to this effect in the second paragraph of the Discussion. In this regard, we also discuss emerging reports that both EPS cells (Gao et al., 2019), and CTB-like cells generated from primed cells (by Mischler et al., 2019) seem to have the potential to give rise to hTSC-like cells. By defining transcriptional and/or epigenomic characteristics shared between naïve hPSCs and these cell types, we may be able to pinpoint what confers competence for hTSC derivation at the molecular level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the Introduction, the authors mention that naïve PSCs maintained in 5i/L/A and t2i/L/Gö have transcriptional and epigenetic features of the human preimplantation epiblast. There are also some subtle differences between naïve PSCs cultured in the two conditions, particularly related to the exact stage of human development that show the closest correspondence. Because of this, I think it is important that the authors test whether naïve PSCs maintained in t2i/L/Gö can also generate proliferative TSCs.</p></disp-quote><p>In agreement, we have cultured naïve hPSCs in PXGL, the most recent media formulation for naïve hPSC culture from the Smith laboratory (Bredenkamp et al., 2019b), for 8 passages, then cultured them in hTSC medium. The PXGL-derived naïve hTSCs resemble blastocyst-derived and 5i/LA-derived hTSCs morphologically (Figure 2—figure supplement 1G), are double positive for hTSC surface marker ITGA6 and EGFR (Figure 2—figure supplement 1H), express trophoblast marker gene mRNA at approximately the same level as naïve hTSCs derived from 5i/LA (Figure 2—figure supplement 1I), and show positive immunostaining for trophoblast markers (Figure 2—figure supplement 1J). These data suggest that naïve hTSC-derivation is likely an intrinsic property of naïve hPSCs, regardless of the specific culture conditions used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Although unlikely, it is formally possible that naive PSC cultures contain a mixed population with a small number of pre-existing trophoblast progenitor cells. Can the authors provide evidence to support or refute this possibility? Expanding single-cell naïve PSC clones and demonstrating the capability of these clonally-derived lines to form TSCs would be sufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful suggestion. We picked and expanded 3 single-cell naïve hPSC clones, A1, A2, and A3 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A). We confirmed their naïve molecular characteristics and their lack of hTSC marker expression (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, C). Subsequently, naïve hTSCs were derived from these clonally expanded naïve hPSCs. All of these clonally derived naïve hTSCs exhibit a typical hTSC morphology (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A), and are negative for naïve hPSC markers but positive for hTSC markers (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, C). The results lend further support to the notion that the ability to give rise to hTSCs is an intrinsic property of naïve hPSCs, rather than representing the expansion of a small population of pre-existing trophoblast-like cells in the culture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would be useful to see how the naïve TSCs compare to the blastocyst-derived TSCs. The authors should add the published RNA-Seq data sets from Okae et al. into their PCA plot in Figure 4A.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment and have now performed RNA-seq analysis on the blastocyst-derived BT5 line from Okae et al., 2018. As we mentioned above under Essential Revisions, naïve hTSCs and primary hTSCs are closely clustered together in the PCA analysis (Figure 4A). In addition, naïve hTSCs displayed comparable or elevated expression of key trophoblast marker genes as primary hTSCs (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). High similarity between naïve and BT5 hTSCs had also been shown in regard to chromatin accessibility landscape (Figure 4F). We conclude that naïve hTSCs have a very similar gene expression and chromatin accessibility profile compared to primary, blastocyst-derived hTSCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 2E: images are poor quality and it is difficult to tell if there is much signal in the cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now used better quality images in Figure 2E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Related to Figure 4I, if you call differentially accessible regions between blastocyst-derived TSCs versus naive PSCs and also between naive TSCs versus naive PSCs, do you get the same TF motifs? (My understanding is that current Figure 4I data show merged data sets).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. Now we have performed transcription factor binding motif analysis on differentially accessible regions specific to naïve hESCs vs. naïve hTSCs as well as naïve hESCs vs. BT5 hTSCs (Figure 4G). Highly similar motif enrichments were observed for naïve hTSCs and BT5 hTSCs (Figure 4G), which further corroborates their common identity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) I think some of the text could be better balanced to help interpret the results and to communicate how the various cell types might correspond to embryo development. The authors start out by showing primed PSCs undergo differentiation in response to BMP signalling, whereas naïve PSCs do not. Based on a set of markers, and in line with previous studies, the authors conclude that primed PSCs retain some capacity to form trophoblast. This has never made much sense from a developmental point of view and in some ways detracts from the more novel finding here that naïve PSCs really can make trophoblast. Whether the BMP4-treated primed PSCs are trophoblast is a matter of debate with at least one paper suggesting that they are more similar to extraembryonic mesoderm, which share many of the marker genes to trophoblast (PMID: 21816365). The other point is related to the comparisons between TSCs and preimplantation trophectoderm (TE) later in the manuscript. This is a reasonable comparison to make, but it is very unlikely that TE contain a highly proliferative trophoblast progenitor, and so I think it is important to communicate that the TSCs are not expected to align too closely with TE.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these helpful comments, and have performed more analysis and modified our text accordingly.</p><p>In the third paragraph of the Discussion, we stated that it has been proposed that putative CTB progenitors derived from primed hPSCs following BMP4 treatment may actually correspond to an extraembryonic mesoderm identity (Bernardo et al., 2011). A recent study from the Parast lab confirms that BMP4 treatment of primed hPSCs gives rise to a mixture of trophoblast and mesoderm cells (Horii et al., 2019). Our data indicate that naïve hPSCs are unresponsive to BMP4 treatment (Figure 1C), and may in fact suggest that the BMP4-mediated differentiation protocol is primed-state specific and does not allow for bona fide trophoblast differentiation.</p><p>We also compared our naïve hTSCs to the Zhou et al. scRNA-seq dataset, which contains both pre- and post-implantation human TE, EPI, and PE samples. This analysis revealed the most significant correlation between naïve hTSCs and day 12 TE (Figure 4E and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B), which has a post-implantation identity. In light of this, we have revised our interpretation to reflect that hTSCs most likely acquire a post-implantation trophoblast identity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The main weakness of the manuscript is that the authors did not take the opportunity to directly compare pluripotent stem cell-derived trophoblast stem cell lines with human embryo-derived stem cell lines (derived by Okae et al., 2018) in the majority of their assays (including self-renewal and differentiation potential). The authors did, however, compare chromatin states between pluripotent stem cell-derived trophoblast stem cells and embryo-derived trophoblast stem cells, which revealed numerous differences. They also compared their own RNA-seq data analyses with those published by Okae et al., which is an excellent start, but not as fleshed out as it could be. For these reasons, it is probably premature to state, as the title does, that the authors have, indeed, derived &quot;trophoblast stem cells from naïve human pluripotent stem cells.&quot;</p><p>Nevertheless, the authors present an abundance of compelling data that they have achieved something new and important.</p><p>For these reasons, I am less concerned with whether embryo-derived and stem cell-derived trophoblast stem cell lines are identical, which leads my evaluation to focus instead on addressing the question of whether the authors' major conclusions are supported by the data presented. In the Discussion, the authors state the manuscript's major conclusions:</p><p>1) Conclusion 1: Naïve, but not primed, pluripotent stem cell lines give rise to self-renewing trophoblast stem cell lines capable of undergoing differentiation to specialized cell types.</p><p>I agree with this statement with a couple of caveats. A) The authors have not shown that pluripotent stem cell-derived trophoblast stem cell lines are equivalent to bona fide, embryo-derived trophoblast stem cell lines, especially given the report that human embryo-derived trophoblast stem cell lines do not express CDX2 (Okae et al., 2018), while the authors putative trophoblast stem cell lines do (Figure 2D). The authors should address this difference and label their new cell line more carefully throughout the manuscript. B) The authors have shown that the population of apparent trophoblast stem cells can give rise to specialized cell types, but I am sure the authors would agree that they do not know whether the cells are bipotent (as stated in the subsection “hTSCs derived from naïve hPSCs have bipotent differentiation potential”) on an individual level, as they have not performed differentiation assays clonally. This distinction should be stated explicitly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. (A) As shown in Figure 2D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, our naïve hTSCs do NOT express CDX2, just as reported for primary hTSCs by Okae et al. This is a further indication that these cells acquire a post-implantation trophoblast identity, since CDX2 is expressed in human pre-implantation TE (Petropoulos et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2019). (B) We fully agree, and now state this caveat in the subsection “Global transcriptome and chromatin accessibility profiles of hTSCs derived from naïve hPSCs”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Conclusion 2: Naïve pluripotent stem cell-derived trophoblast stem cell lines share transcriptional similarities with preimplantation trophectoderm.</p><p>This may be true, but the transcriptional similarities are not profound (r = 0.52). How would mouse trophoblast stem cells and mouse trophectoderm transcriptomes stack up in this analysis? Additionally, I would caution the authors to consider whether a comparison between trophectoderm and epiblast, as they have performed in Figure 4E, would result in genes that are truly trophectoderm-specific. Since the authors have excluded the inner cell mass cell type called primitive endoderm from this analysis, they are not able to know to what extent the trophectoderm-specific subset is, in fact, trophectoderm-specific. Additional discussion of the nature of the genes/pathways that exhibit similar expression dynamics between embryo and ES-derived trophoblast, and their possible relevance to trophoblast biology, could help the authors make a more persuasive case.</p></disp-quote><p>In agreement, we performed additional analysis to compare our naïve hTSCs to the scRNA-seq dataset from Zhou et al., 2019, which includes pre- and post-implantation TE, EPI, and PE samples. Marker genes of all three lineages as published by Zhou et al. were used for this analysis. We found that naïve hTSCs and primary hTSCs cluster the most closely amongst themselves, as well as with day 10 and day 12 TE (Figure 4E), and thus with post-implantation trophectoderm. The correlation between naïve hTSC/hPSC expression in vitro and TE/EPI expression at day 10 or day 12 in vivo increases to r = 0.61 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). We should note that due to many variables, including library preparation methods, sequencing platforms, and bulk vs. single cell RNA-seq differences, the hTSCs in our study are not expected to correlate perfectly with in vivo trophoblast. This analysis also revealed clearly that hTSCs correlate very poorly with either EPI or PE lineages (Figure 4E).</p><p>To further uncover the genes and biological processes that contribute to the similarities between naïve hTSCs and post-implantation TE, we first compiled a list of genes that are specifically expressed in either TE or EPI at day 10 or day 12 of human development (Zhou et al., 2019), which are the stages with which naïve hTSCs showed the strongest correlation (Figure 4E). We then performed gene ontology (GO) analysis on the top 10% most highly upregulated genes in naïve hTSCs relative to naïve hPSCs (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and Supplementary file 4). The most enriched biological processes in naïve hTSCs include female pregnancy, reproductive processes, and positive regulation of NF-kappa B transcription factor activity (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). This provides additional validation that the process of hTSC derivation from naïve hPSCs activates genes and pathways that are relevant to human trophoblast biology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Conclusion 3: Naïve pluripotent stem cell-derived trophoblast stem cell lines share chromatin similarities with embryo-derived trophoblast stem cell lines.</p><p>Again, the authors reported differences too, and it is not yet clear to me which/how many differences are important/unimportant, nor is it clear exactly which aspects of the ATAC-seq data are being correlated in Figure 4G.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 4F (original Figure 4G), all accessible chromatin regions are being correlated, and we rephrased the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Global transcriptome and chromatin accessibility profiles of hTSCs derived from 250 naïve hPSCs” to remove any ambiguity. As shown by the dendrogram in Figure 4F, AN naïve hTSCs are more closely correlated with BT5 hTSCs than with H9 naïve hTSCs, suggesting that naïve- and blastocyst-derived hTSCs have highly similar chromatin accessibility landscapes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I believe that the authors could address these concerns by using more balanced language, and additional computational analyses, rather than performing additional wet-lab experimentation.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
