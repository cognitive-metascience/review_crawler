marine algae blooms. Such blooms can trigger secondary blooms of planktonic bacteria that consist of swift successions of distinct bacterial clades, most prominently members of the <italic>Flavobacteriia, Gammaproteobacteria</italic> and the alphaproteobacterial <italic>Roseobacter</italic> clade. We investigated such successions during spring phytoplankton blooms in the southern North Sea (German Bight) for four consecutive years. Dense sampling and high-resolution taxonomic analyses allowed the detection of recurring patterns down to the genus level. Metagenome analyses also revealed recurrent patterns at the functional level, in particular with respect to algal polysaccharide degradation genes. We, therefore, hypothesize that even though there is substantial inter-annual variation between spring phytoplankton blooms, the accompanying succession of bacterial clades is largely governed by deterministic principles such as substrate-induced forcing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11888.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11888.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11888.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Small algae in the world's oceans remove about as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as land plants. These algae do not grow continuously, but often surge in numbers during temporary blooms. Such blooms can be large enough to be seen from space by satellites. The lifespan of algae within such blooms is short, and when they die, marine bacteria feed on the remnants, which releases much of the stored carbon dioxide.</p><p>Much of an algal cell consists of different types of polysaccharides. These large molecules are essentially made from sugars linked together. Polysaccharides are varied molecules and can contain many different sugars that can be linked in a number of different ways. During algae blooms bacteria proliferate that are specialized in the degradation of these polysaccharides. In 2012, researchers reported how over the progression of an algae bloom different groups of marine bacteria bloomed in rapid succession. However, it remained unknown whether the same or different groups of bacteria respond to algae blooms at the same place from year to year, and whether or not these bacteria use the same enzymes to degrade the polysaccharides.</p><p>Teeling, Fuchs et al. – who include many of the researchers from the 2012 study – now report on the analysis of a series of algae blooms that occurred in the southern North Sea between 2009 and 2012. The analysis is based on samples collected every week during the spring seasons, and shows that certain groups of related bacteria, known as clades, became common during each bloom. Teeling, Fuchs et al. also found indications that the clades that repeatedly occurred had similar sets of genes for degrading algal polysaccharides, but that the sets were different between the clades.</p><p>These data suggest that there is a specialized bacterial community that together can degrade the complex mixture of algal polysaccharides during blooms. This community reappears each year with an unexpectedly low level of variation. Since different species of algae made up the blooms in each year, this finding suggests that the major polysaccharides in these algae are similar or even identical.</p><p>Future work will focus on the specific activities of bacterial enzymes that are needed to degrade polysaccharides during algae blooms. Study of these enzymes in the laboratory will help to resolve, which polysaccharides are attacked in which manner, and to ultimately help to identify the most abundant algal polysaccharides. This will improve our current understanding of the carbon cycle in the world’s oceans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11888.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11888.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>marine bacterioplankton</kwd><kwd>marine phytoplankton</kwd><kwd>marine microbial biodiversity</kwd><kwd>bacterial decomposition</kwd><kwd>algal biomass</kwd><kwd>blooms</kwd><kwd>marine carbon cycling</kwd><kwd>coastal shelf spring phytoplankton blooms</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amann</surname><given-names>Rudolf I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dynamic successive blooms of clades of planktonic marine bacteria that can be observed during blooms of marine algae follow discernible patterns, part of which might be explained by substrate-induced forcing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pelagic zones of the world's oceans seemingly constitute rather homogenous habitats, however, they feature enough spatial and temporal variation to support a large number of species with distinct niches. This phenomenon has been termed 'paradox of the plankton' by G. Evelyn Hutchinson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hutchinson, 1961</xref>). Interactions within planktonic microbial communities are manifold and complex (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., (2012)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Worden et al. (2015)</xref> for reviews). Still, planktonic microbial communities are simple in comparison to benthic or terrestrial soil communities and thus particularly suitable for the study of microbial community composition dynamics. In recent years, continuous biodiversity studies at long-term sampling stations have started to reveal discernible deterministic patterns within marine microbial plankton communities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuhrman et al. (2015)</xref> for a recent review). This is particularly true for less dynamic oligotrophic oceanic regions that are dominated by the members of the alphaproteobacterial <italic>Pelagibacteriaceae</italic> (SAR11 clade) and the cyanobacterial <italic>Prochlorococcaceae (Prochlorococcus marinus</italic>). By contrast, more dynamic eutrophic coastal regions are subject to frequent system perturbations and thus seldom in a state of equilibrium. This can lead to apparently stochastic changes in bacterioplankton community composition. To capture recurrence of biodiversity patterns in such coastal areas, sampling must occur at the order of weekly to sub-weekly time scales over multiple years. Owing to the lack of such intensively sampled long-term time series data, our current understanding of the extent and predictability of recurring microbial biodiversity patterns for such marine habitats is still limited.</p><p>A particularly important connection in the marine carbon cycle exists between marine microalgae as primary producers and heterotrophic bacteria that feed on algal biomass. Global photosynthetic carbon fixation is estimated to exceed 100 Gigatons yearly, of which marine algae contribute about half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falkowski et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Field et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sarmento and Gasol, 2012</xref>). Planktonic uni- to pluricellular algae such as diatoms, haptophytes, and autotrophic dinoflagellates are the most important marine primary producers. Diatoms alone are estimated to contribute 20–40% to global carbon fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nelson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armbrust, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Primary production by planktonic microalgae differs from primary production by sessile macroalgae or land plants as it is much less constant, but culminates in blooms that are often massive, as occurs worldwide during spring blooms from temperate to polar regions. These blooms are highly dynamic phenomena that are time-limited by nutrients, predator grazing and viral infections. Bloom termination results in a short-lived massive release of algal organic matter that is consumed by dedicated clades of heterotrophic bacterioplankton. This trophic connection leads to synchronized blooms of planktonic bacteria during phytoplankton blooms, as has been described in various studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell and Kuparinen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Niu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teeling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The activities of these heterotrophic bacteria impact the proportion of algal biomass that is directly mineralized and released back into the atmosphere mostly as carbon dioxide, and the algae-derived biomass that sinks out to the bottom of the sea as carbonaceous particles. These are further remineralized by particle-associated bacteria while sinking and by benthic bacteria when reaching the sediment, even in the deep sea (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ruff et al., 2014</xref>). The remainder is buried for a long time as kerogen and forms the basis for future oil and gas reservoirs. The ratio between bacterial mineralization and burial of algae-derived organic matter thus has a profound influence on the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falkowski et al., 1998</xref>). However, the bulk of bacteria during phytoplankton blooms are free-living and not attached to particles or algae. These bacteria play a pivotal role in the mineralization of algae-derived non-particulate dissolved organic matter (DOM).</p><p>The bacterial clades that respond most to phytoplankton blooms belong to the classes <italic>Flavobacteriia</italic> (phylum <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>) and <italic>Gammaproteobacteria,</italic> and the <italic>Roseobacter</italic> clade within class <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchan et al., 2014</xref>). This response is typically not uniform, but consists of a series of distinct clades that bloom one after another. In the year 2009, we investigated the response of bacterioplankton to a diatom-dominated spring phytoplankton bloom in the German Bight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teeling et al., 2012</xref>). Within the free-living bacteria (0.2 to 3 µm) we observed a swift succession of bacterial clades that were dominated by <italic>Flavobacteriia</italic> and <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>, with consecutively blooming <italic>Ulvibacter (Flavobacteriia), Formosa (Flavobacteriia), Reinekea (Gammaproteobacteria), Polaribacter (Flavobacteriia)</italic> genera and SAR92 (<italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>) as prominent clades.</p><p>Using time-series metagenome and metaproteome analyses, we demonstrated that the substrate-spectra of some of these clades were notably distinct. The succession of bacterioplankton clades hence constituted a succession of distinct gene function repertoires, which suggests that changes in substrate availability over the course of the bloom were among the forces that shaped the bacterioplankton community. Dominance of bottom-up over top-down control is assumed to be characteristic for the initial phases of spring phytoplankton blooms. After winter, inorganic nutrients are aplenty, and the overall abundance of microbes is low. When suitable temperature and sunlight conditions are met in spring, algae and subsequently bacteria can enter an almost unrestricted proliferation. In contrast, predators such as flagellates, protists and zooplankton can only start proliferating when their food sources are available in larger numbers. Hence, top-down control by predation sets in only during later bloom phases. This situation is distinct from summer and fall phytoplankton blooms.</p><p>Pronounced differences between blooming clades were found in the gene frequencies and protein expression profiles of transporters and carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantarel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lombard et al., 2014</xref>]), such as glycoside hydrolase (GH), polysaccharide lyase (PL), carbohydrate esterase (CE), or carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) containing genes. The latter indicates a pronounced niche partitioning with respect to algal polysaccharide degradation. Marine algae produce large quantities of distinct polysaccharides, for example storage, cell matrix and cell wall constituents, or as part of extracellular transparent exopolymer particles (TEP). It has been recently shown that in particular <italic>Flavobacteriales</italic> and <italic>Rhodobacterales</italic> respond to TEP availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>). The diversity of algal polysaccharides is too high for a single bacterial species to harbor all the genes required for the complete degradation of all naturally occurring variants. Thus, polysaccharide-degrading bacteria specialize on dedicated subsets of polysaccharides, which is why the decomposition of algal polysaccharides during and after algal blooms is a concerted effort among distinct bacterial clades with distinct glycan niches (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xing et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we provide evidence that the succession of bacterioplankton clades that we reported for the 2009 North Sea spring phytoplankton bloom re-occurred during the spring blooms from 2010 to 2012. We tested whether the bacterioplankton clades and their associated CAZyme repertoires differ from year to year or exhibit recurrent patterns. We analyzed spring bacterioplankton community composition via 16S rRNA catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) and 16S rRNA gene tag sequencing, as well as gene function repertoires by deep metagenome sequencing. Our efforts have culminated into the as of yet highest resolved dataset capturing the response of planktonic bacteria to marine spring phytoplankton blooms and have allowed identification of recurring patterns that might ultimately lead to an explanatory model for bacterioplankton succession dynamics during spring algae blooms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sampling site characteristics</title><p>The samples were taken at Helgoland Island about 40 km offshore in the southeastern North Sea in the German Bight at the station 'Kabeltonne' (54° 11.3' N, 7° 54.0' E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) between the main island and the minor island, Düne (German for 'dune').

While most of these families comprise a diverse range of functions, they are indicative for the hydrolysis of certain glucans, xylans, mannans (GH92), cellulose (GH5), fucans (GH29), and peptidoglycan (GH23, 103, 73, and 18). The abundant families GH3, 16, 17 and 5 comprise β-1,3-glucanases and the family GH30 β-1,6-glucanases. Both enzymes are involved in the cleavage of chrysolaminarin. Chrysolaminarin, a mostly linear β-1,3-glucan with occasional β-1,6 branches, is the storage polysaccharide in diatoms and thus one of the most abundant polysaccharides on Earth.</p><p>The ten families of carbohydrate-binding modules with the highest mean abundances during blooms were, in descending order, CBM50, 32, 6, 9, 48, 11, 22, 57, 20, and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These CBM domains are indicative for the binding of peptidoglycan (CBM50), galactans (CBM32), glycogen (CBM48), β-1,3- and β-1,4-glucans (CBM6, 11, 4), xylan (CBM6, 9, 22, 4), and cellulose (CBM6, 4). This suggests a pronounced specialization of the bacterial community in the acquisition of storage polysaccharides (β-1,3-glucans such as chrysolaminarin; α-1,4-glucans such as starch and glycogen) and cell wall polysaccharides (xylose, cellulose and peptidoglycan) of both algae and bacteria. By contrast, CBMs for the binding of algal TEP, which consists predominantly of fucose- and rhamnose-rich anionic sulfated heteropolysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Passow, 2002</xref>), were only found in lower abundances, e.g. CBM47 (fucose) and CBM67 (rhamnose).</p><p>Among carbohydrate esterase families, CE11, 4, 1, and 14 exhibited the highest mean abundances during blooms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). The only known function for family CE11 is that of the UDP-3-O-acyl-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase, an enzyme involved in lipid A biosynthesis. The second and third most abundant CE families 4 and 1 comprise a number of enzymatic functions including deacetylation of peptidoglycan, xylan, and chitin.</p><p>Finally, the polysaccharide lyase families PL6, 7, 17 and 5 constituted the most abundant PL families during bloom dates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Known members of these PL families are all involved in the usage of alginate. However, gene frequencies of these PL families were an order of magnitude below those of abundant GHs, CBMs, and CEs, indicating that alginate degradation does not play a vital role in North Sea spring phytoplankton blooms. Alginate is a cell wall constituent in brown macroalgae, however, the microalgae that dominate North Sea spring blooms are devoid of alginate.</p><p>For all of these GH, CBM, PL, and CE families, we observed remarkably similar gene frequency patterns during all four spring blooms, often with peaks in the same families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–L</xref>). Alongside CAZymes, sulfatase and TonB-dependent transporter (TBDT) gene frequencies also increased during blooms while tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter genes showed an almost opposite trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H,M</xref>). A class-level analysis revealed that sulfatases and TBDT genes were predominantly present in <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, whereas TRAP transporters were mostly present in <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6R,W</xref>). The observed shifts in sulfatase, TBDT and TRAP transporter frequencies hence reflect the shifts in relative abundance between these two classes. This is in agreement with our study on the 2009 spring bloom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teeling et al., 2012</xref>) and furthermore demonstrates recurrence of this phenomenon during four consecutive years.</p><p>Class-level analyses of the most abundant GH and CBM families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N–P</xref>) showed that <italic>Flavobacteriia</italic> not only contributed more total CAZymes to the microbial community than <italic>Alpha-</italic> and <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>, but also exhibited a tighter coupling between GH and CBM genes with highly similar abundance profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>). The distribution of families was also more uneven in <italic>Flavobacteriia</italic>, indicative of a more pronounced substrate specialization compared to <italic>Alpha</italic>- and <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>. GH92 (mannosidase) and GH16 (including β-1,3-glucanase) genes, for example, were predominantly found in <italic>Flavobacteriia</italic>, possibly indicating more readiness to decompose mannans and chrysolaminarin.</p><p>Metagenome taxonomic classification provided sufficient data for analysis of CAZyme repertoires of the flavobacterial NS5 marine group, NS3a marine group, <italic>Formosa, Polaribacter,</italic> and <italic>Cryomorphaceae</italic>, and the gammaproteobacterial <italic>Alteromonadales</italic> and <italic>Reinekea</italic> clades (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 10</xref>). For most of these clades, the analyses revealed fingerprint-like patterns, which corroborates the hypothesis that these clades have distinct glycan niches that are relatively stable across years. For example, the NS5 marine group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Q</xref>) was rich in GH3, 20 and 29 (fucosidases), but notably devoid of GH92 (mannosidases). By contrast, <italic>Formosa</italic> and <italic>Polaribacter</italic> clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6T,U</xref>) contained higher abundances of GH92 genes. The <italic>Formosa</italic> CAZyme profile was also characterized by high proportions of GH16, 17, and 30 families, which all contain enzymes that can decompose chrysolaminarin. <italic>Polaribacter</italic> contained a broader set of CAZymes that included all families found in <italic>Formosa</italic>, however, <italic>Polaribacter</italic> was richer in GH13 (e.g. α-amylase) and poorer in GH92 (mannosidases) than <italic>Formosa</italic>. Likewise, the GH repertoires of the NS3a and NS5 marine groups were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Q,S</xref>), but the NS3a marine group was richer in GH13 and 32 and devoid of GH29 family fucosidases. The high number of CAZyme families in <italic>Polaribacter</italic> corroborated metagenome bin analyses that suggested a higher diversity within this clade. CAZyme gene frequencies were much lower in the <italic>Cryomorphaceae</italic> than in the other investigated <italic>Flavobacteriia</italic> clades with GH frequencies barely exceeding 0.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests a different ecophysiological niche and a distinct role of the <italic>Cryomorphaceae</italic> during phytoplankton blooms.</p><p>For <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>, recurring patterns were detected for the prominent <italic>Alteromonadales</italic> and <italic>Reinekea</italic> clades. <italic>Alteromonadales</italic> contained some of the GH families that play important roles during phytoplankton blooms, such as GH13 and 16, but were notably poor in or even devoid of others, such as GH29 and GH92, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast to other prominent clades, we did not obtain sufficient metagenome sequences for <italic>Reinekea</italic> for all four years, but only for 2009 and 2010 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6V</xref>). However, the <italic>Reinekea</italic> CAZyme patterns of 2009 and 2010 were well conserved with high proportions of GH23 and 13, and CBM48, 20, 41, 21, and 25. The GH23 family comprises peptidoglycan lyases and the GH13 family contains α-1,4-glucanases (e.g. α-amylase). CBM48, 20, 41, 21, and 25 all bind α-1,4-glucans such as starch and glycogen, and the ubiquitous CBM50 contains peptidoglycan-binding members. These results are consistent with a glycan niche that involves decomposition of external α-1,4-glucans and possibly peptidoglycan.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Nutrient-poor marine surface waters are dominated by clades such as SAR11 and <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>.

Microbial communities in nutrient-rich 'green' surface oceans by contrast feature higher proportions of heterotrophic species that feed on more complex organic substrates. In particular during phytoplankton blooms, the release of algae-derived organic matter selects for fast growing species with genomic adaptations towards algal biomass remineralization. These are typically members of the <italic>Flavobacteriia</italic> and <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> classes and the alphaproteobacterial <italic>Roseobacter</italic> clade. Similarly adapted species from these clades compete for substrates during phytoplankton blooms with variation in which species prevail.

Some of the genera might be dominated by a single species while others might be more diverse with considerable variation in competitive success between bloom events. Nevertheless, the high level of recurrence in particular of flavobacterial clades indicates a strong selection of few clades highly adapted for the manipulation and uptake of specific and complex polysaccharides (and likely other biopolymers) and disagrees with substantial levels of sloppy-feeding by these bacteria that would allow other less adapted clades to arbitrarily reach high abundances via cross-feeding. This might be attributed to the capability of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> for very efficient macromolecule uptake as it has been recently shown for uptake of α-mannan by the human gut bacterium <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cuskin et al., 2015</xref>). This bacterium binds α-mannan macromolecules to its surface, followed by rapid cleavage into larger oligomers that are immediately imported via a TonB-dependent transporter (TBDT) into the periplasm without detectable loss. The bulk of the degradation into smaller molecules takes place in the periplasm where the substrate is secure from outside competitors before transport into the cytoplasm.</p><p>TonB-dependent transporters are not specific to <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, but it seems that only <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> have evolved a functional coupling of SusC-like TBDT porins with SusD-like TonB-dependent receptors (TBDRs) that bind and guide the substrate to the porin. At least so far, only <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> genomes feature characteristic <italic>susCD</italic> gene tandems. Within <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> genomes such tandems are frequently found in so-called polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sonnenburg et al., 2010</xref>]). PULs are operons or regulons where one or more <italic>susCD</italic> gene tandems are co-located with CAZymes. Further frequent accessory genes in PULs encompass transcriptional regulators, proteases, transporter components and sulfatases. The latter are required for the desulfation of sulfated polysaccharides, which marine algae produce in large quantities. The diversity of PULs in marine <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> genomes is high and largely unexplored and so far only few PULs have been linked to dedicated algal polysaccharides (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hehemann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kabisch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xing et al., 2015</xref>). The large, complex and efficient PUL uptake systems might explain why <italic>Flavobacteria</italic> consistently outcompeted <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> during the onset of all blooms.</p><p>It is noteworthy that we observed a shift in bacterioplankton biodiversity alongside a shift in functional gene repertoires for the major clades in all four years of this study. The abundance of CAZymes and sulfatases increased from pre- to mid-bloom situations and leveled off post-bloom. Likewise, similar abundance patterns were observed for the most abundant CAZyme families in all studied years.</p><p>We did observe an increase in the abundance of TBDRs during bloom situations, and we have shown previously that TBDRs are among the most abundantly expressed proteins during the bacterial mineralization of algae biomass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teeling et al., 2012</xref>). The relevance of TBDRs in nutrient-rich oceanic regions has been also supported by in situ metaproteome studies of samples from the South Atlantic Ocean (in particular at coastal upwelling zones; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morris et al., 2010</xref>]) and from the Antarctic Southern Ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Williams et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The recurrent patterns in bacterioplankton diversity and functional repertoires during the four studied spring blooms are remarkable in view of the variation among algae taxa. For example, even though algal biomass of the 2012 spring bloom was dominated by silicoflatellate <italic>Chattonella</italic> spp. and not by diatoms as was true for the three preceding years, the respective bacterioplankton communities were strikingly similar. Likewise only few bacterioplankton taxa seemed to be weakly correlated with dedicated phytoplankton taxa, and no clear correlation was found between distinct bacterioplankton taxa and individual distinct diatom clades in statistical analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary files 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">7</xref>). It seems that phytoplankton community composition did not exert a strong effect on the composition of the free-living non-phycosphere bacterioplankton community. Instead, the dominating algae (in terms of biomass) seemed to produce similar or perhaps identical types of substrates for specifically adapted clades of heterotrophic bacterioplankton. It is therefore conceivable that recurrence is more pronounced on the functional level than on the taxonomic level, since species from different taxa with similar ecophysiological niches might functionally substitute each other in different years. This hypothesis is supported by the bacterioplankton communities' similar CAZyme gene repertoires in the 2009 to 2012 spring blooms and in particular the consistency on class level that was almost unaffected by distinct blooming clades, yet needs to be further tested by deep metatranscriptome sequencing and metaproteomics during multiple spring phytoplankton blooms in future studies. Considering the extent of recurrence, our combined metagenome data (&gt;5 million predicted proteins) should provide sufficient search space for such an analysis.</p><p>The existence of recurrent key players during North Sea spring phytoplankton blooms suggests that the bacterioplankton community composition during and after such blooms is governed by deterministic effects. We have shown before that temperature exerts a strong effect on North Sea bacterioplankton as it selects for temperature-dependent guilds, for example when comparing spring and summer blooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lucas et al., 2015</xref>). Within short-lived spring blooms, however, the supply of algae-derived organic matter is among the main factors that shape the bacterioplankton composition. In particular the different types of structurally distinct polysaccharides that algae produce in large quantities seem to exert such substrate-induced forcing. Since <italic>Flavobacteriia</italic> are more specialized on polysaccharides than <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>, this would also explain, why <italic>Flavobacteriia</italic> dominated the recurrent clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q–T</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–J</xref>) and <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> clades exhibited more stochastic peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q–T</xref>).</p><p>At the beginning of a bloom, most available polysaccharides will be exopolysaccharides, but as the bloom commences and algae become senescent, more and more cellular algal substrates are released, culminating in the bloom's final die off phase. Bacteria will naturally consume the more degradable substrates such as storage polysaccharides (e.g. chrysolaminarin) first, and more recalcitrant substrates (e.g. branched and sulfated polysaccharides) later. TEP for example seems to undergo such selective feeding, as it has been suggested that in particular fucose-rich TEP is less readily degraded than mannose and galactose rich TEP (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Passow, 2002</xref>). Such selective feeding creates an additional change in substrate availability and leads to a succession of substrate niches for specifically adapted bacterioplankton clades to grow.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Bacterioplankton communities during spring phytoplankton blooms in the coastal North Sea undergo swift and dynamic composition changes and thus are difficult to investigate. Nonetheless, we found clades that recurrently reached high abundances among <italic>Flavobacteriia</italic> (<italic>Formosa, Polaribacter</italic>, NS3a marine group, <italic>Ulvibacter</italic>, VIS6 clade <italic>Cryomorphaceae, Tenacibaculum), Gammaproteobacteria (Alteromonadaceae/Colwelliaceae</italic>, SAR92, <italic>Reinekea</italic>) and <italic>Roseobacter</italic> clade <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> (DC5-80-3, NAC11-7). Recurrence was not only detectable on the taxonomic but also on the functional level with a highly predictable increase in TonB-dependent polysaccharide uptake systems and distinct CAZyme patterns. The niches of abundant bacterioplankton clades are more complex and manifold than the glycan niches that we explore in this study. CAZymes, however, have the advantage that they allow linking of gene repertoires and possible environmental functions in a way currently not feasible for other macromolecules such as proteins and lipids. Our results suggest that besides stochastic also deterministic effects influence phytoplankton-bacterioplankton coupling during blooms. They indicate that during spring phytoplankton blooms similar principles of resource partitioning and specialization are at play as within human gut microbiota that decompose fiber-rich plant material, albeit at a much larger scale. Rather the availability of substrates commonly occurring in microalgae than one-to-one interactions of particular phytoplankton and bacterioplankton species caused the succession of free-living bacterioplankton clades.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Phytoplankton and physicochemical data</title><p>Physicochemical parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and phytoplankton data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>) were assessed in subsurface water on a weekday basis as part of the Helgoland Roads LTER time series.

Taxometer consolidates predictions of a set of individual sequence classification tools into a consensus using a weighted assessment on seven selected ranks (superkingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species) of the NCBI taxonomy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/</ext-link>).

In contrast to the original Taxometer approach we omitted signature-based classification with Self-Organizing Maps and mapping of reads containing partial 16S rRNA gene sequences. The prediction tools that were used are outlined below:</p><p>We used the HMMER-based module of CARMA3 (not the BLAST-based module) that infers taxonomy of sequences by post-processing genes with HMMER3 hits to the Pfam database. The basic principle is to apply a reciprocal search technique to reduce the number of identified matches and thereby to improve taxonomic classification quality.</p><p>KIRSTEN (Kinship Relationship Reestablishment) infers taxonomy of sequences by post-processing BLASTp hits to the NCBI nr database by means of rank-based evaluations on all levels of the NCBI taxonomy with an increasing stringency from the superkingdom down to the species level. On each taxonomic level, all occurring taxa are weighted by the sum of their BLASTp bit scores. When the taxon with the highest weight exceeds an adjustable threshold, the process continues towards the next taxonomic level. The threshold increases with each taxonomic level, i.e. the algorithm becomes more critical while it progresses. For this study, we substituted BLASTp by the UBLAST module of USEARCH 6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edgar, 2010</xref>) with an E-value cutoff of E-10 and maximum hit count of 500.</p><p>SMALT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/smalt/">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/smalt/</ext-link>) was used to map metagenome reads on a manually compiled set of 49 reference genomes and a streamlined version of the NCBI nr database. Both, the reference genomes and the sequences selected from the NCBI nr database were selected based on habitat-specific information. This was done manually for the reference genomes and automatically for the NCBI nr database as follows: Each of the hits from the UBLAST search during KIRSTEN analysis can be associated with multiple taxa, since in nr redundant sequences from different taxa are merged. We used this information to extract all taxa associated with a given hit, then combined the taxa of all hits and finally extracted all sequences of these taxa from Genbank. This way a sample-specific streamlined subset of Genbank was generated that greatly sped up the mapping process. Only metagenome reads with at least 95% identity to any sequence in the sample-specific sequence database were used. Reads were subsequently back-mapped to contigs. Since contigs consist of many reads, this way, contigs were associated with multiple taxonomic paths. Taxonomic paths resulting from classification with reference genomes and the habitat-specific streamlined nr were concatenated. Paths representing less than 1% of the reads of a given contig were discarded.</p><p>Finally, Taxometer was used to combine all gene-based predictions from CARMA3 and KIRSTEN and the mapping results for each contig, and to infer a consensus taxonomy. Taxonomic predictions were possible for 94.6% of the contigs above 1 kbp.

Spearman rank correlations measure the strength of association between two ranked variables. A precondition (assumption) for this nonparametric statistical analysis is that the two variables share a monotonic relationship (i.e. when one variable increases, the other either consistently increases as well or consistently decreases). This monotonic relationship does, however, not need to be linear. While no particularly strong correlations were found between major algae groups and bacterioplankton clades, some noteworthy trends were detected. For example, <italic>Ulvibacter</italic> abundances were positively correlated with diatoms (in particular centrales) and negatively correlated with silicoflagellates, whereas an opposite trend was observed for the VIS1 clade of the NS5 marine group (i.e. negative correlation with diatoms and a positive correlation with silicoflagellates). While the explanatory power of such pairwise rank-based correlations is limited and correlation does not necessarily imply causation, these data suggest at least for <italic>Ulvibacter</italic> sp. (and to a lesser extent for <italic>Formosa</italic> clade B) that they are associated with diatoms, while the NS3a, NS5 and NS9 marine groups seemed to be rather positively correlated with flagellates such as dino- and silicoflagellates. The positive correlation between <italic>Ulvibacter</italic> sp. and diatoms was supported by Spearman rank correlation analysis between the abundances of prominent bacterioplankton clades and distinct phytoplankton groups. <italic>Ulvibacter</italic> abundances were positively correlated with the diatoms <italic>Mediopyxis helysia, Chaetoceros debilis, Chaetoceros minimus, Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii</italic> and the <italic>Phaeocystis</italic> spp. haptophytes. Correlations of other bacterioplankton groups with distinct phytoplankton groups were less pronounced. Noteworthy positive correlations were found between <italic>Chattonella</italic> spp. and <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> abundances (probe CF319a), in particular <italic>Marinoscillum</italic> spp. (probe CYT-734), <italic>Polaribacter</italic> spp. (probe POL740) and the NS5/VIS1 and NS3a marine groups. The NS5/VIS1 marine group was negatively correlated with most diatom groups and the <italic>Phaeocystis</italic> sp. haptophytes, and only positively correlated with <italic>Chattonella</italic> species. This might indicate a preference for <italic>Chattonella</italic> spp. or simply reflect that the members of the VIS1 clade of the NS5 marine group were less competitive than other <italic>Flavobacteriia</italic> under the conditions where other algae dominated. Spearman rank correlations between major bacterioplankton clades and physicochemical parameters were most conclusive for <italic>Ulvibacter</italic> species. Ulvibacter abundances were positively correlated with chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>, consistent with the previously detected positive correlation with in particular diatoms. <italic>Ulvibacter</italic> abundances were also negatively correlated with silicate, phosphate, nitrate and ammonium. In particular the strong negative correlation with silicate, which is the limiting factor for diatom frustule formation, supports a particularly strong association of <italic>Ulvibacter</italic> spp. and diatoms. Similar but weaker trends were observed also for other bacterioplankton clades, such as <italic>Polaribacter, Formosa</italic> clade B, or VIS6 clade <italic>Cryomorphaceae</italic>. Of all genus-level clades, <italic>Polaribacter</italic> and <italic>Formosa</italic> clade A showed the strongest associations with temperature.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11888.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11888.016</ext-link></p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-11888-supp6-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD7-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11888.017</object-id><label>Supplementary file 7.</label><caption><title>Linear regression analyses were computed in order to test, whether the abundances of major clades of <italic>Flavobacteriia</italic> were influenced by abiotic factors or by abundant algae groups.</title><p>For all tested clades of <italic>Flavobacteriia</italic>, multiple abiotic factors and multiple algae groups were obtained as explanatory variables.

It should be noted though that these regressions were computed based on log-transformed abundance data and not algae biovolumes (which were not measured).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work in its current format will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We think you have submitted a very interesting study and the reviewers were collectively enthusiastic about the efforts to collect the data. However, at the same time the reviewers also were concerned about the novelty yet provided compared to the Science paper of 2012. They felt that a more rigorous analysis will yield new and interesting insights into bacterial phytoplankton interactions. Furthermore, the reviewers indicated some experiments and also experimental and methodological improvements, which might lead to a study with deeper insight into the interaction of algae and bacteria, but this cannot be in the time schedule we expect for a major revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript describes the characterisation of planktonic blooms following the primary blooms of algae in the southern North Sea. Such successions during spring phytoplankton blooms were investigated for four consecutive years. An enormous amount of data was generated by dense sampling and high-resolution taxonomic analyses. These data are of very high quality. In addition, metagenomic data were provided which revealed recurring patterns at the functional level, in particular concerning polysaccharide degradation. The manuscript is very well written, the outcome is very interesting. The methods used are state of the art. I have two comments to be discussed:</p><p>1) The functional analysis is purely based on occurrence of e.g. CAZyme-encoding genes by metagenome sequencing. Of course, the findings are sound, i.e., a succession of bacteria with a distinct set of CAZyme-encoding genes was detected. I am not sure whether it would be possible to also carry out a proteome analysis to demonstrate the presence of these enzymes, many of them can be expected to be extracellular. I am not sure whether this is possible at all.</p><p>2) I think the manuscript contains sufficient novelty compared to the Science paper of 2012, where some of the authors showed that substrate-controlled succession of marine bacterioplankton populations is induced by a phytoplankton bloom. In the current manuscript a far more comprehensive analysis was provided.</p><p>In general, I think the manuscript reports very interesting data, and also functional relationships. Also, I expect the data being an extremely valuable source for further studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a significant contribution to the understanding of how bacteria respond to spring phytoplankton blooms. It appears technically sound in design and data reporting, and provides great detail that will inform our understanding of this important phenomenon. My main concern: There are clearly consistencies in the bacterial responses yearly, however the primary conclusion that there are &quot;recurring patterns&quot; of bacterioplankton dynamics is not statistically supported, and frankly vague. A clear quantitative (and justified) definition is needed, otherwise one can focus on what parts repeat and say there is a repeating pattern, or focus on differences and say there isn't. The succession details in their earlier Science paper (Teeling et al., 2012) differ here. If one accepts a broad qualitative definition of &quot;recurring patterns,&quot; the results are confirmatory of previous work by the authors and others, cited by recent reviews (Buchan et al., Nature Reviews Microbiology, for example), showing that many taxa, including those reported here, have repeated seasonality or bloom responses. Admittedly few prior studies covered the fine temporal scale measured here, and that is a considerable strength.</p><p>To quantitatively show dynamics are recurring, statistics should be applied using each year as a sort of replicate to determine which aspects of the microbial successions repeat, including relationships to algal taxa. The spring &quot;blooms&quot; are quite variable in their dynamics, as acknowledged by the authors, and the response differs, as expected. If bottom up controls are the dominant factor controlling the bacterial composition as suggested, the why are dynamics not similar within a year when there is a secondary peak of chlorophyll after the first bloom (see specific comments)? Could it be top-down controls?</p><p>Regarding associations (or lack thereof) with phytoplankton, I think the assessment of the phytoplankton dynamics is not universal enough to allow full conclusions. For instance, only one member an important group of phytoplankton, the haptophytes, is reported (<italic>Phaeocystis</italic>) – are there no others? Additionally, among the most numerically abundant taxa were the Green Algae, which have many significantly different species, but here they are &quot;lumped&quot; together. It is unlikely that particular microbial interactions would occur with whole families or orders of phytoplankton, but instead be rather very specific (e.g. see Amin et al. 2015 and references therein). Unfortunately, the manuscript only reports a relatively small number of phytoplankton species – and it would be good to see calculations of the fraction of total phytoplankton these represent (e.g. biomass totals to compare with chlorophyll-based totals to see what% may be missing. Some chlorophyll increases were not accompanied on a daily basis with counts). Furthermore, the main way the authors have looked for correlation between phytoplankton and bacteria is via Spearman's correlation for apparently all of the years together. By visual examination, many of the &quot;responding&quot; bacteria seem to have a delayed reaction to the increases in chlorophyll, so the authors should also look for time-delayed correlations, in addition to year-by-year studies.</p><p>CARD-FISH identified only about 70% of the bacteria, a shortcoming to understanding the full community response, addressable with their less frequent 16S observations. The broad groups appear to have little consistent response to the 'blooms.' Why no direct comparisons between CARD-FISH and 16S sequences? Some groups explored with the 16S not found in CARD-FISH are generally ignored, but CARD-FISH could represent as little as about 40% during blooms. Notable such bacteria include <italic>Verrucomicrobia</italic> (increases in May 2010, 2011,2012). Also, chloroplast data should be separated from figures of 16S tag sequencing results because they are not bacteria or archaea.</p><p>Important: Is the variability observed largely temporal (local successions) or is it a mixture of spatial and temporal variability (most likely)? Are the blooms very patchy or regional? Satellite imagery would help, even occasional. Minimally – deserves discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes an impressive campaign to characterize the bacterial communities in a coastally influenced environment over the course of consecutive several years. These types of long-term, high-resolution temporal studies have been previously restricted to more oligotrophic environments. Here, the authors focus their analysis on bacterial communities associated with the seasonal phytoplankton blooms that occur in their study site, with the broader goal of providing a better understanding of the underlying drivers of the recurrence of specific bacterial lineages/groups.</p><p>The scientific methods are solid, and I have no major worries regarding the quality of the data. My main concern (indeed, personal struggle) is that I am unsure of the scientific impact of this work, at least as currently presented in the manuscript. While this is a truly impressive dataset and one that should be published/disseminated, the main conclusions are that some bacterial lineages (and some of the functions they encode) show recurring seasonal and annual patterns of occurrence. Linkages between specific bacterial taxa, functions and environmental parameters (principally those associated with phytoplankton blooms) are evident. Yet, as the authors report, this has been shown previously; albeit these &quot;elsewhere&quot; environments are generally more oligotrophic, and perhaps subject to less environmental variability (though that is debatable) than the one characterized here. The authors frame their conclusions on the nature of the succession of bacterial groups as being one that is influenced by both &quot;stochastic processes&quot; and &quot;deterministic principles&quot;, however, I did not find the manuscript to be convincingly clear on what they mean by these statements.</p><p>Given the criteria for acceptance in this journal – &quot;highly influential research&quot; –, I am of the position that the authors need to dig deeper to draw more novel conclusions with respects to what this time-series analysis reveals regarding environmental parameters and bacterial structure and function. The volume and nature of these data suggest that would be appropriate for some modeling efforts. This type of exercise might better support the authors conclusions and illustrate the emergent properties/recurrent patterns of specific bacterial lineages.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Recurring patterns in bacterioplankton dynamics during coastal spring algae blooms&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Although we acknowledge that the revised version was considerably improved we still felt that some points made by the reviewers were valid and simply disagreed by the authors. On the other side, we also see that the dataset is very valuable and that the authors had made more new, convincing, and quantitative conclusions. There are several points which need to be addressed. In addition to those outlined by the reviewers. We ask you to tone down the language associated with the conclusions, especially those related to the presumptive underlying drivers of the observed patterns (&quot;substrate-induced forcing&quot;). This conclusion is based on metagenomic analysis and functions that have not been shown conclusively. We would like to ask you to modify the text accordingly. For instance, in the Abstract &quot;We thereby demonstrate that even though there is substantial inter-annual variation between spring phytoplankton blooms, the accompanying succession of bacterial clades is governed by deterministic principles such as substrate-induced forcing&quot; could be modified to something like: &quot;We thereby hypothesize that even though…&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The study reports the characterisation of planktonic blooms following the primary blooms of algae in the southern North Sea.

However, at the same time the reviewers also were concerned about the novelty yet provided compared to the Science paper of 2012. They felt that a more rigorous analysis will yield new and interesting insights into bacterial phytoplankton interactions. Furthermore, the reviewers indicated some experiments and also experimental and methodological improvements, which might lead to a study with deeper insight into the interaction of algae and bacteria, but this cannot be in the time schedule we expect for a major revision.</italic> Reviewer #1:</p><p> <italic>The manuscript describes the characterisation of planktonic blooms following the primary blooms of algae in the southern North Sea. Such successions during spring phytoplankton blooms were investigated for four consecutive years. An enormous amount of data was generated by dense sampling and high-resolution taxonomic analyses. These data are of very high quality. In addition, metagenomic data were provided which revealed recurring patterns at the functional level, in particular concerning polysaccharide degradation. The manuscript is very well written, the outcome is very interesting. The methods used are state of the art. I have two comments to be discussed:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The functional analysis is purely based on occurrence of e.g. CAZyme-encoding genes by metagenome sequencing. Of course, the findings are sound, i.e., a succession of bacteria with a distinct set of CAZyme-encoding genes was detected. I am not sure whether it would be possible to also carry out a proteome analysis to demonstrate the presence of these enzymes, many of them can be expected to be extracellular. I am not sure whether this is possible at all.</italic> </p><p>We did carry out ten metaproteome analyses of soluble fractions of bacterioplankton cells that correspond to the 10 new metagenomes of 2010 to 2012 that we present in our study. The smallest metaproteome dataset of the 2010 to 2012 blooms comprises only 1,058 and the largest 3,994 proteins (25,832 proteins for all 10 time points combined). Since the blooms of 2010 to 2012 were also less intense than the bloom of 2009, these metaproteomes yielded mostly conventional highly expressed proteins such as chaperonins, ribosomal proteins and transporters. While the proteomes were not deep enough to detect many expressed CAZymes, we could however, as in 2009, detect remarkably high levels of TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors/transporters among the proteins with the highest expression levels. We will use this expression of TonB-dependent receptors as an indirect measure for the expression of CAZyme-encoding polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) in a future study. In order to achieve this, we have systematically isolated and sequenced close to 50 genomes of North Sea <italic>Flavobacteriia</italic>. We are working on a systematic investigation of the co-localization of TonB-dependent receptors (TBDRs) and CAZymes in PULs of these isolates and predict polysaccharide substrate specificities. We will subsequently use the metaproteome data in conjunction with these (meta-)genomic data to use TBDR expression as a proxy for expression of CAZymes. This is a much more laborious, but also targeted approach, which has the potential for additional insights on relevant polysaccharide substrates, which we plan to publish in a separate paper.</p><p><italic>2) I think the manuscript contains sufficient novelty compared to the Science paper of 2012, where some of the authors showed that substrate-controlled succession of marine bacterioplankton populations is induced by a phytoplankton bloom. In the current manuscript a far more comprehensive analysis was provided. In general, I think the manuscript reports very interesting data, and also functional relationships. Also, I expect the data being an extremely valuable source for further studies.</italic> We would like to thank reviewer #1 for this statement. The dataset we present is indeed unusually large (e.g. 10x more metagenomic information than in the 2012 Science paper), which prevents analysis of every possible aspect. Instead, it is our intention to explain the dataset and to focus the analyses of biodiversity and gene function repertoires on selected relevant key aspects in continuation of our initial 2012 Science publication.</p><p>We agree with reviewer #1 that the dataset will allow us and others to explore additional aspects, for example the diversity and genomic potential of bacterioplankton groups that were not in our focus, such as for example members of the alphaproteobacterial <italic>Roseobacter</italic> or the betaproteobacterial OM43 clades, or to focus on other relevant gene functions besides those involved in the concerted decomposition of polysaccharides.</p><p>In order to make the dataset more accessible, we now include the full set of physicochemical measurements and the data of the dominating algae taxa as supplementary material (new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">2</xref>).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p> <italic>This is a significant contribution to the understanding of how bacteria respond to spring phytoplankton blooms. It appears technically sound in design and data reporting, and provides great detail that will inform our understanding of this important phenomenon. My main concern: There are clearly consistencies in the bacterial responses yearly, however the primary conclusion that there are &quot;recurring patterns&quot; of bacterioplankton dynamics is not statistically supported, and frankly vague. A clear quantitative (and justified) definition is needed, otherwise one can focus on what parts repeat and say there is a repeating pattern, or focus on differences and say there isn't.</italic> </p><p>We are communicating a very densely sampled large dataset and for reasons of practicality we focused on the major clades. Within these clades, there is a clear pattern of recurrence, not in the sense that the order of clades is identical each year (which is not expected due to variations in phytoplankton dynamics), but in the sense that these clades recur from year to year, which we prefer to show as original data.</p><p>We used a quantitative criterion of equal or larger than 5% relative abundance in at least two of the analyzed four for the most abundant clades, and some of the clades (defined mostly on the level of genus) that we describe responded with even much higher peaks. We made this more clear in the revised manuscript (subsection “bacterioplankton - diversity and bloom characteristics”, fourth paragraph). Annual recurrence of these clades is independent of any stochastic occurrence of other clades, and this means that we did not hand-pick results in order to make up recurrence as this reviewer implies. We focused our study further to clades from <italic>Bacteroidete</italic>s and <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>, two clades known for their potential to degradepolysaccharides and demonstrated in the 2012 Teeling paper to respond to phytoplankton blooms. We only touch upon other abundant groups such as SAR11, <italic>Roseobacter</italic> or OM43 that lack a specific potential for polysaccharide degradation.</p><p><italic>The succession details in their earlier Science paper (Teeling et al., 2012) differ here. If one accepts a broad qualitative definition of &quot;recurring patterns,&quot; the results are confirmatory of previous work by the authors and others, cited by recent reviews (Buchan et al., Nature Reviews Microbiology, for example), showing that many taxa, including those reported here, have repeated seasonality or bloom responses. Admittedly few prior studies covered the fine temporal scale measured here, and that is a considerable strength.</italic> </p><p>The purpose of this study was to test our hypothesis that spring phytoplankton blooms trigger rapid successions of flavobacterial and gammaproteobacterial clades specialized for polysaccharide degradation and to investigate this succession in a very comprehensive dataset collected in four consecutive years.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge so far nobody has performed a polyphasic study of this scope including FISH cell counts, diversity assessment by tag sequencing, and metagenomic profiling for the same study site over a multiple year time span. To cite the 2014 review of Alison Buchan et al. that this reviewer brings forward:</p><p>&quot;However, such studies often differ with respect to bloom location, duration and intensity of sampling, phytoplankton species succession, geochemistry and temperature, which prevents quantitative generalizations of bacterial composition and responses.&quot;</p><p>Here we address exactly this problem by presenting a high temporal resolution study from one and the same location that spans four consecutive years.</p><p><italic>To quantitatively show dynamics are recurring, statistics should be applied using each year as a sort of replicate to determine which aspects of the microbial successions repeat, including relationships to algal taxa.</italic> </p><p>As stated above, the recurrence of abundant taxa can visually be seen in the data we show. We actually selected <italic>eLife</italic> because it is an electronic journal able to accommodate significantly more of our high-resolution original data than a printed journal. Any statistical approach with n=4, i.e. four years as replicates, has severe limitations, yet we show recurrence of specific clades in 3-4 out of 4 years. Likewise, we could further extend the analysis that we already did with respect to the relationships of specific bacterial genera to algal taxa. However, we would like to make this reviewer aware of the fact that our study deals with free-living bacteria in the size fraction 0.2 – 3 µm and not with bacteria that are directly algae-associated such as phycosphere bacteria. In any case, the statistical analyses provided show that there is no simple one to one relationship between occurrence of dedicated algae taxa and dedicated clades of free-living bacteria. This is actually a major new result of this study, consistent with our hypothesis that the availability of substrates commonly occurring in microalgae such as laminarin are a major cause for the bacterial succession, and more important than one-to-one interactions of particular phytoplankton and bacterioplankton species (see Discussion, eighth paragraph). This is now also stated in the final sentence of the concluding remarks (see end of Discussion).</p><p><italic>The spring &quot;blooms&quot; are quite variable in their dynamics, as acknowledged by the authors, and the response differs, as expected. If bottom up controls are the dominant factor controlling the bacterial composition as suggested, the why are dynamics not similar within a year when there is a secondary peak of chlorophyll after the first bloom (see specific comments)? Could it be top-down controls?</italic> We designed the study in a way that it is strictly focused on the first spring bloom phase, since at the end of the winter period top-down factors should beminimal. Hence, we rephrased as follows:</p><p>“Dominance of bottom-up over top-down control is assumed to be characteristic for the initial phases of spring phytoplankton blooms. […] Hence, top-down control by predation sets in only during later bloom phases. This situation is distinct from summer and fall phytoplankton blooms.”</p><p>By no means we stated that bottom-up control is the dominant factor for all taxa for the entire year, but bottom-up control likely dominates during early bloom stages when predators and viruses are not yet abundant. Of course top-down control by grazing or virus mortality cannot be excluded, in particular during later bloom phases in which successions would be much more difficult to predict.</p><p><italic>Regarding associations (or lack thereof) with phytoplankton, I think the assessment of the phytoplankton dynamics is not universal enough to allow full conclusions. For instance, only one member an important group of phytoplankton, the haptophytes, is reported (Phaeocystis) – are there no others?</italic> </p><p>In fact, we have very detailed phytoplankton data for all four years, and besides <italic>Phaeocystis</italic>, we discuss <italic>Chaetoceros debilis, Chaetoceros minimus, Mediopyxis helysia, Rhizosolenia</italic> styliformis and <italic>Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii, Chattonella spp.,</italic> and <italic>Phaeocystis</italic> spp. as dominant groups.Likewise, all of these groups and the major phytoplankton clades were statistically tested for association. We added the respective primary data as new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>Additionally, among the most numerically abundant taxa were the Green Algae, which have many significantly different species, but here they are &quot;lumped&quot; together.</italic> </p><p>Green algae simply did not play a major role during the North Sea spring phytoplankton blooms that we analyzed, which in most cases are dominated by diatoms. This is why we did not include any information on this paraphyletic group in the abundance plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and treated them as one group in statistical analyses. We included the primary algae count data (new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>) for reference that shows that the numbers of green algae were minute compared to the major algae taxa. We do have high-resolution data of many more algae taxa at hand (more than 200 algae taxa are continuously identified at Helgoland in the framework of the Helgoland Roads time series since 1962), and these data are available on request. (see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.awi.de/forschung/biowissenschaft/oekologie-der-kuesten/arbeitsgruppen/ag-langzeitoekologieforschung-old-version/long-term-observations/helgoland-roads.html">https://www.awi.de/forschung/biowissenschaft/oekologie-der-kuesten/arbeitsgruppen/ag-langzeitoekologieforschung-old-version/long-term-observations/helgoland-roads.html</ext-link>)</p><p><italic>It is unlikely that particular microbial interactions would occur with whole families or orders of phytoplankton, but instead be rather very specific (e.g. see Amin et al. 2015 and references therein). Unfortunately, the manuscript only reports a relatively small number of phytoplankton species – and it would be good to see calculations of the fraction of total phytoplankton these represent (e.g. biomass totals to compare with chlorophyll-based totals to see what% may be missing. Some chlorophyll increases were not accompanied on a daily basis with counts).</italic> </p><p>We concur that associations of algae and phycosphere bacteria can be quite specific, but those bacteria were not subject of our study in which we examined the 0.2 – 3 µm fraction. We did include species level assignments of phytoplankton that was dominant in terms of biomass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-D</xref> bold lines) except for the raphidophyte <italic>Chattonella</italic> that dominated in 2012. In this context we would like to point out to this reviewer that the 2012 bloom was distinct from the usually diatom-dominated spring blooms at Helgoland, and still we found the same bacterioplankton clades responding. This is a clear indication against the proposed strong effect of algal identity on the sampled 0.2 – 3 µm bacterioplankton fraction. It is actually among the main outcomes of this study that indeed families and orders of phytoplankton and not particular species are important during spring blooms in the Southern North Sea, i.e. all diatoms and several other microalgae have laminarin as the main storage polysaccharide.</p><p>We are sorry that within this multi-year study we were not able to provide daily measurements for all parameters. As we explained in the manuscript, there is no strict one-to-one correlation between algae biomass and chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>. Reliable biomass data is very hard to obtain, and this reviewer certainly agrees that sizes of algae depend heavily on the physiological state. There are of course published values for all of the major taxa that occurred during the blooms we investigated, but usage of such values would be very rough estimations with a considerable margin of error, which is why we did abstain from including such error-prone biomass data in statistical analyses.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, the main way the authors have looked for correlation between phytoplankton and bacteria is via Spearman's correlation for apparently all of the years together. By visual examination, many of the &quot;responding&quot; bacteria seem to have a delayed reaction to the increases in chlorophyll, so the authors should also look for time-delayed correlations, in addition to year-by-year studies.</italic> </p><p>We agree that a delayed reaction of the responding bacteria is obvious. For a brief analysis of such delays, lagged correlation approaches (LSA, localsimilarity analysis) could be applied generally. However, for these analyses, consistent and coherent datasets are required without any missing values. Due to inherent limitations of field sampling, such datasets are scarce and only few studies fulfilling the LSA requirements were published until now. In the context of our study consistency was hard to achieve due to the unpredictability of the exact onset of the spring phytoplankton blooms.</p><p>We did in fact compute forward regressions for each year that yielded no significant correlations. Only a lagged co-occurrence could be proven since the interrelation-mediating metabolites (e.g. polysaccharides) were not analyzed, since this is technically extremely demanding. Future studies will need to include quantitative analyses of structurally resolved polysaccharides.</p><p><italic>CARD-FISH identified only about 70% of the bacteria, a shortcoming to understanding the full community response, addressable with their less frequent 16S observations. The broad groups appear to have little consistent response to the 'blooms.' Why no direct comparisons between CARD-FISH and 16S sequences?</italic> </p><p>CARD-FISH does have the decided advantage over 16S rRNA tag sequencing that it provides reliable cell counts. The disadvantage is that it is a laborious technique when done for a very large number of samples, which is why regrettably few studies include such data. In contrast to many other high-profile microbiome studies we actually provide exact numbers for those clades expected to recur. In order to counteract the disadvantages that we only count what we are probing for by CARD-FISH, we have investigated all samples by in-depth 16S rRNA tag sequencing to also identify novel clades. The tag data that we provide represent a dense series for 2010 to 2012 and all of these samples were deeply sequenced (rarefaction analyses not included in the manuscript show that we sequenced multiple times beyond exhaustion of any increase in novel taxa).</p><p>As for a direct comparison of CARD-FISH and tag data, we would like to remind this reviewer that perfect consensus of both methods is not possible for fundamental reasons, because the taxon frequency obtained by tag sequencing are biased among other factors by differential PCR amplification. Also CARD-FISH probe specificities and taxonomic affiliations based on tag sequencing do not match perfectly. This is well known and inherent to the way both technologies work. We advise to use the probe match tool implemented in the Silva database for an exact evaluation of the groups that the CARD-FISH probes that we used target. All of these probes are published (see the references that we provided), including information on their specificities. A technical discussion of multiple reasons why CARD-FISH numbers and tag frequencies might differ is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Some groups explored with the 16S not found in CARD-FISH are generally ignored, but CARD-FISH could represent as little as about 40% during blooms. Notable such bacteria include Verrucomicrobia (increases in May 2010, 2011,2012). Also, chloroplast data should be separated from figures of 16S tag sequencing results because they are not bacteria or archaea.</italic> This is a hypothesis-driven study in which we indeed monitored particular bacterial clades using of CARD-FISH. The reviewer is thus correct that we did not include all abundant bacterial groups in the Discussion. Since the intention of this paper was not the general assessment of all aspects of bacterial diversity we in particular “neglected” groups such as SAR11, OM43 or <italic>Roseobacter</italic>, which are known to lack significant polysaccharide degradationpotential. A complete discussion of all data retrieved is simply impossible for a dataset of such size and hence we focused on key aspects that we think are prominent and of major importance. However, based on the reviewer’s remark we included a short comment on <italic>Verrucomicrobia</italic> (subsection “bacterioplankton - diversity and bloom characteristics”, third paragraph), which are for sure a very interesting group that responded to the investigated spring phytoplankton blooms with decreasing maximum abundances of 7.7% (2010), 5.0% (2011) and 2.9% (2012). This decrease correlates with decreasing bloom intensities, which agrees with a proposed role of <italic>Verrucomicrobia</italic> in polysaccharide decomposition (e.g. Manuel Martinez-Garcia et al., 2012).</p><p>As suggested we removed the chloroplast data and all tags ascribed as <italic>Eukaryota</italic> from the calculations of tag frequencies and recalculated all graphsin the respective figure (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) accordingly.</p><p><italic>Important: Is the variability observed largely temporal (local successions) or is it a mixture of spatial and temporal variability (most likely)? Are the blooms very patchy or regional? Satellite imagery would help, even occasional. Minimally – deserves discussion.</italic> </p><p>Based on the reviewer’s remarks we added satellite data (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which we already had analyzed, yet did not include. These data indicate that the variability is largely temporal, but there are of course also spatial influences. We discussed this in detail for the Helgoland sampling site in our Science publication of the 2009 spring bloom using satellite images and particle drift simulations. Particle drift simulation data could be computed and made available on request, but would further inflate the dataset.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below: Although we acknowledge that the revised version was considerably improved we still felt that some points made by the reviewers were valid and simply disagreed by the authors. On the other side, we also see that the dataset is very valuable and that the authors had made more new, convincing, and quantitative conclusions. There are several points which need to be addressed. In addition to those outlined by the reviewers. We ask you to tone down the language associated with the conclusions, especially those related to the presumptive underlying drivers of the observed patterns (&quot;substrate-induced forcing&quot;). This conclusion is based on metagenomic analysis and functions that have not been shown conclusively. We would like to ask you to modify the text accordingly. For instance, in the Abstract &quot;We thereby demonstrate that even though there is substantial inter-annual variation between spring phytoplankton blooms, the accompanying succession of bacterial clades is governed by deterministic principles such as substrate-induced forcing&quot; could be modified to something like: &quot;We thereby hypothesize that even though…&quot;.</italic></p><p>We agree that our data does not provide a direct proof of deterministic effects such as substrate-induced forcing, but rather provides indirect indications that such effects might play a major role during spring bloom successions. We hence toned down the language of our conclusions throughout the manuscript as requested. The above-mentioned part of the Abstract was rephrased to:</p><p>&quot;We therefore hypothesize that even though there is substantial inter-annual variation between spring phytoplankton blooms, the accompanying succession of bacterial clades is largely governed by deterministic principles such as substrate-induced forcing.&quot;</p><p>In the Results section, we rephrased as follows:</p><p>&quot;Metagenome taxonomic classification provided sufficient data for analysis of CAZyme repertoires of the flavobacterial NS5 marine group, NS3a marine group, <italic>Formosa, Polaribacter</italic>, and <italic>Cryomorphaceae</italic>, and the gammaproteobacterial <italic>Alteromonadales</italic> and <italic>Reinekea</italic> clades (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 10</xref>). For most of these clades, the analyses revealed fingerprint-like patterns, which corroborates the hypothesis that these clades have distinct glycan niches that are relatively stable across years.<italic>&quot;</italic></p><p>In the Discussion, we rephrased as follows:</p><p>&quot;The existence of recurrent key players during North Sea spring phytoplankton blooms suggests that the bacterioplankton community composition during and after such blooms is governed by deterministic effects.&quot;</p><p>And finally in the concluding remarks, we rephrased the respective statement as follows:</p><p>&quot;Our results suggest that besides stochastic also deterministic effects influence phytoplankton-bacterioplankton coupling during blooms.&quot;</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p> <italic>We thank the authors for their response to our criticism. We appreciate their detailed and extended response to many of our technical suggestions, of which they responded to compellingly. The dataset and extensive analysis is indeed very impressive and valuable.
