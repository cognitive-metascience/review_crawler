We find that the rosette defect of one mutant, named Rosetteless, maps to a predicted C-type lectin, a class of signaling and adhesion genes required for the development and innate immunity in animals. Rosetteless protein is essential for rosette development and forms an extracellular layer that coats and connects the basal poles of each cell in rosettes.

At first, such a creature would likely have been made from clusters of cells that all had the same function. Eventually, different cells took on different roles, and today animals have many organ systems, each made up of specialized cell types. How the ancestors of animals transitioned from being single celled to multicellular, however, is poorly understood.</p><p>It is now possible to reconstruct key steps in the evolution of ‘multicellularity’ by comparing modern animals with their closest living relatives—the choanoflagellates. These are a group of aquatic microorganisms that can either live as single cells or develop into multicellular colonies. The genes that allow choanoflagellate cells to form colonies are hypothesized to be similar to the genes that the very first animals used to become multicellular.</p><p>Now, Levin et al. have studied a choanoflagellate called <italic>S. rosetta</italic>. This species is a good choice, as its genome sequence has been decoded and it is relatively easy to induce <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cells to switch between living on their own or living in spherical colonies called rosettes.</p><p>Using a technique known as ‘forward genetics’, Levin et al. bombarded <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cells with chemicals and X-rays to introduce genetic mutations into the cells. The mutated cells were then grown in conditions that would normally cause <italic>S. rosetta</italic> to form rosette colonies; the cells that continued to live in isolation in these conditions were then studied further, as this meant that mutations had occurred in the genes responsible for colony formation.</p><p>Levin et al. identified several mutant <italic>S. rosetta</italic> strains that cannot form rosettes. One of these mutant strains had an altered copy of a gene that Levin et al. named <italic>rosetteless</italic>. The protein produced by the <italic>rosetteless</italic> gene is similar to proteins that connect animal cells to one another in tissues and organs. Normally in rosettes this protein is found outside of the cells, in a secreted structure that joins the cells of the colony together. In the Rosetteless mutants, the protein is often incorrectly made and typically ends up on the wrong part of the cell. Levin et al. further confirmed the importance of the <italic>rosetteless</italic>-encoded protein by creating antibodies that stick to the protein and interfere with its function, thereby blocking rosette formation.</p><p>Unraveling the role of the <italic>rosetteless</italic> gene is an important step towards understanding which genes made it possible for single-celled organisms to evolve into complex multicellular animals. Future genetic screens in <italic>S. rosetta</italic> promise to reveal whether <italic>rosetteless</italic> is part of a network of genes and proteins which regulate animal development and could thus illuminate the molecular machinery behind multicellularity in the long-extinct predecessors of animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04070.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04070.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>choanoflagellate</kwd><kwd><italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic></kwd><kwd>multicellularity</kwd><kwd>C-type lectin-like</kwd><kwd>rosetteless</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM089977</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007631</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institute for Advanced Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The establishment of forward genetics in <italic>S. rosetta</italic> reveals the first gene known to be required for choanoflagellate multicellular development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The molecular mechanisms underlying animal multicellularity evolved, in part, through the modification of ancient adhesion and signaling pathways found in the unicellular and colonial progenitors of animals.

However, the roles of animal gene homologs in choanoflagellates have not been determined, and there have not been any published reports of successful disruptions to choanoflagellate gene function (including gene deletions, RNA interference, or transgene expression). Indeed, no direct functional links have yet been drawn between genotype and phenotype for any choanoflagellate gene or trait.

In wild-type cells, Rtls was highly enriched in the extracellular matrix-filled center of rosettes, where it was observed in a thick layer underlying the basal poles of all cells in the rosette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). While Rtls staining sometimes connected all cells in the center of rosettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), in most instances Rtls was observed to connect all but one pair of neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Because rosettes form through a process of incomplete cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fairclough et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dayel et al., 2011</xref>), this discontinuous Rtls staining may reflect the history of cell division during rosette formation, with discontinuities in its distribution indicating adjacent cells that were not sisters. We hypothesize that Rtls regulates rosette development by interacting with components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which has previously been shown to fill the center of rosettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dayel et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In wild-type single cells and chain colonies, the subcellular localization and apparent abundance of Rtls were notably different than in rosettes. Despite the fact that equivalent levels of Rtls were detected in lysates from rosette-induced and -uninduced cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), little to no Rtls signal was detected by immunofluorescence when wild-type single cells and chains were imaged with the settings used for visualizing Rtls in rosettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Because Rtls has a predicted secretion signal, it is possible that <italic>S. rosetta</italic> chain colonies and single cells released Rtls into their aquatic environment, where it may have been washed away during processing of cells for immunofluorescence. After increasing the gain used during confocal imaging, we were able to detect Rtls in cell membrane-associated patches in wild-type single cells and chains, but these patches were absent from Rosetteless mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The patches of Rtls localization were most often located near the basal pole of each cell, but were sometimes detected at the apical pole or along the lateral regions of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In no case was the Rtls staining in single cells or chains as intense as the Rtls staining observed in the cores of rosettes.</p><p>In summary, three findings demonstrate that Rtls function is necessary for and specific to rosette development: (1) the localization of Rtls protein is developmentally regulated and most abundant in the core of rosettes, (2) Rosetteless mutant cells fail to form rosettes but are otherwise wild type, and (3) secreted Rtls protein is essential for rosette development, while being dispensable during other stages of the <italic>S. rosetta</italic> life history.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The <italic>rosetteless</italic> gene is the only gene yet known to be required for choanoflagellate multicellular development. The molecular mechanisms by which Rtls regulates rosette formation remain unknown, but the developmentally regulated secretion of Rtls protein into the ECM-filled space in the center of rosettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) likely provides some important clues. Rtls may stabilize the connections between rosette cells by interacting with the ECM in a manner akin to the lecticans, a family of animal C-type lectins that stabilize cartilage and other connective tissues by cross-linking carbohydrates and proteins in the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ruoslahti, 1996</xref>). Such a role would be consistent with the observation that the Rosetteless mutant produces wild-type chain colonies, as one of the main differences between rosettes and chain colonies lies in the stability and mechanical robustness of rosettes as compared to chain colonies. A second possible hint regarding Rtls function stems from the fact that the Rtls CTLDs most closely resemble animal CTLDs that preferentially bind mannose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drickamer, 1992</xref>), such as mannose binding protein and pulmonary surfactant protein A, each of which functions in innate immunity as pattern recognition receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takahashi et al., 2006</xref>). Because rosette development is regulated by bacterial signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alegado et al., 2012</xref>), Rtls may play a role in substrate recognition and cell signaling. Future work on the biochemical and physiological roles of Rtls will enable the discovery of other proteins in the rosette development regulatory pathway, while also potentially providing insights into the ancestral functions of CTLD-containing proteins.</p><p>The discovery that Rosetteless regulates rosette development provides a starting point for investigating the relationship between animal and choanoflagellate multicellularity. CTLD-containing proteins have previously been shown to regulate cell adhesion and development in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reidling et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iba et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kulkarni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chin and Mlodzik, 2013</xref>), offering intriguing parallels with the role of the Rosetteless CTLD protein in the control of rosette development. However, the molecular functions of Rtls are currently unknown and it is therefore unclear whether they are conserved in animal CTLD-containing proteins. Moreover, while the genomes of diverse animals encode Rtls-like proteins containing a signal peptide, two C-type lectin-like domains, and serine-threonine-rich low complexity regions (e.g., the placozoan <italic>Trichoplax adhaerans</italic> (XP_002112548), the cnidarian <italic>Hydra vulgaris</italic> (XP_002155329), the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (NP_501369.1), and the fish <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (XP_005158004); relevant motifs detected by SMART, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Letunic et al., 2012</xref>]), it is not clear whether the similarities among these proteins and Rtls are the result of homology or convergent evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To obtain the high quality variant calls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), we removed all variants that were called with a quality score below 100 in addition to all variants that were called as heterozygous, since we expected these haploid genomes to yield homozygous calls. We focused on detecting single nucleotide variants (SNVs), because Rosetteless was isolated following EMS treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Identifying Rosetteless SNVs</title><p>After filtering the detected SNVs by quality score, we found that Rosetteless contained 25,160 high-quality SNVs, 25,143 of which (99.93%) were shared among Rosetteless and at least one of the wild-type strains (the parental strain and C2E5), meaning that they were segregating polymorphisms, which were unlikely to contribute to the Rosetteless phenotype. We experimentally validated all of the predicted Rosetteless-specific SNVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Short regions of genomic DNA flanking SNVs predicted to be unique to Rosetteless were amplified by PCR using a 1:1 mix of Taq (New England Biosciences, Ipswich, MA) and Pfu (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), gel extracted using the GeneClean II kit (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA), and analyzed by Sanger sequencing. SNVs were considered ‘verified’ if they were present in Rosetteless gDNA but absent from gDNA from the parental strain. The supercontig 8 splice donor mutation (<italic>rtls</italic><sup><italic>l1</italic></sup>) was the only Rosetteless-specific SNV predicted to alter a coding region, and we confirmed that this mutation was present in Rosetteless and absent from the parental strain by PCR and Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, when we attempted to verify the other 16 detected Rosetteless SNVs, only three were verified as polymorphic between Rosetteless and the parental strain. Of the remaining variants, three were false-positive variant calls in Rosetteless, two lay within regions of the reference genome that were misassembled, and eight were false-negative variant calls, where shared, segregating polymorphisms were not identified in the parental strain or the C2E5 wild-type strain. Thus despite the fact that the vast majority of called SNVs were high quality and independently called in all three samples, the enrichment of poor SNV calls in the Rosetteless-specific set meant that of the 17 potentially unique SNVs originally identified in the Rosetteless genome, there remained only four verified SNVs, including a predicted splice donor mutation at supercontig 8: position 427,804.</p><p>We were initially surprised to find such a small number of unique mutations in Rosetteless. However, it is possible that the EMS mutagenesis was ineffective prior to the isolation of Rosetteless, which is consistent with the fact that the Rosetteless mutagenesis did not result in substantial cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, despite the fact that Rosetteless was derived from a culture treated with EMS, it may in fact be a spontaneous mutant.</p><p>The raw reads for the SrEpac parental strain, the C2E5 wild-type co-isolate, and Rosetteless are publicly available (accession numbers SRX365844, SRX476076, and SRX476075, respectively).

Isolate B had been maintained as a diploid culture, which was not suitable for crossing to the haploid Rosetteless strain. However, as Isolate B exhibited genome-wide homozygosity, we reasoned that if we could induce Isolate B to undergo meiosis and generate an Isolate B haploid strain, this haploid strain would inherit the same predicted markers as the sequenced, diploid Isolate B strain. Thus, our first goal was to isolate a haploid strain from Isolate B.</p><p>Isolate B consists of <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cells that are fed <italic>A. machipongonensis</italic> bacteria and cultivated in CG media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levin and King, 2013</xref>). We induced Isolate B to become haploid by passaging the culture with a 1:2 or 1:5 dilution every 2 to 3 days in CG media for several weeks. Although Isolate B is typically thecate when diploid, this passaging regime resulted in a culture consisting mostly of rosettes. We measured the ploidy of the culture by flow cytometry as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levin and King (2013)</xref> and found that approximately 51% of the population was haploid. To establish a clonal, haploid line of Isolate B, we isolated cells by limiting dilution into 96-well plates containing 10% CG media in ASW. The probability of clonal isolation during this step was 0.93. We selected 12 isolates to expand into larger volumes and measured the ploidy of each clonal population by flow cytometry. We selected one isolate that consisted almost entirely of haploid cells to proceed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>Part 2: induction of mating</title><p>Our next goal was to induce mating between Rosetteless and the haploid Isolate B culture. <italic>S. rosetta</italic> mating can be induced by transferring a stationary phase culture to nutrient poor media for several days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levin and King, 2013</xref>). As <italic>S. rosetta</italic> can undergo both self-fertilization and outcrossed mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levin and King, 2013</xref>), we expected this procedure would generate a mixed population of cells that would include: (1) outcrossed heterozygous diploids containing both mutant and wild-type alleles, (2) homozygous diploids generated from the self-fertilization of either parental type, and (3) haploid, parental-type cells that never underwent mating. For the purposes of the cross, we were interested in only the outcrossed, heterozygous diploids. To enrich for these cells, we needed to both maximize the proportion of the population that was induced to mate and attempt to have an equal mix of Rosetteless and Isolate B cells present when mating occurred.</p><p>We first attempted to grow the Rosetteless and Isolate B cultures at similar rates through similar passaging regimes. The <italic>S. rosetta</italic> in Rosetteless and Isolate B are cultured with two different species of bacteria, so we added 1 ml of an <italic>A. machipongonensis</italic> liquid culture to Rosetteless and 1 ml of an <italic>E. pacifica</italic> liquid culture to Isolate B to ensure that both choanoflagellate cultures were fed to both bacterial species. The two isolates were passaged daily for 8 days to a starting cell density of 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/ml in 10 ml CG media. This was continued for 8 days. On the first 2 days, 1 ml of liquid <italic>E. pacifica</italic> culture in HN media was added to each isolate to encourage rapid growth.</p><p>On the ninth day, we set up the starvation conditions for the cross. We mixed the cells together by adding 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells from each culture to 9 ml CG media and 1 ml of liquid <italic>E. pacifica</italic> culture. The next day, the mixed culture was pelleted and resuspended in 10 ml ASW to starve the cells and induce mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levin and King, 2013</xref>). After 11 days of starvation in ASW, we measured the ploidy of the culture and found that approximately 75% of the cell population had become diploid, suggesting that mating had occurred. 3 ml of the starved culture was then added into 10 ml CG media and cells were subsequently passaged every 1–3 days for 8 days to revive the cultures from their starved state.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-3"><title>Part 3: identification of outcrossed diploids</title><p>Following mating, we isolated clones and identified cells that had undergone outcrossed mating through genotyping. We reasoned that genotyping each clone at three unlinked markers could provide evidence for meiosis through independent assortment, while also allowing for multiple, genetically distinct, progeny to be isolated from each flask. Because the chromosome number of <italic>S. rosetta</italic> has not been determined, we selected three markers, each on one of the three largest assembled supercontigs (2.5 Mb, 2.0 Mb, and 1.9 Mb in size), to help ensure that the markers would either be on different chromosomes or far enough apart to be unlinked.</p><p>We isolated clones by limiting dilution into twenty 96-well plates containing 10% CG media in ASW (vol/vol). The probability of clonal isolation in this step was 0.86. After 1 week of growth, 384 isolates were expanded into 4 ml 50% CG media in 6-well plates to accumulate enough biomass for genotyping. After 4–7 days growth, we pelleted 2 ml of the culture and extracted DNA using a base/Tris method as follows. We resuspended the pellet in 20 µl base solution (25 mM NaOH, 2 mM EDTA), transferred the sample into PCR plates, and boiled at 100°C for 20 min, followed by cooling at 4°C for 5 min. We then added 20 µl Tris solution (40 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5) and used 1 µl of this sample as the DNA template for each of our genotyping reactions.</p><p>To identify which clonal populations were the result of outcrossed mating (as opposed to self-mating), we genotyped each of the clonal isolates at three microsatellite markers that were polymorphic between the Rosetteless and Isolate B parental strains (gt_indel_2, gt_indel_7, and gt_indel_9; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Any clonal populations that had undergone outcrossed mating were expected to be heterozygous at all three markers, while those that did not mate or self-fertilized were expected to be homozygous at all three markers. Of the 384 genotyped clones, seven were heterozygous at all three markers, suggesting that these clones were the product of outcrossed mating. All remaining clones were homozygous at all three markers, but 372 clones were homozygous for the Isolate B alleles, while only three were homozygous for the Rosetteless alleles, raising the possibility that the Rosetteless mutant was less viable than Isolate B under the starvation conditions used to induce mating. Such differential viability may also explain the low rate of outcrossed mating, if few Rosetteless haploids survived to mate with Isolate B haploids. But despite the low frequency of outcrossed mating, we proceeded with the cross using the heterozygous diploids.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-4"><title>Part 4: induction of meiosis and initial isolation of haploid, meiotic progeny</title><p>We next induced meiosis in the outcrossed heterozygotes to complete the sexual life cycle and obtain recombinant, haploid progeny from the cross. We expanded the heterozygotes in 10 ml CG media and measured the ploidy of the cultures, expecting that the heterozygotes would form largely diploid population of cells. In four of the seven cultures, the population remained mostly diploid, whereas there was a substantial haploid population in the remaining three cultures, suggesting the meiosis had already occurred for a large subset of these cells. To ensure that we could isolate the products of independent meioses, we divided the four, mostly diploid cultures into ten total flasks and then passaged these cultures rapidly to induce meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levin and King, 2013</xref>). 1 ml of liquid <italic>E. pacifica</italic> culture was added to each flask. The ten flasks were passaged every 1–2 days for 7 days, scraping to dislodge thecate cells and adding liquid <italic>E. pacifica</italic> each time.</p><p>We next repeated the clonal isolation and genotyping steps, as above, to identify the haploid products of meiosis. We genotyped 288 clonal populations and identified 32 isolates (11%) that were homozygous at all three genotyped markers. All of these putatively haploid cultures formed either rosettes or chain colonies. We also identified 17 clonal cultures that were homozygous at some markers but heterozygous at others; these apparently diploid clones were presumably generated from the products of meiosis that later underwent a second round of mating before clonal isolation. Notably, the majority of the isolates (83%) were cultures of thecate cells that were heterozygous diploids and did not undergo meiosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-5"><title>Part 5: isolating additional haploid progeny</title><p>Based on the genotyping results from Part 4, we hypothesized that the differentiation into the thecate cell type was a morphological correlate of diploidy. Therefore, we thawed one of the original heterozygous diploid isolates and again attempted to induce meiosis, this time while excluding the thecate cells during passaging. After thawing the heterozygous isolate into 10% CG medium (vol/vol in ASW), we scraped the culture to dislodge thecate cells and immediately divided the culture into six flasks. We passaged each flask every 2 days without scraping to induce meiosis and select against the thecate cells. We then repeated the clonal isolation and genotyping steps as above for 154 clonal isolates, of which 150 were haploid progeny (97%). Of the 182 total haploid progeny, four were duplicates of other isolates (as they shared matching genotypes at &gt;90% of markers), and these were excluded from further analysis. Therefore, the mapping cross described here allowed for the isolation of 178 independent haploid progeny.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Rosetteless: dominant or recessive?</title><p>We sought to investigate whether the Rosetteless phenotype was dominant or recessive by examining the phenotypes of the heterozygotes isolated after mating Rosetteless to Isolate B.

The presence of rosettes (and absence of chain colonies) suggested that the Rosetteless phenotype might be recessive. However, culture conditions that favor rosette or chain colony development over the production of thecate cells (i.e., rapid passaging in nutrient-rich media) also favor meiosis, meaning that the rare rosette colonies could represent a minority of cells that had already undergone meiosis. Therefore, we were not confident that rosettes were developing from diploid cells and could not definitively determine whether the Rosetteless phenotype was dominant or recessive.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Linkage map construction</title><p>From the genome sequences of Rosetteless and Isolate B, we identified 39,451 putative polymorphic positions that could be used as markers to genotype the mapping cross.

In addition to the three microsatellite markers, the cross progeny were further genotyped at 57 markers using KASP technology (LGC Genomics, Beverly, MA; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We obtained genotype data for 91% of these reactions. Four of the cross isolates were duplicates of other isolates in the set and were excluded from further analysis. The program R/qtl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Broman et al., 2003</xref>) was used to construct a preliminary linkage map from the Rosetteless–Isolate B cross progeny. For each genotyping reaction, Rosetteless alleles were coded as ‘A’ and Isolate B alleles were coded as ‘H’ to emulate a backcross and allow for haploid genetics to be analyzed. We included in the linkage map the 60 markers that were genotyped in over 90 progeny and the data from the 175 non-duplicate individuals that were genotyped in at least 30 markers each. We constructed linkage groups using a maximum recombination fraction of 0.4 and a minimum LOD of 5 (i.e., 1 in 100,000 odds of linkage). Following linkage group construction by R/qtl, we used the physical linkage known from the <italic>S. rosetta</italic> genome assembly to manually link markers on the same supercontig into a single linkage group.

However, we observed some segregation distortion for 13 of the markers examined. Four of these markers had missing data for 50–80 of the genotyped progeny, suggesting that an error in calling one of the alleles may be responsible for the apparent distortion. We also observed segregation distortion for four of the supercontig 2 markers and the gt2 splice donor marker that were each genotyped in the majority of the haploid progeny. The Rosetteless phenotype and splice donor mutation were present in 82% of the isolated progeny (145/177), while the remaining progeny readily formed rosette colonies, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We believe this segregation distortion may be related to the Rosetteless phenotype itself. As chain colonies break up into many individual cells, it may be more likely that chain-forming cells will be selected during the clonal isolation process as compared to cells in rosettes. However, regardless of the cause of the segregation distortion, we concluded that the defect underlying the Rosetteless phenotype was tightly linked to the <italic>rtls</italic><sup><italic>l1</italic></sup> splice donor mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>RT-PCR and cloning of <italic>rtls</italic><sup><italic>l1</italic></sup> splice isoforms</title><p>We isolated RNA from the SrEpac parental strain and Rosetteless using the RNAqueous kit (Life Technologies) and prepared cDNA using oligo dT primers and Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Since many three-letter abbreviations have already been used for genes in other organisms, we propose the use of four-letter abbreviations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank K Drickamer, I Hariharan, J Rine, R Alegado, A Glazer, J Bosch, S Nichols, J Nelson, and members of the King laboratory for discussions and comments on the manuscript, J Carlisle for help with screening, and E Waters for help with molecular cloning.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This article by Levin et al., reports the first application of genetics to the model choanoflagellate species <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic>, a pre-metazoan model for animal development. This organism develops from a single cell form into a multi-cellular form (rosettes) in response to environmental cues from its prey bacterium. The authors recently discovered and now take advantage of an extant sexual cycle to conduct chemical and X-ray mutagenesis. Nine mutants were uncovered through painstaking ocular inspection. One, Rosetteless, was characterized in detail here. The authors took multiple approaches to define and characterize the causative mutation, including genetic linkage analysis, whole genome sequencing, and characterization of the impact of the mutation on splicing. A genetic linkage map was constructed for the first time and used to show that the mutation segregates as a single mendelian trait on supercontig 8. The authors show that the mutation alters splicing of a putative C-type lectin, and make the case that this predicted cell surface protein is the root of the genetic defect. These studies represent a tour de force development and application of genetics to a powerful pre-metazoan model system.</p><p>The general consensus is that your manuscript represents landmark work as it describes the use of genetics for the first time in this group of organisms, and provides key insights into the evolution of animal multicellularity. In essence, this manuscript reports both significant conceptual and technical advances consistent with the high standards that one has come to expect from an <italic>eLife</italic> paper. We recommend that the paper be accepted for publication, provided that the following concerns are satisfactorily addressed.</p><p>1) Demonstrate antibody specificity: As the <italic>rtls</italic> mutation cannot be complemented, the specificity of the Rtls antibody is fundamental to the arguments of this paper. Presently, antibody specificity has not been adequately demonstrated. For example, three key pieces of data rely on antibody specificity; Rtls antibody inhibition experiment, Rtls quantification in WT +/- bacteria media, and protein quantification in <italic>rtls</italic> mutants.</p><p>While the data are compelling that the antibody is recognizing the protein, one could take a skeptical view that since a Western blot is not shown recognizing a single protein of the correct mass in wild-type, and missing or truncated in mutants, that they may have simply generated an antibody that happens to bind the outside of Choanoflagellates inhibiting their cell-cell interaction, but not due to inhibiting the activity of Rtls. Demonstrating antibody specificity by Western blotting is required and is missing.</p><p>Related to this issue is the use of dot-blots for quantification. While these assays can be informative, they have significant limitations, especially regarding epiptope availability, uneven antibody adhesion, and uneven binding to the substrate. As such, they are generally not regarded as the best way to quantify the amount of protein in a sample. Rather, the standard is to perform Western blot analysis and use densitometry to quantify the amount of protein in the desired band. In combination with the lack of antibody specificity, the authors cannot be sure what the differences in intensity in the dot blots are the result of.</p><p>This manifests in the curious results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, which appears to have Rtls protein. However, the authors report earlier that they cannot detect appreciable amounts of properly spliced Rtls mRNA. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> shows that <italic>rtls</italic> mutants have ∼40% of the normal amount of protein. Is this due to truncated protein? Is their antibody not specific? Without a Western blot it is impossible to know what is actually being quantified. The authors do demonstrate that recombinant protein competes the antibody signal, but this raises a further question: what is the purity of the recombinant protein? A simple silver stained gel of the protein in the supplement would be informative, and again is typically reported when someone is reporting on the use of recombinant proteins.</p><p>In order to do this experiment correctly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5-figure supplement 1 B and C</xref> should be western blots with recombinant protein, whole cell lysates from WT, WT Alg, <italic>rtls</italic> and <italic>rtls</italic> + Alg. Parallel blots should be probed with both the pre-immune and immune sera.</p><p>2) Homology of Rtls to metazoan proteins: The reviewers wish to understand whether Rtls is a multicellularity gene, or whether it is specific for rosette development. Although knowledge of the homology or Rtls to metazoan protein is not absolutely necessary and will probably not change the current conclusions, the relative importance of the finding reported (the mutant <italic>rtls</italic>) changes depending on whether Rtls is homologous or not to animal CTLD-containing proteins. Thus, if Rtls happens to be homologous to animal C-type lectins, then this will be a clear example of co-option (of adhesion proteins/domains) taken place at the origin of the metazoan lineage. If it is not, the finding is mostly important to understand the specific development of choanoflagellate colonies. Either way the finding is important enough, but the wider implications change. Thus, this issue should be clarified in order for the reader to fully grasp the implications of the findings here reported. One option is to perform phylogenetic trees to see whether Rtls (or the Rtls CTLDs) is/are homologous to metazoan C-type lectin containing genes. If trees are not possible, maybe the authors could try blast similarity network analyses. At a minimum, the authors should consider expanding the discussion to include: 1) whether <italic>S. rosetta</italic> or other choanoflagellates have other types of C-type lectins, 2) whether Rtls is also present in the non-colonial choanoflagellate <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> (from which genome is available), 3) whether CTLDs are specific to animals and choanoflagellates or are they present in other more ancient eukaryotes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04070.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Demonstrate antibody specificity […]</italic></p><p><italic>2) Homology of Rtls to metazoan proteins […]</italic></p><p>We start by addressing the generation and specificity of the Rosetteless antibody. As requested, we have revised the text (described in detail below) to more clearly explain the nature of the Rosetteless antibody and the evidence for its specificity. In addition, we have added two new pieces of data: (1) a silver-stained gel documenting the purity of the recombinant Rosetteless used to compete with endogenous Rosetteless in tests of antibody specificity and (2) a Western showing that Rosetteless antibody recognizes the recombinant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>First, we wish to clarify some information on the design and generation of the antibody. The Rosetteless antibody was raised against an epitope that we predicted should be present in all wild type and mutant Rtls isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; orange bracket). Therefore, our measurements of protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) are expected to recognize both wild type and truncated versions of Rtls. To clarify this section of the Results, we have added the following text:</p><p>“To investigate endogenous Rtls protein in <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cells, we generated an antibody against residues 438–539, a region of the protein that is unique to Rtls and was expected to be present in all wild type and mutant Rtls isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). Using this antibody, we found that total Rtls protein levels in mutant cells were ∼25% that of wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B-D</xref>).”</p><p>We have also added the following section on Rtls epitope design to the Methods and provide the BLAST results below:</p><p>“The epitope is unique to Rtls and bears no resemblance to other predicted polypeptide sequences in <italic>S. rosetta</italic>; when the amino acid sequence of the epitope was used to search the full catalog of predicted <italic>S. rosetta</italic> proteins (using blastp), no other protein hit the epitope with an e-value less than 20 (i.e. the other hits were not statistically significant)”.<table-wrap id="tblu1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Target</th><th>Score (Bits)</th><th>Expect</th></tr><tr><th/><th/><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic><underline>S. rosetta</underline></italic><underline>: PTSG_03555.1: Rosetteless</underline></td><td>214.157</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td><italic><underline>S. rosetta</underline></italic><underline>: PTSG_04911.1: hypothetical protein</underline></td><td>25.794</td><td>22.958</td></tr><tr><td><italic><underline>S. rosetta</underline></italic><underline>: PTSG_08579.1: hypothetical protein</underline></td><td>25.794</td><td>27.127</td></tr><tr><td><italic><underline>S. rosetta</underline></italic><underline>: PTSG_06697.1: hypothetical protein</underline></td><td>25.409</td><td>34.553</td></tr><tr><td><italic><underline>S. rosetta</underline></italic><underline>: PTSG_11988.1: hypothetical protein</underline></td><td>25.024</td><td>46.272</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Unlike conventional antibodies, the anti-Rtls antibody was generated as a genomic antibody, using a process that involves the introduction into rabbits of a DNA construct encoding the epitope, rather than the injection of purified protein ([Brown, 2011]; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sdix.com/Products/Custom-Antibody-Services/Antibody-Development/Genomic-Antibody-Technology.aspx">http://www.sdix.com/Products/Custom-Antibody-Services/Antibody-Development/Genomic-Antibody-Technology.aspx</ext-link>). This means that there was no possibility of inadvertently introducing additional bacterial or choanoflagellate epitopes during antibody generation. After the rabbit antiserum was harvested, the antibody was also affinity purified and analyzed by ELISA by SDIX.</p><p>We now turn to a discussion of the evidence for the specificity of the Rosetteless antibody:</p><p>One of the gold standard methods for establishing antibody specificity is to show that the signal is present in wild type samples, but absent or altered in mutant or knock out samples. In the case of Rosetteless, the staining patterns detected by immunofluorescence microscopy in mutant and wild type cells were strikingly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), as were the levels of protein detected by dot blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). To summarize the main text, Rtls mutants are missing both the bright staining at the center of rosettes (because the mutants do not produce rosettes) and the fainter, cell-membrane associated patches found in wild type single cells and chains. By dot blot, the anti-Rtls signal was reduced in mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1C</xref>) even though the antibody should recognize both wild type and truncated Rtls isoforms. These differences between mutant and wild type detected by immunofluorescence microscopy and dot blot are most consistent with the interpretation that the majority of the antibody signal recognizes an epitope that is altered between mutant and wild type cells.</p><p>As an additional test of the specificity of the antibody, we used recombinant protein as a competitor during immunofluorescence and in dot blots. As requested by the reviewers, we have added documentation of the purity of the recombinant protein (by silver stain) and a Western blot of the recombinant protein as recognized by anti-Rtls to the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref>). The epitope has a predicted size of 38 kDa, and in our purifications it consistently appears at this size as a doublet, suggesting that some cleavage of the recombinant protein occurs in the bacteria. We indeed see this doublet as the predominant set of bands in the silver-stained recombinant protein sample and the only clear signal by Western blot.</p><p>In cells stained with the Rosetteless antibody, we see three main areas of immunofluorescence: (1) an extracellular meshwork in the center of rosettes, (2) in single cells and chains, a thin patch of membrane-associated staining that is most often found at the base of cells but sometimes seen in other parts of the cell, and (3) faint staining throughout the cell body in single cells and rosettes. If the Rosetteless antibody is pre-incubated with recombinant Rosetteless protein, the first two staining patterns (i.e. extracellular meshwork in center of rosettes and thin membrane-associated patches) disappear, presumably because those patterns result from antibody binding that specifically recognizes Rosetteless protein. The third pattern (i.e. faint staining throughout the cell body) persists following pre-incubation of the Rosetteless; we interpret this third pattern then to reflect either autofluorescence or non-specific staining. We are careful in the text to delineate that portion of the staining pattern that is specific to Rosetteless vs. that which reflects either autofluorescence or non-specific staining (in the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>): “In all cells following competition with the epitope there remained faint staining in the cell body; we thus infer that this is non-specific staining that does not reflect the distribution of Rtls protein in the cells”).</p><p>Finally, we agree with the reviewers that a Western of <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cell lysates would be a valuable contribution to our efforts to validate the Rosetteless antibody. Indeed, we have been trying to establish Rosetteless Westerns on <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cell lysates for the past 5 months. However, likely due to the nature of Rosetteless protein itself, our attempts at these Westerns have failed.</p><p>We find either that there is no signal or that the primary signal detected by the anti-Rtls antibody by Western blot is of a very high molecular weight protein that does not enter the gel. We believe that the explanation for this phenomenon lies in the predicted mucin-like domains of the Rtls protein; in similar S/T-rich regions, mucins are heavily glycosylated, making these proteins sticky and quite large [Harrop et al, 2011]. Indeed, because such ECM proteins may be decorated with a variable number of sugars and often undergo other forms of posttranslational processing (e.g. cleavage into active forms), a single band on a Western may not even be expected for this type of protein.</p><p>Still, we have made a number of attempts to modify our Western blotting protocol to accommodate heavily glycosylated proteins and solubilize the mucous-like <italic>S. rosetta</italic> lysate. These attempts include: 1) various cell lysis and solubilization methods; 2) syringing and other means of physical shearing; 3) pre-incubation of cell lysates with deglycosylases; 4) resuspension of lysate in 8M urea; and 5) the use of low-percentage acrylamide and acrylamide/agarose gels. However, in all attempts to date, we observe either a high molecular weight signal that does not enter the gel, or no signal at all.</p><p>Due to the challenges in working with fully glycosylated mucins, the use of dot blots for semi-quantitative analyses of mucin levels is not unusual [Harrop et al, 2011, Thomsson et al 2011]. Therefore, because Western analysis of Rosetteless in <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cell lysates has not yet been possible, we used dot blot analysis to measure the relative abundance of Rosetteless protein in wild type and mutant cells [Harrop et al, 2011, Thomsson et al 2011]. As the reviewers pointed out, dot blots are not ideal, as the high concentration of protein can lead to non-specific binding of antibodies and, because the proteins are not separated by size, it is not possible to see whether the source of the signal is from one protein or multiple proteins. Nonetheless, for proteins that do not properly enter into gels, it can provide a means by which to estimate their abundance. Similar to our procedure for validating the antibody by immunofluorescence, we used the pre-incubation of the recombinant epitope with anti-Rtls antibody to compete away the staining that specifically recognized the Rosetteless protein. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref>, we demonstrate that this pre-incubation results in the loss of the majority, but not all, of the signal by dot blot. We also showed the residual signal following competition in the main figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), and explained in the figure legend for this panel that it was only a “semi-quantitative” method, thereby acknowledging the limitations with dot blots.</p><p>In summary, although we have been unable to perform a Western analysis on <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cell lysates, we have a number of independent observations and experiments that are all consistent with the interpretation that the anti-Rtls antibody displays a high degree of specificity for Rtls protein.</p><p>We now discuss the relationship between Rosetteless protein and CTLD-containing proteins in animals:</p><p>We have generated a new figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>, to illustrate the diversity of CTLD-containing proteins in choanoflagellates. This figure shows the full domain architecture of all CTLD-containing proteins in the <italic>S. rosetta</italic> and <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> genomes, with similar animal CTLD domain architectures for comparison.</p><p>While Rtls may indeed be a multicellularity gene, we have not yet demonstrated this to be the case. We refrain from making this assertion because it is not currently possible to clearly assess the homology between Rtls and animal lectins. Specifically, the divergence time between animals and choanoflagellates means that orthology assignments often must be made on the basis of domain architecture and organization instead of amino acid alignments. This analysis cannot be convincingly carried out for Rtls, as its simple domain architecture is not sufficiently diagnostic. Finally, within animals, C-type lectins are a family of rapidly evolving genes that exhibit extensive duplications and rearrangements among taxa (e.g. [Sattler et al, 2012; Drickamer et al 1999]). It is thus not currently possible to assign clear orthology relationships among many of the animal C-type lectins, much less between animal C-type lectins and more evolutionarily distant CTLD-containing proteins found in choanoflagellates and other eukaryotes (e.g. [Wheeler et al, 2008]). We discuss the limitations in identifying homologous C-type lectins in the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
