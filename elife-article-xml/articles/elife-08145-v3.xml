An unanswered question is how polar septation activates a transcription factor (σ<sup>F</sup>) selectively in the small cell. We present evidence that the upstream regulator of σ<sup>F</sup>, the phosphatase SpoIIE, is compartmentalized in the small cell by transfer from the polar septum to the adjacent cell pole where SpoIIE is protected from proteolysis and activated. Polar recognition, protection from proteolysis, and stimulation of phosphatase activity are linked to oligomerization of SpoIIE. This mechanism for initiating cell-specific gene expression is independent of additional sporulation proteins; vegetative cells engineered to divide near a pole sequester SpoIIE and activate σ<sup>F</sup> in small cells. Thus, a simple model explains how SpoIIE responds to a stochastically-generated cue to activate σ<sup>F</sup> at the right time and in the right place.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08145.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08145.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08145.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>An important question in biology is how genetically identical cells activate different sets of genes. This is particularly perplexing for cells that rely on random events to specify the genes they switch on. Normally, cells of a bacterium called <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> divide symmetrically to produce two identical cells that express identical sets of genes. However, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells can also undergo a developmental program to form a spore to help it survive periods of extreme conditions. To do this, first a <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cell divides asymmetrically by placing the site of division close to a randomly selected end of the cell. This creates a smaller cell that becomes the spore and a larger cell that nurtures the developing spore. Each cell must turn on different genes to play its role in spore development, but how asymmetry in the position of cell division leads to these differences in gene expression has been a longstanding mystery.</p><p>Bradshaw and Losick studied a regulatory protein called SpoIIE, which is responsible for switching on genes in the small cell. SpoIIE is made before cells divide asymmetrically, but only accumulates in the small cell. The experiments revealed that an enzyme broke down the SpoIIE protein if it wasn’t in the small cell. This prevented SpoIIE from incorrectly switching on genes before division was completed or in the large cell.</p><p>Protection of SpoIIE from being broken down in the small cells was then shown to be linked to the placement of cell division; SpoIIE first accumulates at the asymmetrically positioned cell division machinery and then is transferred to a secondary binding site at the nearby end of the cell. Capture of SpoIIE at the end of the cell was coupled to its stabilization as SpoIIE molecules interacted with one another to form large complexes.</p><p>Together these findings provide a simple mechanism to link the asymmetric position of cell division to differences in gene expression. Future studies will focus on understanding how SpoIIE is captured at the end of the cell and how this prevents SpoIIE from being degraded.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08145.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08145.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>FtsH</kwd><kwd>PP2C protein phosphatase</kwd><kwd>asymmetric cell division</kwd><kwd>sigma factor</kwd><kwd>sporulation</kwd><kwd>stochasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM18568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Losick</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG 2051-10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bradshaw</surname><given-names>Niels</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Asymmetric cell division is linked to cell-specific transcription by handoff of a key developmental regulator from the cytokinetic machinery to the adjacent cell pole where it oligomerizes to become stabilized and activated.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>How genetically identical daughter cells adopt dissimilar programs of gene expression following cell division is a fundamental problem in developmental biology. A common mechanism for establishing cell-specific gene expression is asymmetric segregation of a cell fate determinant between the daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horvitz and Herskowitz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neumüller and Knoblich, 2009</xref>). In polarized cells, intrinsic asymmetry can be inherited from generation to generation.

To sporulate, cells place a division septum near a randomly chosen pole of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Veening et al., 2008</xref>) to create two unequally sized daughter cells with dissimilar programs of gene expression. The smaller cell, the forespore, which largely consists of the cell pole, will become the spore, whereas the larger cell, the mother cell, nurtures the developing spore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The σ<sup>F</sup> factor and the proteins that control it – SpoIIAB, SpoIIAA, and SpoIIE – are produced at the onset of sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gholamhoseinian and Piggot, 1989</xref>), but σ<sup>F</sup> is held inactive until the completion of asymmetric cell division, when it turns on gene expression selectively in the forespore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Margolis et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stragier and Losick, 1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). SpoIIAB is an anti-sigma factor that traps σ<sup>F</sup> in an inactive complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Min et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duncan and Losick, 1993</xref>). Escape from SpoIIAB is mediated by the anti-anti-sigma factor SpoIIAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diederich et al., 1994</xref>). SpoIIAA is, in turn, activated by SpoIIE, a member of the PP2C family of protein phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bork et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levdikov et al., 2011</xref>). SpoIIE converts the inactive phosphorylated form of SpoIIAA (SpoIIAA-P) to the active dephosphorylated form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duncan et al., 1995</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Dephosphorylation of SpoIIAA-P by SpoIIE is therefore the critical event in activating σ<sup>F</sup>. Understanding how SpoIIE reads out cellular cues to delay dephosphorylation of SpoIIAA-P until after septation and restrict phosphatase activity to the forespore is thus the central challenge in understanding how cell-specific gene transcription is established during sporulation.</p><p>SpoIIE consists of three domains: a PP2C phosphatase domain at the C-terminus, a ten-pass transmembrane domain at the N-terminus, and a 270-amino acid central domain (henceforth referred to as the regulatory domain) that is important for regulating SpoIIE compartmentalization and activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3"> Arigoni et al., 1999</xref>).

After septation is complete, SpoIIE is found principally in the forespore and to a limited extent at a second polar divisome near the distal cell pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08145.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SpoIIE degradation depends on FtsH.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SpoIIE is compartmentalized to the forespore.

This apparent contradiction led us to consider the possibility that spatially restricted proteolysis contributes to compartmentalization of SpoIIE. Selective stabilization of SpoIIE in the forespore coupled to efficient global degradation would enrich SpoIIE in the forespore despite ongoing transcription of <italic>spoIIE</italic> in predivisional cells and the mother cell. To investigate this hypothesis, we sought to determine if SpoIIE turns over on a timescale commensurate with σ<sup>F</sup> activation and, if so, to identify the responsible protease.</p><p>To detect SpoIIE degradation during sporulation, we monitored the disappearance of SpoIIE with a C-terminal FLAG tag following inhibition of translation with chloramphenicol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). SpoIIE-FLAG was degraded with a half-life of 7 min, demonstrating that SpoIIE is unstable relative to the approximately 1 hr progression of asymmetric cell division and σ<sup>F</sup> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and supporting spatially restricted degradation as a plausible mechanism to compartmentalize SpoIIE.</p><p>Next, we sought to identify the protease that degrades SpoIIE. We noticed that the gene (<italic>ftsH</italic>) for the transmembrane AAA+ protease FtsH is located near <italic>spoIIE</italic> in the genome with highly conserved synteny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, FtsH is known to degrade transmembrane protein substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama, 2009</xref>), making it an attractive candidate protease for SpoIIE. FtsH degrades several proteins that block entry into sporulation and prevent the expression of <italic>spoIIE</italic>, such as the Spo0A inhibitor Spo0E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Le and Schumann, 2009</xref>). We therefore engineered the synthesis of SpoIIE during vegetative growth to bypass the requirement for FtsH in the expression of <italic>spoIIE</italic>. In exponential phase cells deleted for <italic>ftsH</italic>, SpoIIE was stable for more than 1 hr after chloramphenicol treatment, whereas in <italic>ftsH</italic> cells SpoIIE was degraded as rapidly as during sporulation (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 7.1 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). (SpoIIE instability and its dependence on FtsH was also seen with untagged SpoIIE [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>]). We conclude that SpoIIE is degraded in an FtsH-dependent manner. The simplest explanation for this is that SpoIIE is a direct substrate for the protease.</p><p>Finally, we attempted to identify the feature or features of SpoIIE that renders it susceptible to proteolysis by FtsH. Truncation of the N-terminal, cytosolic tail of SpoIIE (removal of residues 11 to 37) blocked degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, ∆Tag), whereas removal of the regulatory domain or the phosphatase domain or substitution of the transmembrane domain with the first two transmembrane segments of <italic>E. coli</italic> MalF (MalF-TM) did not impede FtsH-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Additionally, the first 37 amino acids of SpoIIE (Tag<sup>SpoIIE</sup>) were sufficient to confer FtsH-dependent degradation on a heterologous protein, MalF-TM-FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Therefore, the N-terminal tail of SpoIIE is a tag that is both necessary and sufficient for FtsH-dependent proteolysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Degradation restricts SpoIIE and σ<sup>F</sup> activity to the forespore</title><p>To test whether SpoIIE degradation is required for compartmentalization of σ<sup>F</sup> activity and SpoIIE, we examined the effect of blocking degradation during sporulation.

Thus, stabilization of SpoIIE only partially uncouples σ<sup>F</sup> activation from cell division.</p><p>Consistent with the idea that degradation contributes to compartmentalization of σ<sup>F</sup> activity by helping to restrict SpoIIE to the forespore, we observed a striking correlation between elevated levels of ∆Tag-SpoIIE in the mother cell and mis-activation of σ<sup>F</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> bottom panels). Together, these data indicate that SpoIIE degradation is required for compartmentalization both of SpoIIE and σ<sup>F</sup> activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><bold>SpoIIE mutants blocked in compartmentalization and</bold> σ<sup>F</sup> <bold>activation</bold></title><p>How is SpoIIE selectively stabilized in the forespore? We considered two models: (1) FtsH is not active in the forespore, or (2) specific features of SpoIIE stabilize it in the forespore. To test the former possibility, we engineered the production of the model FtsH substrate Tag<sup>SpoIIE</sup>-MalF using a forespore specific, σ<sup>F</sup>-dependent promoter. Tag<sup>SpoIIE</sup>-MalF was rapidly degraded in a manner dependent on the Tag<sup>SpoIIE</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore FtsH is active in the forespore, suggesting that SpoIIE is specifically stabilized against FtsH-dependent degradation.</p><p>To identify features of SpoIIE required for its accumulation in the forespore, we screened for SpoIIE variants defective in compartmentalization. We created amino acid substitutions of the most highly conserved residues in SpoIIE and tested these variants (and previously described variants) for function in sporulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>) and forespore accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To monitor accumulation in the forespore of each SpoIIE variant, we compiled average profiles of SpoIIE-YFP along the long axis of hundreds of cells that had undergone polar division. Through this analysis, we identified nine variants of SpoIIE (for example SpoIIE<sup>K356D</sup>) that were absent in the forespore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref> blue) and accumulated to reduced levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Variants with normal compartmentalization, in contrast, accumulated at approximately wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref> black). Supporting the idea that failure to accumulate in the forespore was due to unrestricted, FtsH-dependent degradation, removal of Tag<sup>SpoIIE</sup> restored these SpoIIE mutant proteins to levels several-fold higher than for wild-type SpoIIE and equivalent to ∆Tag SpoIIE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

We chose this mutant because the K356D substitution was located in the regulatory domain of SpoIIE and caused a particularly severe sporulation defect.

The coordinated rescue of these phenotypes by a single amino acid substitution supports our model that a common feature of SpoIIE mediates protection from proteolysis, accumulation in the forespore, and activation of σ<sup>F</sup>.</p><p>The other intragenic suppressors of SpoIIE<sup>K356D</sup> were substitutions at V697 (V697A and V697F), which is located in the phosphatase domain of SpoIIE. V697A had been independently isolated previously and shown to cause premature activation of σ<sup>F</sup> (in the absence of the K356D substitution) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilbert and Piggot, 2003</xref>). These suppressors were not allele specific; V697A suppressed all other mutants of SpoIIE, including the compartmentalization defective SpoIIE<sup>S361F</sup> mutant and the compartmentalized SpoIIE<sup>Q483A</sup> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carniol et al., 2004</xref>]). The V697A substitution did not restore compartmentalization or stabilization of SpoIIE.

All together, these results suggest that the V697A substitution locks the phosphatase domain in a high activity state, bypassing the activation defect of SpoIIE<sup>K356D</sup>. Indeed, biochemical experiments showed that the V697A substitution enhanced the activity of SpoIIE in dephosphorylating SpoIIAA-P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SpoIIE is compartmentalized and stabilized by binding to the cell pole</title><p>To further investigate the mechanism of SpoIIE compartmentalization, we took advantage of the compartmentalization-defective variant SpoIIE<sup>K353D</sup> and revisited the localization of stabilized SpoIIE. To isolate events prior to σ<sup>F</sup> activation, and because certain targets of σ<sup>F</sup> (e.g. <italic>spoIIQ</italic>) affect the localization of SpoIIE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campo et al., 2008</xref>), we used a mutant lacking σ<sup>F</sup> to analyze the localization of SpoIIE, ∆Tag-SpoIIE, and its K353D mutant derivative (in contrast to the experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> in which cells were σ<sup>F+</sup>).</p><p>Our most striking observation was that ∆Tag-SpoIIE was noticeably enriched at the poles of cells that had not initiated polar division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Because the forespore is derived from the cell pole, we hypothesized that the pole is a landmark that directs SpoIIE compartmentalization. In support of this idea, polar localization was abolished by the K356D substitution and partially restored by the T353I suppressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> lower panel).

To address this question, we engineered the synthesis of SpoIIE-YFP and ∆Tag SpoIIE-YFP in vegetative cells that were blocked in divisome formation through the use of the FtsZ inhibitor MciZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Handler et al., 2008</xref>). We observed that ∆Tag SpoIIE-YFP was enriched at the ends of these cells, and this localization recapitulated the features of polar localization seen during sporulation: polar localization was only observed for stabilized SpoIIE, was blocked by K356D substitution, and was restored by the T353I suppressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Therefore, a fundamental, constitutive feature of the cell pole mediates SpoIIE polar localization.</p><p>We next sought to identify the feature of the pole that is responsible for SpoIIE localization. DivIVA recognizes the negative curvature of the cell pole and directs the polar localization of several other proteins during growth and sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lenarcic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ramamurthi and Losick, 2009</xref>). Recently, DivIVA was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with SpoIIE, making it an attractive candidate to anchor SpoIIE to the cell pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eswaramoorthy et al., 2014</xref>). We found that whereas wild-type SpoIIE co-immunoprecipitated with DivIVA from extracts of sporulating cells (as previously observed), SpoIIE<sup>K356D</sup> did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Additionally ∆Tag SpoIIE-YFP polar localization during vegetative growth was abolished by a <italic>divIVA</italic> deletion (in the background of a <italic>minD</italic> deletion to suppress the cell division defect of <italic>divIVA</italic> deletion) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, DivIVA directly or indirectly anchors SpoIIE at the cell pole and can do so independently of sporulation. Based on the result with the K356D mutant, we further propose that this anchoring serves to stabilize, compartmentalize and activate SpoIIE, and that these activities are linked through a common feature of SpoIIE.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The divisome competes with the cell pole for binding of SpoIIE</title><p>During sporulation, SpoIIE first accumulates at the polar divisome, constricts along with the septum and then is released into the forespore following the completion of cytokinesis (as shown by time-lapse and structured illumination microscopy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that the divisome competes with the pole for SpoIIE binding and that SpoIIE is not free to associate with the pole until the divisome is disassembled. To investigate this model, we monitored SpoIIE localization in the background of a temperature-sensitive allele of <italic>divIC</italic> that stalls cell division after divisome formation but before cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levin and Losick, 1994</xref>). In this background, SpoIIE-YFP and ∆Tag SpoIIE-YFP localized to the divisome (as visualized with a ZapA-CFP fusion) but not to the cell pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Similarly, when cytokinesis was blocked during sporulation by a <italic>divIB</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>), ∆Tag SpoIIE-YFP localized to the divisome but not to the cell pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Therefore, the divisome sequesters and prevents SpoIIE from associating with the cell pole. We conclude that SpoIIE has affinity for two subcellular sites: the divisome, its dominant binding site, and the pole, where it is captured only after release from the divisome after the completion of cytokinesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>SpoIIE is compartmentalized in vegetative cells engineered to divide asymmetrically</title><p>The results discussed above suggest a simple model for how SpoIIE and σ<sup>F</sup> activity are compartmentalized in the forespore. We propose that SpoIIE is sequestered at the asymmetrically positioned divisome and is released and captured at the proximal (forespore) pole when cytokinesis is completed. In support of this idea, cells that cannot synthesize additional SpoIIE molecules in the forespore nonetheless robustly compartmentalize SpoIIE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Asymmetric compartmentalization of SpoIIE in the forespore could be achieved by virtue of the close proximity of the divisome and the forespore pole. Weak SpoIIE association with the pole would be compensated for by the small volume of the forespore and reinforced by protection from degradation by FtsH. Finally, any SpoIIE released into the mother cell would be captured at the divisome, preventing capture at the mother cell pole. Thus, a simple model explains how SpoIIE is protected from degradation and compartmentalized in the forespore only after cytokinesis is complete.</p><p>The heart of this model is that asymmetric positioning of the division septum is all that is necessary for compartment specific stabilization and activation of SpoIIE. To test this prediction, we sought to compartmentalize SpoIIE in cells that had been engineered to undergo polar division independently of sporulation. To do so, we artificially expressed <italic>spoIIE</italic> and overexpressed <italic>ftsAZ</italic> in vegetative cells, which was previously demonstrated to reposition the division septum from the mid-cell to near the pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Yehuda and Losick, 2002</xref>). To preclude transcription of sporulation-specific genes, we additionally deleted the master regulator for entry into sporulation, <italic>spo0A</italic>. We then visualized the localization of SpoIIE in these cells. As predicted by our model, cells enriched for SpoIIE were much smaller than average for the entire population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Further, to ask whether this compartmentalization of SpoIIE was sufficient to direct cell-specific activation of σ<sup>F</sup>, we additionally induced synthesis of σ<sup>F</sup> and its regulators SpoIIAA (the anti-anti σ<sup>F</sup> factor substrate for the SpoIIE phosphatase) and SpoIIAB (the anti-σ<sup>F</sup> factor) in a strain harboring a reporter for σ<sup>F</sup> activity. Remarkably, σ<sup>F</sup> was activated with high selectivity in a subpopulation of the minicells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). We conclude that polar division is the only feature of sporulation necessary to restrict SpoIIE protein and activity to the small cell and that this is sufficient to explain compartmentalized activation of σ<sup>F</sup>.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08145.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Repositioning the septum in vegetative cells is sufficient for compartmentalization of SpoIIE.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the top image, vegetatively growing cells producing SpoIIE-GFP and overexpressing the <italic>ftsZ</italic> operon formed minicells enriched for SpoIIE-GFP (strain RL5930).

We found that the 13-amino acid interval from residues 345 to 358 contained a feature required for multimerization; although SpoIIE truncated to residue 345 (SpoIIE<sup>345-827</sup>) multimerized, all truncations extending to 358 (SpoIIE<sup>358-827</sup>) and beyond did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This region encompasses K356, raising the possibility that K356D might block stabilization and activation of SpoIIE at the pole by blocking multimerization, and that T35I might suppress the phenotypes of K356D by restoring multimermization. Indeed, gel filtration experiments confirmed that SpoIIE<sup>320-827, K356D</sup> did not multimerize and that T353I partially restored multimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Of all the SpoIIE variants analyzed, the K356D substitution uniquely blocked multimerization, highlighting a key role for the N-terminal region of the regulatory domain in mediating multimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In sum, these biochemical experiments in conjunction with the in vivo experiments described above lead us to propose that multimerization of SpoIIE is the critical transition that stabilizes SpoIIE, enabling it to recognize the cell pole and leading to its activation as a phosphatase. First, we found that multimerization is required for stabilization of SpoIIE and compartmentalization of SpoIIE to the forespore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4B,C—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, removal of Tag<sup>SpoIIE</sup> uncoupled multimerization from degradation, and revealed an additional link between SpoIIE activation and multimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Finally, we found that recognition of the cell pole by SpoIIE also depended on multimerization, even when SpoIIE was synthesized in vegetative cells uncoupled from degradation and σ<sup>F</sup> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A hallmark of sporulation is a process of asymmetric division that creates a septum near one randomly selected pole of the cell. Polar placement of the septum directs the protein phosphatase SpoIIE to activate σ<sup>F</sup> in the resulting forespore. How SpoIIE activates σ<sup>F</sup> at the right time and in the right place has been one of the enduring mysteries of this developmental system. As the end of the cell used for asymmetric division is chosen without regard to whether it is the old or new pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Veening et al., 2008</xref>), the cues that SpoIIE interprets to achieve cell-specific activation of σ<sup>F</sup> must arise de novo, that is, from the position of the septum rather than from preexisting asymmetry. Indeed, our results show that no feature of the sporulation process other than polar placement of the septum is necessary for compartmentalizing SpoIIE and for cell-specific activation of σ<sup>F</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, as transcription of <italic>spoIIE</italic> commences prior to asymmetric division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fujita and Losick, 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), SpoIIE must also respond to temporal cues to ensure it is not active prior to the completion of cytokinesis.</p><p>Here we have provided evidence for a model in which SpoIIE leverages the asymmetric position of the septum to selectively associate with the adjacent cell pole of the forespore where it is stabilized and activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Three key features of our model are as follows:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Capture at the cell pole</italic>. SpoIIE initially accumulates at the polar divisome and is handed off to the forespore pole following cytokinesis. Sequential transfer is enforced by preferential binding to the divisome over the cell pole, and we propose that selectivity for the forespore is achieved by the divisome being immediately adjacent to the forespore pole and that the forespore is largely derived from the pole. Additionally, SpoIIE not captured in the forespore would be sequestered at the distal divisome in the newly formed mother cell, preserving asymmetry.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Spatially restricted proteolysis.</italic> SpoIIE is degraded by the AAA+ protease FtsH and is selectively stabilized in the forespore. This ensures that SpoIIE does not accumulate or become active prior to asymmetric division or in the mother cell following asymmetric division.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Oligomerization</italic>. Polar recognition, protection from FtsH, and activation as a phosphatase are linked by a transition that takes place at the pole and is mediated by oligomerization.</p></list-item></list><p>Together these three features provide a simple mechanism for how cues derived from asymmetric cell division restrict SpoIIE to the forespore and couple σ<sup>F</sup> activation to the completion of cytokinesis. At the same time our model raises several unanswered questions important both for understanding sporulation and diverse related biological systems.</p><p>How does SpoIIE localize to the cell pole and the divisome? Localization to the divisome depends on FtsZ and FtsA, the earliest assembling proteins to define the divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Levin et al., 1997</xref>). But whether SpoIIE interacts with these proteins directly, what features of SpoIIE mediate divisome association, and how SpoIIE influences FtsZ polymerization and divisome maturation are unknown. Answering these questions will help us to understand how SpoIIE is transferred from the divisome to the cell pole as well as how SpoIIE influences the position of the division septum. Similarly, localization to the pole depends on DivIVA, which directly senses the shape of the pole and acts as an organizing center for other pole-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lenarcic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ramamurthi and Losick, 2009</xref>). But it is not known whether this interaction is direct or depends on an accessory protein.</p><p>How does oligomerization of SpoIIE promote σ<sup>F</sup> activation? Genetic and biochemical evidence are consistent with a model in which stabilization, compartmentalization, and activation of SpoIIE are linked by oligomerization of SpoIIE molecules and that this oligomerization takes place in the forespore after asymmetric division. We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that oligomerization commences earlier in sporulation and that some other unrecognized feature of SpoIIE is additionally required for its transition to a stable and active state in the forespore. Structural information about the organization of SpoIIE oligomers and an in vivo assay for oligomerization may help distinguish between these possibilities and yield new insights into how it contributes to compartment specific σ<sup>F</sup> activation.</p><p>How is activation of σ<sup>F</sup> coordinated with the completion of asymmetric cell division? Our model proposes two mechanisms to prevent predivisional activation of σ<sup>F</sup>: First, the features of the forespore (small size, high concentration of cell pole, and proximity to the divisiome) that promote SpoIIE stabilization and σ<sup>F</sup> activation are all emergent properties that depend on completion of cell division. Second, competition between the divisome and cell pole for binding to SpoIIE prevents premature accumulation and activation of σ<sup>F</sup>. Although there has been uncertainty about when SpoIIE is released from the divisome and when asymmetry in SpoIIE compartmentalization is established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eswaramoorthy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lucet et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 1998</xref>), our time-lapse imaging and structured illumination microscopy indicate that SpoIIE constricts along with the FtsZ ring during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is consistent with our model that SpoIIE remains sequestered at the divisome until cytokinesis is completed. In the future it will be important to determine just how association with the divisome prevents SpoIIE from oligomerizing and activating σ<sup>F</sup>.</p><p>How is SpoIIE protected from degradation in the forespore? We have shown that the N-terminal tail of SpoIIE is necessary and sufficient for FtsH-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>) and that stabilization in the forespore is mediated by features of SpoIIE that are required for interaction with the cell pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Additionally, we have presented evidence that multimerization of SpoIIE is required for both stabilization and interaction with the pole. One possibility is that multimerization shields the Tag<sup>SpoIIE</sup> from FtsH as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>. Alternatively, as FtsH has been shown to have weak unfoldase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herman et al., 2003</xref>), multimerization might render SpoIIE resistant to FtsH unfolding and hence proteolysis. Finally, although we favor the view that SpoIIE is directly recognized by FtsH, it is conceivable that it requires an adaptor as is the case for some substrates of AAA+ proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gottesman, 2003</xref>). If so, SpoIIE could be protected from degradation by negative regulation of the adaptor.</p><p>How is the phosphatase activity of SpoIIE regulated? Our genetic analysis provides clues for how activation occurs. We found that the V697A substitution locks SpoIIE in a high activity state in vitro, and restores σ<sup>F</sup> activity in mutants defective for compartmentalization and σ<sup>F</sup> activation. V697 is in an active site proximal loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levdikov et al., 2011</xref>); in many PP2C phosphatases this loop coordinates a third manganese ion that is critical for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Su et al., 2011</xref>). However, SpoIIE lacks the aspartate that coordinates this manganese, which could indicate that V697A locks the phosphatase in a conformation that compensates for the missing manganese ion. Additionally, we found that the stimulation of phosphatase activity (and binding to the pole) is genetically linked to multimerization: oligomerization, and σ<sup>F</sup> activation were blocked by the substitution K356D and restored by T353I. We therefore speculate that multimerization induces a conformational change that organizes the catalytic center, compensating for the missing manganese and activating the phosphatase. A test of our hypothesis for a multimerization-dependent conformational change in the active site will require reconstituting multimerization-dependent activation of SpoIIE in vitro. Other PP2C phosphatases, such as the tumor suppressor protein PHLPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2005</xref>), similarly lack the aspartate to coordinate a third magnesium ion, suggesting that our speculation, if correct, could represent a more general regulatory mechanism for PP2C phosphatases.</p><p>In summary, we propose that the asymmetrically positioned division machinery – the de novo-generated source of asymmetry – positions SpoIIE to be captured at the adjacent cell pole, triggering σ<sup>F</sup>-directed gene expression in the forespore. Capture at the pole, proteolytic stabilization and stimulation of the phosphatase all depend on oligomerization of SpoIIE. Thus, three interlinked regulatory events are sufficient to explain how SpoIIE exploits a stochastically generated spatial cue to the cell-specific activation of a transcription factor.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and strain construction</title><p><italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains were constructed in PY79 using standard molecular genetic techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harwood and Cutting, 1990</xref>).

Your submission has been evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision.</p><p>The reviewers each felt that this was a clearly written manuscript that provided some new insight in the mechanism by which SpoIIE activates σ<sup>F</sup> in the forespore of developing <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. However, there were several major concerns about the conclusions and model proposed that limited enthusiasm for the paper. After extensive discussion between the reviewers, the consensus was that the paper is not suitable for <italic>eLife</italic> unless the model proposed can be further substantiated through additional experiments and analysis, as summarized below. If each of the issues below can be addressed, we would consider a revised manuscript, subject to an additional round of peer review.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> raised several questions. First, the fact that SpoIIE was apparently active in the mother cell simply by eliminating FtsH-dependent degradation implies that the proposed change in SpoIIE oligomerization during spore formation may not be so critical to its activation. Second, it was noted that the authors haven't shown whether the activation that occurs in mother cells depends on cell division. It has previously been reported that overexpressing SpoIIE bypasses the requirement for cell division (Arigoni et al., 1999), which, with other data, led the authors to suggest that compartmentalization of σ<sup>F</sup> activity occurred via the exclusion of an inhibitor (perhaps FtsH) from the forespore, so testing dependence is critical. These two issues should be addressed.</p><p>2) Central to the model proposed is the notion that SpoIIE's oligomerization state changes following compartmentalization. The authors must show a change in oligomerization state in vivo during sporulation, e.g. by using sucrose gradients to directly monitor oligomerization.</p><p>3) It is odd that stabilizing the mutant SpoIIE variants by removing the N-terminal tag does not restore σ<sup>F</sup> activity. If the only role of oligomerization is to protect SpoIIE from proteolysis, then removal of the degradation tag should bypass the need for oligomerization and restore σ<sup>F</sup> activity, even if it's no longer compartment-specific. This result suggests that the point mutants have independent defects in activating the phosphatase domain, or that oligomerization itself is necessary for activation. These predictions can be tested in part by analyzing the oligomeric state of their mutants in vitro and by showing oligomerization-dependent protease activity in vitro. In sum, it was not clear whether oligomerization of SpoIIE was protecting it against FtsH-dependent degradation or activating phosphatase activity, or both.</p><p>4) The authors need to somehow demonstrate more directly that SpoIIE-YFP at the divisome is transferred to the nearby cell pole. Although the genetics and cell biology presented were consistent with this conclusion, a direct demonstration of the &quot;handoff&quot; being postulated is needed, perhaps by photoactivation and single particle tracking. Additionally, it wasn't clear whether SpoIIE was really being &quot;handed off&quot; or whether SpoIIE potentially just relocalizes from the septum to the pole via release, diffusion, and capture. The word &quot;handoff&quot; implies a more active mechanism, so the mechanism and wording should be clarified throughout the paper.</p><p>5) The authors need a more thorough discussion of the SpoIIE literature and an attempt to work towards an integrated model. This issue arose in two contexts. First: SpoIIE requires FtsZ to localize to the septum, but not DivIC. Interestingly, in a <italic>divICts</italic> mutant, there are no septa, but SpoIIE is active, producing dephosphorylated SpoIIAA, but apparently not at a high enough concentration to disrupt the SpoIIAB-σ<sup>F</sup> complex (Carniol et al. 2004, Feucht 2002). How can these results be reconciled with the model here? Second: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and the Introduction (fourth paragraph) state that SpoIIE constricts during cell division. This conflicts with recent data in Eswaramoorthy 2014, which used super resolution microscopy to demonstrate that SpoIIE does not constrict together with the divisome, but rather stays at the edge of the septal disk <italic>and</italic> that SpoIIE is biased towards the forespore side of the septum immediately after cell division and before relocalization to the pole.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) Does the MalF-TM chimera accumulate properly in the forespore, activate σ<sup>F</sup>, and support wild-type sporulation efficiency? These results would define the contribution of the transmembrane segments to SpoIIE function. If these results have been published previously, they should be mentioned in the Discussion.</p><p>2) The authors identified amino acid substitutions in the regulatory domain of SpoIIE which cause sporulation defects and defects in σ<sup>F</sup> activation, but are not mislocalized. The authors should use these mutants to strengthen the prediction that oligomerization is required for SpoIIE localization in the forespore. In particular, mutants that cannot activate σ<sup>F</sup> but are properly localized would be expected to oligomerize properly.</p><p>3) The SpoIIE variant C399A has very low SpoIIE levels, mislocalized SpoIIE protein, and nearly undetectable transcription driven by σ<sup>F</sup>, yet it only has a ten-fold decrease in sporulation efficiency. The authors should discuss this apparent discrepancy in phenotypes.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In the absence of colocalization with FtsZ or with membrane staining, it is unclear how the SpoIIE localization pattern correlates with division during this timelapse.</p><p>5) The frequency with which σ<sup>F</sup> activity is observed in single cells versus in the mother cell of sporangia should be scored and shown.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Many of the cells that have uncompartmentalized σ<sup>F</sup> activity lack sporulation septa. Does activation of σ<sup>F</sup> in this case depend on cell division? Or does stabilizing SpoIIE lead to σ<sup>F</sup> activation in predivisional cells? The frequency of the various cell types should be shown.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The legend states that &quot;the contrast [for ΔTag-SpoIIE] is approximately 5X brighter for SpoIIE-YFP.&quot; The authors must mean that the fluorescence intensity is 5X greater than SpoIIE-YFP.</p><p>8) The supplement for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> should include a few representative sporangia that are stained with FM4-64. The spore titers should be presented in standard scientific notation. 4.2 X108.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. The graphs showing the frequency with which σ<sup>F</sup> is activated in minicells does not accurately convey the data. How many total minicells were scored? What fraction had IIE? σ<sup>F</sup> activity? The data would likely best be presented in table format, so that the precise number of the various types of minicells counted is clear. If it is to be presented in a graphical format, the Y-axis should be labeled and the numbers of each cell type presented.</p><p>10) Additional images and quantification is necessary for the cell biological data, so that it is clear how often σ<sup>F</sup> is activated before polar septation versus active in the mother cell.</p><p>11) Introduction, fourth paragraph: what does 'a central regulatory domain' mean? Is it a domain that regulates SpoIIE or that is involved in regulating SpoIIAA? It isn't clear at this point of the paper – eventually there is some evidence that emerges that this domain may affect multimerization status and hence activity of the phosphatase domain, but I think the authors should clarify much earlier.</p><p>12) In the subsection “SpoIIE is degraded by FtsH”, second paragraph: Stability of SpoIIE is monitored using a C-terminal FLAG tag. But this tagging could interfere with stability as protein termini often play critical roles in protease activity. This issue should be addressed by examining native SpoIIE stability somehow and by demonstrating the functionality of the tagged SpoIIE.</p><p>13) In the subsection “SpoIIE is degraded by FtsH”, end of third paragraph: What's the evidence that degradation is &quot;likely&quot; direct? Additional evidence is needed or the conclusion should end at SpoIIE being degraded in an FtsH-dependent manner. On a related note: the title of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (&quot;SpoIIE is degraded by FtsH&quot;) and comments in the Discussion (second and fifth paragraphs) should be adjusted given the data shown.</p><p>14) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>/E: Should be shown on a semi-log plot.</p><p>15) In the subsection “SpoIIE mutants blocked in compartmentalization and σ<sup>F</sup> activation”, last paragraph: The evidence here that SpoIIE transitions from a hypothetical &quot;active&quot; state to an &quot;inactive&quot; state is weak. It could be that the compartmentalization defective mutants are also disrupted in phosphatase activity, but that phosphatase activity is constitutive. In other words, the mutants identified may prevent SpoIIE from being degraded and from being a proper phosphatase – I don't see the logic that SpoIIE must be transitioning from one state to another in terms of catalytic activity inside the forespore. The simplest test of the authors' idea is to examine in vitro the phosphatase activity of SpoIIE and the various compartmentalization-defective SpoIIE mutants.</p><p>16) In the subsection “An allele-specific suppressor of SpoIIE<sup>K356D</sup>”, first paragraph: The 'regulatory domain' still remains ill-defined at this stage of the manuscript and its function/role opaque to all but the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> aficionado.</p><p>17) In the subsection “An allele-specific suppressor of SpoIIE<sup>K356D</sup>”, first paragraph: As above (point number 15), it doesn't seem necessary to invoke the notion that SpoIIE's activity as a phosphatase is regulated. It could be that it is just the proteolysis of SpoIIE that is regulated with spore-specific stabilization.</p><p>18) In the subsection “An allele-specific suppressor of SpoIIE<sup>K356D</sup>”, last paragraph: Did the authors really test full-length SpoIIE phosphatase activity or a fragment of SpoIIE lacking the TM and potentially other domains? I would have guessed the latter, but the Methods section doesn't provide enough details. If it really is full-length protein, how are the multiple TM helices dealt with?</p><p>19) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>: Why does the very bright focus not show up in the line scan? More to the point: this bright focus seems to imply that ΔTag SpoIIE-YFP mainly accumulates away from the pole.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Asymmetric Division Triggers Cell-Specific Gene Expression Through Coupled Capture and Stabilization of a Phosphatase&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer. The manuscript has been greatly improved but there is still one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors tried, at the reviewers’ request, to generate data supporting the notion that SpoIIE makes a change in oligomeric state during sporulation. As noted in their responses, this did not work and apparently both sucrose gradient fractionation and co-IPs from merodiploid strains indicated that SpoIIE is oligomeric, even in the presence of the K356D mutation. Two points here:</p><p>1) Did the authors examine oligomerization via sucrose gradients as a function of development to test whether oligomeric state changes, as postulated? This seems just as important to test as the K356D mutant. And if the experiment was done, it should probably be shown or at least discussed in the paper (see next point as well).</p><p>2) The paper, as written, leaves the reader with the feeling that the transition in oligomeric state is known with more certainty than it really is e.g. in the Discussion it states that 'We have presented evidence that multimerization of SpoIIE is a critical transformation'. While I definitely agree that there is some evidence in favor of this model, notably the in vitro studies of oligomerization by a truncated SpoIIE coupled with mutagenesis, there is also potentially evidence against this model or at least insufficient evidence (i.e. the sucrose fractionation experiments noted in the responses to the reviewers) to make a strong conclusion. I think the authors should be more explicit in the Discussion about what the evidence is and they should probably cite the outcome of their sucrose fractionation experiments, both with the K356D mutant and as a function of development. On this topic: I'm also still puzzled why the authors are postulating that the multimerization of SpoIIE occurs in the forespore, implying that cell division and compartmentalization are necessary for this transition, and yet mother cells that can't degrade SpoIIE but haven't yet divided can still show some activation of σ<sup>F</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although predivisional cells only constitute 18% of the total cells showing σ<sup>F</sup> activation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, that result still implies, to me, that SpoIIE either multimerizes before septation in some cells or that it doesn't actually undergo a transition. Perhaps I'm being dense here, but this one aspect of the model still doesn't make sense to me and may need a bit of clarification and/or softening of the conclusions and statements about changes in multimerization.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08145.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> raised several questions.

We have modified the text describing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> (subsection “An allele-specific suppressor of SpoIIE<sup>K356D</sup>”) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> (“Discussion”) to make the basis for this conclusion clearer. Specifically, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> demonstrates that SpoIIE oligomerization is critical for σ<sup>F</sup> activation even when degradation by FtsH is blocked. Thus, the requirement for oligomerization to stabilize SpoIIE in the forespore can be uncoupled from the requirement for oligomerization to activate σ<sup>F</sup>.</p><p><italic>Second, it was noted that the authors haven't shown whether the activation that occurs in mother cells depends on cell division. It has previously been reported that overexpressing SpoIIE bypasses the requirement for cell division (Arigoni et al., 1999), which, with other data, led the authors to suggest that compartmentalization of σ<sup>F</sup> activity occurred via the exclusion of an inhibitor (perhaps FtsH) from the forespore, so testing dependence is critical. These two issues should be addressed.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for drawing our attention to the importance of the connection between cell division and σ<sup>F</sup> activation and have added data and text that address this link. Specifically, we have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> quantifying mis-activation of σ<sup>F</sup> when FtsH mediated degradation is blocked. The figure shows mis-activation primarily in cells that have completed asymmetric cell division. This supports the conclusion that stabilization of SpoIIE partially uncouples σ<sup>F</sup> activation from cell division. Partial uncoupling of σ<sup>F</sup> activation from cell division by stabilizing SpoIIE is consistent with our model that sequestration of SpoIIE at the divisome prohibits premature oligomerization of SpoIIE and activation of σ<sup>F</sup>. Thus, our model is consistent with the results of Arigoni et al., but rather than FtsH being excluded from the forespore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we find that competition between binding of SpoIIE to the divisome or the cell pole helps ensure proper timing of σ<sup>F</sup> activation. We have also added additional text clarifying and expanding this point (subsection “SpoIIE mutants blocked in compartmentalization and σF activation”).</p><p>Additionally, we found that blocking cell division with a <italic>divICts</italic> mutation delays but does not block high σ<sup>F</sup> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). A simple explanation for these results is that in most cells ∆Tag-SpoIIE is sequestered at the divisome, delaying σ<sup>F</sup> activation until levels of ∆Tag-SpoIIE saturate the divisome and excess ∆Tag-SpoIIE can oligomerize and activate σ<sup>F</sup>. Predivisional activation of σ<sup>F</sup> could additionally occur in a subpopulation of cells where <italic>∆tag-spoIIE</italic> is expressed prior to assembly of the divisome (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08145.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08145.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08145.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-08145-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) Central to the model proposed is the notion that SpoIIE's oligomerization state changes following compartmentalization. The authors must show a change in oligomerization state in vivo during sporulation, e.g. by using sucrose gradients to directly monitor oligomerization.</italic></p><p>This is the one challenge posed by the reviewers that we failed to address as we now explain. We have performed both sucrose gradient fractionation of SpoIIE and co-immunoprecipitation of SpoIIE from merodiploid strains with differentially tagged SpoIIE constructs. In both cases we detect oligomeric assemblies of SpoIIE even in the presence of the K356D mutation, preventing us from isolating K356D-dependent oligomers. These complexes could be indirect through SpoIIE association with macromolecular complexes such as the divisome, or could be mediated by the transmembrane domain of SpoIIE. Nevertheless, our in vitro studies of SpoIIE oligomerization combined with the unbiased isolation of a suppressor mutation that restored sporulation and oligomerization strongly suggest, we believe, a role for oligomerization in vivo. Furthermore, the additional experiments we performed dissecting the phenotype of the oligomerization mutant and its suppressor provide compelling evidence that oligomerization is required following the completion of asymmetric septation to interact with the cell pole, protect SpoIIE from degradation, and activate σ<sup>F</sup>.</p><p><italic>3) It is odd that stabilizing the mutant SpoIIE variants by removing the N-terminal tag does not restore σ<sup>F</sup> activity. If the only role of oligomerization is to protect SpoIIE from proteolysis, then removal of the degradation tag should bypass the need for oligomerization and restore σ<sup>F</sup> activity, even if it's no longer compartment-specific.

These predictions can be tested in part by analyzing the oligomeric state of their mutants in vitro and by showing oligomerization-dependent protease activity in vitro. In sum, it was not clear whether oligomerization of SpoIIE was protecting it against FtsH-dependent degradation or activating phosphatase activity, or both.</italic></p><p>Based on the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we do conclude that oligomerization is required both for σ<sup>F</sup> activation and for stabilization of SpoIIE from degradation by FtsH and have added text to make our reasoning on this point clearer. Responding to reviewer comments here and above in point 1, we now emphasize the connection between oligomerization and σ<sup>F</sup> activation in our text (subsection “An allele-specific suppressor of SpoIIE<sup>K356D</sup>” and the Discussion). Additionally, we assessed the oligomerization state of other variants of SpoIIE and found that SpoIIE<sup>K356D</sup> (and truncated variants beginning after amino acid 356) was uniquely defective in oligomerization, consistent with our model that oligomerization is necessary but not sufficient for compartmentalization and activation of σ<sup>F</sup>. These data have now been included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. We additionally monitored the phosphatase activity of SpoIIE variants in vitro as detailed below in response to point 15.</p><p><italic>4) The authors need to somehow demonstrate more directly that SpoIIE-YFP at the divisome is transferred to the nearby cell pole. Although the genetics and cell biology presented were consistent with this conclusion, a direct demonstration of the &quot;handoff&quot; being postulated is needed, perhaps by photoactivation and single particle tracking. Additionally, it wasn't clear whether SpoIIE was really being &quot;handed off&quot; or whether SpoIIE potentially just relocalizes from the septum to the pole via release, diffusion, and capture. The word &quot;handoff&quot; implies a more active mechanism, so the mechanism and wording should be clarified throughout the paper.</italic></p><p>In brief, we do and did envision diffusion and capture when we used the word “hand off” and now provide additional data to support this. In light of the confusion it caused, we have added text to clarify this point and we no longer use handoff in the text. Further, and importantly, to demonstrate that SpoIIE is transferred from the divisome to the forespore, we have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> demonstrating that forespore transcription of <italic>spoIIE</italic> is not required for compartmentalization. To block forespore transcription of <italic>spoIIE,</italic> we prevented forespore capture of the <italic>spoIIE</italic> gene, either by deletion of <italic>racA</italic> (to reduce the efficiency of chromosome capture in the forespore), or by transplanting the <italic>spoIIE gene</italic> to the terminus in cells harboring <italic>spoIIIE36</italic> mutation (to prevent chromosome transport to the forespore).</p><p><italic>5) The authors need a more thorough discussion of the SpoIIE literature and an attempt to work towards an integrated model. This issue arose in two contexts. First: SpoIIE requires FtsZ to localize to the septum, but not DivIC. Interestingly, in a</italic> divICts <italic>mutant, there are no septa, but SpoIIE is active, producing dephosphorylated SpoIIAA, but apparently not at a high enough concentration to disrupt the SpoIIAB-σ<sup>F</sup> complex (Carniol et al. 2004, Feucht 2002). How can these results be reconciled with the model here?</italic></p><p>To further address the link between cell division and σ<sup>F</sup> we have added new data as described above and a paragraph to the Discussion (subsection”Fluorescence microscopy”). Specifically, and as in previous studies, we observe SpoIIE accumulation at the divisome but reduced activation of σ<sup>F</sup> in cells mutant for <italic>divIC</italic>. This is consistent with IIE being largely sequestered at the divisome and not oligomerized at the cell pole. Carniol et al. (2004) saw partial dephosphorylation of SpoIIAA to levels similar to wt sporulating cells but much lower than SpoIIE<sup>V697A</sup>. A simple explanation for the lack of σ<sup>F</sup> activation in the Carniol et al. (2004) study is that dephosphorylated SpoIIAA is concentrated in the forespore in wild-type cells, while in the <italic>divIC</italic> mutant there is still a significant amount of SpoIIAA-P present throughout the cell.</p><p><italic>Second: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and the Introduction (fourth paragraph) state that SpoIIE constricts during cell division. This conflicts with recent data in Eswaramoorthy 2014, which used super resolution microscopy to demonstrate that SpoIIE does not constrict together with the divisome, but rather stays at the edge of the septal disk</italic> and <italic>that SpoIIE is biased towards the forespore side of the septum immediately after cell division and before relocalization to the pole.</italic></p><p>We have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> to provide additional evidence of SpoIIE constriction with the divisome and have moved discussion of the constriction of SpoIIE along with the divisome to the Results section. Our results mostly agree nicely with and are complementary to Eswaramoorthy et al. (2014), and we build on their results by providing genetic evidence that association of SpoIIE with DivIVA is required for SpoIIE compartmentalization to the forespore. The major discrepancy as noted is with respect to the co-localization of SpoIIE and FtsZ. The main difference in our experimental approach is that we have taken time lapse images, while Eswaramoorthy et al. looked at static images. Because there is a lag between assembly of the divisome and constriction of the septum, and SpoIIE is released to the forespore while the FtsZ ring is disassembling, it is difficult to accurately stage the static images, which might have obscured the constriction of SpoIIE along with the FtsZ ring. To further document that SpoIIE constricts, we have taken additional time-lapse images of cells with the FtsZ ring and membrane labeled in addition to SpoIIE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). From these images it is clear that SpoIIE constricts along with the FtsZ ring and is released after the completion of septation. Artifacts from the FM4-64 membrane stain can further complicate efforts to localize SpoIIE at the nascent septum. We imaged SpoIIE during sporulation by structured illumination microscopy, taking advantage of a fluorescent fusion protein to stain the membrane and mark the nascent septum. These images further supported our conclusion that SpoIIE constricts along with the nascent septum.</p><p><italic>Minor points:1) Does the MalF-TM chimera accumulate properly in the forespore, activate σ<sup>F</sup>, and support wild-type sporulation efficiency? These results would define the contribution of the transmembrane segments to SpoIIE function. If these results have been published previously, they should be mentioned in the Discussion.</italic></p><p>The MalF-TM-SpoIIE chimera does not support wild-type sporulation efficiency and we have added these data to the table in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>. Previous studies (King et al. (1999), Carniol et al. (2004)) that used a MalF-TM-SpoIIE chimera had unknowingly removed the FtsH degradation tag. While stabilized MalF-TM-SpoIIE prematurely activates σ<sup>F</sup> and prevents asymmetric cell division, MalF-TM-SpoIIE with the FtsH degradation tag is not stabilized in the forespore and fails to activate σ<sup>F</sup>. Thus, the transmembrane domain plays a role in protecting SpoIIE from proteolysis in the forespore.</p><p><italic>2) The authors identified amino acid substitutions in the regulatory domain of SpoIIE which cause sporulation defects and defects in σ<sup>F</sup> activation, but are not mislocalized. The authors should use these mutants to strengthen the prediction that oligomerization is required for SpoIIE localization in the forespore. In particular, mutants that cannot activate σ<sup>F</sup> but are properly localized would be expected to oligomerize properly.</italic></p><p>As discussed above in response to essential revision 3, we have assessed the oligomerization of several additional mutants of SpoIIE and found that SpoIIE<sup>K356D</sup> was uniquely defective in oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The SpoIIE variant C399A has very low SpoIIE levels, mislocalized SpoIIE protein, and nearly undetectable transcription driven by σ<sup>F</sup>, yet it only has a ten-fold decrease in sporulation efficiency. The authors should discuss this apparent discrepancy in phenotypes.</italic></p><p>The simplest explanation why the <italic>spoIIE<sup>C399A</sup></italic> mutant has a less severe sporulation defect than other SpoIIE variants is that it supports a low level of σ<sup>F</sup> activation. This is supported by a longer exposure of the western from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, which shows a low but significant level of σ<sup>F</sup>-directed expression of a reporter. Additionally, we note that assessment of sporulation efficiency by heat killing is highly sensitive, while assays for IIE levels and σ<sup>F</sup> activity do not accurately report on events in a minor population of cells. Finally, C399A is part of a motif of four invariant cysteines in SpoIIE, and we observe synergistic effects of mutating multiple cysteines in tandem, suggesting that mutation of a single cysteine does not abolish function.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In the absence of colocalization with FtsZ or with membrane staining, it is unclear how the SpoIIE localization pattern correlates with division during this timelapse.</italic></p><p>To further document that it does and in response to comment 5 above, we have taken new time lapse images colocalizing SpoIIE and FtsZ, which have been included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and as supplementary movies. We observe clear constriction of SpoIIE along with FtsZ and the septal membrane.</p><p><italic>5) The frequency with which σ<sup>F</sup> activity is observed in single cells versus in the mother cell of sporangia should be scored and shown.</italic></p><p>These data have been added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Many of the cells that have uncompartmentalized σ<sup>F</sup> activity lack sporulation septa. Does activation of σ<sup>F</sup> in this case depend on cell division? Or does stabilizing SpoIIE lead to σ<sup>F</sup> activation in predivisional cells? The frequency of the various cell types should be shown.</italic></p><p>These data have been added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The legend states that &quot;the contrast [for ΔTag SpoIIE] is approximately 5X brighter for SpoIIE-YFP.&quot; The authors must mean that the fluorescence intensity is 5X greater than SpoIIE-YFP.</italic></p><p>The text of the legend has been clarified to indicate that the contrast has been equalized between the images for display purposes, but that we observe brighter fluorescence signal for ∆Tag-SpoIIE-YFP as expected from the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>8) The supplement for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> should include a few representative sporangia that are stained with FM4-64. The spore titers should be presented in standard scientific notation. 4.2 X108.</italic></p><p>We have modified the notation of sporulation efficiency in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>. Although we have imaged all of the <italic>spoIIE</italic> mutant strains presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>, we do not think that images of the defective sporangia would be informative beyond the average traces presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. We have decided not to include this additional data but we would of course agree to do so if the reviewer considers it important.</p><p><italic>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. The graphs showing the frequency with which σ<sup>F</sup> is activated in minicells does not accurately convey the data. How many total minicells were scored? What fraction had IIE? σ<sup>F</sup> activity? The data would likely best be presented in table format, so that the precise number of the various types of minicells counted is clear. If it is to be presented in a graphical format, the Y-axis should be labeled and the numbers of each cell type presented.</italic></p><p>We have added labels indicating the Y-axis scale to the histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and have modified the legend to note the total number of cells observed in each case.</p><p><italic>10) Additional images and quantification is necessary for the cell biological data, so that it is clear how often σ<sup>F</sup> is activated before polar septation versus active in the mother cell.</italic></p><p>These data have been added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.</p><p><italic>11) Introduction, fourth paragraph: what does 'a central regulatory domain' mean? Is it a domain that regulates SpoIIE or that is involved in regulating SpoIIAA? It isn't clear at this point of the paper – eventually there is some evidence that emerges that this domain may affect multimerization status and hence activity of the phosphatase domain, but I think the authors should clarify much earlier.</italic></p><p>The central regulatory domain is defined physically from sequence analysis (as distinct from the transmembrane domain to the N-terminus and the PP2C phosphatase domain to the C-terminus), and functionally from genetic evidence supporting a role in regulating SpoIIE function. We have modified the text to clearly define our use of the term “regulatory domain” in the Introduction.</p><p><italic>12) In the subsection “SpoIIE is degraded by FtsH”, second paragraph: Stability of SpoIIE is monitored using a C-terminal FLAG tag. But this tagging could interfere with stability as protein termini often play critical roles in protease activity. This issue should be addressed by examining native SpoIIE stability somehow and by demonstrating the functionality of the tagged SpoIIE.</italic></p><p>We used tagged SpoIIE for degradation experiments due to the fact that C-terminally tagged variants of SpoIIE support sporulation to levels indistinguishable from wild-type (these sporulation efficiency numbers are now included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), and YFP tagged SpoIIE is compartmentalized in the forespore. Additionally, native SpoIIE antibodies are of poor quality. In response to the reviewers’ suggestion, we conducted degradation experiments with untagged SpoIIE, and an affinity purified SpoIIE antibody. The results are similar to those seen with the tagged protein, and we detected degradation of SpoIIE that was largely dependent on FtsH. These data have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>13) In the subsection “SpoIIE is degraded by FtsH”, end of third paragraph: What's the evidence that degradation is &quot;likely&quot; direct? Additional evidence is needed or the conclusion should end at SpoIIE being degraded in an FtsH-dependent manner. On a related note: the title of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (&quot;SpoIIE is degraded by FtsH&quot;) and comments in the Discussion (second and fifth paragraphs) should be adjusted given the data shown.</italic></p><p>We agree that “likely” is too strong and have changed the wording throughout the manuscript, and have modified the title to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. In the Discussion we present as a model that FtsH degrades SpoIIE, and for simplicity and readability we have left this unchanged.</p><p><italic>14) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>/E: Should be shown on a semi-log plot.</italic></p><p>Although plotting exponential decay on semi-log axes leads to a linear fit, the linear axes are more intuitive to the general reader, and so we prefer to leave the plots as they are. We have included semi-log plots of the data here for reference.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08145.023</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08145.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08145.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-08145-resp-fig2-v3"/></fig></p><p><italic>15) In the subsection “SpoIIE mutants blocked in compartmentalization and σF activation”, last paragraph: The evidence here that SpoIIE transitions from a hypothetical &quot;active&quot; state to an &quot;inactive&quot; state is weak. It could be that the compartmentalization defective mutants are also disrupted in phosphatase activity, but that phosphatase activity is constitutive. In other words, the mutants identified may prevent SpoIIE from being degraded and from being a proper phosphatase – I don't see the logic that SpoIIE must be transitioning from one state to another in terms of catalytic activity inside the forespore. The simplest test of the authors' idea is to examine in vitro the phosphatase activity of SpoIIE and the various compartmentalization-defective SpoIIE mutants.</italic></p><p>We acknowledge here and in the text that we do not have direct evidence of activation of SpoIIE phosphatase activity. However, this model is consistent with previous evidence (Feucht et al. 2002) and our analysis of the SpoIIE<sup>V697A</sup> variant. We have measured the in vitro phosphatase activity of a significant set of IIE mutants that do not support σ<sup>F</sup> activity in vivo and did not detect defects in phosphatase activity for any mutants. This was true for both SpoIIE variants such as K356D that are destabilized and not compartmentalized and for variants such as Q483A that are compartmentalized properly. Importantly mutation of a residue (D628A) that coordinates manganese in the active site abolished phosphatase activity. We suspect that our in vitro phosphatase assay lacks a critical factor for SpoIIE activation (such as DivIVA), and that we are monitoring a low basal level of phosphatase activity. This is further supported by the unphysiologically high manganese concentrations required to detect phosphatase activity for SpoIIE (Km=2mM). It is a major future goal to reconstitute SpoIIE activation in vitro.</p><p><italic>16) In the subsection “An allele-specific suppressor of SpoIIE<sup>K356D</sup>”, first paragraph: The 'regulatory domain' still remains ill-defined at this stage of the manuscript and its function/role opaque to all but the</italic> B. subtilis <italic>aficionado.</italic></p><p>We have modified the text to clearly define our use of the term “regulatory domain” in the Introduction.</p><p><italic>17) In the subsection “An allele-specific suppressor of SpoIIE<sup>K356D</sup>”, first paragraph: As above (point number 15), it doesn't seem necessary to invoke the notion that SpoIIE's activity as a phosphatase is regulated. It could be that it is just the proteolysis of SpoIIE that is regulated with spore-specific stabilization.</italic></p><p>See response above to point 15.</p><p><italic>18) In the subsection “An allele-specific suppressor of SpoIIE<sup>K356D</sup>”, last paragraph: Did the authors really test full-length SpoIIE phosphatase activity or a fragment of SpoIIE lacking the TM and potentially other domains? I would have guessed the latter, but the Methods section doesn't provide enough details. If it really is full-length protein, how are the multiple TM helices dealt with?</italic></p><p>As noted in the Methods and the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, phosphatase assays were performed with soluble fragments of SpoIIE encompassing amino acids 320-827. We have added a further note to the Methods section to clarify this.</p><p><italic>19) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>: Why does the very bright focus not show up in the line scan? More to the point: this bright focus seems to imply that ΔTag-SpoIIE YFP mainly accumulates away from the pole.</italic></p><p>The line scan presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> is an average trace of SpoIIE-YFP fluorescence normalized to FM4-64 from all cells in a population, while the image above is of a representative cell. Some, but not all cells have bright spots of SpoIIE fluorescence that coincide with bright spots of FM4-64 staining. It is not uncommon to observe such artifactual puncta of FM4-64 staining, particularly when cells are stressed, (as they are when cell division is blocked).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The authors tried, at the reviewers’ request, to generate data supporting the notion that SpoIIE makes a change in oligomeric state during sporulation. As noted in their responses, this did not work and apparently both sucrose gradient fractionation and co-IPs from merodiploid strains indicated that SpoIIE is oligomeric, even in the presence of the K356D mutation. Two points here:1) Did the authors examine oligomerization via sucrose gradients as a function of development to test whether oligomeric state changes, as postulated? This seems just as important to test as the K356D mutant. And if the experiment was done, it should probably be shown or at least discussed in the paper (see next point as well).</italic></p><p>Indeed, we did examine oligomerization as a function of developmental stage using sucrose gradients (comparing time points during sporulation and genetic perturbations to arrest development at various stages). Due to the technical limitations mentioned above, these experiments were uninformative either way. As described below, we have added a paragraph that to the Discussion that addresses the uncertainty in when oligomerization commences.</p><p><italic>2) The paper, as written, leaves the reader with the feeling that the transition in oligomeric state is known with more certainty than it really is e.g. in the Discussion it states that 'We have presented evidence that multimerization of SpoIIE is a critical transformation'. While I definitely agree that there is some evidence in favor of this model, notably the in vitro studies of oligomerization by a truncated SpoIIE coupled with mutagenesis, there is also potentially evidence against this model or at least insufficient evidence (i.e. the sucrose fractionation experiments noted in the responses to the reviewers) to make a strong conclusion. I think the authors should be more explicit in the Discussion about what the evidence is and they should probably cite the outcome of their sucrose fractionation experiments, both with the K356D mutant and as a function of development.</italic></p><p>In our revised manuscript we have added a paragraph to the Discussion (fourth paragraph) that directly discusses these issues and have changed the language in the seventh paragraph. In particular, we discuss an alternative model in which oligomerization commences earlier in sporulation and state that we cannot distinguish the models without an in vivo assay for oligomerization.</p><p><italic>On this topic: I'm also still puzzled why the authors are postulating that the multimerization of SpoIIE occurs in the forespore, implying that cell division and compartmentalization are necessary for this transition, and yet mother cells that can't degrade SpoIIE but haven't yet divided can still show some activation of σ<sup>F</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although predivisional cells only constitute 18% of the total cells showing σ<sup>F</sup> activation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, that result still implies, to me, that SpoIIE either multimerizes before septation in some cells or that it doesn't actually undergo a transition. Perhaps I'm being dense here, but this one aspect of the model still doesn't make sense to me and may need a bit of clarification and/or softening of the conclusions and statements about changes in multimerization.</italic></p><p>I think the reviewers are overlooking the fact that SpoIIE in these cells accumulates to high levels because we have removed the degradation tag. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows that when stabilized, SpoIIE accumulates at the poles of predivisional cells, which should lead to predivisional activation of σ<sup>F</sup>. Although we cannot make a direct comparison (because σ<sup>F</sup> activation perturbs SpoIIE localization), the frequency with which we observe polar SpoIIE is consistent with the fraction of predivisional cells with σ<sup>F</sup> activity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
