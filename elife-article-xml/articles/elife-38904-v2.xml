environment. Moreover, individual microbial and mammalian cells can vary substantially in their proliferation rates, stress tolerance, and drug resistance, with important implications for the treatment of infections and cancer. To investigate the causes of cell-to-cell variation in proliferation, we used a high-throughput automated microscopy assay to quantify the impact of deleting &gt;1500 genes in yeast. Mutations affecting mitochondria were particularly variable in their outcome. In both mutant and wild-type cells mitochondrial membrane potential – but not amount – varied substantially across individual cells and predicted cell-to-cell variation in proliferation, mutation outcome, stress tolerance, and resistance to a clinically used anti-fungal drug. These results suggest an important role for cell-to-cell variation in the state of an organelle in single cell phenotypic variation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single cell</kwd><kwd>noise</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>616434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001961</institution-id><institution>AXA Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2011-26206</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007492</institution-id><institution>Fondation Bettencourt Schueller</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2015-68351-P)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carey</surname><given-names>Lucas B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003030</institution-id><institution>Agència de Gestió d’Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name><name><surname>Carey</surname><given-names>Lucas B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dhar</surname><given-names>Riddhiman</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A genome-wide quantitative microscopy screen implicates mitochondria in single cell variation in proliferation and drug resistance in yeast.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Isogenic populations often exhibit considerable phenotypic heterogeneity even in an identical environment. One common phenotypic variation that has been observed in isogenic populations of microbial and mammalian cells, including cancer cells is variation in proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sandler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fridman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Levy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yaakov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferrezuelo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Polymenis and Schmidt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gupta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kiviet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Roesch et al., 2010</xref>). Phenotypic variations that are often coupled with variation in proliferation rate are the abilities of an individual cell to survive stress and drug treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Levy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yaakov et al., 2017</xref>). In this regard, the existence of ‘persister’ cells in microbial populations is well known and poses a significant challenge for antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fridman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kussell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wakamoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">LaFleur et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bojsen et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, individual cells in tumors have been shown to vary in their ability to survive anticancer drugs and can lead to drug-resistant populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shaffer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ramirez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hata et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rego et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Márquez-Jurado et al., 2018</xref>). Recent advances in single-cell techniques are revealing the extent of transcriptomic and metabolic differences among isogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Trapnell, 2015</xref>). The existence of such heterogeneity in gene expression in isogenic microbial and animal populations has been shown – to some extent – to underlie the variable outcome of mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dickinson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burga et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Raj et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eldar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Horvitz and Sulston, 1980</xref>).

This can happen due to the small numbers of molecules involved in processes such as transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rigney, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cookson et al., 2010</xref>) or during stochastic partitioning of cellular components during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birky and Skavaril, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huh and Paulsson, 2011</xref>). Although genetic variation has been shown to influence proliferation heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ziv et al., 2013</xref>) and cell-to-cell variation in the expression level of single genes and levels of metabolite has been correlated with variation in proliferation rate and stress and drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Levy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yaakov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shaffer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burga et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Raj et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eldar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rotem et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battich et al., 2015</xref>), the true underlying causes of such phenotypic heterogeneity are poorly understood.</p><p>To identify genes and cellular processes involved in the generation of phenotypic heterogeneity we set up a high-throughput microscopy assay to quantify proliferation heterogeneity in a yeast population. Using this assay, we quantify the impact of deletion of &gt;1500 genes on proliferation heterogeneity. We present evidence that the variation in mitochondrial membrane potential is an important determinant of phenotypic heterogeneity in individual cells. We also show that mitochondrial membrane potential impacts gene expression and stress tolerance and drug resistance in individual cells. Taken together, our work suggests an important role for an organelle in generating phenotypic heterogeneity across individual cells in a homogenous environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Natural and lab yeast populations show proliferation heterogeneity</title><p>To investigate cell-to-cell variation in proliferation rates, we set up a high-throughput automated time-lapse microscopy assay that measures the proliferation rates of thousands of single-cells per plate as they grow into micro-colonies.

Many deletions have been shown to reduce population growth rate and can do so in different ways. Deletions can uniformly affect fitness of all the cells or alternatively, can affect fitness of a sub-population whereas the rest of the population remains unaffected. Inter-individual variation in the outcome of mutations has been observed before in multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dickinson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burga et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Raj et al., 2010</xref>) but its relative occurrence has not been systematically quantified.</p><p>We therefore used the automated microscopy assay to quantify proliferation rate heterogeneity in triplicate for 1600 gene deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, including 1150 gene deletions previously reported as affecting growth rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Giaever et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baryshnikova et al., 2010</xref>]).

At the single cell level,~39% of all mutants with a significant reduction in population proliferation rate (1112 mutants) showed significantly higher variation in mutation outcome compared to the WT strain (Mann-Whitney U test, FDR &lt; 0.1, after correcting for change in mode growth rate). Among these mutants,~13% had the same mode growth rate as the WT strain while showing higher variability (Mann-Whitney U test, FDR &lt; 0.1).

The cells surviving fluconazole treatment included a sub-fraction able to respire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

Laboratory strains of yeast have long been known to generate respiratory deficient ‘petite’ colonies at quite high frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dimitrov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nagley and Linnane, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Evans et al., 1985</xref>). However, a slow growing sub-population of cells was observed in all the laboratory, natural, and clinical strains that we tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>Although, mitochondrial genes showed the strongest enrichment for an increased slow fraction in our gene deletion screen, other causes of slow growth will, of course, also exist. For example, deletions of genes associated with chromosome segregation and nucleus organization also affected heterogeneity but had no apparent relation to mitochondrial function. Environmental conditions, both during growth prior to microscopy, and during microscopy, are likely to affect heterogeneity; pre-growth in ethanol reduces proliferation heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), presumably due to selection for cells with well-functioning mitochondria and high mtDNA copy number.</p><p>Previous theoretical studies have proposed that variability in the partitioning of cellular components could lead to heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birky and Skavaril, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huh and Paulsson, 2011</xref>). However, prior experimental work on the fidelity of mitochondria inheritance has shown it to be high, suggesting it is likely to be of little phenotypic consequence for single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jajoo et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, we have shown here that cell-to-cell variation in the <italic>state</italic> of the organelle can be high and predicts phenotypic variation among single cells. Although variation in mitochondrial membrane potential has been shown to exist in isogenic yeast populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fehrmann et al., 2013</xref>), here we have linked such variations to heterogeneity in growth and drug resistance phenotypes. Variation in mitochondrial membrane potential was related to variation in mtDNA copy number in individual cells, but we do not currently know if this is the only – or even the most common – cause of variation in the state of the organelle across single cells. Future work will be required to track down the upstream, proximal causes of this cell-to-cell variation in organelle functional state. The list of gene deletions that alter growth heterogeneity that we have reported here provide a rich resource for this future work.</p><p>In addition to the TMRE method we used, three different methods have now been used to identify slow-proliferating yeast within a population: GFP tagged TSL1, GFP tagged HSP12, and FitFlow, a direct method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Levy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van Dijk et al., 2015</xref>). These methods agree on some aspects and disagree on others. For example, early work on proliferation heterogeneity in yeast has correlated expression noise in a stress response gene with proliferation heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Levy et al., 2012</xref>) with this ultimately linked to the variation in the activity of the Ras/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and its target transcription factors MSN2 and MSN4 in individual yeast cells leading to variation in expression of downstream stress response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Some of our results are identical to that of Li <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2018</xref>); we also find that <italic>pde2</italic> and <italic>ira2</italic> cells have a reduced fraction of slow growing microcolonies. Others differ. Importantly, TSL1 mRNA expression is lower in the high TMRE sub-population, as are the MSN2/MSN4 targets CTT1, DDR2 and HSP12.</p><p>Other studies have suggested a role for the DNA damage response in the generation and or maintenance of proliferation heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yaakov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van Dijk et al., 2015</xref>). Results from our screen show that the slow growing sub-populations in an isogenic yeast population are primarily driven by loss of mitochondrial function in lab, natural and clinically-isolated yeast strains. Loss of mitochondrial function leads to a loss of respiration capability and induced DNA damage response, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yaakov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van Dijk et al., 2015</xref>). However, while it is tempting to speculate that the mitochondria defects in the high TMRE sub-population cause the DNA damage seen in other studies, the partial conflict in the mRNA-sequencing data suggest that this is not the case.</p><p>Taken together, results across all four studies suggest that there are multiple types of slow-proliferating cells. It will be interesting to determine the full extent of the heterogeneity in cell-state and stress resistance within isogenic populations.</p><p>Prior work on the causes of variation in proliferation rates, stress and drug resistance, and mutation outcome across individuals and individual cells has focused on fluctuations in gene expression as causative influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Levy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yaakov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shaffer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burga et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Raj et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eldar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rotem et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battich et al., 2015</xref>). Here we have shown that, in yeast, variation in an organelle is strongly associated with heterogeneity in gene expression across single cells. In animals, inherited and somatic genetic variation in the mitochondrial genome can act as an important modifier of phenotypic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haag-Liautard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kujoth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tyynismaa and Suomalainen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kauppila et al., 2016</xref>). Recent work has also revealed substantial variation in mtDNA copy number across human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Reznik et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, in mammalian cells, mitochondrial variability has been suggested to be an important influence on cell-to-cell variation in gene expression and splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johnston et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guantes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guantes et al., 2016</xref>) and to influence variability in cell death by modulating apoptotic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Márquez-Jurado et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest important roles for cellular organelles, in general, and mitochondria, in particular, in the generation of heterogeneity among individual cells. In future work, therefore, it will be important to test the extent to which cell-to-cell variation in the state of mitochondria and other organelles also contributes to variable phenotypic outcomes, mutation effects, and drug resistance in human cells, including in cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>High-throughput microscopy assay</title><p>Our high-throughput microscopy assay was inspired by the microcolony growth measurement assay by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Levy et al.

The cells were diluted 1:50 in fresh medium, grown for 20 hr and diluted again 1:50 in fresh medium. Finally, cells were grown for 4 hr, cell densities were determined by OD at 600 nm in a Tecan plate reader and then were diluted to another plate containing SCD or appropriate medium required for microscopy experiment using a Biomek NX (Beckman Coulter) liquid handling robot, capable of pipetting variable volumes of cells across wells in a 96 plate, to a target density of ~17000 cells/μl. This minimized any possible bias due to variability in cell densities among strains. A final 5-fold dilution was done by pipetting 80 μl cells onto a pre-coated 96-well microscopy plate containing 320 μl of SCD. The microscopy plate was then sealed with LightCycler 480 sealing foils (Roche), cells were spun at 450 rpm for 2 min and taken for microscopy observations.</p><p>Microscopy plates (96-well glass bottom, MGB096-1-2-LG-L, Brooks Life Science Systems) were coated with 200 μl sterile solution of 200 μg/ml concanavalin A (type IV, Sigma) at 37°C for 16–18 hr. The solutions were then pipetted out and the plates were washed twice with sterile milli-q water. Plates were dried at 4°C for at least 24 hr.

Yeast cells were identified by juxtaposition of bright and dark pixels (10,36). A pixel was considered ‘bright’ if its intensity exceeded mean +2.2 s.d. value and a pixel was considered ‘dark’ if its intensity was below mean-2.2 s.d. value. In addition, Sobel’s edge detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sobel and Feldman, 1968</xref>) was applied for identifying yeast cell boundaries with sharp changes in pixel intensity. Clustering was used to identify the microcolonies and the centroid position for each microcolony was calculated. Microcolonies were tracked through centroid tracking over time. Sudden increase or decrease in centroid number in a time series indicated a failure in image acquisition or image processing and such images were discarded from the analysis. To differentiate cells from cellular debris, residuals of concanavalin A coating etc., two filtering steps were used. First, only objects that were bigger than 50 pixels at the start of observation were considered. Second, the object had to increase its size to greater than 2-fold at the end of observation. Whether neighbouring colonies touch each other at any point in time during microscopy observation was also checked. If they did, they were tracked only up to the time they touched each other. Similar to the findings of Ziv <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ziv et al., 2013</xref>), lag phase during growth was observed in some microcolonies in our experiments.

Three replicates were considered as three nodes in a graph with K-S distance between them as the edge weight. If the K-S distance between two replicates exceeded 0.1, no edge was drawn between those two nodes.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naama Barkai as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Please address all comments in the individual reviews below. In particular, the reviewers were concerned that the experiments showing transition from 'slow' to 'fast' state are important but are not very convincing and should be addressed. in this context, please note the paper from Gilles Charvin (Fehrmann et al., 2013). They used microfluidics to look at mitochondrial membrane potential in individual yeast cells as they aged. This paper should have been cited in the current manuscript, and it sets the bar both technically (for the microfluidic analysis of membrane potential and growth in individual cells) and conceptually (they found that decline of membrane potential is age-independent and leads to clonal senescence – i.e., is not reversible). The phenomenon studied in the current manuscript is different because it has to do with high-potential/low-respiration cells, but the Charvin study sets the precedent in the literature at least for irreversible mitochondrial-state changes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Dhar et al. address an important topic of broad interest: cellular heterogeneity and its relationship to proliferation and survival. Given that very little is known about the causes of heterogeneity, their approach of doing a genetic screen for yeast mutants that alter the distribution of growth rates within a population is sensible, and the scale of the experiment (&gt;1500 mutants) is impressive. However, despite my enthusiasm for the research question and the general approach, I do have some major concerns:</p><p>1) The authors appear to have reinvented the micro-colony growth assay of Levy et al. (Levy et al., 2010) and should do a better job of presenting the similarities and differences between the two methods. Of particular concern is that they appear to have cell behaviors that were not seen by the other group – they mention lag (subsection “Image processing” and subsection “Cell sorting and growth measurement of sorted bins”, end of last paragraph) and nutrient deprivation, neither of which was seen by the other group (Levy et al., 2010 and Ziv et al., 2013) in medium with sufficient glucose.</p><p>2) The finding of a role for mitochondria in growth heterogeneity is interesting, but petites are well known to decrease growth rate and increase stress resistance. So the key advance here would be the finding that mitochondrial states switch back and forth, rather than petites just being a slow-growing dead end. Levy et al., 2010, had already demonstrated switching of growth states, and that single micro-colonies could give rise to the complete distribution of growth rates. So the question is whether the switching is driven by mitochondrial-state changes. Unfortunately, the experiments on switching are not entirely convincing. The authors took bins of cells sorted by TMRE (mitochondrial membrane potential) and assayed their growth. They found that high-TMRE cells tended to have slower growth rates and that high TMRE correlated with respiration deficiency. These results would be consistent with switching only in the direction of becoming petite. But the authors argue that switching can go in both directions because sorted bins could repopulate the full distributions of TMRE staining and growth. However, noise in TMRE staining or other technical reasons could mean that the sorted bins were contaminated to some extent with respiration-proficient cells, which then might be responsible for the repopulation of the distributions. A more direct tracking experiment is necessary.</p><p>3) The manuscript does not offer much mechanistic insight into the changes in mitochondrial state or mtDNA copy number. What is causing these changes? Why do the changes persist for the number of cell generations that they do? Is the mitochondrial-state phenomenon tied to, or independent from, the heterogeneity in gene expression seen in Levy et al., 2010?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Dhar et al. studied heterogeneity of growth between yeast cells by measuring single-colony growth rates of a large collection of yeast strains (gene deletions and natural strains). The originality was to track over time the size of colonies that emerge from single cells, deriving individual growth rates of these initial founder cells. The distribution of single-cell growth rates differed between strains and the authors found marked alterations of these distribution for mutants of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial functions. They sorted cells based on TMRE staining, and observed that high signal correlated with i) slow growth ii) low mtDNA iii) low competence for respiration iv) peculiar transcriptomic signatures v) sensitivity to heat and oxidative stress but vi) higher survival to fluconazole. Overexpression of MIP1 increased mtDNA content and reduced both the fraction of slow growing cells and the fraction of respiratory-deficient cells.</p><p>General Assessment:</p><p>This is a very sound study. The amount of work is impressive and the complementarity of the experimental approaches is remarkable. Conclusions that heterogeneity in mitochondrial 'state' affects phenotypic heterogeneity between cells is very important and opens novel avenues for investigating cell-cell biological variation, which is a hot topic.</p><p>1) The raw data of colony growth assays is not made available. This is not acceptable, as others may later want to explore the dataset in various ways. The raw data should be uploaded in a public repository in two forms:</p><p>- Time-course data of the size of each colony, for all colonies and all yeast strains. This is important if others want to explore time-series for lag phase, saturations or other traits that may not be fully correlated to the growth rates computed by the authors.</p><p>- The scalar values of growth-rates of individual colonies, so that others can use these values directly.</p><p>2) GO analysis (Figure 2E) highlighted respiration based on many genes but little enrichment. Other terms were better enriched, although among fewer genes, especially for the 'red' set. The authors should mention in text what are the kinases, cytoskeletal binding proteins and carbohydrate transporters involved in maintaining the% slow fraction.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The described research aims to identify the underlying mechanisms of investigating proliferation heterogeneity in isogenic cell populations. Through a quantitative microcolony assay, the authors demonstrate in isogenic cultures of yeast maintain heterogenous and stable rates of cell division that are influenced by genetic variation. By screening the yeast deletion collection, the authors discover that mitochondrial activity influences proliferation heterogeneity, and that mitochondrial membrane potential and respiratory dysfunction are features of the &quot;slow fraction&quot; of these cell populations. This work highlights the importance of mitochondrial dynamics as a master regulator of cells and how these dynamics may influence heterogeneity.</p><p>• <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is known to throw off petite cells that lack complete mtDNAs, in a genetic background dependent manner (these petites can also propagate in liquid cultures so multiple serial transfers can alter the initial number of petites in the inoculums which may influence the overall observed heterogeneity differences between strains). The &quot;slow fraction&quot; could represent these non-respiring petite cells, however the authors provide evidence that the &quot;fast&quot; to &quot;slow&quot; transitions are reversible (i.e. that the High TMRE, respiratory deficient cells could give rise to Low TMRE cells (subsection “Mitochondria state but not content predicts slow growth”, last paragraph, Figure 5—figure supplement 2Figure). Have these &quot;switched&quot; cells regained respiratory capability? To decide if cells have switched between slow and fast growth, the authors rely on a threshold value of growth rates (as opposed to a percent change). It's not clear why the 0.3 h-1 threshold was chosen. As I understood, a microcolony that changes from 0.1 to 0.29 h-1 would be scored as slow growing while a microcolony that changes from 0.29 to 0.31 h-1 would be scored as one that switched between slow and fast growth. Can the authors clarify?</p><p>• Yeast cells growing in microplates are likely to be oxygen starved (even if being shaken) and near transition states in metabolism, so it makes sense that changes in mitochondrial &quot;states&quot; are being observed. A discussion of how environmental conditions could influence heterogeneity would help to put this into context.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Single cell functional genomics reveals the importance of mitochondria in cell-to-cell phenotypic variation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

I remain enthusiastic about the topic of the manuscript and I remain impressed by the scale of the mutant analysis, but I also remain concerned that the authors' analyses of switching rely on indirect arguments that are not entirely convincing. Specifically:</p><p>1) They argue (subsection “Switching of cells from high to low membrane potential”) that TMRE-high to TMRE-low switching must take place to explain the observation that 1% of cells are TMRE-low immediately after sorting into the TMRE-high bin (a low rate of contamination), whereas 34.7% of cells are TMRE-low 24 hours later. Their argument relies on a simple model in which TMRE-high cells consist of two subpopulations (80% slow-growing and 20% fast-growing), TMRE-low cells are fast-growing, and the average slow and fast growth rates represent the corresponding subpopulations. This model has some problems. First, the arithmetic mean growth rate might not be appropriate to model changes in subpopulation sizes over time. If each cell chooses a growth rate at random from its distribution then what matters is the geometric mean, which is heavily influenced by low values. Alternatively, if growth rate is relatively stably inherited through time then what matters is the fastest members of a subpopulation. Either way, arithmetic mean could be a very poor indicator of subpopulation growth. Second, even if we ignore the problem with the arithmetic mean and take the authors' argument and apply it to the transition between the 24-hr time point and the 48-hr time point, then their calculation actually predicts quite well the 48-hr subpopulation sizes from the 24-hr starting point, so TMRE-high to TMRE-low switching is not required to explain this transition. Third, the authors' simple model ignores lag, which would likely further under-represent the slow-growing (high-TMRE) fraction, and might actually be why the transition from 0 to 24 hours requires additional explanation whereas the transition from 24 to 48 hours does not.</p><p>2) The authors have verified that their analyses of growth rate switching in micro-colonies are robust to changes in cutoffs between &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; growth, which is good, but what these switches mean is insufficiently discussed. In particular, fast-to-slow switches such as those shown in Figure 5D necessarily involve concerted changes in most cells in a micro-colony because a single cell changing from fast to slow in the middle of micro-colony growth would not appreciably change the growth rate of the micro-colony. The authors should discuss (and perhaps experimentally investigate) what such switches at the level of the micro-colony mean.</p><p>3) The conclusion that some cells regain ability to respire is an interesting piece of this work but it is not clear exactly what the authors mean by it. In Figure 5E they present the &quot;percentage of colonies that regained capability to respire&quot; but the calculation involves two different plates that were not replicas, so the ability to &quot;regain&quot; respiration was a more indirect inference than the text suggests.</p><p>Because of the above concerns, my view remains that more direct evidence of switching at the level of single cells (from high-TMRE to low-TMRE, from slow growth to fast growth, and from respiration-deficient to respiration capable) would substantially strengthen this paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I completely agree that the resubmission only indirectly addresses our concerns about slow to fast growth. Even with the new statistical analysis, some quick growing contaminants could explain what they conclude are transitions. A simple replica plating experiment would have shown that their non-respiring cells can convert back to respiring cells. Given that they were previously asked for alternate experimentation to demonstrate the slow to fast transition, they need to back off this claim.

In Figure 5E they present the &quot;percentage of colonies that regained capability to respire&quot; but the calculation involves two different plates that were not replicas, so the ability to &quot;regain&quot; respiration was a more indirect inference than the text suggests.</p><p>Because of the above concerns, my view remains that more direct evidence of switching at the level of single cells (from high-TMRE to low-TMRE, from slow growth to fast growth, and from respiration-deficient to respiration capable) would substantially strengthen this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The replica plating experiment for assessing the ability to regain respiration required us to know the time of switching which we were not able to determine through this experiment.

Even with the new statistical analysis, some quick growing contaminants could explain what they conclude are transitions. A simple replica plating experiment would have shown that their non-respiring cells can convert back to respiring cells. Given that they were previously asked for alternate experimentation to demonstrate the slow to fast transition, they need to back off this claim.
