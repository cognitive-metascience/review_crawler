However, to date there has been no quantitative evaluation of the stability of heterochromatic gene repression. We designed a genetic strategy to capture transient losses of gene silencing in <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> as permanent, heritable changes in genotype and phenotype. This approach revealed rare transcription within heterochromatin that occurred in approximately 1/1000 cell divisions. In concordance with multiple lines of evidence suggesting these events were rare and transient, single-molecule RNA FISH showed that transcription was limited. The ability to monitor fluctuations in heterochromatic repression uncovered previously unappreciated roles for Sir1, a silencing establishment factor, in the maintenance and/or inheritance of silencing. In addition, we identified the sirtuin Hst3 and its histone target as contributors to the stability of the silenced state. These approaches revealed dynamics of a heterochromatin function that have been heretofore inaccessible.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05007.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05007.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05007.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A single cell from a plant, an animal or another eukaryote can contain several meters of DNA. In order to fit this length inside the nucleus of the cell, the DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones to form a compact structure known as chromatin.</p><p>Chromatin exists in two forms: loosely packed chromatin tends to contain the genes that are expressed in cells, whereas highly compacted chromatin (also called heterochromatin) silences the expression of most nearby genes. Adding small chemical markings to histone proteins can alter how much the chromatin is compacted, and newly formed cells can inherit these markings whenever a cell divides. This enables the new cell to essentially ‘remember’ which genes were active and which were repressed in the original cell. However, no one has measured how stable heterochromatin is over multiple cell divisions; as such it is unclear if genes that should remain silent are occasionally expressed after a cell has divided a number of times.</p><p>Budding yeast is a well-established model for studying heterochromatin. The genome of this single-celled organism has distinct regions of highly compacted chromatin, which are established and maintained by a number of different proteins.</p><p>Dodson and Rine have developed a new technique to detect when gene silencing is lost in individual yeast cells, even if the loss of silencing only occurs for a brief period. This approach revealed that genes in supposedly ‘silent’ heterochromatin were still expressed but only very rarely—in about 1 in every 1000 cell divisions.</p><p>Dodson and Rine's findings suggest that when silencing is lost, it is promptly re-established with the aid of a protein called Sir1. In addition, the new technique revealed that Sir1 helps to prevent losses of silencing in the first place. As such, the Sir1 protein appears to have previously unappreciated roles in the maintenance and the inheritance of heterochromatin in dividing yeast cells. Dodson and Rine also discovered that a protein called Hst3—which acts to remove chemical markings from histone proteins—also helps stabilize the silenced state. With this technique in hand, it is now possible to test any molecule, environment, or cellular process for its potential effect on the stability of gene silencing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05007.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05007.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>bistability</kwd><kwd>Sir2</kwd><kwd>Sir3</kwd><kwd>Sir4</kwd><kwd>histone H3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM 031105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rine</surname><given-names>Jasper</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5 T32 GM 7232-34</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dodson</surname><given-names>Anne E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE 1106400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dodson</surname><given-names>Anne E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell and single-molecule analyses of transient gene expression revealed hitherto unrecognized dynamics in heterochromatin function and defined novel roles for a heterochromatin establishment factor and an understudied sirtuin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heterochromatin is a heritable, condensed chromatin structure that silences the expression of most genes within or near it. Phenomena such as clonal inheritance of inactivated X-chromosomes in female mammals, as well as position-effect variegation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and yeast, demonstrate the remarkable ability of cells to propagate heterochromatic repression through mitosis. As an epigenetic state, heterochromatic gene repression provides a means for genetically identical cells to differentiate into stable, distinct cell types. However, despite its significance, little is known about the dynamics of heterochromatic repression and which factors contribute to or disrupt its stability.</p><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, heterochromatin forms at the silent mating-type loci, <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic>, through the recruitment and subsequent spreading of Sir proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grunstein and Gasser, 2013</xref>). DNA elements known as the <italic>E</italic> and <italic>I</italic> silencers flank each locus and nucleate complexes of Sir2, Sir3 and Sir4. Sir complexes then deacetylate histones and bind nucleosomes throughout the region, thereby rendering <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> transcriptionally silenced and largely inaccessible to DNA-interacting proteins. Since each locus contains either <bold>a</bold> or α mating-type information, as does the <italic>MAT</italic> locus, heterochromatic repression of <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> ensures that the <italic>MAT</italic> genotype is the only determinant of whether haploids mate as <bold>a</bold> or α cells.</p><p>Following its initial establishment, Sir-mediated heterochromatin can be maintained through the G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub> and M phases and inherited through S phase. Sir2, Sir3 and Sir4 are essential for all aspects of silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rine and Herskowitz, 1987</xref>). Thus, mutants lacking any of these proteins express <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> to the level of the transcriptionally active <italic>MAT</italic> locus. In contrast, mutants lacking Sir1 exhibit a bistable silencing phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pillus and Rine, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). Within a population of <italic>sir1</italic> cells, <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> exist in one of two phenotypic states: silenced or expressed. Each state is heritable for multiple cell divisions, demonstrating the epigenetic nature of Sir-mediated heterochromatin and inspiring the notion that Sir1 functions in the establishment of silencing, but not the maintenance or inheritance thereafter.</p><p>Notably, rare switches occur between the two expression states of <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> in <italic>sir1</italic> mutants, during which silencing is either lost or established. If Sir1 functioned exclusively in establishment, then losses of silencing should also occur in wild-type cells, yet no such event has been detected. Wild-type expression levels of genes at the <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> loci are 1000-fold lower than the expression levels of the same genes when at the <italic>MAT</italic> locus, and efforts to detect expression of <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> by any molecular method have shown the expression signal is indistinguishable from background noise. Moreover, 100% of <italic>MATa</italic> cells respond to α-factor, and diploids homozygous at the <italic>MAT</italic> locus are completely unable to sporulate. Thus, by all previous molecular criteria, the silent mating-type loci are transcriptionally inert. However, heterochromatin undergoes regular exchange of at least some of its structural components with newly synthesized molecules of the same proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng and Gartenberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Festenstein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheutin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ficz et al., 2005</xref>) and is subject to perturbations, such as its replication in S phase. These fluctuations in heterochromatin structure imply that either the mechanism of silencing compensates for these changes and flawlessly reassembles each cell cycle, or that there are rare, as yet undetected losses of silencing resulting from heterochromatin dynamics.</p><p>To address whether RNA polymerase ever succeeds in transcribing silent chromatin at <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic>, we designed an assay capable of detecting short-lived gene expression with single-cell resolution. By capturing the consequences of transcription with a permanent, heritable mark, we detected transient losses of silencing at <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> in wild-type cells, characterized the nature of these losses, and identified genetic determinants of heterochromatin stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To determine the stability of gene repression in heterochromatin, we placed the gene encoding the Cre recombinase under control of the <italic>α2</italic> promoter at either <italic>HMLα</italic> or <italic>HMRα</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). RNA measurements made by quantitative RT-PCR showed that <italic>cre</italic> was as repressed as the native <italic>α2</italic> gene at this location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). On chromosome V of both the <italic>HMLα</italic><italic>::cre</italic> and <italic>HMRα</italic><italic>::cre</italic> strains, we integrated a sequence in which two <italic>loxP</italic> sites flanked the <italic>RFP</italic> gene and the selectable drug marker <italic>kanMX</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The <italic>loxP</italic>–<italic>RFP</italic>-<italic>kanMX</italic>-<italic>loxP</italic> sequence resided downstream of the strong <italic>GPD</italic> promoter and upstream of a promoterless <italic>GFP</italic> gene. Thus, cells carrying this RFP-GFP cassette were RFP-positive, drug resistant, and GFP-negative. However, in the event that <italic>cre</italic> repression were lost, the resulting Cre protein could mediate recombination at the <italic>loxP</italic> sites, thereby excising the <italic>RFP</italic> and <italic>kanMX</italic> genes and positioning the <italic>GFP</italic> gene adjacent to the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It should be noted that the recombination event would be essentially irreversible in that the excised DNA lacked an origin of replication and would thereby be lost upon cell division. Therefore, the transient expression of <italic>cre</italic> would trigger a permanent switch to GFP expression and drug sensitivity in that cell and in all of its descendants. By convention, we refer to cells expressing RFP as red, and cells expressing GFP as green.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05007.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cre-based assay.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Design of assay to detect short-lived gene expression.

We first tested whether the expression of <italic>cre</italic> from the <italic>α2</italic> promoter would produce enough recombinase to cause an efficient RFP-to-GFP switch by adding the Sir2 inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM) to the medium. The nicotinamide-induced derepression of either <italic>HMLα</italic><italic>::cre</italic> or <italic>HMRα</italic><italic>::cre</italic> resulted in entirely green colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These observations were consistent with the quantification of GFP fluorescence by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, expression of the <italic>cre</italic> gene at either <italic>HML</italic> or <italic>HMR</italic> was both necessary and sufficient for the switch from RFP to GFP expression. We then plated <italic>HMLα</italic><italic>::cre</italic> and <italic>HMRα</italic><italic>::cre</italic> cells on medium lacking nicotinamide to determine the stability of gene silencing under normal conditions. The resulting colonies were predominantly red, indicating the majority of cells maintained the repression of <italic>cre</italic> throughout growth of the colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Within these colonies, however, we observed discrete green sectors, each of which represented a loss-of-silencing event that occurred in a cell at the vertex of the sector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although the switch to GFP expression was irreversible, some of the smaller sectors did not extend to the edge of the colony, likely due to a combination of genetic drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hallatschek et al., 2007</xref>) and the nature of three-dimensional growth of the colony.

First, <italic>cre</italic> and <italic>GFP</italic> mRNA levels were measured in both red and green regions from within the same colony. If the loss-of-silencing event that resulted in the green sector were temporary, then the level of <italic>HMLα</italic><italic>::cre</italic> repression would be indistinguishable between red and green sectors. Alternatively, if the loss of silencing were permanent, then <italic>cre</italic> mRNA would be detectable in cells from the green sector. Consistent with the efficiency of heterochromatin formation, which occurs de novo in approximately 1–2 cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Osborne et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>HMLα</italic><italic>::cre</italic> repression was fully restored in the descendants of a cell that experienced a loss of silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The slight difference in <italic>GFP</italic> expression between wild-type cells from the green sector and <italic>sir2Δ</italic> cells may have been due to the constitutive presence of Cre protein in the <italic>sir2Δ</italic> mutant, which could have potentially disrupted transcription by binding the <italic>loxP</italic> site between the promoter and the <italic>GFP</italic> gene. In addition, the <italic>GFP</italic> mRNA values in the red population likely reflected a low level of GFP expression since colonies were grown in the absence of G418 selection and therefore RFP-to-GFP switches occurred at a low rate. As secondary confirmation that losses of silencing were transient, we have never detected green sectors in colonies of a wild-type strain containing the <italic>GFP</italic> gene under control of the <italic>α2</italic> promoter at <italic>HMLα</italic> (unpublished observations).</p><p>The pattern of colony fluorescence revealed the history of individual lapses in silencing, with the size of each green sector corresponding to how early the silencing loss occurred during colony growth. Colonies that were half red/half green reflected a loss of <italic>cre</italic> repression in either the mother or daughter cell of the first division that gave rise to the colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Therefore, the frequency of half-sectored colonies equaled the rate of RFP-to-GFP switches per cell division.

The distribution of <italic>KAP104</italic> expression in wild-type cells was slightly lower than the distribution in the <italic>sir4Δ</italic> mutant, which may be explained by our observation that <italic>sir4Δ</italic> cells were slightly larger than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), as noted before for <italic>sir2Δ</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moretto et al., 2013</xref>).

The wild-type strain and the negative control strain were distinguishable, however, by the frequency of cells containing more than one spot of <italic>cre</italic> signal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). We observed five wild-type cells across all three replicates (13,695 wild-type cells total) that contained more than one <italic>cre</italic> spot, ranging from 2 to 4 spots per cell, whereas we never detected more than one <italic>cre</italic> spot per cell in the negative control strain (13,722 No-<italic>cre</italic> cells total). Together, the RNA FISH analysis and the Cre-based assay converged on the same striking conclusion: the low rate of RFP-to-GFP switches reflected the complete absence of <italic>HMLα::cre</italic> transcription in the vast majority of cells.</p><p>There was no evidence of any wild-type cells containing <italic>cre</italic> RNA levels typical of <italic>sir4Δ</italic> cells<italic>,</italic> suggesting that in the rare cells that lost silencing, the duration of transcription was short, presumably due to continuous nucleation of silent chromatin by Sir1 and other factors. Silencing in individual <italic>sir1</italic> cells was previously measured by indirect bioassays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pillus and Rine, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2006</xref>), and with respect to transcription, the expression levels of <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> underlying the two phenotypically distinct cell types in a <italic>sir1</italic> population have never been established. RNA FISH allowed us to evaluate <italic>sir1Δ</italic> cells at the level of transcription on a per cell basis to determine whether these two states were molecularly equivalent to the levels of <italic>HML</italic> expression seen in <italic>sir4Δ</italic> and wild-type cells.

Therefore, in approximately half of all cells lacking Sir1, <italic>HML</italic> was fully repressed, whereas the other half expressed <italic>HML</italic> at levels indistinguishable from those in a <italic>sir4Δ</italic> mutant.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Effects of Sir protein availability on the dynamics of silencing</title><p>Although Sir1 was defined by its role in the establishment of silencing, and is not required for maintenance or inheritance, the possibility that it contributes to these other processes has never been directly tested. Such a test would require a comparison of the rate of silencing loss in wild-type cells to the rate of silencing loss in the population of <italic>sir1</italic> cells in which <italic>HML</italic> was silenced. Whereas past measurements in wild-type cells were confounded by the role of Sir1 in establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2006</xref>), the Cre-based assay is sensitive enough to record losses of silencing before re-establishment occurs.</p><p>To determine whether Sir1 contributes to the maintenance or inheritance of silencing, we sporulated a <italic>sir1</italic> hemizygote containing <italic>HMLα::cre</italic> and the RFP-GFP cassette and then imaged the fluorescence of colonies derived from the meiotic products.

However, green sectors were notably more abundant in the colonies of spores lacking Sir1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, the frequency of half-sectored colonies in a <italic>sir1Δ</italic> haploid was 35-fold above the frequency of half-sectored colonies in a wild-type haploid (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that cells lost silencing at <italic>HML</italic> at a strikingly higher rate when Sir1 was absent. In strains containing <italic>HMRα::cre</italic> instead of <italic>HMLα::cre</italic>, <italic>sir1Δ</italic> colonies showed elevated sectoring and a higher abundance of half sectors in comparison to wild-type colonies, as well (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, beyond its role in establishment, Sir1 contributed to either the maintenance or inheritance of silencing at both <italic>HMLα</italic> and <italic>HMRα</italic>.

To determine whether Hst3 stabilized silencing through deacetylation of H3 K56-ac or through deacetylation of yet undiscovered substrates, we measured the effects of amino acid substitutions that either mimic (K56Q) or prevent (K56R) the acetylation of H3 K56. Although these histone gene mutations were previously analyzed for their effects on silencing, the outcome varies depending on the locus and the assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hyland et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). In our strains, with <italic>cre</italic> under the native <italic>α2</italic> promoter at <italic>HML</italic>, colonies of the K56Q mutant showed a dramatic increase in sectoring, whereas the K56R mutant was similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consistent with the possibility that the <italic>hst3Δ</italic> silencing defects were due to an increase in acetylated histone H3 K56, the sectoring phenotypes suggested that neutralizing the positive charge at this position on histone H3 impaired the stability of repression. By half-sector analysis, however, both the K56Q and K56R mutants showed a significant increase (p = 3 × 10<sup>−3</sup> and p = 9 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, respectively; Student's <italic>t</italic> test) in the rate of silencing loss compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The relatively high frequency of half-sectored colonies in the histone H3 K56R mutant was unexpected due to the similarity in sectoring patterns between histone H3 K56R mutant colonies and wild-type colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, the histone H3 K56R substitution has previously been shown to decrease silencing under various conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). Differences between sectoring patterns and half-sector frequencies are considered further in the ‘Discussion’.</p><p>Cells expressing the H3 K56Q mutant produced similar patterns of colony sectoring regardless of whether Hst3 was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This phenotype was slightly less severe than that of <italic>hst3Δ</italic> cells expressing wild-type H3 K56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), perhaps because glutamine was not quite as disruptive to silencing as acetylated lysine at this residue. In addition, the H3 K56R substitution in <italic>hst3Δ</italic> cells restored silencing to wild-type levels, as determined by overall colony sectoring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, blocking the acetylation of residue 56 suppressed the <italic>hst3Δ</italic> sectoring phenotype. Collectively, the sectoring patterns suggested that Hst3 promoted the stability of silencing through the deacetylation of histone H3 K56-ac. Whereas the deletion of <italic>HST3</italic> caused a threefold increase in the half-sector frequency of wild type (p = 3 × 10<sup>−4</sup>; Student's <italic>t</italic> test), it did not significantly affect the half-sector frequency of the H3 K56Q mutant (p = 0.3; Student's <italic>t</italic> test) or the surprisingly high half-sector frequency of the H3 K56R mutant (p = 0.06; Student's <italic>t</italic> test) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, the state of histone H3 K56 affected the stability of silencing at <italic>HML</italic>, and amino acid substitutions of this residue were epistatic to the <italic>hst3Δ</italic> mutation.</p><p>Colonies derived from cells in which the only source of histone H3–H4 genes was a plasmid-borne copy of <italic>HHT2-HHF2</italic> exhibited more sectoring than colonies of cells containing both <italic>HHT1-HHF1</italic> and <italic>HHT2-HHF2</italic> at their native chromosomal loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Assuming the decrease in gene copy number led to a decrease in protein abundance, silencing was likely affected by levels of histones H3 and H4 that were either limiting or improperly balanced with the levels of histones H2A and H2B. Consistent with these possibilities, histone dosage has previously been shown to affect various functions of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moore et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moore et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Venditti et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>In principle, the effect of histone H3–H4 gene dosage should sensitize silencing in all genetic backgrounds.

In pedigree A, onset of GFP expression (depicted as yellow) was detected in a large-budded cell (1). At the same time, GFP also appeared in the daughter cell that arose from the previous cell division (2). Due to the assymetry of switch 1 (only the mother cell remained green, implying that recombination occurred after DNA replication), switches 1 and 2 must have arisen from independent recombination events. It is unknown, however, whether the two recombination events resulted from two losses of silencing, or rather one loss of silencing that occurred when the two cells shared a cytoplasm (earliest stage shown for the pedigree). In pedigree B (montage shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), GFP fluorescence was first detected in a small-budded cell that gave rise to two cells that remained green (1). Approximately 40 min later, the daughter cell of the preceding cell division also began to show GFP fluorescence as a small-budded cell. In pedigree C, GFP expression was first detected in a mother-daughter pair subsequent to cytokinesis, but prior to both cells budding. Whereas the mother cell became green, however, the daughter cell developed a large bud without ever reaching a similar level of GFP expression, at which point the experiment ended. This pattern could be explained by two switching events, one early asymmetric switch where only the mother inherited a recombined RFP–GFP cassette and the daughter cell inherited GFP molecules along with an intact RFP–GFP cassette, followed by a later switch that occurred in the daughter cell. Alternatively, there could have been only one early switch where the RFP–GFP cassette inherited by the daughter cell either did not undergo recombination and GFP perdurance was especially long, or the cassette did undergo recombination, but GFP expression was weak, perhaps due to an error in recombination.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05007.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05007.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05007-fig8-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>Of the remaining cells that switched, three cells had small buds when GFP fluorescence was first detected and 12 had large buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).

Alternatively, recombination may have occurred shortly after DNA replication at both newly synthesized copies of the RFP-GFP cassette. In contrast, 8 of the 12 cells that expressed detectable GFP as large-budded cells gave rise to mother-daughter pairs in which only the mother or daughter remained green (patterns 7 and 8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>), indicating that Cre catalyzed recombination after S phase and acted on only one of the two RFP-GFP cassettes. Switches that followed patterns 7 and 8 also demonstrated that the time between recombination, which occurred some point after DNA replication, and GFP detection, which occurred when a large bud was present, spanned only a fraction of a complete cell cycle.</p><p>For three of the RFP-to-GFP switches, we observed a second switch in the daughter cell that arose from the immediately preceding cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). These paired switches, which occurred either simultaneously or within 40 min of each other, could have reflected either two loss-of-silencing events in directly related cells, or rather one loss-of-silencing event that happened when the mother cell and its daughter still shared a cytoplasm, assuming there was perdurance of the Cre protein in both cells and a delay in recombination. These patterns are considered further in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> and the ‘Discussion’.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Several lines of evidence establish the dynamic nature of heterochromatin structure. The incorporation of newly synthesized Sir3 into silenced chromatin during G<sub>1</sub>-phase arrest suggests that at least some Sir3 binding to nucleosomes is transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng and Gartenberg, 2000</xref>). Similarly, fluorescence-recovery-after-photobleaching experiments have shown that heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), a structural component of heterochromatin in other eukaryotes, can rapidly associate and dissociate from heterochromatic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheutin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Festenstein et al., 2003</xref>). However, the consequences of these structural fluctuations on the underlying functions of heterochromatin remain poorly understood. Here, we showed that heterochromatin dynamics had a functional impact on the transcriptional repression imparted by Sir proteins. Moreover, we have established a route to a comprehensive understanding of all factors influencing heterochromatin dynamics.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Inherent dynamics of heterochromatic gene silencing</title><p>At a low rate, the heterochromatic loci <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> underwent losses of silencing that had escaped detection by all previous efforts, due to the combination of their rarity and transience. Independent observations indicated that silencing was promptly re-established following its loss. First, <italic>HMLα::cre</italic> was fully silenced in the descendants of cells that switched to GFP expression, showing that <italic>cre</italic> expression was only temporary. Secondly, single-molecule RNA FISH did not detect any wild-type cells expressing <italic>HMLα::cre</italic> to the average level of <italic>sir4Δ</italic> cells, implying that when silencing was lost in wild-type cells, it was restored before <italic>cre</italic> transcription could reach that level. These data, taken together with the inability of less sensitive assays to capture expression of <italic>HML</italic> or <italic>HMR</italic>, suggested that losses of silencing were rare and short-lived.</p><p>The detection of silencing loss in a subset of wild-type cells supported a model where Sir proteins and the transcriptional machinery constantly compete for access to the silent mating-type loci. Such a concept is consistent with the dynamic exchange of structural components in heterochromatin, the continuous recruitment of Sir proteins by the silencers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng and Gartenberg, 2000</xref>), and the ability of increased levels of a transcriptional activator to overcome the silenced state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aparicio and Gottschling, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad and Henikoff, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). This model could explain why losses of silencing were more frequent when cells contained only half the normal gene dosage of <italic>SIR1</italic>, <italic>SIR3</italic> or <italic>SIR4</italic>. Perhaps losses of silencing at <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> resulted from stochastic fluctuations in the local concentration of silencing factors. Alternatively, specific perturbations such as DNA replication may have disrupted the binding of Sir proteins to nucleosomes, thereby creating an opportunity for RNA polymerase to access heterochromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Defining the roles of Sir1 in silencing</title><p>The contribution of Sir1 to silencing in wild-type cells was previously underappreciated. Heritability of the repressed state in a subset of <italic>sir1Δ</italic> cells showed that Sir1 was not absolutely required for the maintenance or inheritance of silenced chromatin, and suggested that Sir1 primarily functioned in establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pillus and Rine, 1989</xref>). However, the presumed role of Sir1 seemed paradoxical under the assumption that wild-type cells never lose silencing and thus do not undergo events requiring re-establishment. This point of confusion can now be resolved by two key findings. First, the Cre-based assay revealed that transient transcription of <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> occurred at a low rate in wild-type cells. Therefore, Sir1 may serve a purpose in the recovery of silencing on the rare occasion that it is lost. Secondly, losses of silencing occurred more often in cells lacking Sir1, indicating that Sir1 contributed to either the maintenance or inheritance of silencing, or both.</p><p>Previous measurements of silencing established that two phenotypic states exist within a population of <italic>sir1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pillus and Rine, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2006</xref>), yet the levels of expression in each of the two subpopulations remained unresolved. For example, in <italic>sir1Δ</italic> cells containing a fluorescent reporter under control of the <italic>URA3</italic> promoter at <italic>HML</italic>, the fluorescence intensity profile of each subpopulation shifted in relation to the profiles of wild-type cells and <italic>sir3Δ</italic> cells depending on whether the <italic>URA3</italic> trans-activator Ppr1 was present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). By directly measuring the transcription of a gene from the native <italic>α2</italic> promoter at <italic>HML</italic> with single-cell and single-molecule resolution, we showed that the silenced subset of <italic>sir1Δ</italic> cells was fully repressed, whereas the expressed subset of <italic>sir1Δ</italic> cells transcribed <italic>cre</italic> to the level of <italic>sir4Δ</italic> cells.</p><p>Together, the Cre-based assay and the RNA FISH measurements resolved two separable aspects of silencing: the level of repression and the rate at which it is lost. Deletion of <italic>SIR1</italic> affected the rate of silencing loss, but not the level of repression since approximately half of all <italic>sir1</italic> cells completely lacked <italic>cre</italic> transcripts. Moreover, the persistence of RFP expression within regions of <italic>sir1Δ</italic> colonies containing either <italic>HMLα</italic><italic>::cre</italic> or <italic>HMRα</italic><italic>::cre</italic> and the RFP-GFP cassette underscored the remarkable ability of heterochromatin to template its own replication for multiple cell divisions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Is there a role for a dynamic dimension to heterochromatic gene silencing?</title><p>In principle, the dynamic nature of silenced chromatin could result from stochastic processes intrinsic to, for example, the binding constants of Sir proteins for their nucleosomes and serve no useful role. Alternatively, the stability of silencing at <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> could be tuned high enough to achieve cell-type specificity, yet just low enough to allow for events such as DNA replication or mating-type interconversion. Haploid cells of a homothallic strain can switch mating types through repair of a double-stranded DNA break at <italic>MAT</italic> using <italic>HML</italic> or <italic>HMR</italic> as a template. Therefore, successful switching requires that the invading <italic>MAT</italic> strand, along with the accessory proteins involved in recombinational repair, gain access to the heterochromatic donor sequence. We speculate that the dynamics of silenced chromatin may contribute to the efficiency of mating-type interconversion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Role of the Hst3 sirtuin and its histone H3 target in heterochromatin stability</title><p>The stability of silencing at <italic>HML</italic> depended in part on Hst3 and the deacetylation of H3 K56-ac. H3 K56 localizes to the DNA entry/exit region of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luger et al., 1997</xref>), and in the acetylated state it is thought to promote transient DNA ‘breathing’, during which the DNA partially unwraps from the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neumann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Simon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">North et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, H3 K56-ac is important for transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Williams et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Värv et al., 2010</xref>), and telomeric heterochromatin is more accessible to the bacterial <italic>dam</italic> DNA methylase in various H3 K56 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that H3 K56-ac destabilizes the nucleosome conformation and thereby renders the DNA more accessible to RNA polymerase.</p><p>H3 K56 acetylation and Hst3 expression are both regulated by the cell cycle. Whereas H3 K56 acetylation peaks during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Masumoto et al., 2005</xref>), Hst3 expression does not peak until G<sub>2</sub>/M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spellman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Celic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maas et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, heterochromatin may be especially susceptible to transcription during the time after K56-acetylated histone H3 is deposited into chromatin, but before Hst3 removes the modification.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>A tractable tool for measuring the dynamics of heterochromatic repression</title><p>As previous measurements of <italic>HML</italic> silencing were unable to distinguish <italic>hst3</italic> mutants from wild type, our detection of a stability phenotype in this mutant underscored the importance of measuring fluctuations in repression for a fuller understanding of heterochromatin. The ability of this assay to capture the existence of transient events through their conversion to permanent, heritable marks can now allow a comprehensive evaluation of the contribution of any and all genes to heterochromatin dynamics. By preserving a historical record of transcription, the Cre-based assay also provides the opportunity to measure the effects of transient environmental or cellular stresses on silencing subsequent to their occurrence. Such analyses will inform our understanding of the mechanisms by which cells maintain integrity of the epigenome.</p><p>Measuring the frequency of half-sectored colonies allowed for quantification of the rate at which silencing was lost. In general, half-sector frequencies were consistent with the overall patterns of colony sectoring. However, strains bearing the histone H3 K56R substitution, for example, were indistinguishable from wild type by sectoring pattern, yet showed a significant increase in the frequency of half-sectored colonies. While we do not fully understand why silencing in histone H3 K56R mutants appeared to be less stable at the two-cell stage of colony growth than at later stages, the complexities of colony development may offer a simple explanation. The physiology of cells during the first cell division of colony growth, at which point silencing was measured by half-sector analysis, would be expected to differ from the physiology of cells during later divisions. Therefore, it is possible that the histone H3 K56R mutation rendered heterochromatin more sensitive to the physiological state of cells. Overall, both assays were informative, and sectoring patterns in particular provided the opportunity to survey heterochromatin dynamics throughout the various microenvironments and metabolic states of colonies.</p><p>A direct comparison could not be made between the rate of RFP-to-GFP switching, as determined by half-sector analysis, and the frequency of wild-type cells expressing <italic>HMLα::cre</italic>, as determined by FISH. Whereas half-sector analysis measured events throughout the duration of an entire cell cycle, the FISH method measured expression in a snapshot of time. Furthermore, the background levels of FISH signal in the negative control strain, though very low, limited quantitative interpretation of the low <italic>cre</italic> RNA levels in wild-type cells. The FISH measurements did show, however, that any detectable transcription of <italic>HMLα::cre</italic> in wild-type cells was both rare and restricted to relatively low levels. These observations implied that a small number of <italic>cre</italic> transcripts produced enough recombinase to catalyze the RFP-to-GFP switch. Further experiments would be necessary to determine the number of <italic>cre</italic> RNAs sufficient for recombination.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Capturing losses of silencing in real time</title><p>The live-cell imaging of pedigrees of wild-type cells endowed with the Cre-based assay reflected our first efforts to visualize in real time the silencing loss events whose history is written in the number and size of green colony sectors. In principle, RNA FISH by itself could provide better time resolution, but morphological classification of fixed spheroplasts using brightfield images was unreliable, especially with the high density of cells needed to capture rare events. Despite the time lag between loss-of-silencing events and the production of the GFP chromophore, several points were clear. First, there was no obvious mother-daughter bias as to which cell contained the more labile <italic>HML</italic> locus. Secondly, the expression of <italic>cre</italic> and the subsequent switches from red to green could occur within the same cell cycle. Overall, the variety of patterns we observed were consistent with the possibility that losses of silencing occur at multiple points during the cell cycle, but such conclusions rely on assumptions for which we have no independent verification. Knowing the extent of variation in the time lag between <italic>HMLα::cre</italic> expression and recombination would help solidify further interpretation. Intriguingly, there were three pedigrees in which a red daughter, born from a mother that switched to green, itself switched to green. Given the low probability of a switch, two switches in such closely related cells implied there was either perdurance of the Cre protein following a single loss-of-silencing event, or some ‘heritable’ instability shared between these two cells, as has been previously suggested in a different context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaufmann et al., 2007</xref>). Future experiments such as live-cell imaging of transcription should reveal the exact timing of silencing loss and address whether the history of a lineage affects stability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains</title><p>The strains, plasmids, and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data SD4-data SD5-data">Supplementary files 1, 2 and 3</xref>, respectively.

Given that some <italic>sir4Δ</italic> and <italic>sir1Δ</italic> cells contained a relatively large number of <italic>cre</italic> transcripts, some of which appeared to overlap each other in a maximum-intensity projection of z-stacks, spot detection was performed in three dimensions to resolve individual spots (code adapted from L Teytelman and available upon request). Within each experiment (three independent experiments were performed), the same threshold values (one for <italic>cre</italic> RNA images and one for <italic>KAP104</italic> RNA images) were applied across all samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Live-cell imaging</title><p>Cells containing <italic>HMLα</italic><italic>::cre</italic> and the RFP-GFP cassette (JRY9628) were grown to mid-log phase in CSM −Trp, sonicated once for 5 s at a power output of 10%, and then imaged over time using the CellASIC ONIX Microfluidic Platform (EMD Millipore, Hayward, CA). Growth was restricted to a single focal plane within chambers of the Y04C Microfluidic Plate for Haploid Yeast (EMD Millipore). CSM −Trp flowed through the chambers continuously at a pressure of 3 psi. Brightfield and fluorescence images of 46 different fields were taken every 10 min for 13 hr using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and an Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) equipped with a Clara Interline CCD camera (Andor Technology, Belfast, Northern Ireland) and a CFI Apo TIRF 60 × /1.49 oil-immersion objective (Nikon Instruments), which was heated to 30°C using an objective heater (Bioptechs, Butler, PA). Exposure times for yEGFP and yEmRFP fluorescence were each 100 ms. Image analysis and video assembly were performed using ImageJ software (NIH).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Leonid Teytelman, Alexander van Oudenaarden and Abby Dernburg for their valuable guidance and provisions for the RNA FISH.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor), Dan Gottschling (guest Reviewing editor), and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript presents extremely interesting results concerning the regulation of transcription of the silent mating type cassettes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. By using the Cre–regulated RFP–GFP reporter described in the paper, the authors can stably capture exceedingly rare expression from within a silent mating type cassette. Using this tool, they investigate the frequency of expression of these cassettes in both wild–type cells and in a set of mutants. One highlight of the manuscript is that the system seems to work and work well. It shows that there is a very low level of expression in wild–type that was not previously detectable. A second highlight is that the experiments reveal that Sir1 is required for more than establishment of silencing, as the data reveal that it is also likely required for maintenance. Other results provide evidence that the histone deacetylase Hst3 is required for silencing and that the absolute levels of heterochromatin components—histones and Sir proteins—are also important. Overall, the development of the reporter system as well as the specific results will be of interest to a large number of scientists.</p><p>The referees agreed that the data are interesting and overall of good technical quality. However, there was also a consensus that the promise of quantitative measurement was not carried forward in the mutant analysis, and that this should be done before acceptance of the manuscript. This and a few other concerns to be addressed are presented below:</p><p>1) Many of the mutant phenotypes in the manuscript are not described in a very quantitative fashion, as they are described and shown only as increased levels of green sectoring. This is true for effects of Sir protein levels, H3/H4 levels, Hst3 effects, H3K56Q mutants, and more. But one of the important points of this manuscript is the quantitative nature of the assay. The reviewers see this initial work as <italic>the</italic> chance to set the standard in the field for all other follow up studies using this assay. Thus before endorsing this work for acceptance, all the mutant analyses should be carried out via a half sector analysis to provide a quantitative measurement for comparison (rather than the semi–quantitative analysis of relative sectoring that was presented). This will help alleviate uninterpretable comparisons that occur between labs or even between mutants.</p><p>2) It is clear that the expression of GFP is dependent upon Cre expression. However, the level of Cre expression and the efficiency at which it mediates recombination at the lox sites is not clear. That is, the FISH experiments tell us that very few wt cells have a Cre signal above background (2–4 spots versus 1 spot). However they do not tell us whether 2–4 spots of Cre are sufficient for recombination. At best this can only be inferred from comparing the frequency of FISH signals to half–sectors. Please acknowledge/define these limitations of your interpretation in the text.</p><p>3) There are a few concerns/comments about the Hst3/H3K56 experiments. First, in Figure 10, the authors conclude that an increased level of sectoring is caused by reduced levels of H3/H4 based on comparing wild–type strains to those with only one copy of H3/H4 on a plasmid. A change in H3/H4 level seems like the likeliest explanation, but other explanations seem possible in the absence of careful measurements of histone levels. Second, the analysis of the amino acid changes at H3K56 (Figure 9) appears to have been done in strains with this same configuration of H3/H4 genes; that is, with a perturbation of sectoring levels already in place. It's hard to know if the altered histone gene configuration might affect the degree of the change caused by the H3K56 changes. It is suggested these two sections be combined to present the results and possible caveats more clearly. Ideally, what is currently Figures 8–10 would be part of the same figure. Finally, there's evidence that an Hst4 deletion causes little phenotype except when combined with an Hst3 deletion, in which case it enhances the Hst3 phenotype. Did the authors test an Hst3 Hst4 double mutant for sectoring levels? If they did not, it would still be helpful to acknowledge the possibility that the double mutant might show an even stronger phenotype.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05007.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Many of the mutant phenotypes in the manuscript are not described in a very quantitative fashion, as they are described and shown only as increased levels of green sectoring.

Measuring these low rates was a daunting and laborious task that in the end required hundreds of liters of media and the screening of hundreds of thousands of colonies. Hence it took a substantial amount of time to revise the manuscript. In anticipation of this workload, we excluded the few mutants that did not show a sectoring phenotype (the <italic>sir2</italic> hemizygote and the <italic>hst1Δ</italic>, <italic>hst2Δ</italic> and <italic>hst4Δ</italic> mutants) from our analysis. The newly determined half-sector frequencies are represented as bar graphs in new panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6 fig7">Figures 5, 6 and 7</xref>. A summary of these values is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, and the raw data are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Table 1–source data 1</xref>.</p><p>For the majority of measurements, the results were straightforward. Differences in sectoring patterns were reflected by differences in the frequency of half-sectored colonies for the genotypes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig5 fig6 fig7">Figures 3, 5, 6 and 7A</xref>. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, however, we found that some genotypes (in particular, strains containing the histone H3 K56R substitution) displayed frequencies of half-sectored colonies that were unexpected based upon the sectoring phenotypes, thus challenging us to consider the ways in which half-sector occurrence could have diverged from the overall sectoring pattern. The most parsimonious explanation for these results was, given that cells experience distinct physiological states between different stages of colony growth and even between different locations within the same colony, these changes in state may have affected silencing in certain genetic backgrounds. Whereas half-sector measurements were restricted to the first cell division of colony growth, the sectoring patterns of developed colonies offered a more complex yet expansive interpretation of heterochromatin dynamics. We added this point to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) It is clear that the expression of GFP is dependent upon Cre expression.

We inferred from this observation that very few <italic>cre</italic> transcripts were sufficient to induce a RFP-to-GFP switch. Although we stand by this interpretation, we agree with the reviewers that more evidence is needed to confirm this possibility. Therefore, we moved this text from the Results to the Discussion and elaborated on the limitations of comparing the FISH analysis to the Cre-based assay.</p><p><italic>3) There are a few concerns/comments about the Hst3/H3K56 experiments. First, in Figure 10, the authors conclude that an increased level of sectoring is caused by reduced levels of H3/H4 based on comparing wild–type strains to those with only one copy of H3/H4 on a plasmid.

Did the authors test an Hst3 Hst4 double mutant for sectoring levels? If they did not, it would still be helpful to acknowledge the possibility that the double mutant might show an even stronger phenotype</italic>.</p><p>For the experiments related to Hst3 and histone H3 K56, we combined what were previously Figures 8 and 9 into what is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> to show the sirtuin deletion mutants together with the histone H3 K56 mutants, as suggested. Figure 10, which showed that a strain containing only one copy of the histone H3-H4 gene pair on a plasmid exhibited more sectoring than a strain containing the two endogenous histone H3-H4 gene pairs, was turned into a supplementary figure to accompany the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. We added text to both the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and the main text to clarify that all strains shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> were in the genetic background containing only one copy of the histone H3-H4 gene pair on a plasmid. This background did sensitize the sectoring phenotype of <italic>hst3Δ</italic> colonies as it did for wild-type colonies (compare the <italic>hst3Δ</italic> colonies between panels A and B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>), but it had a more variable effect on the frequency of half sectors, which is now discussed in the Results. A change in histone H3 and H4 levels is indeed the likeliest explanation for the histone H3-H4 gene dosage effect on silencing. However, to address the valid point that alternative explanations cannot be ruled out, we adjusted the text to both strengthen support for this model and recognize any inherent assumptions. Finally, since previous publications have shown Hst4 to be a minor contributor to the role of its paralog Hst3, we agree with the reviewers that deletion of Hst4 would likely enhance the phenotype of the <italic>hst3Δ</italic> mutant. In recognition of this, we added text to the Results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
