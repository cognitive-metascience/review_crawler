Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of this process and currently both VEGF and its receptors, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and Neuropilin1 (NRP1), are targeted in therapeutic strategies for vascular disease and cancer. NRP1 is essential for vascular morphogenesis, but how NRP1 functions to guide vascular development has not been completely elucidated. In this study, we generated a mouse line harboring a point mutation in the endogenous <italic>Nrp1</italic> locus that selectively abolishes VEGF-NRP1 binding (<italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF−</italic></sup>). <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF−</italic></sup> mutants survive to adulthood with normal vasculature revealing that NRP1 functions independent of VEGF-NRP1 binding during developmental angiogenesis. Moreover, we found that <italic>Nrp1</italic>-deficient vessels have reduced VEGFR2 surface expression in vivo demonstrating that NRP1 regulates its co-receptor, VEGFR2. Given the resources invested in NRP1-targeted anti-angiogenesis therapies, our results will be integral for developing strategies to re-build vasculature in disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03720.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03720.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03720.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Blood flows through blood vessels to carry oxygen and nutrients towards, and waste away from, the cells of the body. New blood vessels are formed not only during development but also throughout life as part of normal tissue growth and repair. However, blood vessels may also form as a consequence of diseases, such as cancer. For example, tumors often stimulate the growth of new blood vessels to ensure a good supply of blood carrying nutrients and oxygen. As such, some anti-cancer therapies try to stop blood vessels from developing in an attempt to slow down or prevent tumor growth.</p><p>New blood vessels often form by branching off from existing vessels. One molecule that stimulates this branching process is called vascular endothelial growth factor (or VEGF for short). Three ‘receptor’ proteins found on the outside of cells can bind to the VEGF molecule and then trigger a response inside the cell that guides the development of new blood vessels. VEGF and its receptor proteins—including one called NRP1—are being investigated as a possible target for drugs that could treat cancer and other diseases affecting blood vessels. However, the exact mechanisms that control the formation of new blood vessels are not fully understood, which makes it difficult to develop these treatments.</p><p>Now Gelfand et al. have created mice whose NRP1 receptors cannot bind VEGF. These mice unexpectedly survive to adulthood and develop normal blood vessels. This outcome is in contrast to mice that lack NRP1, which normally die as embryos and have severe defects with their nerves and blood vessels. Gelfand et al. instead found that mice that only lack NRP1 in the cells of their blood vessels had less of another receptor protein called VEGFR2 on the surface of these cells. This result suggests that NRP1 controls blood vessel development, not by binding to VEGF but by affecting how much of the VEGFR2 receptor is available to interact with VEGF.</p><p>These findings challenge the long-held view of how NRP1 functions and lead Gelfand et al. to suggest a new mechanism: NRP1 interacts with VEGFR2, rather than with VEGF, to control the formation of new blood vessels. Future work will aim to uncover how these interactions regulate the normal development of blood vessels, and if other molecules that bind to NRP1 are involved in this process. Furthermore, these findings may help to guide the on-going efforts to develop drugs that target NRP1 into treatments that are effective against diseases that involve problems with blood vessels—including diabetes, immune disorders, and cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03720.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03720.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Neuropilin-1</kwd><kwd>developmental angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>VEGFR2</kwd><kwd>VEGF</kwd><kwd>mouse genetic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS064583</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Chenghua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Alice and Joseph Brooks Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tata</surname><given-names>Aleksandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Harvard Mahoney Neuroscience Institute Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lacoste</surname><given-names>Baptiste</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

The molecular mechanisms underlying angiogenesis have become increasingly clear, and VEGF is an essential player in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Carmeliet et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferrara et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iruela-Arispe and Dvorak, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miquerol et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ruhrberg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stalmans et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rossant and Hirashima, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Coultas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Olsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung and Ferrara, 2011</xref>). VEGF operates by interacting with three receptors, VEGFR1, VEGFR2 (KDR/Flk1), and NRP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ferrara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung and Ferrara, 2011</xref>). Although these three receptors are expressed in spatially and temporally overlapping patterns, they are thought to play different roles in VEGF signaling. The main receptor for VEGF, VEGFR2, is a receptor tyrosine kinase whose activity is crucial for VEGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Olsson et al., 2006</xref>). Upon binding VEGF, VEGFR2 phosphorylates intracellular targets leading to a multitude of cellular responses including proliferation, migration, and transcriptional modification via signaling pathways such as PI3K, Src, and PLCϒ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Olsson et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, NRP1 is a multifaceted transmembrane receptor that not only binds VEGF and forms a complex with VEGFR2 but also binds a structurally and functionally unrelated family of traditional axon guidance cues, the secreted class 3 semaphorins (SEMA3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He and Tessier-Lavigne, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kolodkin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Soker et al., 1998</xref>). Consistent with these binding partners, <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice are embryonically lethal with both neural and vascular defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kitsukawa et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kawasaki et al., 1999</xref>), indicating that NRP1 protein is instrumental for developmental angiogenesis. However, how NRP1 functions in conjunction with multiple ligands and receptors to guide vascular development remains elusive.</p><p>Previous work has started to systematically dissect NRP1 function in vivo using a combination of structure–function analyses and mouse genetic approaches. In particular, endothelial-specific NRP1 knock-outs (<italic>Tie2-Cre;Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/−</italic></sup>) recapitulate the devastating vascular defects observed in <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice—the vascular network is poorly developed and large endothelial cell aggregates form within the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2003</xref>). This result strongly demonstrates that NRP1 is a cell autonomously required in endothelial cells for its absolutely essential function in developmental angiogenesis. To pinpoint how SEMA3-NRP1 vs VEGF-NRP1 binding contributes to NRP1's critical role in vascular development, previous work generated a knock-in mouse line, <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>Sema−</italic></sup>, in which SEMA3-NRP1 interactions were abolished and VEGF-NRP1 binding was maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>Sema−</italic></sup> mice mimicked the neural defects observed in the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> but did not exhibit any vascular abnormalities. These data suggest that SEMA3-NRP1 binding does not mediate NRP1's important function in vascular morphogenesis and instead point to the hypothesis that VEGF-NRP1 interactions may be integral for angiogenesis.</p><p>Currently, the dominant view in the field asserts that VEGF-NRP1 binding enhances VEGFR2 activity and downstream signaling. Yet, the functional consequence of VEGF-NRP1 interactions has only been studied indirectly using in vitro methodology and blocking antibodies in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herzog et al., 2011</xref>). Specifically, an antibody inhibiting VEGF-NRP1 binding was found to interfere with retinal vascular remodeling as well as tumor angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pan et al., 2007</xref>) and is currently being developed as a therapeutic strategy to block vessel outgrowth. This study suggests that VEGF-NRP1 binding facilitates pathological angiogenesis. However, in vivo evidence describing a role for VEGF-NRP1 binding in vascular development is currently lacking and the precise function of NRP1 in VEGF-mediated angiogenesis urgently needs to be addressed.</p><p>To delineate the role of VEGF-NRP1 interactions, we identified a single amino acid residue in the b1 domain of NRP1 that is necessary for VEGF-NRP1 binding and generated a mouse harboring this point mutation to abolish VEGF-NRP1 interactions in vivo (<italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF−</italic></sup>). Surprisingly, although VEGF-NRP1 binding was successfully eliminated, the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF−</italic></sup> mutants survived into adulthood and did not display any of the severe vascular phenotypes seen in either the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> or the endothelial-specific NRP1 knock-out. Upon closer examination, NRP1-deficient blood vessels in the endothelial-specific NRP1 knock-out exhibited reduced VEGFR2 surface expression, a phenomenon not observed in the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF−</italic></sup> mutant. These results challenge the well-accepted view that NRP1 requires VEGF-NRP1 binding to facilitate developmental angiogenesis and points to a provocative new hypothesis that the angiogenic role of NRP1 lies in its capacity as a VEGFR2 co-receptor. Interestingly, retinal angiogenesis and blood flow recovery following hindlimb ischemia were mildly perturbed in the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF−</italic></sup> mutant suggesting that the postnatal vascular system is uniquely sensitive to the loss of VEGF-NRP1 binding. Together, this work not only significantly advances our basic scientific understanding of how NRP1 functions in VEGF-mediated angiogenesis, but also provides new insights that may facilitate the development of more effective NRP1-targeted anti-angiogenesis therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of an <italic>Nrp1</italic> mutation that abolishes VEGF-NRP1 binding</title><p>We sought to elucidate the in vivo function of VEGF-NRP1 binding by generating a mouse line that selectively disrupts VEGF binding to NRP1. A previous structure–function analysis revealed that the b1 domain of NRP1 is necessary and sufficient for VEGF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gu et al., 2002</xref>). However, this b1 region is also required for SEMA3-NRP1 interactions, so a series of <italic>Nrp1</italic> variants containing smaller deletions in the b1 domain were engineered with site-directed mutagenesis to identify a region specific for VEGF-NRP1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Based upon previous publications, we first targeted two specific sites in the b1 domain: the 7-residue binding site of the Pathologische Anatomie Leiden-Endothelium (PAL-E) monoclonal antibody which competes with VEGF for NRP1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaalouk et al., 2007</xref>) and the 3-residue binding site of the VEGF analog tuftsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vander Kooi et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). COS-1 cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) or mutant <italic>Nrp1</italic> constructs and assessed for NRP1 expression. PAL-E and tuftsin binding site mutations did not affect NRP1 protein expression at the cell surface as examined by non-permeabilized antibody staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Ligand binding to NRP1 was assessed using alkaline phosphatase-tagged VEGF (AP-VEGF) and SEMA3A (AP-SEMA3A) in conjunction with alkaline phosphatase histochemistry. All of the PAL-E or tuftsin binding site variants were capable of abolishing VEGF-NRP1 binding, but unfortunately, also eliminated SEMA3-NRP1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03720.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design and assessment of <italic>Nrp1</italic> variants harboring mutations in the VEGF-binding site.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the NRP1 b1 extracellular domain and crystal structure highlighting three potential mutagenesis sites: the PAL-E binding site (orange circle), tuftsin binding site (blue circle), and electronegative surface (red circle).

Likewise, mutations in the tuftsin binding site (S346A, E348A, T349A or S346A, E348A) abolished AP-SEMA3A binding and reduced AP-VEGF binding. Although mutations in the NRP1 electronegative surface (E319K, D320K) eliminated AP-VEGF binding and reduced AP-SEMA3A binding, the E319K mutation only slightly reduced AP-SEMA3A binding and maintained AP-VEGF binding.

Specifically, we identified a hydrophilic region comprised of several negatively charged residues that provided a promising mutagenesis site for abolishing VEGF-NRP1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Several of these residues were mutated to amino acids of the opposite charge in order to preserve the hydrophilic nature of the region. As with previous <italic>Nrp1</italic> variants, NRP1 surface expression was unperturbed in transfected COS-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). One of these mutations (E282K) did not affect the binding of either AP-SEMA3A or AP-VEGF, while others (E282K and E420K) eradicated binding of both the ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the D320K mutation converting aspartic acid 320 into lysine (<italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>D320K</italic></sup>) successfully abolished VEGF-NRP1 binding while conserving AP-SEMA3A binding as demonstrated through alkaline phosphatase histochemical staining on transfected COS-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>).

In this regard, NRP1 must function through an alternative mechanism to regulate vascular development during embryogenesis. The intracellular domain of NRP1 does not have any obvious enzymatic activity and is not responsible for the signal transduction mediating angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fantin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lanahan et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, two apparent alternatives remain. One possibility is that a yet unidentified ligand outside the VEGF or SEMA3 family binds to NRP1 and instructs developmental angiogenesis. Alternatively, NRP1 may control vascular development by directly regulating its co-receptor, VEGFR2.</p><p>To test this second possibility, VEGFR2 expression was evaluated in the <italic>Tie2-Cre;Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/−</italic></sup> mutants and control littermates via Western blot on E14.5 lung tissue.

A point mutation in this D320 residue was incorporated into the endogenous <italic>Nrp1</italic> locus to generate the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF−</italic></sup> mutant, a novel mouse line that selectively abolishes VEGF-NRP1 binding in vivo. Recently a cDNA knock-in NRP1 mutant, <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>Y297A/Y297A</italic></sup>, was also developed to examine the role of VEGF-NRP1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fantin et al., 2014</xref>). However, mice generated with genetically modified cDNA notoriously lack the essential intronic regions that regulate the temporal and spatial expression of the gene. Consequently, the aberrant and severe down-regulation of NRP1 protein expression in the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>Y297A/Y297A</italic></sup> hypomorph prevents any definitive conclusions from being garnered about the biological cause of phenotypes present in this mouse. In this regard, abnormalities in the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>Y297A/Y297A</italic></sup> hypomorph could originate from two potential sources: the severe reduction in NRP1 levels or the abolishment of VEGF-NRP1 binding. Unlike the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>Y297A/Y297A</italic></sup> line, our <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF−</italic></sup> mutant contains a two base pair replacement in the endogenous <italic>Nrp1</italic> locus and preserves the genetic structure of the <italic>Nrp1</italic> gene. Consequently, <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF−</italic></sup> mice maintain appropriate levels of NRP1 protein expression and allow the first unobscured in vivo assessment of VEGF-NRP1 binding in developmental angiogenesis. Our <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF−</italic></sup> line provides a powerful new genetic tool for selectively interrogating the function of VEGF-NRP1 binding in broad areas of basic research and translational study.</p><p>Remarkably, our <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF−</italic></sup> mutant did not recapitulate the early embryonic lethality or developmental angiogenesis phenotypes of the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and endothelial-specific NRP1 knock-out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF−</italic></sup> mutant did not exhibit any of the cardiac failure, perinatal lethality, or growth defects observed in the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>Y297A/Y297A</italic></sup> hypomorph indicating that these phenotypes are attributed to the severe reduction in NRP1 protein in <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>Y297A/Y297A</italic></sup> mutants rather than the lack of VEGF-NRP1 binding. However, the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF−</italic></sup> mutant did exhibit a delay in vascular extension and a reduction in the number of arteries in the postnatal retina. This retinal phenotype is significantly less severe than those observed in the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>Y297A/Y297A</italic></sup> hypomorph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fantin et al., 2014</xref>) or in animals treated with antibodies inhibiting VEGF-NRP1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pan et al., 2007</xref>). Together, these results reveal that the retina relies on both VEGF-NRP1 dependent and independent mechanisms to establish the retinal vasculature.</p><p>Our surprising results challenge the well-accepted view that NRP1 depends on VEGF-NRP1 binding to facilitate angiogenesis and points to a provocative new hypothesis that NRP1 functions independently of VEGF-NRP1 binding perhaps via its interaction with an unidentified ligand or in its capacity as a co-receptor for VEGFR2. Our study demonstrates that the NRP1-deficient endothelial cells have reduced VEGFR2 expression at the cell surface, a phenomenon that was not observed in the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF−</italic></sup> mutants. This result provides the first in vivo evidence that NRP1 controls VEGFR2 levels at the cell membrane and offers the first in vivo phenotypic characterization linking NRP1 regulated VEGFR2 surface expression to vascular development.</p><p>Consistent with our in vivo observations, several lines of in vitro work using multiple cell culture systems demonstrate that NRP1 is essential for the proper presentation, recycling, and degradation of VEGFR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shintani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holmes and Zachary, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ballmer-Hofer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hamerlik et al., 2012</xref>). The loss of function and gain of function studies in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) found that VEGFR2 protein levels were decreased in the absence of NRP1 while <italic>Vegfr2</italic> mRNA levels were unaffected by Nrp1 siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shintani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holmes and Zachary, 2008</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hamerlik et al. (2012)</xref> examined human glioblastoma multiforme cells and found that shRNA mediated knock-down of NRP1 resulted in dramatically decreased VEGFR2 protein levels accompanied by a lower surface presentation of VEGFR2 and a decrease in cell viability. Moreover, cell surface protein biotinylation and immunofluorescence staining with confocal microscopy confirmed the co-localization of VEGFR2-NRP1 with the early/recycling endosome. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ballmer-Hofer et al., (2011)</xref> used stably transfected porcine aortic endothelial cell (PAEC) lines in conjunction with immunostaining to visually follow VEGFR2 trafficking in the presence and absence of NRP1. Their experiments revealed that upon VEGF stimulation, VEGFR2 is internalized in Rab7 vesicles for degradation. However, in the presence of NRP1, VEGFR2 is stabilized in Rab11 vesicles and recycled back to the cell surface. In conjunction with our in vivo results, these data demonstrate that NRP1 guides vascular development through its capacity as a VEGFR2 co-receptor rather binding to VEGF. In this manner, NRP1 regulates angiogenesis by controlling the amount of VEGFR2 expression at the cell surface and consequently the level of VEGFR2-VEGF signaling.</p><p>The modulation of co-receptors may function as a general mechanism for regulating cell signaling and behavior. A prior in vitro study identified a similar relationship between the membrane protein, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Francavilla et al., 2009</xref>). This previous work discovered that NCAM induced sustained FGFR1 activation by controlling the intracellular trafficking of the FGFR1 receptor. Specifically, NCAM was capable of re-targeting internalized FGFR1 from the lysosomal degradation pathway to Rab11-postive recycling vesicles and increased FGFR1 expression at the cell surface. In this regard, the co-receptor interaction between NRP1 and VEGFR2 may be representative of a more universal phenomenon in which membrane proteins function to regulate the cell surface expression and subsequent downstream signaling of receptors.</p><p>Ultimately, our findings mark a pivotal step toward understanding the role of NRP1 in developmental angiogenesis and indicate that NRP1-VEGFR2 interactions rather than VEGF-NRP1 binding underlie NRP1's critical function in VEGF-mediated vascular development. Given the substantial resources invested in NRP1-targeted anti-angiogenesis therapies for vascular disease and cancer, the information gleaned from this study will be invaluable in identifying the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying angiogenesis and ultimately using this information to instruct the development of new therapeutic approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Site-directed mutagenesis and targeting vector construction</title><p>Rat Neuropilin1 cDNA was re-cloned from pMT21 into pCS2+ using the original EcoRI and XhoI sites present in both vectors.

Cells incubated with no antibody, APC-anti-Flk1, or PE-anti-CD31 only served as the control population.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Phenotypic analysis of the developing retina</title><p>Whole-mount retina immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., (2011)</xref>. Briefly, eyes were extracted and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Retinas were dissected in PBS and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C. Retinas were then permeabilized in PBS, 1% BSA, and 0.5% Triton X-100 at 4°C overnight, washed 2× for 5 min in 1% PBT (1% Triton X-100 in PBS), and incubated in Isolectin GS-IB4 (1:200, #I21411 Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and anti-αSMA Cy3 (1:100, #C6198 Sigma-Aldrich, Natick, MA) in 1% PBT overnight at 4°C. Retinas were washed 3× for 5 min and flat-mounted using ProLong Gold antifade reagent (#P36934 Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Flat-mounted retinas were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon Eclipe 80i microscope equipped with a Nikon DS-2 digital camera and by confocal laser scanning microscopy using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. Quantification was performed using MetaMorph Image Analysis Software and ImageJ. At least four retinal leaves were quantified per animal to determine the vascular extension ratio, both eyes were examined in each animal for artery number, and three representative images were quantified from each animal for vascular coverage (representing the total isolectin-positive pixel area per image).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Femoral artery ligation</title><p>Ketamine (80–100 mg/kg) and xylazine (5–10 mg/kg) delivered by IP injection were used to anesthetize 12-week old male <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF−</italic></sup> and control littermates. After anesthesia was achieved, the bilateral hindlimbs and lower abdomen were cleared of hair and cleaned with 10% betadine and 70% alcohol. An incision of 3–4 mm was made in the right inguinal area to visualize the femoral artery. Two 6–0 silk sutures were tied in the proximal femoral artery and the deep femoral and epigastric artery branches were cauterized. The femoral artery was then ligated between the two sutures. The skin was sutured with one 4–0 prolene sutures. Immediately before and after surgery, each animal was scanned with a non-invasive laser doppler imaging system (moorLD12-HR Moor Instruments, Wilmington, DE) under 1–3% isofluorane anesthesia. Blood flow recovery in the hindlimbs was further assessed on 3, 5, and 7 days post-surgery and quantified via Moor LDI Software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The standard error of the mean was calculated for each experiment and error bars in the graphs represent the standard error.

I am also including the three reviews in their original form at the end of this letter, as there are many specific and useful suggestions in them that will not be repeated in the summary here.</p><p>All of the reviewers were impressed with the incisive design and execution of your experiments. The mutant mouse that you constructed is the cleanest experimental approach to date to address the question of whether direct VEGF binding to Neuropilin1 (Nrp1) plays a role in vivo. Our consensus is that this is an important body of work but that a few key questions have been left open and that addressing them would greatly enhance the impact of the study.</p><p>These are:</p><p>Is the Nrp1 VEGF binding mutant mouse really normal? A close look at the retinal vasculature (e.g. at P7, P9, and adulthood) and at health/fertility at later ages would be useful. You might consider stressing the system, for example with the oxygen induced retinopathy model (your colleague Lois Smith at Children's Hospital is the expert) or with a test of tumor angiogenesis, both of which tie into the applied aspects of this work as related to the efficacy of anti-Nrp1 antibodies. Comparing the phenotypes to those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fantin et al (2014)</xref> would be useful.</p><p>The decrease in VEGFR2 levels (and surface VEGFR2), which is presented as the mechanism by which the Nrp1 KO exerts its effects, could use more experimental backing. Checking the level of VEGFR2 phosphorylation in response to VEGF and an assessment of VEGFR2 trafficking with vs. without Nrp1 vs. with the Nrp1 VEGF binding mutant (in cell culture) would be very helpful.</p><p>Is the VE cadherin level in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> lower in the absence of Nrp1? If so, does this suggest other roles for Nrp1? Also, the decrease in VEGFR2 by Western blot seems more dramatic than the decrease shown by FACS. Is the lower level of VEGFR2 shown by FACS in the absence of Nrp1 really insufficient for VEGF signaling? Or is something more subtle at play (defective trafficking?)?</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Clear mechanistic understanding of the VEGF signaling pathway is of paramount importance since this pathway lies in the heart of vascular biology and is being targeted to treat a number of human diseases. The role of Neuropilin-1 is an important piece of the puzzle in VEGF signaling, and the central dogma about Neuropilin-1 is that binding to VEGFA is essential for its function despite lacking direct evidence to support it. Recent attempt to provide direct evidence by assessing a Neuropilin-1 allele that lacks VEGF-A binding capacity fell short to answer this question due to the severe reduction of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fantin et al 2014</xref>). In this report, Gelfand et al carried out rigorous analyses of a knockin Neuropilin-1 allele that abolished VEGFA binding yet preserved expression levels, and provided convincing evidence to demonstrate that the VEGFA binding capacity is dispensable for embryonic vascular development. They also provided biochemical evidence implicating Neuropilin-1 in the regulation of VEGFR2 levels. This study unequivocally refutes a dogma in the VEGF signaling field and reveals a novel Neuropilin-1 function. It is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The overall quality of the paper can be improved by addressing the following comments.</p><p>1) The degree of surface VEGFR2 reduction is much less than that of total VEGFR2 when Npn1 was deleted in ECs (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> with 5A), suggesting that the loss of Npn1 effect on surface VEGFR2 might be secondary to a reduction of total VEGFR2. Since the exiting data cannot distinguish between maintaining surface VEGFR2 levels versus regulating total VEGFR2 levels, the mechanism depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> is not supported by actual data. The diagram should be modified to reflect a reduction in total VEGFR2, and the related text descriptions throughout the manuscript should be revised accordingly.</p><p>2) Since the reduction of surface VEGFR2 is modest (∼ 30%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) in the Npn1 null ECs, the functional significance of reducing VEGFR2 levels has not been clearly established. This question can be addressed by including a phospho-VEGFR2 blot or ELISA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>3) Data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fantin et al. 2014</xref> indicated that either severely reduced NRP1 levels and/or abolishment of NRP1-VEGFA binding plays an important role in postnatal angiogenesis. This is an important issue in the angiogenesis field. The authors have the proper tool and data to address this question. They can contribute to the angiogenesis community by mentioning some aspects of postnatal development in their Npn1VEGFR- mice. For example, they can include a table that documents mouse numbers at different age after birth to demonstrate if there is reduced viability overtime, instead of only giving a statement about a single time point. They can also point out if they have seen overt phenotypes reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fantin et al. 2014</xref>, for example, have they ever seen evidence of cardiac failure in some of their knockin mice?</p><p>4) Some mechanistic data related to how NPN1 regulates VEGFR2 level will significantly elevate this manuscript to a different level. The authors should consider including one or two in vitro analysis similar to the NCAM / FGFR1 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Francavilla et al 2009</xref>).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Gelfand et al present evidence that a point mutation (D320K) in the extracellular domain of neuropilin 1 (Npn1) prevents its binding to VEGF while leaving relatively intact Nrp1 association with Sema 3A. By gene replacement strategy they also generated a mouse line harboring the D320K mutation in the Npn1 locus.</p><p>The major finding of this paper is that, in absence of VEGF binding to Npn1, embryo vascular development is unaffected. Furthermore, it is reported that Npn1 co-immunoprecipitates with VEGFR2 and stabilizes VEGFR2 levels. The authors therefore hypothesize that Npn1 acts by controlling VEGFR2 levels through a still undefined mechanism.</p><p>1) The authors are not giving a fair representation of the literature. In the Abstract they report: “Npn1 is essential for vascular morphogenesis, but how Npn1 functions to guide vascular development remains elusive”. This statement is unfair considering several previous papers: Lanahan et al Dev Cell 2013; Fantin et al Development 2014 or Raimondi et al J Exp Med 2014. Furthermore, similarly to what is reported here, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fantin et al., 2014</xref> already generated mice expressing Npn1 with a mutation that prevents VEGF binding. Homozygous mutated mice were viable and no severe and lethal cardiovascular phenotypes were observed implying that Npn1 could have VEGF-independent role during vascular development. Although the experimental approaches used in the two papers are different, the final conclusion remains the same.</p><p>2) The reduction in VEGFR2 levels in Npn1 mutants is indeed striking but does not correspond to the findings of many other authors where the uncoupling or strong reduction on Npn1 did not modify VEGFR2 or VEGFR1 expression (see, as an example, Fantin et al. Development 2014). In addition, while in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 A</xref> the drop in receptor expression is almost complete; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 D</xref> it is around 35% only.</p><p>Since Title, Abstract and Discussion are focused on this finding the authors should present more solid data to support their conclusions. Last but not least, if the decrease in VEGFR2 is in the range presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 A</xref> the phenotype of Npn1 KO should be comparable to that of VEGFR2 KO and this is not the case.</p><p>3) The authors do not investigate the possible effects of their Npn1 mutant on neurons. Taking into account that some types of neurons rely on VEGF165 and Npn1 signaling, these observations are needed for a more complete interpretation of the mutant phenotype.</p><p>4) Introduction. Most of previously published data converge in saying that the domain of Npn1 responsible for the binding of Sema 3a is the b1 region and not the a1 (see for instance <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2103 by Kikutani). This should be introduced and discussed in a better way in the text.</p><p>In conclusion, the model presented is of particular value and the data shown demonstrate unequivocally that Npn1 acts independently from binding to VEGF 165. However, more solid data on the mechanism of action of Npn1 are needed to make the paper novel enough for publication in the Journal.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this study the VEGF binding site of Neuropilin has been mutated in mice. This has been executed very well, with careful in vitro validation of the mutation to ensure that the mutation (D320K) only affects VEGF but not Sema3 binding. This approach is more sophisticated and better controlled than a previous study from another group who created a Nrp1Y297A mutation (PMID: 24401374), also aimed at ablating VEGF binding in Nrp1. The NrpY297A study suffered from a poor genetic targeting strategy that resulted in reduced Nrp1 expression (in vivo). Surprisingly, both studies found that VEGF binding to Nrp1 is not required for normal embryonic development. The current study shows this more convincingly, because the Nrp1Y297A study was more difficult to interpret because of the reduced Nrp1 levels caused by the Nrp1Y297A mutation. The novel Nrp1D320K strain described here will therefore be a very useful, well validated research tool.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors found that the Nrp1D320K mutation caused a dramatic reduction of VEGFR expression. This is a very intriguing observation and it would be interesting to know the reason for this and what the functional consequences are. The study does not explore this but the authors conclude (in the Discussion) that “Nrp1 regulates angiogenesis by controlling the amount of VEGFR2 expression at the cell surface and consequently the level of VEGFR2-VEGF signaling.”</p><p>There are several problems with this statement:</p><p>1) It is logically wrong. Since the Npn1VEGF mice have reduced VEGFR2 levels but develop normally, Nrp1 obviously is not regulating angiogenesis via VEGFR2 levels, otherwise the mice would have a Nrp1 KO phenotype.</p><p>2) The authors have not actually shown that VEGFR2 signalling is reduced. This would have to be shown more directly (e.g. VEGFR2 phosphorylation in Western blots).</p><p>3) Although the flow cytometry data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> indicates reduced surface expression of VEGFR2 this seems only to be the case for around 50% of the cells. On the other hand, the Western blot data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 A</xref>) indicates a much stronger reduction of around 90% (contradicting the flow cytometry data somewhat). This demonstrates that also intracellular VEGFR2 must be dramatically reduced and not only surface VEGFR2</p><p>4) VEGFR2 levels were only studied in lung endothelial cells.

They can contribute to the angiogenesis community by mentioning some aspects of postnatal development in their Npn1VEGFR- mice.

In the Abstract they report: “Npn1 is essential for vascular morphogenesis, but how Npn1 functions to guide vascular development remains elusive”. This statement is unfair considering several previous papers: Lanahan et al Dev Cell 2013; Fantin et al Development 2014 or Raimondi et al J Exp Med 2014</italic>.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, similarly to what is reported here,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6"><italic>Fantin et al., 2014</italic></xref> <italic>already generated mice expressing Npn1 with a mutation that prevents VEGF binding. Homozygous mutated mice were viable and no severe and lethal cardiovascular phenotypes were observed implying that Npn1 could have VEGF-independent role during vascular development. Although the experimental approaches used in the two papers are different, the final conclusion remains the same</italic>.</p><p>We have updated this sentence in the Abstract to provide a fairer representation of the previously published work. As Reviewer 1 points out, the phenotypes described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fantin et al., 2014</xref> have two potential interpretations: they could originate from the severe reduction in NRP1 levels or from the abolishment of VEGF-NRP1 binding. Our <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF-</italic></sup> mutant maintains appropriate levels of NRP1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, Figure 3–figure supplement 3D) and provides the proper <italic>in vivo</italic> tool to delineate between these two alternatives. We have now assessed the phenotypes described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fantin et al., 2014</xref> and while some are linked to VEGF-NRP1 binding (retinal vasculature extension and arteriogenesis) others most likely result from the reduced NRP1 levels observed in the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>Y297A/Y297A</italic></sup> hypomorph rather than from lack of VEGF-NRP1 binding (cardiac failure, retinal vascular density, and retinal endothelial tufts). A detailed point-by-point description of these results is provided above.</p><p><italic>2) The reduction in VEGFR2 levels in Npn1 mutants is indeed striking but does not correspond to the findings of many other authors where the uncoupling or strong reduction on Npn1 did not modify VEGFR2 or VEGFR1 expression (see, as an example, Fantin et al. Development 2014). In addition, while in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5 A</italic></xref> <italic>the drop in receptor expression is almost complete; in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5 D</italic></xref> <italic>it is around 35% only</italic>.</p><p><italic>Since Title, Abstract and Discussion are focused on this finding the authors should present more solid data to support their conclusions. Last but not least, if the decrease in VEGFR2 is in the range presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5 A</italic></xref> <italic>the phenotype of Npn1 KO should be comparable to that of VEGFR2 KO and this is not the case</italic>.</p><p>We agree with this sentiment and have gone back to quantify the VEGFR2 levels in our Western blots. Indeed, the decrease in VEGFR2 levels is more on par with the FACS analysis and we have replaced the Western blot image with a more representative data. Furthermore, we have included our quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) The authors do not investigate the possible effects of their Npn1 mutant on neurons. Taking into account that some types of neurons rely on VEGF165 and Npn1 signaling, these observations are needed for a more complete interpretation of the mutant phenotype</italic>.</p><p>First, we looked at the most robust neural phenotype that has been linked to VEGF-NRP1 function. Specifically, facial motor neurons express NRP1, and their migration during development is dependent on the presence of VEGF164 (Schwarz et al., 2004). According to the literature, <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants have a defect in which the migration of the facial motor neurons is disrupted. The phenotype was thought to be a result of VEGF-NRP1 binding in neurons because <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>Sema-</italic></sup> and <italic>Tie2-Cre;Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/-</italic></sup> mutants do not have this phenotype while VEGF-120 mice phenocopy the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>. With <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization for <italic>Isl1</italic>, we analyzed the migratory path of motor neurons at E12.5. To our surprise, we did not see a migration defect in the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF-</italic></sup> mutant. However, we also failed to see a migration defect in the neuronal-specific NRP1 knock-out (<italic>Nestin-Cre,Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup>) demonstrating that NRP1 is not required in neurons for this phenotype. In this regard, our data bring the claims of previous work into question and resolving this discrepancy is beyond the scope of our current manuscript. In addition, we also examined gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons because Carboni et al., 2011 showed that VEGF164 promotes the survival of migrating GnRH neurons by co-activating the ERK and AKT signaling pathways through NRP1. However, as with the facial motor neurons, we did not detect any GnRH survival phenotype in our <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF-</italic></sup> mutants.</p><p><italic>4) Introduction. Most of previously published data converge in saying that the domain of Npn1 responsible for the binding of Sema 3a is the b1 region and not the a1 (see for instance</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2103 by Kikutani). This should be introduced and discussed in a better way in the text</italic>.</p><p>We have already stated that “A previous structure-function analysis revealed that the b1 domain of NRP1 is necessary and sufficient for VEGF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gu et al., 2002</xref>). However, this b1 region is also required for SEMA3-NRP1 interactions so a series of <italic>Nrp1</italic> variants containing smaller deletions in the b1 domain were engineered with site-directed mutagenesis to identify a region specific for VEGF-NRP1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>)” in the Results section.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>Furthermore, the authors found that the Nrp1D320K mutation caused a dramatic reduction of VEGFR expression. This is a very intriguing observation and it would be interesting to know the reason for this and what the functional consequences are. The study does not explore this but the authors conclude (in the Discussion) that “Nrp1 regulates angiogenesis by controlling the amount of VEGFR2 expression at the cell surface and consequently the level of VEGFR2-VEGF signaling</italic>.<italic>”</italic></p><p><italic>There are several problems with this statement</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) It is logically wrong. Since the Npn1VEGF mice have reduced VEGFR2 levels but develop normally, Nrp1 obviously is not regulating angiogenesis via VEGFR2 levels, otherwise the mice would have a Nrp1 KO phenotype</italic>.</p><p>Based on the critique, it is apparent that Reviewer 3 misunderstood the results from our study. We clearly show that <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF-</italic></sup> mice have normal VEGFR2 levels, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> via Western blot and FACS analysis. In contrast, <italic>Tie2-Cre,Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/-</italic></sup> mutants have reduced VEGFR2 levels which is consistent with the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> phenotype shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The authors have not actually shown that VEGFR2 signalling is reduced. This would have to be shown more directly (e.g. VEGFR2 phosphorylation in Western blots)</italic>.</p><p>We have performed additional experiments to determine the level of VEGFR2 phosphorylation in lung lysates following VEGF treatment in the <italic>Tie2-Cre,Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF-</italic></sup> mutants. Please see our detailed description above.</p><p><italic>3) Although the flow cytometry data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C</italic></xref> <italic>indicates reduced surface expression of VEGFR2 this seems only to be the case for around 50% of the cells</italic>. <italic>On the other hand, the Western blot data (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5 A</italic></xref><italic>) indicates a much stronger reduction of around 90% (contradicting the flow cytometry data somewhat). This demonstrates that also intracellular VEGFR2 must be dramatically reduced and not only surface VEGFR2</italic></p><p>As previously described above, we have reassessed VEGFR2 levels in our Western blots and now have included quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Importantly, we have determined that the decrease in VEGFR2 observed in the <italic>Tie2-Cre,Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/-</italic></sup> mutant is comparable to the reduction seen in our FACS analysis</p><p><italic>4) VEGFR2 levels were only studied in lung endothelial cells. Yet the main vascular phenotype in Nrp1 mutants is found in the brain and retinal vasculature</italic>.</p><p>We examined VEGFR2 levels in lung endothelial cells for practical purposes, in that we were able to harvest the greatest number of endothelial cells from this organ to perform our analysis. The <italic>Tie2-Cre;Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>fl/-</italic></sup> mutants are embryonic lethal and finding a tissue with an adequate source of cells was of paramount importance. We attempted to analyze brain endothelial cells via FACS, but the tissue was difficult to dissociate and formed clumps during the immunolabeling process. These clumps were unable to be analyzed via the FACS equipment and resulted in a significant loss of endothelial cells from our samples.</p><p><italic>5) The Nrp1Y297A mice also developed normally but that study found abnormalities in postnatal animal, such as abnormal retinal vasculature development, reduced neovascularisation in the oxygen induced retinopathy model and reduced tumour growth. These postnatal phenotypes should be also checked in the Nrp1D320K mice</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate this constructive criticism and have now included a broader phenotypic analysis of the <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup><italic>VEGF-</italic></sup> mutant. In particular, we have examined the retinal vasculature at two time points (P9 and adult), challenged the mutant with a hindlimb ischemia assay, and included additional information about fertility, organ size, and viability.</p></body></sub-article></article>
