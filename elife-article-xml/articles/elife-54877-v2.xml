cardiopulmonary mortality via macrophage-driven lung inflammation; however, the mechanisms are incompletely understood. RNA-sequencing demonstrated <italic>Acod1</italic> (<italic>Aconitate decarboxylase 1</italic>) as one of the top genes induced by PM in macrophages. <italic>Acod1</italic> encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that produces itaconate, which has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects via NRF2 after LPS. Here, we demonstrate that PM induces Acod1 and itaconate, which reduced mitochondrial respiration via complex II inhibition. Using <italic>Acod1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, we found that Acod1/endogenous itaconate does not affect PM-induced inflammation or NRF2 activation in macrophages in vitro or in vivo. In contrast, exogenous cell permeable itaconate, 4-octyl itaconate (OI) attenuated PM-induced inflammation in macrophages. OI was sufficient to activate NRF2 in macrophages; however, NRF2 was not required for the anti-inflammatory effects of OI. We conclude that the effects of itaconate production on inflammation are stimulus-dependent, and that there are important differences between endogenous and exogenously-applied itaconate.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Air pollution is a major global health problem that causes around 4.2 million deaths each year. Once inhaled, pollution particles can remain in the lungs, where they cause inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately chronic disease. Macrophages, a population of immune cells in the lungs, are involved in this inflammatory process.</p><p>Itaconate is a molecule with potential anti-inflammatory effects, produced by mammalian cells including macrophages. Recent studies have shown that a modified form of the molecule, 4-octyl itaconate, reduces inflammation when applied to cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide, a component of infectious bacteria that is, usually, a strong trigger of inflammation. These experiments used the 4-octyl modification to ensure that itaconate could get into the cells.</p><p>Itaconate’s anti-inflammatory action is thought to work by activating a signaling process in cells called the NRF2 pathway. NRF2 is a protein made by ‘active’ macrophages, that is, macrophages already primed to respond to foreign particles. NRF2 in turn increases production of factors that ‘damp down’ inflammation, all of which are collectively termed the NRF2 anti-inflammatory pathway. Although macrophages in the lungs are linked with inflammation caused by air pollution, their role – and that of itaconate – is still not well-understood. Sun et al. therefore wanted to determine if itaconate helps macrophages control pollution-induced inflammation.</p><p>Initial experiments treated mouse macrophage cells with pollution particles. Analyzing gene activity in these cells showed that exposure to pollution did indeed switch on the <italic>Acod1</italic> gene, which encodes the enzyme that makes itaconate. It also turned on genes for other molecules involved in inflammation. Pre-treating macrophages with 4-octyl itaconate before pollution exposure reduced inflammation and also, as expected, turned on the NRF2 pathway.</p><p>To determine whether cells’ own production of itaconate affected lung inflammation, macrophages were isolated from mutant mice lacking <italic>Acod1</italic>. Comparing these cells, which could not make itaconate, with normal cells revealed that removing itaconate did not change the inflammatory response to pollution. Activity of the NRF2 pathway also remained similar in both types of cells. This showed that itaconate produced by macrophages likely has different effects on lung inflammation from other forms of the compound.</p><p>These findings represent a step forward in understanding how pollution interacts with immune cells in the lungs. They reveal that the source of anti-inflammatory factors can be just as important in shaping immune responses as the type of factor. These results highlight the need for further, detailed work on the mechanisms underlying pollution-induced disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group

associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is one of the top preventable causes of death in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">McGlade and Landrigan, 2019</xref>). The World Health Organization estimates that exposure to air pollution is responsible for 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">WHO, 2018</xref>). Air pollution has been identified as a leading cause of global disease burden, and as the fifth mortality risk factor particularly in low- and middle-income countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>). The majority of PM-associated morbidity and mortality is due to cardiopulmonary diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, lung cancer, congestive heart failure and ischemic/thrombotic cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hamanaka and Mutlu, 2018</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that lung macrophages are required for PM-induced lung inflammation and consequently acute thrombotic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mutlu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chiarella et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Soberanes et al., 2019</xref>). PM induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is required for the PM-induced prothrombotic state and resultant acceleration of vascular thrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mutlu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chiarella et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, we found that PM affects mitochondrial function in lung macrophages characterized by increased oxygen consumption rate and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are both required for PM-induced IL-6 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Soberanes et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Despite significant improvement in our understanding about the mechanisms by which PM induces pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, the mechanisms that regulate PM-induced lung inflammation are not completely understood. To better understand these mechanisms, we performed RNA-sequencing in macrophages following PM exposure. Here, we demonstrate that PM regulates the expression of genes that have not been previously reported. One of the top genes induced by PM was <italic>Irg1</italic> (Immune-responsive Gene 1) or <italic>Acod1</italic> (Aconitate decarboxylase 1), which encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that produces itaconate from the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle metabolite cis-aconitate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Strelko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Michelucci et al., 2013</xref>). Itaconate has been reported to be produced in macrophages following LPS stimulation and to have anti-inflammatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lampropoulou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mills et al., 2018</xref>). We confirmed that PM induces both mRNA and protein expression of Acod1 in macrophages, and increases intracellular and media levels of itaconate. Our metabolic analysis showed that itaconate inhibits mitochondrial complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) and that Acod1 is an important regulator of cellular respiration following PM exposure. Treatment of macrophages with a cell-permeable itaconate derivative, 4-octyl itaconate (OI) attenuated PM- and LPS-induced cytokine production. <italic>Acod1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, which lack endogenous itaconate production, exhibited exaggerated IL-1β production following LPS exposure; however, no effect on PM-induced inflammation was observed. As recently described, OI induced NRF2 protein and expression of its target genes such as <italic>Nqo1</italic> and <italic>Hmox1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mills et al., 2018</xref>); however, we found that NRF2 was not required for the anti-inflammatory effects of OI. Furthermore, using <italic>Acod1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, we found that endogenous itaconate production is not required for NRF2 protein or its target gene expression following treatment with either PM or LPS. These results suggest that recently reported anti-inflammatory and NRF2-inducing effects of exogenous itaconate (OI) may not represent the effects of endogenously-produced itaconate and therefore OI should not be used as a surrogate for Acod1 and endogenous itaconate. Collectively, our results suggest that stimulus and location of itaconate production play major roles in governing the effect of itaconate on inflammation in macrophages. Furthermore, in contrast to recent studies, we suggest that NRF2 is not a major regulator of the anti-inflammatory effects of itaconate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Particulate matter induces aconitate decarboxylase 1 (<italic>Acod1</italic>) and production of itaconate in macrophages</title><p>Previous studies that evaluated the effect of PM on macrophages have evaluated a limited number of regulated genes, primarily focusing on pro-inflammatory cytokines. To gain a non-biased understanding of the mechanisms by which PM induces lung inflammation, we treated BMDMs from C57BL/6 mice with PM or vehicle control for 24 hours and performed RNA-Seq to analyze PM-induced changes in the transcriptome. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis revealed 370 unique genes significantly regulated by PM. Gene ontology analysis of RNA-seq data showed upregulation of pathways relating to inflammatory responses, metabolism, and cytokine stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The most highly upregulated gene induced by PM exposure was <italic>Acod1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

To confirm that PM upregulates mRNA and protein expression of Acod1, we first treated BMDMs with PM for 4, 8 or 24 hours, and then assessed the expression of <italic>Acod1</italic> through qPCR and western blot over time. PM induced <italic>Acod1</italic> gene expression as early as 4 hours after treatment, peaking at 8 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Western blot analysis showed expression of ACOD1 protein was delayed compared to mRNA expression and was detectable beginning 24 hours after PM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To determine whether Acod1 protein induction was associated with increased cellular levels of its metabolic product, we measured intracellular levels of itaconate in BMDMs 24 hours after treatment with PM using capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry (CE-MS) (Human Metabolome Technologies, Boston, MA). We found that PM caused a significant increase in intracellular itaconate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), correlating with the upregulation of ACOD1. Furthermore, we detected increased concentrations of itaconate via mass spectrometry in the medium of macrophages treated with PM, indicating that itaconate is released from cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PM causes a time-dependent expression of ACOD1 and production of itaconate, prompting us to further study whether itaconate plays a role in the regulation of PM-induced inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Itaconate decreases mitochondrial oxygen consumption by inhibiting succinate dehydrogenase/complex II in macrophages</title><p>Since itaconate has been shown to be a weak inhibitor of complex II, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cordes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lampropoulou et al., 2016</xref>), we hypothesized that PM exposure may regulate mitochondrial respiration in macrophages through induction of Acod1 and production of itaconate.</p><p>We first confirmed that itaconate inhibits SDH in BMDMs using the Seahorse XF Plasma Membrane Permeabilizer to assess the effect of itaconate on individual mitochondrial respiratory complexes. To measure the effect of itaconate on complex II/SDH activity, we permeabilized cells in the presence of rotenone (to eliminate the contribution of complex I), ADP, and succinate as substrate. Measurement of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) showed an immediate decrease in OCR following injection of either itaconate or malonate, a known SDH inhibitor used as a positive control. Addition of oligomycin did not cause a further reduction in OCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These data suggest that itaconate, like malonate, is indeed an SDH inhibitor. When cells were permeabilized in media containing only the complex I substrates pyruvate/malate, injection of itaconate caused a smaller decrease in OCR relative to that seen during complex II-dependent respiration. This reduction was again similar to what was observed with malonate (complex II inhibitor). Injection of oligomycin resulted in a significant drop in OCR. These results are consistent with itaconate mediating its inhibitory effects on respiration via complex II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Itaconate decreases oxygen consumption rate via inhibition of complex II, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) We measured oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in permeabilized BMDMs (using XF plasma membrane permeabilizer) in the presence of ETC complex II substrate (succinate, 10 mM) and complex I inhibitor (rotenone, 2 mM), followed by injections of 1) media (control, <italic>n</italic> = 6), itaconate (10 mM, <italic>n</italic> = 6) or malonate (10 mM, <italic>n</italic> = 6), a known complex II inhibitor, 2) oligomycin (2 mM), an ATP synthase inhibitor, and 3) Antimycin A (2 mM), a complex III inhibitor.

Air pollution exposure is one of the top preventable causes of death in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">McGlade and Landrigan, 2019</xref>). It is estimated that exposure to air pollution causes 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide every year according to the World Health Organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hamanaka and Mutlu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">WHO, 2018</xref>). Since limiting exposure to PM cannot be achieved immediately, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which PM causes morbidity and mortality is required in order to combat the effects of air pollution on public health.</p><p>As lungs are the entry site for PM, it is not surprising that lung inflammation plays an important role in PM-induced adverse health effects, which are predominantly cardiopulmonary diseases. We have previously reported that macrophages, and in particular, their production of IL-6, are required for the PM-induced lung inflammation and resultant acute thrombotic cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mutlu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chiarella et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Soberanes et al., 2019</xref>). However, the mechanisms regulating PM-induced inflammation in the lung are not completely understood.</p><p>In this study, using an unbiased approach with RNA-seq, we first discovered <italic>Acod1</italic> as the gene most induced by PM in macrophages. In a time-dependent fashion, PM induced the mRNA and protein expression of ACOD1, which was not evident at earlier time points (4, 8 hours) but was detected at 24 hours. Confirming a functional role, PM-induced expression of ACOD1 led to production of itaconate in our metabolomics measurements.</p><p>Assessment of the effect of PM on mitochondrial function showed that PM has a time-dependent effect on mitochondrial respiration. While PM increased mitochondrial OCR at 1 hour, it reduced OCR at 24 hours. Similarities in the time dependency between the effects of PM on ACOD1/itaconate and mitochondrial respiration led us to explore whether itaconate is responsible for the late reduction of OCR following PM exposure. Using <italic>Acod1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> macrophages, we found that itaconate is required for the PM-induced reduction in mitochondrial OCR at 24 hours. Consistent with a role of itaconate as an inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, we found that <italic>Acod1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> BMDMs lack succinate accumulation following PM treatment. This finding is in agreement with findings by Cordes et al., which showed a loss of succinate accumulation in response to LPS stimulation in <italic>Acod1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cordes et al., 2016</xref>). Collectively, our data support a key role for Acod1 and itaconate in the metabolic reprogramming of macrophages in response to both LPS and PM stimulation.</p><p>Interestingly, although we found that endogenous itaconate production was an important regulator of mitochondrial metabolism and respiration in PM-treated macrophages, we were unable to find an effect of endogenous itaconate on PM-induced inflammation. This was in contrast to the effect of <italic>Acod1</italic> deletion on LPS-induced inflammation, in which IL-6 and IL-1β induction was augmented in the absence of endogenous itaconate production. Our results show a stimulus dependency for the effect of itaconate that has not been previously demonstrated. Thus, although PM and LPS both promote inflammatory cytokine expression and itaconate-dependent metabolic reprogramming, the effects of itaconate on inflammation differ between the two stimuli.</p><p>To enhance our understanding of the role of itaconate in the lungs with PM exposure, we used an in vivo model of PM exposure in WT and <italic>Acod1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Similar to our in vitro data, in vivo exposure of mice to PM shows that while <italic>Acod1</italic> is highly upregulated in the lung macrophages following PM exposure, the presence or lack of <italic>Acod1</italic> did not affect inflammation in the lung. Expression of IL-6 and TNFα were equally increased with PM exposure, regardless of ACOD1 expression status.</p><p>To date, the majority of studies investigating the role of Acod1 and itaconate on metabolism have largely focused on the effects of exogenously-applied cell membrane-permeable forms of itaconate (e.g., dimethyl itaconate and OI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lampropoulou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bambouskova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Following the initial studies with dimethyl itaconate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lampropoulou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bambouskova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>), a more recent study questioned whether treatment with dimethyl itaconate actually increases intracellular levels of itaconate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">ElAzzouny et al., 2017</xref>). In response to this limitation of dimethyl itaconate, Mills and colleagues proposed the use of OI as a cell permeable form of itaconate and demonstrated that OI does increase intracellular levels of itaconate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mills et al., 2018</xref>). Our results showing that OI reduces PM-induced cytokine production are in agreement with Mills and colleagues suggesting that the exogenous cell membrane-permeable version of itaconate has anti-inflammatory effects. However, given the differing effects of endogenous itaconate production versus OI treatment on PM-treated macrophages, our results suggest additional cautions should be taken when extrapolating the effects of cell-permeable itaconate analogs to the effects of endogenously-produced itaconate. This is highlighted by the fact that while OI is sufficient to induce NRF2 activation in macrophages, Acod1 is not required for NRF2 activation in response to PM or LPS. It would be expected that if a major effect of endogenous itaconate production were NRF2 activation, this should have been absent in <italic>Acod1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> BMDMs. This loss of function experiment was notably lacking in the previous report linking itaconate with NRF2. Our results suggest that location of itaconate plays a major role in regulating its downstream effects.</p><p>While our results agree with Mills et al that OI activates the NRF2 antioxidant pathway by upregulation of NRF2 protein and its target genes, we found that NRF2 was dispensable for the anti-inflammatory effects of OI. Mills et al assessed the anti-inflammatory effects of OI by Western blot for intracellular IL-1β. Our findings examining the expression of multiple cytokines at the mRNA level suggest that NRF2 does not play a major role in regulating the anti-inflammatory effect of OI.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that exposure of macrophages to PM induces a mitochondrial enzyme, ACOD1 and production of a mitochondrial metabolite, itaconate, which is required for PM-induced metabolic reprogramming. Although endogenous itaconate reprograms mitochondrial function in PM-treated macrophages, it does not have a major effect on PM-induced gene expression or inflammatory response in vitro or in vivo. Future work will be required to determine whether endogenous itaconate regulates other macrophage functions. Our finding that itaconate is secreted from macrophages suggests that important, unexplored effects of itaconate production may occur in non-macrophage cells. Our results also caution about the interpretation of results achieved using exogenous cell membrane-permeable forms of itaconate as they may not represent the effects of endogenously-produced itaconate. Further, our results suggest that our understanding of the role of NRF2 in the cellular response to itaconate is far from complete. While OI is sufficient to induce NRF2 activation in macrophages, endogenous itaconate production is not required for PM or LPS-mediated NRF2 activation.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The authors found that macrophages exposed to PM upregulated Acod1 and production of itaconate. Such itaconate production contributed to the ability of PM to suppress oxidative metabolism via effects on Complex II, although it did not appear to affect inflammatory gene induction. The authors also found that endogenous and exogenous itaconate have different effects on the macrophage response to PM, which is of interest given the many recent studies that have explored the use of OI and dimethyl-itaconate (DI) as therapeutics. The authors also found that endogenous itaconate (via ACOD1) and exogenous itaconate do not regulate NRF2 to modulate anti-inflammatory effects, in macrophages stimulated with either PM or bacterial LPS.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the objective of this study was to understand the mechanisms behind PM-induced lung inflammation, the authors relied exclusively on PM stimulation of BMDMs in vitro and did not see any effect of ACOD1-mediated itaconate production on inflammatory gene induction. To strengthen physiological relevance, the authors should use models of PM-induced lung inflammation and examine lung and alveolar macrophages for induction of ACOD1 and production of itaconate, and compare WT and Acod1 KO mice for lung inflammation to determine the role of itaconate (or if not possible, co-administration of OI in WT mice).</p><p>2) The authors should provide more details in Materials and methods (e.g., concentration of itaconate used) so that readers can better understand what was done and to allow for experiments to be reproduced by the scientific community.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54877.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the objective of this study was to understand the mechanisms behind PM-induced lung inflammation, the authors relied exclusively on PM stimulation of BMDMs in vitro and did not see any effect of ACOD1-mediated itaconate production on inflammatory gene induction.

Details of this experiment can be found in Figure 10.
