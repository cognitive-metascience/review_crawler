Detailed structures of antiporters with bound substrate ions are essential for understanding how they work. We have resolved the substrate ion in the dimeric, electroneutral sodium/proton antiporter PaNhaP from <italic>Pyrococcus abyssi</italic> at 3.2 Å, and have determined its structure in two different conformations at pH 8 and pH 4. The ion is coordinated by three acidic sidechains, a water molecule, a serine and a main-chain carbonyl in the unwound stretch of trans-membrane helix 5 at the deepest point of a negatively charged cytoplasmic funnel. A second narrow polar channel may facilitate proton uptake from the cytoplasm. Transport activity of PaNhaP is cooperative at pH 6 but not at pH 5. Cooperativity is due to pH-dependent allosteric coupling of protomers through two histidines at the dimer interface. Combined with comprehensive transport studies, the structures of PaNhaP offer unique new insights into the transport mechanism of sodium/proton antiporters.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03579.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03579.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03579.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Although the membrane that surrounds a cell is effective at separating the inside of a cell from the outside environment, certain molecules must enter or leave the cell for it to work correctly. One way this transport can occur is via proteins embedded in the cell membrane, called transporters.</p><p>Transporters that are found in all organisms include the sodium/proton antiporters, which exchange protons from inside the cell with sodium ions from outside. However, exactly how the antiporter works was unknown.</p><p>Previous work suggested that the structure and activity of the sodium/proton antiporter changes as the acidity of its environment changes, but the precise details of how this occurs were unclear. Wöhlert et al. have now crystallised a sodium/proton antiporter from a single-celled organism called <italic>Pyrococcus abyssi</italic>, a species of archaea that has been found living in hydrothermal vents deep in the Pacific Ocean. The structures the protein takes on in different functional states were then deduced from these crystals using a technique called X-ray crystallography. Using heavy thallium ions instead of sodium ions, which are less visible to X-rays, Wöhlert et al. found the site in the antiporter where the transported ion binds as it moves through the membrane.</p><p>The antiporter has a funnel-shaped cavity that faces inwards (into the cell) in both acidic and alkaline conditions, although a second narrow channel that is open in alkaline conditions is blocked in acidic conditions by small protein rearrangements. Wöhlert et al. suggest that the differences between both structures explain how the antiporter tunes its ability to bind to the ions it transports.</p><p>Wöhlert et al. further measured the activity of the antiporter and observed that the transport of ions was most rapid under slightly acidic conditions. In more acidic conditions, the sodium ion cannot bind to the antiporter, and in an alkaline environment, the sodium ions bind too strongly to the antiporter; in both cases, the ions cannot be transported.</p><p>Comparing the findings presented here with separate work that uncovers the structure of the sodium/proton antiporter in a different species of archaea revealed very similar structures. Related transporters are also found in mammals, and defects in these transporters can lead to problems with the heart and kidneys. A better understanding of the sodium/proton antiporter structure could therefore help to develop new treatments for these conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03579.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03579.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Pyrococcus abyssi</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>sodium/proton antiport</kwd><kwd>x-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>transport mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (Max Planck Society)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wöhlert</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name><name><surname>Yildiz</surname><given-names>Özkan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cluster of Excellence, Macromolecular Complexes</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (Max Planck Society)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Max Planck Research School, Frankfurt</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wöhlert</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Transport and communication across biological membranes SFP807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wöhlert</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The X-ray structure of the PaNhaP provides a unique view of substrate-ion binding and release in electroneutral sodium/proton antiporters.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter NhaP from <italic>Pyrococcus abyssi</italic> (PaNhaP) exchanges protons against sodium ions across the cell membrane. PaNhaP is a functional homologue of the human Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger NHE1, which controls intracellular pH and Na<sup>+</sup> concentration. NHE1 is an important drug target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karmazyn et al., 1999</xref>), but its structure and detailed mode of action are unknown. Transport mechanisms of eukaryotic membrane proteins are conserved in the more robust prokaryotic transporters from thermophilic bacteria and archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). High-resolution structures of such homologues are of great value for understanding the mechanisms of cation/proton antiport, provided that (i) the transported substrate ions are resolved, (ii) structures of the same transporter are available in different conformations, and (iii) kinetic data of substrate binding and transport are available. In this paper we report the structure of the electroneutral Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter PaNhaP from the hyperthermophilic archaeon <italic>P. abyssi</italic> in two different conformations at pH 4 and pH 8, with the substrate ion resolved at pH 8. We show that, like NHE1, transport by PaNhaP is cooperative in a pH-dependent manner, indicating a pH-dependent allosteric interaction of protomers in the dimer.</p><p>The first structure of a cation-proton antiporter (CPA) revealed that <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> NhaA (EcNhaA) is a dimer in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Williams et al., 1999</xref>). The 6 Å map of EcNhaA resolved 12 trans-membrane helices (TMH) in the protomer, arranged in a 6-helix bundle, plus a row of six TMHs at the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Williams, 2000</xref>). A membrane dimer was also found for the NhaP1 antiporter from <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic> (MjNhaP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vinothkumar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goswami et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Paulino and Kühlbrandt, 2014</xref>). MjNhaP1, PaNhaP and the medically important NHE1 belong to the CPA1 subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brett et al., 2005</xref>) of antiporters, which exchange Na<sup>+</sup> and protons with 1:1 stoichiometry and are thus electroneutral. By contrast, EcNhaA and TtNapA from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic>, as well as the eukaryotic NHA1-2 and AtChx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brett et al., 2005</xref>), belong to the CPA2 subfamily of electrogenic antiporters, which exchange one Na<sup>+</sup> against two protons.

The structure was solved by SAD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1 tbl2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>). Twelve out of the 14 SeMet positions in the asymmetric unit containing one PaNhaP dimer were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Seen from the cytoplasm, the PaNhaP dimer is roughly rectangular, with a long axis of 90 Å and a short axis of 53 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Each protomer has 13 TMHs (H1-H13) connected by short loops or helices on the membrane surface. H4-6 and H11-13 form the 6-helix bundle, while H1-3 and H7-10 form the dimer interface. H1-6 and H8-13 are two halves of an inverted 6-helix repeat, connected by H7. Several helices are highly tilted, especially H7 and H8, which include angles of more than 45° with the membrane normal while others, in particular H6 and H10, are bent. H5 and H12 in the 6-helix bundle are discontinuous. Their cytoplasmic and extracellular halves (referred to as H5<sub>C</sub>, H5<sub>E</sub> and H12<sub>C</sub>, H12<sub>E</sub> respectively) are each connected by unwound stretches with antiparallel orientation, which cross one another in the centre of the protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The membrane surfaces are marked by three short amphipathic helices connecting H3 to H4 on the cytoplasmic side, H6 to H7 and H10 to H11 on the extracellular side. H10 protrudes by 11 Å on the cytoplasmic surface, and the helix hairpin connecting H12 to H13 protrudes by about 7 Å on the extracellular side. The loops connecting helices H1 to H2 and H8 to H9 are ∼10 Å below the cytoplasmic or extracellular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure

Although the ion radius of monovalent Tl<sup>+</sup> (1.5 Å) is similar to that of K<sup>+</sup> (1.44 Å) and larger than that of Na<sup>+</sup> (1.12 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shannon, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cotton and Wilkinson, 1988</xref>), Tl<sup>+</sup> is able to replace Na<sup>+</sup> in PaNhaP. The same has been found for the Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent aspartate transporter Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>), the mammalian glutamate transporter EAAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tao et al., 2008</xref>) and fructose-1,6-biphosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Villeret et al., 1995</xref>). In Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, Na<sup>+</sup> but not K<sup>+</sup> competes for Tl<sup>+</sup> binding, and Tl<sup>+</sup> inhibits Na<sup>+</sup>-driven aspartate transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>). Coordination geometry and ligand distances for Tl<sup>+</sup> in PaNhaP are similar to those typically found for protein-bound Na<sup>+</sup> in the PDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harding, 2002</xref>). The larger ion radius of Tl<sup>+</sup> may account for the lower transport rate in PaNhaP. However, Tl<sup>+</sup> is a much better substrate than K<sup>+</sup>, which is not transported at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The selectivity for Na<sup>+</sup> over K<sup>+</sup> is reminiscent of the striking selectivity of sodium channels, which is thought to be related to ion solvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roux et al., 2011</xref>). Presumably, the same principle applies to the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters. The water molecule between the sidechain of Asp130 and Tl<sup>+</sup> indicates that the bound substrate ion retains part of its hydration shell, as complete dehydration is energetically unfavourable.</p><p>In PaNhaP, all ion-binding residues are found in the first half of the inverted repeat. Interestingly, the structure and interaction of the ion-coordinating Asp159 and Ser155 in H6 resemble those of the inversely oriented Glu408 and Ser404 in H13 in the second half of the inverted repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,D</xref>). This may imply that an early form of the CPA1 antiporters, which must have arisen by gene duplication of an unknown precursor, had a second, symmetrical ion-binding site that has been lost in the course of evolution. Arg362 in the unwound stretch of H12, which is essential in MjNhaP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hellmer et al., 2003</xref>) and completely conserved in the CPA1 antiporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hellmer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goswami et al., 2011</xref>), may be a tethered positive charge that takes the place of the Na<sup>+</sup> ion in the second half of the inverted repeat, in a way similar to the arginine that replaces the co-transported Na<sup>+</sup> in the sodium-independent substrate/product antiporter CaiT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalayil et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Regulation of transport activity</title><p>The transport activity of PaNhaP is highest at pH 5 and declines at higher or lower pH. The resulting bell-shaped pH profile is explained in terms of the Na<sup>+</sup> affinity of the acidic residues in the substrate-binding pocket. The protonation state of these is likely to affect the affinity of the binding site for Na<sup>+</sup>. At low pH, most if not all of the ion-coordinating carboxyl sidechains (Glu73, Asp130, and Asp159) would be protonated, resulting in reduced affinity for Na<sup>+</sup>, as has been shown for MjNhaP1 by electrophysiological measurements on solid-supported membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calinescu et al., 2014</xref>). At pH 5–7 these carboxyl sidechains would be increasingly deprotonated and able to bind and release Na<sup>+</sup> ions, as is necessary for transport. At pH &gt; 7, the ion-binding site is predominantly deprotonated and negatively charged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), resulting in an increased Na<sup>+</sup> affinity. As a result, the transport rate would decrease, as the ions are bound more tightly. This is consistent with the increased transport rate of the E73A mutant, which has one less carboxyl in the binding site, hence releases Na<sup>+</sup> more easily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In addition, the propagation of the pH-induced conformational changes at the dimer interface via Glu73 or Tyr31 would modulate the binding site by changing the coordination geometry for the ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Future structure-based molecular dynamics simulations should show how the protonation state of each of these residues influence the affinity of the binding site for Na<sup>+</sup> in a pH-dependent manner.</p><p>The pH-dependent transport activity of PaNhaP suggests a self-regulatory mechanism for the binding site rather than regulation by a separate pH sensor as proposed for EcNhaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Herz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diab et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schushan et al., 2012</xref>). At the pH 5 activity maximum of PaNhaP, transport is not limited by Na<sup>+</sup> affinity. Under these conditions, substrate binding of the PaNhaP dimer is non-cooperative, but unexpectedly it becomes cooperative at pH 6. Cooperative ion binding is most likely mediated by Glu73 and may be important for controlling the intracellular pH at neutral or basic pH, where a cooperative increase in Na<sup>+</sup> affinity would gradually inhibit substrate release and slow down transport. This may be a safety mechanism to protect the organism against excessive influx of Na<sup>+</sup>, and hence efflux of protons, at rising pH, which may be critical for survival.</p><p>The medically relevant but elusive human Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger NHE1 is a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fafournoux et al., 1994</xref>) like PaNhaP. Several other common features, including high sequence homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goswami et al., 2011</xref>) especially of the unwound stretches in H5 and H12, key residues in the ion binding site such as Ser155, Asp130 and the ND motif, the functionally important Arg337 and Arg362 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hellmer et al., 2003</xref>), as well as pH profiles and transport kinetics suggest that the archaeal and mammalian CPA1 antiporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuster et al., 2008</xref>) work essentially in the same way. Remarkably, NHE1 also shows pH-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> cooperativity, with a Hill coefficient of 1.8 at pH 6.8 that drops to ∼1 at pH 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuster et al., 2008</xref>). The PaNhaP structure thus serves as an excellent model for the membrane part of NHE1. Molecular details of allosteric regulation in NHE1 are likely to be different, as the His292 that reorients in response to pH in PaNhaP is not conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goswami et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The electrogenic CPA2 antiporters, such as EcNhaA or TtNapA, which exchange two protons against one Na<sup>+</sup>, have two conserved aspartates in place of the ND motif in H6. In terms of its overall structure, TtNapA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2013</xref>) is more similar to PaNhaP than to EcNhaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunte et al., 2005</xref>), especially with respect to the dimer interface. The tertiary structure of the CPA antiporters is thus not a diagnostic of electroneutral or electrogenic transport.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanisms of ion binding and release</title><p>In <italic>Pyrococcus</italic>, the Na<sup>+</sup> gradient required for ATP synthesis is maintained by specific antiporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McTernan et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore assume that PaNhaP, like human NHE1, utilizes the Na<sup>+</sup> gradient across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>) for pH homeostasis. Protons, probably in the form of hydronium ions (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>), can reach the binding pocket either through the cytoplasmic funnel or through the narrow polar channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Only small rearrangements of the residues lining this channel would be required for H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> to pass. Using the second narrow polar channel for proton translocation would physically separate the routes for Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> on the cytoplasmic side, which may be an advantage as the two ion currents flow in opposite directions. It would also explain why residues that line this channel, in particular the Glu154/Arg337 ion bridge and Asn158, which do not participate in ion coordination, are so highly conserved in the family. Molecular dynamics simulations and functional analysis of suitable mutants will be required to differentiate between the two proton paths, which both appear equally likely on the basis of the x-ray structures.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03579.024</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Substrate ion exchange on the cytoplasmic side.</title><p>The substrate-binding site of PaNhaP is located between the unwound stretches in the six-helix-bundle and the interface domain.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior editor), Richard Aldrich (Reviewing editor), and 2 reviewers, one of whom, Rajini Rao, has agreed to reveal her identity. A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper from the Kuhlbrandt group reports a trio of new structures of PaNhaP, an archael homolog of the NhaA family of Na/H exchangers, including the first structure of a Na/H exchanger that includes a cation, in this case a Thallium ion. Together, these structures represent a significant step forward in our understanding of this exchanger family, especially by visualizing a candidate cation binding site (and it's nice that Tl actually can drive transport, suggesting that this is indeed <italic>the</italic> cation binding site). Mutations of residues involved in cation binding have dramatic effects on transport activity consistent with the proposed role of the identified site. The crystal structures are very nice and the activity assays seem to have been carefully performed. The work is clearly presented and well written. The following comments should be addressed to improve the paper:</p><p>1) This manuscript should be combined with the accompanying one as a single revised submission.</p><p>2) Role of changes in the dimer interface. The authors report that the low pH form of the crystal primarily shows changes at the dimer interface but the actual structural rearrangements seem quite small. More of a concern though is how to interpret these changes in the context of mechanism. The state of the transporter in the low pH crystal is not at all clear-is it still inward facing? Lacking information about the state, we find it hard to conclude that the changes at the dimer interface ‘relay allosteric changes from the other protomer’. Indeed, the authors' interpretation of the structure implies that the low pH form of the protein should have substantially different Na affinity than the pH 8 form (if indeed they reflect the same overall state), but this prediction is not tested with the experiments shown here. Indeed, the Km for Na of 505 uM at pH 5 seems to shift to ∼200 mM at pH 6 but the structures are at pH 4 and 8, where activity is substantially different. The structures suggest that actual binding affinities could indeed be measured at pH 4 and 8, which would be essential to support the authors' interpretation. In addition, we find the superposition of structures presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref> to capture the overall comparison of structures much better than the one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> itself and would include at least one of these in the primary figure.</p><p>3) The acridine orange assay used in both papers to measure proton flux is an excellent assay for qualitative assessment of proton flux. However, the actual mechanism of acridine orange is unknown in detail and it is impossible to quantitatively measure pH change with this assay. Therefore the relative rates as a function of pH in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figure 5 and 6</xref> are unreliable and should be omitted. Na22 flux could be used to measure these rates if desired, or a more quantitative pH probe, like pyranene.</p><p>4) The discussion of ‘Self-regulation of transport activity’ is completely disconnected from the evidence presented in the paper. If the authors wish to discuss this, they need to provide some experimental or computational support for their claims. They discuss ‘pH-dependent affinity’ but show no evidence that the affinity is indeed pH dependent beyond Kms at pH 5 and 6. Whether these values actually represent affinity depends on a range of assumptions which may or may not be valid for this protein.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03579.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>1) This manuscript should be combined with the accompanying one as a single revised submission.</p><p>For a number of reasons we prefer to keep the manuscripts separate. One reason is authorship. The x-ray and electron crystallographic structure determination were two separate projects done by two PhD students. Merging the manuscripts would mean an injustice to one of them, and shared first authorship would not reflect the different contributions correctly. The other, more important reason is content. A merged manuscript would become unwieldy, unless important information is omitted, which we do not want to do. We therefore decided to revise the PaNhaP manuscript and to pursue publication of the MjNhaP1 manuscript separately.</p><p>2) Role of changes in the dimer interface. The authors report that the low pH form of the crystal primarily shows changes at the dimer interface but the actual structural rearrangements seem quite small.</p><p>The structural rearrangements at the PaNhaP interface cannot be described as small. <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> plus supplements clearly show that sidechains in helix H10 move by up to 8A as the pH changes from 8 to 4. Moreover the changes are not confined to the interface but propagate through the whole protomer, including the loops connecting the trans-membrane helices.</p><p>More of a concern though is how to interpret these changes in the context of mechanism. The state of the transporter in the low pH crystal is not at all clear-is it still inward facing?</p><p>PaNhaP is in an inward-open conformation both at pH8 and at pH4. This is now stated explicitly in the revised manuscript. The substrate-binding site is accessible from the cytoplasm through the cytoplasmic funnel but not from the extracellular side under both conditions. However, the narrow side channel that leads from the cytoplasmic surface to the ion-binding site is blocked at pH4 by side chain rearrangements, as stated in the revised manuscript.</p><p>It is important to note that the pH-dependent allosteric change of the dimer is different from the inside-open to outside-open transition in the transport cycle of the protomer. This is now stated explicitly in the revised manuscript. Rather, the allosteric change increases the affinity of the binding site for the substrate ion from Km = 500 µM to K0.5 = 25 µM. This extends the range for high-affinity substrate binding by ∼1 pH unit from acidic towards neutral conditions, as may be necessary for efficient Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange at physiological pH in this particular organism. The pH-dependent binding affinity will be the subject of a future molecular dynamics study that goes well beyond the scope of the present manuscript.</p><p>Lacking information about the state, we find it hard to conclude that the changes at the dimer interface ‘relay allosteric changes from the other protomer’.</p><p>It is evident from <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">supplementary Video 1</xref> in the original manuscript) that the pH-dependent repulsion of protonated histidines 292 causes conformational changes, and that this mechanism can only work with two protomers next to one another in the dimer. Therefore the changes do indeed relay allosteric changes between protomers. However, we agree that it may be better to say that ‘conformational changes caused by repulsion of the protonated histidines at the dimer interface are relayed to the ion binding site to modulate the Na<sup>+</sup> binding affinity in a pH-dependent manner’. This is now stated in the revised manuscript.</p><p>To show the pH-induced differences more clearly, we have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">supplementary figures 1 and 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> as stereo images in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Indeed, the authors' interpretation of the structure implies that the low pH form of the protein should have substantially different Na affinity than the pH 8 form (if indeed they reflect the same overall state), but this prediction is not tested with the experiments shown here.</p><p>Both structures do indeed show the same overall state (inward-open), as explained above. Because the antiporter is only minimally active at pH4 and pH8 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we are unable to measure the binding affinity under these conditions with the methods available to us. However, the Na binding affinities at pH5 and pH6 are substantially different, as indicated by the K<sub>0.5</sub> for the cooperative antiporter at pH6 that we have now added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. Compared to the K<sub>m</sub> at pH5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, this indicates a roughly 20-fold increase in Na binding affinity.</p><p>In the revised manuscript we have emphasized the probable role of protonation states of acidic residues in the binding site in pH-dependent activity changes. For example, Asp130, which is involved directly in substrate-ion coordination, changes its conformation in response to pH, and this directly affects the coordination geometry. This should now be clearer in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>, which shows the superposition of the ion-coordinating residues in both protomers in stereo.</p><p>Indeed, the Km for Na of 505 uM at pH 5 seems to shift to ∼200 mM at pH 6 but the structures are at pH 4 and 8, where activity is substantially different.</p><p>We have no idea how the referees arrive at the conclusion that the K<sub>m</sub> at pH6 should be 200 mM. There was no K<sub>m</sub> value or even a K<sub>0.5</sub> value for this pH in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> or anywhere else in the original manuscript. We have added the K<sub>0.5</sub> value, which is 25 µM, to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> of the revised manuscript.</p><p>The structures suggest that actual binding affinities could indeed be measured at pH 4 and 8, which would be essential to support the authors' interpretation.</p><p>As explained above, PaNhaP is essentially inactive at pH 4 and 8, so these measurements are not feasible by the methods available to us.</p><p>In addition, we find the superposition of structures presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref> to capture the overall comparison of structures much better than the one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> itself and would include at least one of these in the primary figure.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we replaced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref> in the original manuscript. <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> of the original manuscript is now <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>, which shows the pH-induced conformational changes very clearly. Stereo pairs of original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are now provided as supplements to this Figure, making the conformational changes even clearer.</p><p>3) The acridine orange assay used in both papers to measure proton flux is an excellent assay for qualitative assessment of proton flux. However, the actual mechanism of acridine orange is unknown in detail and it is impossible to quantitatively measure pH change with this assay. Therefore the relative rates as a function of pH in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figure 5 and 6</xref> are unreliable and should be omitted.</p><p>We do not understand this comment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> of the original manuscript shows pH-induced conformational changes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows the temperature dependence of transport.</p><p>Figure 4–figure supplement 1 (both in the original and the revised manuscript) does show acridine orange measurements as a function of pH but these measurements are only qualitative to confirm transport activity under symmetrical pH conditions. All quantitative measurements of pH-dependent activity were performed with radioactive <sup>22</sup>Na assays.</p><p>Na22 flux could be used to measure these rates if desired, or a more quantitative pH probe, like pyranene.</p><p>This is exactly what we have done, as explained in many different places in the original manuscript.</p><p>4) The discussion of “Self-regulation of transport activity” is completely disconnected from the evidence presented in the paper. If the authors wish to discuss this, they need to provide some experimental or computational support for their claims. They discuss ‘pH-dependent affinity’ but show no evidence that the affinity is indeed pH dependent beyond Kms at pH 5 and 6. Whether these values actually represent affinity depends on a range of assumptions which may or may not be valid for this protein.</p><p>Experimental evidence includes the observation that mutation of His292 to cysteine (Figure 7–figure supplement 1) did not alter the pH dependence, as stated in the revised manuscript. Additional experimental support is provided by SSM measurements with MjNhaP1 as cited in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
