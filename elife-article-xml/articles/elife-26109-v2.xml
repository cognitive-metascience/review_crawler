mammalian integrated stress response (ISR) and has emerged as a promising target for modifying the course of protein misfolding diseases. The [(<italic>o</italic>-chlorobenzylidene)amino]guanidines (Guanabenz and Sephin1) have been proposed to exert protective effects against misfolding by interfering with eIF2α-P dephosphorylation through selective disruption of a PP1-PPP1R15A holophosphatase complex. Surprisingly, they proved inert in vitro affecting neither stability of the PP1-PPP1R15A complex nor substrate-specific dephosphorylation. Furthermore, eIF2α-P dephosphorylation, assessed by a kinase shut-off experiment, progressed normally in Sephin1-treated cells. Consistent with its role in defending proteostasis, Sephin1 attenuated the IRE1 branch of the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response. However, repression was noted in both wildtype and <italic>Ppp1r15a</italic> deleted cells and in cells rendered ISR-deficient by CRISPR editing of the <italic>Eif2s1</italic> locus to encode a non-phosphorylatable eIF2α (eIF2α<italic><sup>S51A</sup></italic>). These findings challenge the view that [(<italic>o</italic>-chlorobenzylidene)amino]guanidines restore proteostasis by interfering with eIF2α-P dephosphorylation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26109.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26109.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26109.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most drugs work by tweaking the way that cells are regulated. Adding or removing a phosphate group from proteins regulates many cellular decisions. There are known drugs that bind to and inhibit the enzymes that add phosphate to proteins, thereby controlling various aspects of cell behaviour. However, drug developers have been far less successful in finding drugs that inhibit phosphatases, the enzymes that remove phosphate from proteins.</p><p>Genetically modified mice can be used as ‘models’ to investigate human diseases. In 2015 a drug called Sephin1 was reported to suppress neurodegeneration in a group of these mice by inhibiting a particular phosphatase. The phosphatase is made of three component proteins that come together to create the active enzyme. Sephin1 was reported to disrupt the association between two of these three components. This discovery was met with excitement; both for its potential therapeutic implications in humans and as an important “first” in pharmacology.</p><p>To understand how Sephin1 and a related drug, Guanabenz, work at the molecular level, Crespillo-Casado et al. reconstructed in a test tube the phosphatase that Sephin1 and Guanabenz were reported to inhibit. To examine the effects the drugs have on the phosphatase, Crespillo-Casado et al. developed assays to measure the association between the components that make up the phosphatase. Further assays measured the removal of phosphate from the phosphatase’s target, a protein called eIF2α.</p><p>The results of the assays show that Sephin1 did not affect the coming together of the components that make up the active phosphatase. The drug also did not inhibit the removal of phosphate from eIF2α in the test tube. To extend these findings Crespillo-Casado et al. exposed cells to Sephin1 and observed features that are consistent with the drug’s reported ability to supress neurodegeneration. However, these features were also observed both in cells lacking the phosphatase that Sephin1 was reported to inhibit and in cells in which eIF2α never acquired a phosphate in the first place.</p><p>The findings presented by Crespillo-Casado et al. do not challenge Sephin1’s role in supressing neurodegeneration, but do question its ability to do so by inhibiting the phosphatase that dephosphorylates eIF2α. This knowledge will be useful to drug developers and those interested in molecular mechanisms of drug action. For those researchers who are interested in Sephin1, further work is needed to discover alternative molecular mechanisms by which it suppresses neurodegeneration. And for those researchers who are interested in eIF2α dephosphorylation, there is a need to look further for inhibitors of this process, as Sephin1 is unlikely to serve in that role.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26109.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26109.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Cricetulus griseus</italic></kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>chemical biology</kwd><kwd>drug action</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>200848/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The notion that the drug-like small molecule Sephin1 protects against protein misfolding by selectively disrupting a cellular phosphatase is refuted.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein folding homeostasis (proteostasis) is achieved by balancing the rate of production, folding and protein degradation. Proteostasis is strongly influenced by the phosphorylation state of serine 51 of the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>). Diverse stress conditions activate kinases that phosphorylate eIF2α, resulting in attenuated rates of translation initiation of most mRNAs and increasing translation of a small group of mRNAs with special 5′ untranslated regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>). The latter encode potent transcription factors such as ATF4 that couple eIF2α phosphorylation to the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harding et al., 2003</xref>), a transcriptional and translational program that adapts cells to stress and participates in diverse biological processes such as memory, immunity and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baird and Wek, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Signalling in the ISR is terminated by eIF2α-P dephosphorylation. This requires the presence of a regulatory subunit, PPP1R15, to direct the catalytic, PP1 subunit, to its specific substrate. Two mammalian genes encode PPP1R15 regulatory subunits. <italic>Ppp1r15b</italic> (or CReP) encodes a constitutively expressed regulatory subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jousse et al., 2003</xref>), whereas <italic>Ppp1r15a</italic> (or GADD34) encodes an ISR inducible regulatory subunit that contributes to a negative feed-back loop operative in the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brush et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma and Hendershot, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2003</xref>). A minimal rate of eIF2α-P dephosphorylation is an essential cellular function, as reflected in the severe phenotypes of <italic>Ppp1r15b</italic> mutation or deletion and in the very early lethality of compound <italic>Ppp1r15a;b</italic> deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdulkarim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harding et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, whilst deletion of the inducible <italic>Ppp1r15a</italic> gene results in sluggish recovery of protein synthesis during the waning phase of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kojima et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Novoa et al., 2003</xref>), mice lacking any PPP1R15A-directed eIF2α-P dephosphorylation (homozygous <italic>Ppp1r15a<sup>tm1Dron</sup></italic>) are superficially indistinguishable from wildtype. Moreover, when challenged with tunicamycin, which causes unfolded protein stress in the endoplasmic reticulum by inhibiting N-linked glycosylation, homozygous <italic>Ppp1r15a<sup>tm1Dron</sup></italic> mice and cultured cells derived from them are relatively resistant to the toxin’s lethal effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marciniak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reid et al., 2016</xref>). This feature is plausibly attributed to sustained activity of the ISR in the <italic>Ppp1r15a</italic> mutant mice, which favours proteostasis by limiting the production of unfolded proteins under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyce et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The proteostasis-promoting features of interfering with PPP1R15A-mediated eIF2α-P dephosphorylation are also played out in the context of certain disease models associated with protein misfolding and proteotoxicity. Both the neuropathic phenotype associated with Schwann cell expression of a mutant misfolding-prone myelin constituent, P0<sup>S63∆</sup>, and a mutant superoxide dismutase expressed in motor neurones are ameliorated by a concomitant dephosphorylation-defective <italic>Ppp1r15a<sup>tm1Dron</sup></italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D'Antonio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), and similar amelioration of inflammatory-mediated central nervous system demyelination is observed in the <italic>Ppp1r15a<sup>tm1Dron</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>These features have led to an interest in the therapeutic potential of targeting PPP1R15-mediated eIF2α-P dephosphorylation with small molecule inhibitors. Early work led to discovery of salubrinal, a small molecule that increases levels of eIF2α-P and retards its dephosphorylation. However, salubrinal is only known to work in vivo and its mechanism of action remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyce et al., 2005</xref>). Limitations of in vitro assays for substrate-specific PPP1R15-mediated eIF2α-P dephosphorylation (see below) have all but precluded a biochemical approach to the problem, but a cell based search for proteostasis regulators suggested that the α2 adrenergic blocker Guanabenz, [(<italic>o,o</italic>-dichlorobenzylidene)amino]guanidine, might exert its beneficial effects on proteotoxicity by interfering with eIF2α-P dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsaytler et al., 2011</xref>). This theme was extended further by the discovery of Sephin1, [(<italic>o</italic>-chlorobenzylidene)amino]guanidine, that had lost its α2 adrenergic blocking activity but retained its proteostasis promoting properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, biochemical characterization of Guanabenz and Sephin1 suggested that both disrupt the complex between PPP1R15A and PP1, providing strong support for a mechanism of action that involves interfering with PPP1R15A-mediated eIF2α-P dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2015</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> therein).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26109.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A tripartite assay for human PPP1R15A-dependent eIF2α-P dephosphorylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon representation of human PPP1R15A (GADD34).

Though PPP1R15 regulatory subunits stably bind the catalytic subunit (PP1), the resulting binary complex is devoid of specificity towards eIF2α-P. However, G-actin joins the PPP1R15-PP1 binary complex as an ancillary subunit to form a ternary complex endowed with substrate-specific eIF2α-P directed phosphatase activity, both in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chambers et al., 2015</xref>) and when constituted with pure components in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To explore in detail the mechanism of action of the [(<italic>o</italic>-chlorobenzylidene)amino]guanidines we reconstructed PPP1R15A-PP1-G-actin-mediated eIF2α-P dephosphorylation in vitro with pure components.

The results of our inquiry, reported on below, question the role of destabilization of the eIF2α-P directed holophosphatase in the proteostatic effects of these compounds.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vitro assay for selective eIF2α-P dephosphorylation sensitive to the stability of the PPP1R15A-PP1 complex</title><p>PPP1R15A/GADD34 is a protein of &gt;600 residues, but only the C-terminal 70 residues are necessary for substrate-specific dephosphorylation of eIF2α-P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This active fragment is also the most conserved segment of the protein; both between homologues of PPP1R15A and with the paralogous PPP1R15B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This region of the protein is natively unfolded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yu et al., 2004</xref>), attaining its structure upon binding the PP1 catalytic and the G-actin ancillary subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>For structural studies we found it convenient to co-express PPP1R15 and PP1 in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). However, the fixed 1:1 stoichiometry of the two subunits imparted by co-expression is unsuited to a detailed examination of the bimolecular affinities involved in complex formation or to the design of an assay sensitive to the stability of PPP1R15A-PP1 complex. To circumvent this limitation, we incorporated a highly soluble maltose-binding protein (MBP) moiety C-terminal to the natively-unstructured human PP1R15A active fragment. When expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> as a fusion protein with a cleavable N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag, GST-PPP1R15A-MBP remained soluble and when added as a purified protein in vitro (after cleavage of the GST), imparted eIF2α-P dephosphorylation activity to reactions containing purified PP1 and G-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left panel). Moreover, the solubilizing MBP tag enabled recovery not only of a human PPP1R15A active fragment (residues 533–624) but also a much larger N-terminally extended fragment (residues 325–636). The minimal active fragment and the much longer N-terminally-extended PPP1R15A had similar activity in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Nonetheless the ability to purify a soluble, N-terminally extended PPP1R15A regulatory subunit expanded the possibilities to study more physiological models of PPP1R15A-mediated eIF2α-P dephosphorylation (a point we shall return to below).</p><p>We quantified the dependence of eIF2α-P dephosphorylation rates on both the concentration of the regulatory human PPP1R15A subunit (EC<sub>50</sub> = 7 nM) and on the ancillary G-actin subunit (EC<sub>50</sub> = 13 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The latter values agreed with our previous measurements of G-actin’s stimulation of enzymatic activity (in an assay using the murine PPP1R15A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), whereas the EC<sub>50</sub> of human PPP1R15A was within an order of magnitude of the affinity of human PPP1R15A for PP1, as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choy et al., 2015</xref>) (see below).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26109.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>eIF2α-P dephosphorylation kinetics as a function of human PPP1R15A<sup>533-624</sup> and G-actin concentration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schema of the human PPP1R15A<sup>533-624</sup> construct used.

To circumvent this problem we biotinylated PP1 and exploited it as a BLI ligand. Addition of either the minimal active fragment, human PPP1R15A<sup>533-624</sup>, or the longer human PPP1R15A<sup>325-636</sup>, gave rise to a robust BLI signal but addition of Sephin1 affected neither the association nor dissociation phase of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). The kinetics of the bimolecular PP1-PPP1R15A interaction were reproducibly different when one or the other was used as a ligand (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). These may reflect different distorting effect of other elements of the BLI biosensor on the kinetics of dissociation when PP1 or PPP1R15A were used as ligands, and/or a contribution of the N-terminal repeats of PPP1R15A to its interactions with PP1, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brush and Shenolikar, 2008</xref>). However, reproducible inertness in all three assays lends confidence to the conclusion that in this experimental system 50 µM Sephin1 does not directly interfere with assembly or stability of the PPP1R15A-PP1 complex.</p><p>Next we sought to examine the effect of Sephin1 on the in vitro dephosphorylation activity of a tripartite eIF2α-P holophosphatase assembled with the N-terminally extended PPP1R15A<sup>325-636</sup> (corresponding to the construct studied by Das and colleagues). As Sephin1 is proposed to inhibit eIF2α-P dephosphorylation by disrupting the binding of PPP1R15A to PP1, we sought to incorporate the PPP1R15A<sup>325-636</sup> component at or below its EC<sub>50</sub>, thereby maximizing the prospects of detecting an inhibitory effect. Addition of purified PPP1R15A<sup>325-636</sup> to PP1 and G-actin accelerated eIF2α-P dephosphorylation with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 5–10 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). However, Sephin1 had no effect on the dephosphorylation reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), whilst tautomycin readily inhibited the reaction (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.4 nM) confirming the sensitivity of the assay to a known inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). These observations were also confirmed in an assay set up with the corresponding murine PPP1R15A<sup>273-657</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). The related compound Guanabenz also proved inert, even when added to the enzymatic assay at the high concentration of 50 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Salubrinal, added at 12 µM (higher concentrations led to conspicuous precipitation) had a mild but highly reproducible inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, inhibition = 22% ± 2.045, unpaired t test, p&lt;0.0001, n = 6). The weakness of salubrinal’s inhibitory effect and the compound’s tendency to precipitate at higher concentrations in the assay buffer frustrated our efforts to establish if inhibition was specific to the eIF2α-P directed ternary complex.

By retarding its dephosphorylation, the primary consequence of eliminating PPP1R15A is to prolong the duration of the eIF2α-P signal in stress response scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kojima et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Novoa et al., 2003</xref>) and to alter the repertoire of mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reid et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the finding that cells and mice lacking PPP1R15A are relatively resistant to pharmacological and genetic models associated with unfolded protein stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER stress) has engendered a specific interest in targeting the PPP1R15A-containing phosphatase complex for inhibition, as a means for accessing the therapeutic potential of enhanced ISR signalling.</p><p>Sephin1 and Guanabenz, compounds previously proposed to exert their proteostatic effects by disrupting the essential PP1-PPP1R15A complex and inhibiting eIF2α-P dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2015</xref>) are found here to have no effect in in vitro enzymatic assays dependent on the formation of a PP1-PPP1R15A complex. Sephin1 likewise proved inert in a Bio-Layer Interferometry assay that measured directly the affinity of PPP1R15A and PP1 for one another. Furthermore, we find that Sephin1 does not interfere with eIF2α-P dephosphorylation in cells (as measured by a kinase shut-off experiment) and that Sephin1 retains its ability to attenuate the impact of a challenge to proteostasis even in cells lacking PPP1R15A, or in ISR-defective <italic>Eifs1</italic><sup>S51A</sup> cells. These observations suggest that the previously-reported attenuation of the recovery of PP1 in complex with PPP1R15A, when both were purified from lysates of cells treated with Sephin1 was unlikely to be a direct consequence of Sephin1 interference with complex formation or of destabilization by Sephin1 of a pre-existing complex and also call into question the importance of any indirect disruption of the PP1-PPP1R15A complex that may occur in vivo and remain undetected by our assays.</p><p>Our findings, questioning whether Sephin1 attains its proteostatic activity by inhibiting the PPP1R15A-containing eIF2α-P directed holophosphatase, and similar concerns raised by the Peti and Shenolikar labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choy et al., 2015</xref>), do nothing to diminish the attractiveness of PPP1R15A inhibition as a potential means for defending proteostasis. Similarly, there is nothing in our study to question the beneficial effects reported for Sephin1 in mouse models of neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2015</xref>) nor we do not challenge the enhanced susceptibility of <italic>Ppp1r15b<sup>KO</sup></italic> cells to the [(<italic>o</italic>-chlorobenzylidene)amino]guanidine, Guanabenz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsaytler et al., 2011</xref>). However, our findings that Sephin1 exerts its effects in CHO-K1 cells lacking PPP1R15A or in ISR-defective <italic>Eifs1</italic><sup>S51A</sup> cells raise doubts as to whether these phenomena were attained via inhibition of PPP1R15A or indeed modulation of the ISR.</p><p>Crystal structures of the PPP1R15(A or B)-PP1 and the related PNUTS/PPP1R10-PP1 and spinophilin/PPP1R9B-PP1 complexes reveal that both the residues corresponding to human PPP1R15A<sup>V556</sup> (of the RVxF motif) and the conserved arginine (human PPP1R15A<sup>R578</sup>) insert deeply into the surface of the PP1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choy et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2015</xref>). The contrast between the dramatic effect of the PPP1R15A<sup>V556E</sup> mutation and the more modest effect of the human PPP1R15A<sup>R578A</sup> mutation on the PPP1R15A-PP1 complex may reflect a role for the former early in the pathway to complex assembly (a process that can be thought of as PPP1R15A folding on the surface of PP1). It is therefore possible that inhibitors of the eIF2α-P holophosphatase might disrupt complex assembly, without affecting the stability or activity of a preformed complex. However, Sephin1 is unlikely to belong to such a category, as it failed to exert an inhibitory effect on enzymatic activity or on the BLI signal even when added to pure PPP1R15A, before addition of PP1 and G-actin. But other compounds that remain to be found might selectively disrupt the assembly of the PPP1R15A-PP1 complex by binding to and stabilizing an intermediate step in its formation.</p><p>Similarly instructive is the human PPP1R15A<sup>W582A</sup> mutation, which eliminates all detectable selectivity of PPP1R15-holophosphatases for eIF2α-P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>)(and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> here) without affecting the kinetics of the bimolecular association of PPP1R15A with PP1 or G-actin. These features suggest that the side chain of W582 - a residue conserved throughout the PPP1R15 family - may have a special role in aligning PP1 and G-actin to form a composite surface with affinity for the substrate, without contributing measurably to the stability of the tripartite holophosphatase. That the side chain of single tryptophan residue can bias the complex towards activity (without affecting its stability), suggests the possibility that small molecules might access this allosteric mechanism and bias the tripartite holophosphatase towards or away from enzymatic activity without the need to disrupt an extensive protein-protein interface.</p><p>Specific cellular dephosphorylation events are notoriously difficult to target with small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sakoff and McCluskey, 2004</xref>). Here we presented evidence that the perception of Sephin1 as a milestone in overcoming that challenge may need re-thinking. However, features of the PPP1R15A-PP1-G-actin holophosphatase noted above suggest ways in which eIF2α-P dephosphorylation might indeed be selectively targeted by small molecules. In vitro assays for selective eIF2α-P dephosphorylation, such as the one described here, might prove useful in discovery of small molecules with such a mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>Diverse cloning techniques were used to create the bacterial and mammalian expression vectors listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.

This saturated culture was used to inoculate 2–4 Litres of LB media supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cultures were incubated at 37°C until OD600 = 0.6–0.8. At this point, they were induced with 1 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and cultured for 20 more hours at 18°C. It was followed by a centrifugation step to pellet bacteria and resuspension of the ice-cold pellets in 3–4 pellet volumes of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 20 mTIU/ ml aprotinin, 2 μM leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin in 10% glycerol). An EmulsiFlex-C3 homogenizer (Avestin, Inc, Ottawa, Ontario) was used to lyse the bacteria, which were then clarified in a JA-25.50 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 33,000×g for 30 min at 4°C.

Two-hundred microliters of each diluted protein preparation was placed in a 96 well plate (655209, Greiner). Streptavidin sensors (18–5019, ForteBio) were hydrated in this buffer for 2–5 min before the binding assay was performed. The plate was placed in the ForteBio Octet RED96 System for data acquisition which was performed at 25° C at a constant orbital flow of 600 rpm. The binding assays consisted of the measurement of change in layer thickness (in nanometres) during a series of sequential steps. The sensor was equilibrated in the buffer (240 s) and the ligand (biotyninated protein) was loaded on the sensor. Ligand attachment to the sensor was checked by immersion of the sensor in buffer after loading (400–2000 s). Finally, association and dissociation of the proteins studied was analysed by soaking the sensor in analyte solutions and buffer, respectively. The duration of the ligand loading on the sensor was set to a specific time (600 s) or a specific value (2 nm displacement) depending on the experiment performed. The duration of the association and dissociation of the analyte to the ligand, was adjusted in order to capture bindings that had not reached equilibrium phase.

Salubrinal, added at 12 µM (higher concentrations led to conspicuous precipitation) had a mild but reproducible inhibitory effect on in vitro dephosphorylation reactions (inhibition = 22% ± 2.045, unpaired t test, p &lt; 0.0001, n=6). The weakness of salubrinal’s inhibitory effect and the compound’s tendency to precipitate at higher concentrations in the assay buffer frustrated our efforts to establish if inhibition was specific to the eIF2α-P directed ternary complex. Nonetheless, these observations showcase the sensitivity of our assay to even weak inhibitors and strengthen the conclusion regarding Sephin1’s inertness in the same assay. We thank the reviewers for this suggestion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
