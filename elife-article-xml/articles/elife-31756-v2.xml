However, TGF-β also induces phosphorylation of SMAD1 and SMAD5, but the mechanism of this phosphorylation and its functional relevance is not known. Here, we show that TGF-β-induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation requires members of two classes of type I receptor, TGFBR1 and ACVR1, and establish a new paradigm for receptor activation where TGFBR1 phosphorylates and activates ACVR1, which phosphorylates SMAD1/5. We demonstrate the biological significance of this pathway by showing that approximately a quarter of the TGF-β-induced transcriptome depends on SMAD1/5 signaling, with major early transcriptional targets being the <italic>ID</italic> genes. Finally, we show that TGF-β-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition requires signaling via both the SMAD3 and SMAD1/5 pathways, with SMAD1/5 signaling being essential to induce ID1. Therefore, combinatorial signaling via both SMAD pathways is essential for the full TGF-β-induced transcriptional program and physiological responses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31756.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells communicate with other cells via signaling molecules to coordinate their activities. Signals released from one cell can influence the behavior of neighboring cells. Signaling molecules belonging to the TGF-β family play crucial roles in animals. For example, these molecules guide the formation of tissues and organs and help maintain them throughout the animal’s adult life. Abnormal regulation of TGF-β family signaling can fuel the growth of cancer cells and also contribute to other diseases in humans.</p><p>Molecules in the TGF-β family bind to and bring together specific receptors on the surface of the receiving cell. This allows the receptors to activate so-called SMAD proteins within that cell. Activated SMADs move to the cell’s nucleus, where they regulate the activity of target genes. This in turn changes how the cell behaves.</p><p>The best-studied member of the TGF-β family is TGF-β itself. It is well known to activate two particular SMAD proteins called SMAD2 and SMAD3. Recent research showed that TGF-β could also activate two different SMAD proteins, SMAD1 and SMAD5. However, it was not understood how this was achieved, or what its biological consequences were.</p><p>Ramachandran et al. set out to address these questions in mouse and human cells grown in the laboratory. The experiments showed that, in addition to its known dedicated receptors, TGF-β also requires a third receptor to activate SMAD1 and SMAD5. Also, TGF-β signaling leads to changes in the activity of several thousand genes, and approximately a quarter of them require signaling via SMAD1 and SMAD5.</p><p>Further work showed that SMAD1 and SMAD5 are needed for a process called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. This is a normal part of animal development, and is also a common feature of cancer cells, allowing them to spread to distant parts of the body.</p><p>Understanding of how TGF-β signaling works in more detail may reveal new ways to target this pathway to treat diseases like cancer. The next step is to see how the signaling via SMAD1 and SMAD5 contributes to different aspects of cancer development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SMAD1/5</kwd><kwd>TGF-beta</kwd><kwd>epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition</kwd><kwd>ID genes</kwd><kwd>ACVR1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010438</institution-id><institution>Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001095</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramachandran</surname><given-names>Anassuya</given-names></name><name><surname>Vizan</surname><given-names>Pedro</given-names></name><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>Debipriya</given-names></name><name><surname>Chakravarty</surname><given-names>Probir</given-names></name><name><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>Caroline S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM58670</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hinck</surname><given-names>Andrew P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA172886</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hinck</surname><given-names>Andrew P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SMAD1/5 signaling is essential for the full transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-induced transcriptional program and physiological responses and is induced via a novel receptor activation mechanism, involving two distinct type I receptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Members of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) family of ligands, which includes the TGF-βs, Activins, NODAL, BMPs and GDFs, have pleiotropic effects on cell behavior ranging from germ layer specification and patterning in embryonic development, to tissue homeostasis and regeneration in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Massagué, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morikawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu and Hill, 2009</xref>). TGF-β family signaling is also deregulated in a number of human diseases through mutation or altered expression of either the ligands or downstream signaling pathway components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller and Hill, 2016</xref>). In this context, the most widely studied pathology is cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellomo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Massagué, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meulmeester and ten Dijke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wakefield and Hill, 2013</xref>), where TGF-β itself has both tumor suppressive and tumor promoting effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Massagué, 2008</xref>). At early stages of cancer TGF-β’s tumor suppressive effects dominate, such as its cytostatic and pro-apoptotic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Padua and Massagué, 2009</xref>). As tumors develop, however, mutations in key components of the pathway or downstream target genes allow the tumor to evade TGF-β’s tumor suppressive effects, whilst remaining sensitive to its tumor-promoting activities. TGF-β directly promotes the oncogenic potential of tumor cells, for example by driving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a hallmark of cancer that enhances cell invasion and migration, and also increases the frequency of tumor-initating cancer stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Massagué, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ye and Weinberg, 2015</xref>). TGF-β’s dual role in cancer thus provides an excellent example of how diverse responses can be elicited by a single ligand.</p><p>The TGF-β family ligands all signal via a common mechanism, initiated by ligand binding to two cell surface serine/threonine kinase receptors, the type II and type I receptors. In the receptor complex, the type II receptors phosphorylate and activate the type I receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wrana et al., 1994</xref>). These in turn phosphorylate the downstream effectors of the pathway, the receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs) on two serines in an SXS motif at their extreme C-termini. Phosphorylated R-SMADs form complexes with the common SMAD, SMAD4, which accumulate in the nucleus and directly regulate the transcription of target genes, leading to new programs of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi and Massagué, 2003</xref>). In the classic view of TGF-β family signaling, there are two branches, characterized by distinct combinations of type II and type I receptors, and the recruitment of specific R-SMADs to particular type I receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wakefield and Hill, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi and Massagué, 2003</xref>). One branch is activated by TGF-β, Activins and NODAL and is mediated via the type I receptors TGFBR1, ACVR1B and ACVR1C (also known as ALK5, ALK4 and ALK7 respectively), which phosphorylate SMAD2 and 3. The other is activated by BMPs and GDFs and is mediated via ACVRL1, ACVR1, BMPR1A and BMPR1B (also known as ALK1, ALK2, ALK3 and ALK6 respectively), which phosphorylate SMAD1, 5 and 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller and Hill, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In general, while this pairing between type I receptors and R-SMADs broadly fits the assignment of specific ligands to the different branches of TGF-β family signaling, it is an oversimplification. For example, ACVR1 is now described as a BMP receptor, but early work indicated that it could bind Activin and TGF-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Massagué, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miettinen et al., 1994</xref>), and very recently it has been shown to signal downstream of Activin in the context of the disease, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hino et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, ACVRL1, a type I receptor that recognizes BMP9 and 10, also transduces TGF-β signals in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pardali et al., 2010</xref>) by phosphorylating SMAD1/5 in parallel with the canonical TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goumans et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goumans et al., 2003</xref>). This SMAD1/5 arm of TGF-β signaling has also been shown to occur in a wide range of other cell types, including epithelial cells, fibroblasts and cancer cell lines, which do not express ACVRL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wrighton et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Important questions concerning this noncanonical TGF-β-induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation remain unanswered. First, the mechanism by which TGF-β induces SMAD1/5 phosphorylation, in particular, the type I receptors involved, is not known. Some studies have concluded that the canonical TGF-β receptors TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 are sufficient for phosphorylation of both SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wrighton et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, others demonstrated that one of the classic BMP type I receptors (ACVR1 or BMPR1A), or in endothelial cells, ACVRL1, is additionally required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goumans et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goumans et al., 2003</xref>). The second crucial issue concerns the biological relevance of TGF-β-induced SMAD1/5 signaling. Nothing is known about the transcriptional program activated by this arm of TGF-β signaling, or indeed, the specific SMAD complexes involved. It is also not known to what extent this pathway is required for the physiological responses to TGF-β.</p><p>Here, we dissect the SMAD1/5 arm of TGF-β signaling and define the underlying mechanism and its biological function. We show that TGF-β-induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation requires both TGFBR1 and ACVR1 and using biosensors, and an optogenetic approach, we establish a new paradigm for TGF-β receptor activation. We have mapped the binding sites on chromatin of nuclear phosphorylated SMAD1/5 (pSMAD1/5) genome-wide, which led us to define the target genes regulated by this arm of TGF-β signaling. We go on to show that this arm of signaling is required for TGF-β-induced EMT. Our data reveal that the full transcriptional programme activated in response to TGF-β requires integrated combinatorial signaling via both the SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5 pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The kinetics of TGF-β-mediated SMAD1/5 phosphorylation</title><p>To begin to dissect which receptors are required for TGF-β-induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation, we compared the kinetics of SMAD1/5 and SMAD2 phosphorylation in response to TGF-β. Using the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and the mouse mammary epithelial cell line NMuMG as model systems, we found that TGF-β induced only transient phosphorylation of SMAD1/5 that peaked at 1 hr and then returned to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This was in contrast to a more sustained TGF-β-induced SMAD2 phosphorylation, or SMAD1/5 phosphorylation in response to BMP4. However, transient SMAD1/5 phosphorylation is not a defining characteristic of this arm of TGF-β signaling, as another human breast cancer line, BT-549, exhibited sustained SMAD1/5 phosphorylation that is still readily detectable 8 hr after TGF-β stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, when BT-549 cells were grown as non-adherent spheres, TGF-β-induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation did not attenuate at all in the first 8 hr of signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, the kinetics of TGF-β-induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation are cell-type-specific and dependent on the culture conditions and are independent of the kinetics of TGF-β-induced SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, suggesting a distinct receptor complex may be involved.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31756.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of SMAD1/5 phosphorylation by TGF-β.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MDA-MB-231 and NMuMG cells were treated with TGF-β or BMP4 for the times indicated.

Transfection of the Opto-ACVR1 alone resulted in no phosphorylation of co-transfected FLAG-SMAD1, either in the absence or presence of blue light. However, when Opto-ACVR1 and Opto-TGFBR1* were co-transfected, a robust light-inducible phosphorylation of FLAG-SMAD1 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly, this was inhibited by both SB-505124 and LDN-193189, confirming the involvement of both receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This directly demonstrates that TGFBR1 can activate ACVR1 in vivo.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we used previously published recombinant versions of TGF-β3, designated WW and WD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2011</xref>). TGF-β3<sup>WW</sup>, the wild-type TGF-β3 dimer, is composed of two identical monomeric TGF-β3 subunits, whereas TGF-β3<sup>WD</sup> contains one wild-type subunit of TGF-β3 and one mutated subunit that cannot bind to either TGFBR2 or TGFBR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, while the TGF-β3<sup>WW</sup> ligand engages two type II:type I pairs in the tetrameric complex, the TGF-β3<sup>WD</sup> ligand can only engage one pair. In addition, TGF-β3<sup>WW</sup> does not bind ACVR1, and by inference, neither does TGF-β3<sup>WD</sup> (data not shown). It was previously demonstrated that TGF-β3<sup>WD</sup> binding to a single type II:type I receptor pair is sufficient to induce phosphorylation of SMAD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore reasoned that if model I was correct then only TGF-β3<sup>WW</sup> would induce phosphorylation of SMAD1/5, as the heterotetrameric complex would not be able to be assembled by TGF-β3<sup>WD</sup>. If model II was correct, however, then both TGF-β3<sup>WW</sup> and TGF-β3<sup>WD</sup> would be competent to induce pSMAD1/5. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 or NMuMG cells with either TGF-β3<sup>WW</sup> or TGF-β3<sup>WD</sup> led to a dose-dependent increase in both SMAD1 and SMAD2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Using delocalization of the adherens junction marker CDH1 (also called E-Cadherin) together with loss of the tight junction marker TJP1 (also called ZO-1) as a measure of EMT, we could readily demonstrate that signaling through SMAD1/5 was crucial for this process in two separate ΔSMAD1/5 clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

We have shown that two type I receptors are required, the canonical TGF-β receptor TGFBR1, and additionally, one of the classical BMP type I receptors, ACVR1. Using in vitro kinase assays, an optogenetic approach and an ACVR1 receptor fluorescent biosensor, we have uncovered a new mechanism for receptor activation whereby one type I receptor activates another. We show that in response to TGF-β, TGFBRI phosphorylates and activates ACVR1, which phosphorylates SMAD1/5. To address the functional significance of this arm of TGF-β signaling, we used genome-wide ChIP-seq and RNA-seq and show that approximately a quarter of the TGF-β-regulated transcriptome is dependent on SMAD1/5, with major early targets being the ID transcriptional regulators. Finally, we have also demonstrated that the SMAD1/5 pathway is essential for TGF-β-induced EMT, and this reflects a requirement for ID1.</p><p>Taking these results together with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daly et al., 2008</xref>), we propose a model of combinatorial signaling that is essential for the TGF-β cellular program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In most cells tested the induction of pSMAD1/5 is more transient than the pSMAD2/3 induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daly et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the initial transcriptional program is regulated by both SMAD pathways and is refined at later time points by the SMAD2/3 pathway. Therefore, the full TGF-β-induced transcriptional program requires combinatorial signaling via both SMAD pathways. With respect to the functional relevance of TGF-β-induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation, we have now shown that complete EMT requires both SMAD pathways. TGF-β-induced anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion have also been shown to require SMAD1/5 signaling, whilst TGF-β-induced growth arrest is only dependent on SMAD2/3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daly et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>Since we have now demonstrated that TGF-β induces the formation of SMAD1/5–SMAD4 complexes that regulate canonical BMP target genes, it is important to ask what discriminates TGF-β signaling from BMP signaling as it is well known that BMP and TGF-β functional responses are distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Itoh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miyazono et al., 2010</xref>). The answer lies in the combinatorial signaling, and likely also in the signaling dynamics. In contrast to TGF-β, BMP stimulation leads to a sustained phosphorylation of SMAD1/5 in the absence of SMAD2/3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grönroos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daly et al., 2008</xref>). As a result, although the gene expression program downstream of BMP shares some common targets with that downstream of TGF-β at early time points, it will be completely distinct at later time points as a result of the sustained SMAD1/5 signaling and the absence of SMAD2/3-driven transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Receptor requirements for TGF-β-induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation</title><p>We have shown that two classes of type I receptors are necessary for TGF-β-induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation, the canonical TGF-β receptor, TGFBR1 and one of the BMP type I receptors, of which we have focused on ACVR1. Our results demonstrate that the kinase activity of TGFBR1 is essential for activation of ACVR1, whereas the kinase activity of ACVR1 is necessary to phosphorylate SMAD1/5. Surprisingly, we found that inhibition of TGF-β-induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation by LDN-193189, which inhibits the BMP type I receptors, is incomplete, even though the same LDN-193189 concentration is sufficient to inhibit BMP-induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation. This same result was also previously seen when the BMP type I receptor inhibitor dorsomorphin was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daly et al., 2008</xref>). A complete inhibition of TGF-β-induced pSMAD1/5 is achieved by combining LDN-193189 with a sub-optimal dose of SB-431542. This is likely explained by the fact that LDN-193189-inhibited ACVR1 is still able to efficiently recruit SMAD1/5, where it may be inefficiently phosphorylated by TGFBR1, which is sensitive to the sub-optimal dose of SB-431542. The requirement for two distinct type I receptors fits well with what was shown for TGF-β responses in endothelial cells, where ACVLR1 and TGFBR1 were both required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goumans et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goumans et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Our optogenetic experiments revealed that activated TGFBR1 phosphorylates and activates ACVR1 in vivo. We previously hypothesized that TGFBR1 and ACVR1 could be in the same receptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daly et al., 2008</xref>), but our use of the mutant TGF-β3 ligands here indicated that these two type I receptors are not part of an obligate heterotetrameric receptor, but rather that TGFBR1, activated by TGFBR2 as a result of TGF-β stimulation can phosphorylate and activate ACVR1 in the membrane as a result of receptor clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We were surprised to see in our optogenetic experiments that light-induced dimers of the activated kinase domain of TGFBR1 were much more active than the monomeric domains, as this suggests that TGFBR1 is able to autophosphorylate and auto-activate in the absence of type II receptors, if brought into close proximity. In fact, a similar observation was made in early studies using chimeric receptors with the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin receptor and the intracellular domain of constitutively active TGFBR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luo and Lodish, 1996</xref>). This chimeric receptor could only mediate a growth arrest after stimulation with erythropoietin, indicating that clustering was important for receptor activity in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Dynamics of TGF-β-induced pSMAD1/5 signaling</title><p>We and others have observed that in most cell types TGF-β-induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation is transient compared with SMAD2/3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wrighton et al., 2009</xref>). Using pSMAD2 as a readout, we previously showed that pSMAD2 levels attenuate over time, and remain at a low steady state level that depends on receptors replenishing the cell surface, for as long as ligand is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vizán et al., 2013</xref>). Our demonstration that levels of fluorescence of the ACVR1-IPF biosensor steadily increase over a number of hours indicates that ACVR1 can also be continuously activated for as long as ligand is present. We have shown that the transience of SMAD1/5 phosphorylation requires new protein synthesis, indicating that SMAD1/5 phosphorylation is likely to be actively terminated by an inhibitor induced by the pathway. Given the prolonged activation of ACVR1-IPF in response to ligand, we hypothesize that such an inhibitor is unlikely to target the receptors, but might be a TGF-β-induced phosphatase that targets phosphorylated SMAD1/5 directly. The transience of SMAD1/5 phosphorylation is not a defining characteristic of this arm of TGF-β signaling as BT-549 breast cancer cells exhibit a more sustained response, which is even more pronounced when the cells are grown as spheres. Comparing TGF-β target genes in BT-549s versus MDA-MB-231s where the response is transient, might shed light on the identity of the putative inhibitor.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>TGF-β-induced pSMAD1/5 is transcriptionally active and required for a subset of TGF-β-induced target genes</title><p>Our ChIP-seq analysis demonstrates for the first time that TGF-β-induced pSMAD1/5 accumulates in the nucleus and binds to chromatin. These experiments revealed that the peaks with the highest pSMAD1/5 enrichment flanked classical BMP target genes, such as <italic>ID1, ID3</italic> and <italic>ATOH8</italic>. Analysis of the binding sites led us to the discovery that the SMAD complexes responsible for inducing these target genes downstream of TGF-β were pSMAD1/5–SMAD4 complexes. The ChIP-seq analysis also revealed widespread co-binding of pSMAD1/5 and SMAD3, which was surprising. For the classical BMP targets, the ratio of pSMAD1/5:SMAD3 in the peaks was high, whereas at classical TGF-β targets like <italic>JUNB, PMEPA1, SERPINE1</italic> and <italic>BHLHE40</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levy and Hill, 2005</xref>), this ratio was less than 1. We do not fully understand the functional significance of the pSMAD1/5 and SMAD3 co-binding. We previously demonstrated that at least in some contexts, pSMAD3–pSMAD1/5 complexes are inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grönroos et al., 2012</xref>), and this is evident in the work presented here for <italic>ID3</italic> induction. However, for <italic>JUNB</italic> we found that knockdown of SMAD1/5 had no effect on TGF-β-induced transcription, suggesting that pSMAD1/5 is not contributing to its transcriptional regulation.

This accounts for a previously unexplained observation that overexpression of dominant negative ACVR1 in NMuMGs caused a partial loss of EMT in response to TGF-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miettinen et al., 1994</xref>). In an earlier study using siRNAs we had concluded that the SMAD1/5 arm of the TGF-β pathway was not required for EMT in EpRas cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daly et al., 2008</xref>). The likely explanation for this discepency is the poor SMAD1/5 knockdown we achieved in those cells compared with the very effective strategy of inhibiting this arm of TGF-β signaling using the combined small molecule inhibitors that we have employed here.</p><p>We have gone on to show that TGF-β-induced ID1 is required for EMT. Importantly, although ID1 is necessary for EMT, it is clearly not sufficient, as BMPs cannot induce EMT in NMuMGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kowanetz et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with this we have also shown that the SMAD3 pathway is essential for EMT. This arm of the pathway is likely required for the induction of some or all of the so-called EMT-associated transcription factors, most notably SNAI1, SNAI2, ZEB1, ZEB2 and BHLH proteins such as TWIST1 and E47 (now called TCF3), some of which are known direct TGF-β targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Peinado et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diepenbruck and Christofori, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that EMT depends on TGF-β-induced ID1 expression has implications for the role of SMAD1/5 and the IDs in cancer. The prevailing view is that ID1 is downregulated by TGF-β in non-tumorigenic human epithelial lines, but upregulated by TGF-β in established tumor cell lines, as we have observed here in MDA-MB-231 and BT-549s, and also in patient-derived tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anido et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Padua et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lasorella et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, ID proteins are overexpressed in many different tumor types and are implicated in the maintenance of tumor stem cells and for some cancer-related phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lasorella et al., 2014</xref>). ID1 was also found in a lung metastatic gene signature of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Minn et al., 2005</xref>). The role of ID1 in EMT is context dependent. In a recent study of breast cancer, ID1 was shown to be expressed in tumor cells that had already undergone an EMT, and it contributed to the growth of the primary tumor by inducing a stem cell-like phenotype. At the metastatic site, however, TGF-β-induced ID1 was proposed to induce an mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) by interferring with the activity of TWIST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stankic et al., 2013</xref>). In light of our current data it will be important to investigate in what tumor contexts ID1 is required for EMT, and more broadly how the TGF-β–SMAD1/5 pathway contributes to different aspects of tumorigenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell line origin, authentication and maintenance</title><p>MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from the ECACC/HPA culture collection, BT-549 cells were obtained from the Francis Crick Institute Cell Services, NMuMG cells were obtained from ATCC, MDCKII cells were obtained from Sigma (UK), NIH-3T3 cells were obtained from Richard Treisman (Francis Crick Institute) and EpRas cells were obtained from Martin Oft and Hartmut Beug (IMP, Vienna).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a compelling study that demonstrates a role for ACVR1 in the activation of Smad1/5 by TGFbeta. The mechanism is reported to be mediated by TGFBR1 mediated phosphorylation and activation of ACVR1. The authors show that the Smad1/5 arm of the TGF β signaling pathway leads to the regulation of a fraction of the total TGF β responsive genes. Moreover, the authors associate this gene expression program with EMT. In conclusion, this is an excellent, well written manuscript that provides compelling evidence to explain a known paradox in TGFB signaling, the transient induction of pSMAD1/5, and shows that it is biologically important.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While 10 µM SB inhibits both pSmad1/5 and pSmad2, and 0.25 μm still inhibits both but possibly inhibiting more pSmad1/5 than pSmad2 (no quantification done), it is too strong to conclude that TGFBR1 is differentially required for SMAD1/5 versus SMAD2 phosphorylation. More evidence is required before such a conclusion can be made.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. Since TGFBR1 opto-activation alone can robustly induce phosphorylation of SMAD1, it cannot be concluded that TFGBR1 + ACVR1 opto-activation of pSMAD1 is by TGFBR1 activating ACVR1.

(For a nice example of this see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> in Randall et al., (2004)). However, initial experiments indicated that we could see some phosphorylation of endogenous SMAD1/5 by the Opto receptors, but we retained the FLAG-SMAD1 in the assay as it substantially extends the range of the assay.
