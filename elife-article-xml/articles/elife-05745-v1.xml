formation with RanGTP. To ensure efficient cargo release in the cytoplasm, NESs have evolved to display low affinity for Crm1. However, mechanisms that overcome low affinity to assemble Crm1-export complexes in the nucleus remain poorly understood. In this study, we reveal a new type of RanGTP-binding protein, Slx9, which facilitates Crm1 recruitment to the 40S pre-ribosome-associated NES-containing adaptor Rio2. In vitro, Slx9 binds Rio2 and RanGTP, forming a complex. This complex directly loads Crm1, unveiling a non-canonical stepwise mechanism to assemble a Crm1-export complex. A mutation in Slx9 that impairs Crm1-export complex assembly inhibits 40S pre-ribosome export. Thus, Slx9 functions as a scaffold to optimally present RanGTP and the NES to Crm1, therefore, triggering 40S pre-ribosome export. This mechanism could represent one solution to the paradox of weak binding events underlying rapid Crm1-mediated export.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05745.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05745.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05745.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants, fungi, and animals store their genetic material within the nucleus of each of their cells. This structure is surrounded by a double layer of membrane that prevents the contents of the nucleus from mixing with the contents of the rest of the cell (namely the cytoplasm). Exchange of material between the nucleus and cytoplasm occurs through pores embedded within the nuclear membrane.</p><p>To travel through one of these pores, large molecules (also called cargos) require the assistance of so-called ‘transport receptors’ such as the Crm1 protein. This protein recognizes and binds to the part of a cargo molecule called a ‘nuclear export signal’, and the Crm1 protein also binds to another protein called RanGTP. Nuclear export signals bind weakly to Crm1, which in turn ensures that these cargos are easily released in the cytoplasm once transport is completed. However, this weak binding means that it has remained a mystery how Crm1 is able to efficiently transport cargos out of the nucleus to begin with.</p><p>Now, Fischer et al. have analyzed how one cargo that contains a nuclear export signal, namely molecules called ribosome precursors, assembles with Crm1. The experiments identified another protein called Slx9 that shuttles rapidly between the inside and the outside of the nucleus. Fischer et al. observed that Slx9 binds directly to RanGTP and brings it together with the ribosome precursor cargo. When a complex of Slx9, RanGTP, and cargo is assembled, it further recruits Crm1 to the cargo. Thus, Slx9 acts as a scaffold to bring cargo into contact with Crm1 and RanGTP, and a tight complex is formed that enables the export of the cargo out of the nucleus. Yeast cells lacking Slx9 delay export of ribosome precursors out of the nucleus. These findings imply the existence of yet-unidentified proteins like Slx9 that help Crm1 to rapidly transport diverse cargos out from the nucleus and into the cytoplasm.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05745.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05745.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>nuclear transport</kwd><kwd>Crm1/Xpo1</kwd><kwd>ribosome export</kwd><kwd>Slx9</kwd><kwd>Rio2</kwd><kwd>nuclear export signal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerische Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panse</surname><given-names>Vikram Govind</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Starting Grant EURIBIO0260676</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panse</surname><given-names>Vikram Govind</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Slx9 is a newly discovered type of RanGTP-binding protein required for Crm1-mediated nuclear export.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In all eukaryotes, transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is channeled through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) embedded within the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tran and Wente, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D'Angelo and Hetzer, 2008</xref>). Yeast NPCs are approximately 60 MDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandez-Martinez et al., 2012</xref>) and are composed of multiple copies of about 30 nucleoporins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rout et al., 2000</xref>). Cargos of different sizes and charges pass through the central transport channel of the NPC, which is filled with a meshwork of natively unfolded Phe-Gly (FG)-repeats present in FG-nucleoporins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frey and Görlich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Terry and Wente, 2009</xref>). These nucleoporins generate a permeability barrier that allows passive diffusion of small molecules, such as ions and metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frey and Görlich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patel et al., 2007</xref>). Macromolecules (&gt;40 kDa) require the assistance of nuclear transport receptors, including members of the importin-β-like family, to efficiently overcome this selectivity barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Macara, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ribbeck and Görlich, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rout and Aitchison, 2001</xref>). These transport receptors, also termed importins and exportins, mediate the majority of molecular exchange between the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cook et al., 2007</xref>). Transport receptors recognize their cargo via specific signal sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cook and Conti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Güttler and Görlich, 2011</xref>) and translocate them through the NPC by transiently interacting with FG-repeats.</p><p>The small GTPase Ran coordinates the movement of importins and exportins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and directs the compartment-specific binding and release of transported cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fried and Kutay, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pemberton and Paschal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cook et al., 2007</xref>). Ran exists in both GDP- and GTP-bound forms, and the two states are asymmetrically distributed, with RanGTP significantly enriched in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakielny and Dreyfuss, 1999</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Görlich and Kutay, 1999</xref>). This gradient of RanGTP is established through the spatial separation of regulators of the Ran-cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Izaurralde et al., 1997</xref>). Whereas the Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor, RCC1 (Prp20 in yeast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bischoff and Ponstingl, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fleischmann et al., 1991</xref>), localizes to the nucleus, the Ran GTPase-activating protein, RanGAP1 (Rna1 in yeast), is found in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hopper et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matunis et al., 1996</xref>). Interactions between RanGTP and transport receptors are crucial for the directionality of nucleocytoplasmic exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nachury and Weis, 1999</xref>). In the nucleus, RanGTP induces the release of imported cargos from importins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rexach and Blobel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Görlich et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, RanGTP promotes the interaction of cargos with exportins for their transport to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fornerod et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kutay et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stade et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Solsbacher et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>In budding yeast, ribosome assembly accounts for a major proportion of the nucleocytoplasmic transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rout et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schlenstedt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sydorskyy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kressler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schütz et al., 2014</xref>). mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) are exported into the cytoplasm. Newly synthesized r-proteins are imported into the nucleus and then targeted to the nucleolus for incorporation into nascent pre-ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schütz et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, &gt;300 transiently interacting non-ribosomal assembly factors aid the construction and maturation of ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bassler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dragon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grandi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schäfer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerhardy et al., 2014</xref>). Correctly assembled pre-ribosomal particles are transported through NPCs into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tschochner and Hurt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Panse and Johnson, 2010</xref>). In addition to other cargos, it is estimated that each yeast NPC facilitates the export of ∼25 pre-ribosomal particles every minute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Warner, 1999</xref>). Transporting pre-ribosomal cargos from the nucleus through the NPC into the cytoplasm, therefore, represents a major task for the export machinery.</p><p>The Ran-cycle-dependent exportin Crm1 plays an essential role in exporting pre-ribosomal particles to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hurt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moy and Silver, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gadal et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson et al., 2002</xref>). Crm1 recognizes and directly binds leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NESs) on cargos in the presence of RanGTP to form a Crm1-export complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fornerod et al., 1997</xref>). Although an essential NES-containing adaptor, Nmd3, has been identified for 60S pre-ribosome export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ho and Johnson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ho et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gadal et al., 2001</xref>), a similar adaptor to recruit Crm1 to the 40S pre-ribosome remains elusive. It has been suggested that multiple NES-containing adaptors such as Ltv1 and Rio2 recruit Crm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Seiser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zemp et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Merwin et al., 2014</xref>), thereby guaranteeing efficient 40S pre-ribosome export. The essential mRNA and 60S pre-ribosome transport receptor Mex67-Mtr2, which does not directly utilize the RanGTP gradient, also facilitates nuclear export of the 40S pre-ribosomal cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faza et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the identification of several components of the export machinery, assembly steps and mechanisms that prepare the pre-ribosomal cargo for transport through the NPC remain largely unexplored.</p><p>To initiate export, Crm1 must cooperatively bind RanGTP and its NES-containing cargo in the nucleus, to form a trimeric export complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Petosa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Monecke et al., 2013</xref>). NESs have evolved to maintain relatively low affinity to Crm1 to avoid defects in disassembly of the export complex in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engelsma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kutay and Güttinger, 2005</xref>). Mechanisms that promote Crm1-export complex assembly and thereby ensure export of the NES-containing cargo at a reasonable rate remain poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we identify yeast Slx9 as a new type of RanGTP-binding protein that promotes assembly of a Crm1-export complex on the 40S pre-ribosome-associated NES-containing adaptor Rio2. Our data raise the possibility of a yet-unidentified family of RanGTP-binding proteins that act as scaffolds to optimally present RanGTP and NES-containing cargos to Crm1, orchestrating a non-cooperative stepwise assembly that drives fast and efficient Crm1-mediated export.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>slx9-1</italic> causes defects in 40S pre-ribosome nuclear export</title><p>Slx9 is a 24-kDa basic protein that co-enriches with pre-ribosomal particles in the 40S maturation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gavin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faza et al., 2012</xref>) and is required for efficient nuclear export of 40S pre-ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faza et al., 2012</xref>). However, the precise contribution of Slx9 to 40S pre-ribosome export has remained unclear. To investigate the function of yeast Slx9, we generated <italic>slx9</italic> variants by random mutagenesis and analyzed the growth of the resulting strains at different temperatures. One allele, <italic>slx9L108P</italic>, hereafter termed <italic>slx9-1</italic>, caused slow growth at temperatures between 20°C and 30°C, indistinguishable from <italic>slx9∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top panel). Like <italic>slx9∆</italic>, <italic>slx9-1</italic> cells were not impaired in growth at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Western analysis of whole cell lysates revealed that Slx9 and Slx9-1 were present at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom panel), indicating that impaired growth of the <italic>slx9-1</italic> strain is not due to reduced levels of the mutant protein. As previously observed, Slx9-GFP localized primarily to the nucleolus, where it co-localized with the nucleolar marker Gar1-mCherry, as well as to the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faza et al., 2012</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Slx9-1-GFP displayed an identical localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that the mutant protein is correctly targeted to the nucleolus and nucleoplasm. Slx9 maximally co-enriched with Enp1-TAP that purifies both the 90S and 40S pre-ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faza et al., 2012</xref>). A similar purification from <italic>slx9-1</italic> cells revealed that Enp1-TAP co-enriched at least as much Slx9-1 mutant protein as Slx9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

To allow efficient cargo release in the cytoplasm, NESs have evolved to have low affinity for Crm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engelsma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kutay and Güttinger, 2005</xref>). This low affinity is expected to reduce the efficiency of Crm1-export complex formation and slow down nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engelsma et al., 2004</xref>). Despite their low affinity in vitro, NES-containing cargos are exported efficiently in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kutay and Güttinger, 2005</xref>). Because they are amongst the most abundant export cargos in a eukaryotic cell and require rapid, sustained rates of export; pre-ribosomal particles are particularly sensitive to the interactions between the NES and Crm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zemp and Kutay, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Panse and Johnson, 2010</xref>). Here, we identify Slx9 as a RanGTP-binding protein that stabilizes the interaction between RanGTP, Rio2, and Crm1 without promoting cooperative binding between these proteins. Instead, Slx9 overcomes the low affinity between the NES and Crm1 and drives stepwise assembly of a Crm1-export complex on the NES-containing adaptor Rio2 of the 40S pre-ribosomal cargo.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Slx9 is a new type of RanGTP-binding protein required for 40S pre-ribosome export</title><p>Slx9 was first proposed to function in ribosome biogenesis pathway through promoting ITS1 processing, which is required to separate pre-rRNAs of the large and small pre-ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bax et al., 2006</xref>). In support to this early assembly role, <italic>slx9∆</italic> interacts genetically with mutations in <italic>RRP5</italic>, which encodes an assembly factor required for pre-rRNA processing. However, low-copy overexpression of the transport receptor <italic>MEX67-MTR2</italic>, which is involved in 40S pre-ribosome export, suppresses the growth defect and pre-40S export defect of <italic>slx9∆</italic> cells. Further, <italic>SLX9</italic> genetically interacts with several factors directly involved in 40S pre-ribosome export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faza et al., 2012</xref>). These functional studies indicate a role for Slx9 in the nuclear export of the 40S pre-ribosomal cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faza et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the pre-rRNA processing defects observed in the <italic>slx9∆</italic> mutant could be a consequence of a primary defect in the nuclear export of 40S pre-ribosomes.</p><p>Surprisingly, although Slx9 did not interact with Crm1 in vitro, it interacts specifically with the GTP-bound form of Ran. This interaction depends on the basic patch of RanGTP. Removal of the RanGTP acidic C-terminal tail strengthened Slx9:RanGTP interactions, suggesting that these proteins interact in a manner distinct from previously identified RanGTP-binding proteins, such as Yrb1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maurer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nilsson et al., 2001</xref>). Sequence analyses did not reveal any apparent homology between Slx9 and known Ran-binding proteins. Based on all these data, we propose that Slx9 is a new type of RanGTP-binding protein.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Slx9 mediates non-canonical stepwise assembly of a Crm1-export complex</title><p>To assemble a Crm1-export complex, Crm1 requires binding to both RanGTP and a NES-containing cargo in a cooperative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Güttler and Görlich, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Monecke et al., 2013</xref>). This canonical assembly pathway requires Crm1 to switch from a relaxed, low affinity ‘cytoplasmic’ conformation to a strained, high-affinity ‘nuclear’ conformation. In the nuclear conformation, RanGTP is enclosed within the toroid-like fold of Crm1, away from the cargo-binding site. Structural analyses of Crm1-complexes suggest that RanGTP promotes NES-binding solely by stabilizing the strained nuclear conformation of Crm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Güttler and Görlich, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Monecke et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, Slx9 mediates a non-canonical stepwise assembly of a Crm1-export complex. First, Slx9 binds RanGTP and the NES-containing 40S pre-ribosome adaptor Rio2. Interactions between Slx9, Rio2, and RanGTP do not rely on cooperative binding, since the pairwise complexes between these proteins were stable. However, all three proteins were required for efficient Crm1 loading to the Rio2-NES. This recruitment also does not rely on cooperative binding between Rio2, Crm1, and RanGTP, since the Slx9:Rio2:RanGTP complex was stable in the absence of Crm1.</p><p>Mutational and functional studies identified a point mutation, L108P, which impaired the ability of Slx9 to bind RanGTP in vitro. Although this mutant protein was stably recruited to pre-ribosomal particles in vivo and to Rio2 in vitro, it was unable to assemble a Crm1-export complex. Both <italic>slx9∆</italic> and <italic>slx9-1</italic> cells displayed impaired 40S pre-ribosome export and synthetic phenotypes with factors involved in 40S pre-ribosome export. These data suggest that the 40S pre-ribosome nuclear export defect observed in <italic>slx9∆</italic> and <italic>slx9-1</italic> cells is due to their failure to efficiently assemble Crm1-export complexes on 40S pre-ribosomal particles. A stepwise formation of a Crm1-export complex could allow currently uncharacterized quality control surveillance steps to monitor pre-ribosome assembly and ensure that only correctly assembled particles are chosen for export. In this respect, Slx9-dependent ribosome export would mirror the assembly process of the 40S pre-ribosomal cargo itself.</p><p>Crm1-mediated nuclear export is modulated by RanGTP-binding proteins, which promote specific steps along the export pathway. For example, RanBP3/Yrb2 increases the rate of cooperative Crm1-complex assembly in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koyama et al., 2014</xref>). Yrb2/RanBP3 also modulates Crm1 substrate recognition, promoting interactions with certain NESs and preventing the strong Crm1-Snurportin1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Englmeier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Langer et al., 2011</xref>). At the other end of the export cycle, RanBP1/Yrb1 and RanBP2 interact strongly with RanGTP in the cytoplasm to stimulate Crm1-export complex disassembly, thereby indirectly contributing to export efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bischoff and Görlich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kehlenbach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maurer et al., 2001</xref>). Notably, despite the fact that these RanGTP-binding proteins act at different stages to stimulate export, they typically influence cooperative interaction between cargo, Crm1, and RanGTP.</p><p>Slx9 utilized a distinct mechanism from that proposed for Yrb2/RanBP3 for Crm1-export complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Englmeier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lindsay et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koyama et al., 2014</xref>). Yrb2/RanBP3 increases the affinity of Crm1 for RanGTP by stabilizing a conformation of Crm1 that promotes canonical assembly of a Crm1-export complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Langer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koyama et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, Slx9 does not interact with RanGTP and Crm1 to form a complex. Instead, it interacts with RanGTP and the NES-containing adaptor Rio2. Finally, biochemical and structural studies show that Yrb2 competes with NES-containing cargo for binding to Crm1 and suggest that NES-binding causes partial dissociation of Yrb2 from the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koyama et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, Slx9 remains stably bound to the GST-Rio2:Crm1:RanGTP complex, suggesting that it does not compete with the Rio2-NES for its interaction. Despite these clear differences, both Slx9 and RanBP3/Yrb2 work to overcome the low binding affinity between NESs and Crm1, representing distinct solutions to the paradox of low affinity interactions driving fast and efficient Crm1-mediated cargo export. Notably, <italic>SLX9</italic> strongly genetically interacted with <italic>YRB2</italic>, suggesting that both mechanisms are employed to ensure rapid 40S pre-ribosome export.</p><p>Does Slx9 target other NES-containing cargos? Although <italic>slx9∆</italic> showed a strong 40S pre-ribosome export defect, <italic>rio2∆NES</italic> grew indistinguishably from WT cells. Notably, <italic>rio2∆NESyrb2∆</italic> cells grew slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>) but are not synthetically lethal as the <italic>slx9∆yrb2∆</italic> strain. These genetic interactions argue that Rio2 is not the sole target of Slx9. Genetic approaches will uncover additional NES-containing adaptors that employ Slx9 to prepare the 40S pre-ribosome for nuclear export.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A family of NES-conformer stabilizers?</title><p>NESs contain variability in the spacing between key hydrophobic residues, yet are recognized by the same rigid hydrophobic pockets on Crm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Güttler et al., 2010</xref>). The structure of RanGTP-Crm1 bound to prototypic NESs showed that the backbone of NESs adopts different conformations, which permits the efficient insertion of key NES residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Güttler et al., 2010</xref>). In support of the proposed NES-conformer selection model, a destabilized NES of Rio2<sup>3G</sup> was unable to bind Crm1 in the presence of RanGTP in vitro. However, Crm1 recruitment to Rio2<sup>3G</sup> was restored in the presence of Slx9, suggesting a stabilizing function. This stabilization provides a mechanism to overcome the weak binding of NESs to Crm1, driving Crm1-complex assembly and guaranteeing efficient cargo export into the cytoplasm. One prediction of the NES-conformer selection model would be that NESs with favorable conformations exhibit improved affinity to Crm1. Slx9 may belong to a family of yet-unidentified RanGTP-binding proteins that induce and stabilize NES-conformers upon binding export cargos. Thus, these RanGTP-binding proteins would allow greater NES variability and potentially regulate the efficiency by which specific NESs are recognized by Crm1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript describes the largely uncharacterized protein Slx9 as a cofactor for Crm1-mediated nuclear export of pre-40S subunits. Whereas much is known about export of the large ribosomal subunit, export of the small subunit has remained enigmatic. It is well established that it depends on Crm1 but essential Crm1 ligands have not been identified. This has led to the suggestion that export factors for the small subunit are redundant. In this work, the authors identify Slx9 as a factor that interacts with Ran-GTP and the NES-containing pre-40S factor Rio2 to recruit Crm1. The data are clearly presented and, for the most part, support the general claims of the authors. However, there are several inconsistencies in the data and interpretation that warrant clarification. While many of these can probably be handled by additional explanations, two points are likely to require new experiments. First, the conclusion of a ternary complex of Slx9-RanGTP-Rio2 is not strongly supported. Second, quantitative interaction analysis rather than the more qualitative GST-pulldown is warranted for certain conclusions. Finally, the text could benefit from a more balanced tone that limits overstatements and overinterpretation of some of the data. Some suggestions are provided in the comments below.</p><p>1) In the subsection “Recruitment of Crm1 to Rio2:RanGTP is stimulated by Slx9”, the statement “…a Rio2:Slx9 complex was able to recruit RanGTP, suggesting that Slx9 employs distinct surfaces to bind these two proteins” cannot be supported strongly based on the data. The authors used immobilized Rio2 to pull down either RanGTP directly, or Slx9 followed by RanGTP. The fact they recover RanGTP in the latter could be due to its direct interaction with immobilized Rio2, either because Rio2 was not completely saturated with Slx9, or because RanGTP simply competed off some bound Slx9. It is therefore unclear how this result permits conclusion of a ternary complex. Indeed, in a situation where all pairwise combinations can interact, such GST-pulldowns will not be convincing and other methods are warranted (e.g., gel filtration, gel shift assays, or sequential affinity steps against two of the proteins recovering the third). Alternatively, a well-controlled and quantitative titration of Slx9 to show that it does not inhibit the binding of Ran-GTP could also argue against mutually exclusive binding.</p><p>2) Subsection “Recruitment of Crm1 to Rio2:RanGTP is stimulated by Slx9”: from data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> the authors claim that Slx9 promotes the formation of a complex containing Rio2, Ran-GTP and Crm1. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows that a trimeric complex containing only Rio2-Ran-GTP and Crm1 assembles efficiently in the absence of Slx9. In fact, in that complex, Crm1 appears to enhance Ran binding, suggesting cooperativity of binding. The same components appear to be present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> lane 4 but now we do not see Crm1 binding. What accounts for this difference? This is an important point as it underpins the conclusion that Slx9 acts in a non-canonical fashion.</p><p>3) The defective interaction between Slx9-1 and RanGTP should be analyzed biophysically to directly compare it to Slx9 (e.g., measurement of Kd values and ideally, on and off rates). The GST pulldown is rather qualitative and the modest difference in recovery observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> (which is not entirely convincing) cannot easily explain why this mutation essentially phenocopies a Slx9∆ strain. As this mutant is used for several key points in the paper, its characterization would appear to be important.</p><p>4) The data presented that FAM207A is indeed the human Slx9 homolog as stated (Figure 2–figure supplement 2) is not entirely convincing. The distribution and evolutionary conservation of the Slx9 proteins has not been reported to date. Indeed, it was previously suggested that Slx9 homologs are limited to yeast species (Bax et al RNA 2006). After one referee performed some limited multiple sequence alignments between putative vertebrate FAM207A homologs and the <italic>pombe</italic> and <italic>cerevisiae</italic> Slx9 proteins, he/she did not find the level of amino acid conservation convincing. Particularly in view of the previous report (Bax et al), the authors should show evidence for the phylogenetic distribution and amino acid conservation of the Slx9 proteins beyond yeast. Related to this, the authors show that FAM207A binds Ran<sup>QL</sup>GTP in vitro. However, this observation in isolation is not convincing since cofractionation with ribosomes or requirement for 40S subunit export are not analyzed. The authors should either be more cautious about the claim that FAM207A is the functional human Slx9 homolog or more robustly support this conclusion.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the authors must rule out that newly synthesized protein does not account for the apparent shuttling of Slx9. Notably, the signal for Slx9 in the recipient nucleus seems less than that for the positive control of Enp1.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) In their previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faza et al 2012</xref>) the Panse group show that at 37 °C, slx9Δ yeast cells grow almost like wild type with restoration of 40S subunit export. How do the authors square this apparent paradox with the findings reported in the current manuscript? Do cells carrying the slx9-1 allele also show restoration of 40S export at 37 °C? Are the proposed “weak” binding events such as the Rio2-Crm1 interaction temperature-dependent?</p><p>2) How does the proposed role of Slx9 in Crm1-mediated nuclear export relate to the previously reported role of Slx9 in ITS1 pre-rRNA processing (Bax et al RNA 2006)? This previous work has not been referenced and should be discussed in the text.</p><p>3) I am a little confused by the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, the authors claim that the interaction between GST-Slx9-1 and His6-Ran<sup>QL</sup>GTP is reduced compared with wild type GST-Slx9. However, to my eye, there seems to be less GST-Slx9-1 compared with GST-Slx9. Indeed, in contrast with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, Slx9 and Slx9-1 seem to bind similarly to Ran<sup>QL</sup>GTP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. Is this apparent difference in Slx9-1-Ran<sup>QL</sup>GTP binding due to the presence of Rio2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>?</p><p>4) There is a lot of discussion in the text about “weak” (Rio2) and “strong” (Nmd3) NES sequences in Crm1-mediated export. Can the authors define this more quantitatively.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> the authors report that slx9-1 localizes to the nucleolus, like the wild-type protein but they claim that it blocks export, evidenced by accumulation of pre-40S markers in the nucleoplasm. If Slx9-1 loads onto particles but prevents their recruitment, its localization should be coincident with the pre-40S markers. How do the authors explain this discrepancy?</p><p>6) The authors identified <italic>slx9-1</italic> as a loss of function mutant and showed that it had reduced interaction with Ran-GTP. In light of that, it is surprising that it appears to bind more tightly to Rio2 and recruit higher levels of Ran-GTP. How can this be explained?</p><p>7) The authors should explain what the biophysical property of GGG is and how they imagine this will affect the presentation of the NES. What do they mean that the GGG mutant “destabilizes” the NES?</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> is intended to show that Slx9-1 interacts more strongly than Slx9 (i.e., lane 6 versus 2, respectively). While this is apparent on the immunoblot, inspection of the stained gel reveals little if any difference. Similarly, the input lanes show Slx9 and Slx9-1 at seemingly equal levels on the stained gel, yet give clearly different signals by immunoblot. This raises the somewhat worrisome possibility that differences see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> (and elsewhere) are a blotting artifact, which is remarkably common when comparing proteins that migrate differently or are mutated. Such potential discrepancies are worth clarifying.</p><p>9) In the subsection “Slx9 acts as a scaffold to load Crm1 onto the Rio2-NES”, the authors state that the RanGTP binding site of Slx9 plays a role in recruiting Crm1, but the basis for this claim is not clear given that the authors do not know what/where the RanGTP binding site is on Slx9.</p><p>10) I am not sure what the basis of the ‘stepwise assembly’ claim is. I realize they have often biochemically performed the reactions in a certain order, but given the various pairwise interactions that are shown in the paper, I cannot see how an order is forthcoming (beyond Crm1 arriving last). The authors should either provide a clear rationale for a specific assembly order, or remain more agnostic on the issue.</p><p>11) The authors make a number of statements regarding kinetic parameters such as cooperativity, but I fail to see how many of these claims can be supported on the basis of relatively qualitative GST-pulldown assays.</p><p>12) Words such as ‘unexpectedly’ are not all that useful in the Abstract since it is unclear what was unexpected or why, without further explanation. In general, I struggled with the repeated claims of novelty and non-canonical mechanisms when the concept appeared to this reader as a variation on that seen with RanBP3/Yrb2. A less exaggerated tone seems preferable, although I realise different authors will have different writing styles.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05745.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>This manuscript describes the largely uncharacterized protein Slx9 as a cofactor for Crm1-mediated nuclear export of pre-40S subunits.

Some suggestions are provided in the comments below</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their thorough and fair comments. We have tried to address these three points.</p><p><italic>1) In the subsection “Recruitment of Crm1 to Rio2:RanGTP is stimulated by Slx9”, the statement “…a Rio2:Slx9 complex was able to recruit RanGTP, suggesting that Slx9 employs distinct surfaces to bind these two proteins” cannot be supported strongly based on the data.

Alternatively, a well-controlled and quantitative titration of Slx9 to show that it does not inhibit the binding of Ran-GTP could also argue against mutually exclusive binding</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers, and have done titrations as suggested. Specifically, we added increasing amounts of RanGTP to a preformed saturated GST-Rio2:Slx9 (or GST-Slx9:Rio2) complex. RanGTP is efficiently recruited to both GST-Rio2:Slx9 and GST-Sxl9:Rio2 complexes. Further, RanGTP binding did not displace Slx9 from the GST-Rio2:Slx9 complex (or Rio2 from GST-Slx9:Rio2). These data are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>.</p><p>In addition to these experiments, we believe that two different observations strongly support the notion for distinct binding surfaces:</p><p>1. Although Rio2 can bind RanGTP or Slx9 on its own, neither the GST-Rio2:RanGTP complex nor the GST-Rio2:Slx9 complex is competent to recruit Crm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lane 4 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lane 4). Only an immobilized GST-Rio2 that is sequentially treated with Slx9 and RanGTP can recruit Crm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lane 8).</p><p>2. The GST-Rio2<sup>3G</sup> mutant is unable to cooperatively bind to Crm1 and RanGTP, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lane 4). Only when GST-Rio2<sup>3G</sup> is sequentially treated with Slx9 and then RanGTP, the resultant GST-Rio2<sup>3G</sup>:Slx9:RanGTP complex is now competent to recruit Crm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, lane 4).</p><p>Together these data support the idea that GST-Rio2:Slx9:RanGTP form a complex.</p><p><italic>2) Subsection “Recruitment of Crm1 to Rio2:RanGTP is stimulated by Slx9”: From data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>the authors claim that Slx9 promotes the formation of a complex containing Rio2, Ran-GTP and Crm1.

The same components appear to be present in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref> <italic>lane 4 but now we do not see Crm1 binding. What accounts for this difference? This is an important point as it underpins the conclusion that Slx9 acts in a non-canonical fashion</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is confusing. As the reviewers correctly points out, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 4, Crm1 and excess RanGTP were added simultaneously to GST-Rio2. In this experiment, Rio2, RanGTP and Crm1 form a trimeric complex through a cooperative mechanism. In the absence of Crm1, RanGTP shows a weaker binding to Rio2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 2).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, the experimental setup is different (summarized in the flow chart, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In a first step, RanGTP is added to GST-Rio2 and then unbound protein is washed away. Again, we observed binding to RanGTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lane 2 and 3), in agreement with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Then, in a second step, Crm1 is incubated with a preformed GST-Rio2:RanGTP complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lane 4). However, because Crm1 is added in the absence of excess of RanGTP, no Crm1 binding is observed. Thus, presenting Crm1 to a Rio2:RanGTP complex in an ordered fashion does not allow cooperative binding. In this stepwise mechanism, Slx9 aids Crm1 recruitment to the GST-Rio2:Slx9:RanGTP complex by optimally presenting the Rio2-NES and RanGTP.</p><p>We have altered the discussion of this data to make this distinction more clear.</p><p><italic>3) The defective interaction between Slx9-1 and RanGTP should be analyzed biophysically to directly compare it to Slx9 (e.g., measurement of Kd values and ideally, on and off rates). The GST pulldown is rather qualitative and the modest difference in recovery observed in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref> <italic>(which is not entirely convincing) cannot easily explain why this mutation essentially phenocopies a Slx9∆ strain. As this mutant is used for several key points in the paper, its characterization would appear to be important</italic>.</p><p>We attempted two quantitative assays, as described above: ITC and SPR. Unfortunately, these experiments were unsuccessful due to technical issues. Specifically, we were unable to attain the necessary concentrations of Slx9 and RanGTP required for ITC due to aggregation, and Slx9 displayed non-specific interactions with immobilized GST that is required to immobilize RanGTP on the surface of the SPR chip. Instead, we have quantified the binding experiment between Slx9 (or Slx9-1) and RanGTP from four independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Specifically, we have normalized the RanGTP Western signal to the amount of GST-Slx9 and GST-Slx9-1 in the Coomassie-stained gel above. These quantifications confirm that GST-Slx9-1 is impaired in RanGTP binding compared to Slx9 (approximately 50% decrease). Although this is not a definitive method to measure affinity, we hope that the review agrees that the 50% reduction in binding is modest. We have tried to clarify this in the text, in the subsection headed “Slx9-1 is impaired in binding Ran<sup>QL</sup>GTP”.</p><p>We apologize for the confusion regarding the <italic>slx9-1</italic> mutant phenotype. Two different complexes (outlined below) containing Slx9-1 were impaired in recruiting Crm1 in vitro. This defect is far more pronounced than the defect in Slx9-1 binding to RanGTP and, we believe that this is the major determinant of the Slx9-1 phenotype in vivo.</p><p>1) Slx9-1 is impaired in recruiting Crm1 to the GST-Rio2:Slx9-1:RanGTP complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, compare lane 5 to lane 9).</p><p>2) The Rio2<sup>3G</sup> mutant is unable to cooperatively bind to Crm1 and RanGTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lane 4). Only when bound to Slx9 and RanGTP it is now able to efficiently recruit Crm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, lane 4). Consistent with the role of Slx9 in optimally presenting the Rio2-NES to Crm1, the GST-Rio2<sup>3G</sup>:Slx9-1:RanGTP complex is unable to bind Crm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, compare lane 1 and 2). This additional experiment further supports the idea that Slx9 promotes Crm1 recruitment to the GST-Rio2<sup>3G</sup>:Slx9:RanGTP complex.</p><p><italic>4) The data presented that FAM207A is indeed the human Slx9 homolog as stated (Figure 2–figure supplement 2) is not entirely convincing. The distribution and evolutionary conservation of the Slx9 proteins has not been reported to date. Indeed, it was previously suggested that Slx9 homologs are limited to yeast species (Bax et al RNA 2006). After one referee performed some limited multiple sequence alignments between putative vertebrate FAM207A homologs and the</italic> pombe <italic>and</italic> cerevisiae <italic>Slx9 proteins, he/she did not find the level of amino acid conservation convincing. Particularly in view of the previous report (Bax et al), the authors should show evidence for the phylogenetic distribution and amino acid conservation of the Slx9 proteins beyond yeast. Related to this, the authors show that FAM207A binds Ran</italic><sup><italic>QL</italic></sup><italic>GTP in vitro. However, this observation in isolation is not convincing since cofractionation with ribosomes or requirement for 40S subunit export are not analyzed. The authors should either be more cautious about the claim that FAM207A is the functional human Slx9 homolog or more robustly support this conclusion</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers and have removed the data concerning FAM207A from the manuscript. We originally chose FAM207A (also called C21orf70) as the potential human homolog of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Slx9 because it is listed as the human homologue for <italic>S. pombe</italic> Slx9 in PomBase database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pombase.org/spombe/result/SPAPB21F2.03">http://www.pombase.org/spombe/result/SPAPB21F2.03</ext-link>). In addition, FAM207A interacts with pre-ribosomal particles and is impaired in pre-40S export (Wyler et al., 2011 RNA). However, we have also been unable to align <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Slx9 and human FAM207A with any significance, and share the doubt that these two are not true functional homologues.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the authors must rule out that newly synthesized protein does not account for the apparent shuttling of Slx9. Notably, the signal for Slx9 in the recipient nucleus seems less than that for the positive control of Enp1.</italic></p><p>We have repeated the heterokaryon assay in presence of 50 µM cycloheximide which inhibits production of newly synthesized Slx9 protein. These data show that Slx9-GFP shuttles between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the difference in recipient nuclear signal, we suspect that there are two pools of Slx9, only one of which can shuttle. <italic>SLX9</italic> interacts genetically with <italic>SGS1</italic>, which encodes a nucleolar DNA helicase that prevents genomic instability (Ooi et al., Nature Genetics 2003). This additional nucleolar role could explain why there is only partial transfer of Slx9-GFP to the recipient nucleus. This additional role could also explain the primarily (though not exclusively) nucleolar localization of Slx9 and Slx9-1.</p><p><italic>Minor comments:</italic></p><p><italic>1) In their previous paper (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17"><italic>Faza et al 2012</italic></xref><italic>) the Panse group show that at 37 °C, slx9Δ yeast cells grow almost like wild type with restoration of 40S subunit export. How do the authors square this apparent paradox with the findings reported in the current manuscript? Do cells carrying the slx9-1 allele also show restoration of 40S export at 37 °C? Are the proposed “weak” binding events such as the Rio2-Crm1 interaction temperature-dependent</italic>?</p><p>Like the <italic>slx9∆</italic> mutant, the <italic>slx9-1</italic> allele also grows normally at 37°C and is also not impaired in the nuclear export of 40S pre-ribosomes. Indeed, this “cold-sensitive” phenotype is relatively common among ribosome synthesis factor mutants. We currently do not understand the basis of the temperature dependence, or whether the binding between Rio2 and Crm1 is temperature-dependent in vivo or, for example, whether ribosome export becomes less dependent on Rio2 at high temperatures. For completeness, we have now added the 37°C growth panel to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) How does the proposed role of Slx9 in Crm1-mediated nuclear export relate to the previously reported role of Slx9 in ITS1 pre-rRNA processing (Bax et al RNA 2006)? This previous work has not been referenced and should be discussed in the text.</italic></p><p>We apologize for the oversight and have now included this important reference in the Discussion. However, we believe that our data are compatible with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bax et al, 2006</xref> RNA and that the ITS1 pre-rRNA processing defect caused by Slx9 depletion could be a secondary consequence of the primary defect in export, since the growth and the pre-40S export defect of the <italic>slx9∆</italic> mutant can be rescued by low copy overexpression of an additional export factor Mex67-Mtr2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faza et al, 2012</xref> PLOS Genetics).</p><p><italic>3) I am a little confused by the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C</italic></xref><italic>. In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref><italic>, the authors claim that the interaction between GST-Slx9-1 and His6-Ran</italic><sup><italic>QL</italic></sup><italic>GTP is reduced compared with wild type GST-Slx9. However, to my eye, there seems to be less GST-Slx9-1 compared with GST-Slx9. Indeed, in contrast with</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref><italic>, Slx9 and Slx9-1 seem to bind similarly to Ran</italic><sup><italic>QL</italic></sup><italic>GTP in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C</italic></xref><italic>. Is this apparent difference in Slx9-1-Ran</italic><sup><italic>QL</italic></sup><italic>GTP binding due to the presence of Rio2 in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C</italic></xref>?</p><p>The reviewers are correct that these data are somewhat somehow confusing. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, pull down of RanGTP by GST-Slx9 or GST-Slx9-1 is shown, and Slx9-1 has a modestly reduced interaction compared to Slx9. We have resolved the issue with loading of GST-Slx9 vs. GST-Slx9-1 by quantification of four independent experiments (presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Specifically, we have normalized the RanGTP signal in the Western blot to the amount of GST-Slx9 and GST-Slx9-1 in the Coomassie-stained gel above. These quantifications confirm that GST-Slx9-1 is impaired in RanGTP binding compared to Slx9 (approximately 50% decrease). Although this is not a definitive method to measure affinity, we hope that the review agrees that the 50% reduction in binding is modest.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, the immobilized protein is GST-Rio2, which has been pre-loaded with either Slx9 or Slx9-1. In this experiment, as pointed out by the reviewers, RanGTP binds equally well to both complexes. However, the complex containing GST-Rio2/Slx9-1/RanGTP is impaired in recruiting Crm1. Therefore, the reviewers are correct in that the difference between these two experiments is the presence of Rio2, which can also bind RanGTP on its own.</p><p><italic>4) There is a lot of discussion in the text about “weak” (Rio2) and “strong” (Nmd3) NES sequences in Crm1-mediated export. Can the authors define this more quantitatively</italic>.</p><p>The difference in NES strength is based on the ability of Crm1 to bind the NES sequence (even without RanGTP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engelsma et al., 2004</xref> EMBO J). This interaction was shown to correlate with sequence similarity to a consensus NES sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engelsma et al., 2004</xref> EMBO J), and has been shown to correlate with affinity for Crm1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kutay &amp; Güttinger, 2005</xref> TIBS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Güttler et al., 2010</xref> NSMB). We have altered the text both to include this historical categorization as well as acknowledged the prior work, and we apologize for the oversight.</p><p><italic>5) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>the authors report that slx9-1 localizes to the nucleolus, like the wild-type protein but they claim that it blocks export, evidenced by accumulation of pre-40S markers in the nucleoplasm. If Slx9-1 loads onto particles but prevents their recruitment, its localization should be coincident with the pre-40S markers. How do the authors explain this discrepancy</italic>?</p><p>Slx9 interacts genetically with a nucleolar DNA helicase, Sgs1 that prevents genomic instability (Ooi et al, Nature Genetics 2003). This additional role which would be strictly nucleolar, would be consistent with the primarily (though not exclusively) nucleolar localization of Slx9 and Slx9-1.</p><p><italic>6) The authors identified</italic> slx9-1 <italic>as a loss of function mutant and showed that it had reduced interaction with Ran-GTP. In light of that, it is surprising that it appears to bind more tightly to Rio2 and recruit higher levels of Ran-GTP. How can this be explained</italic>?</p><p>The reviewers are correct that, in the context of Rio2, Slx9-1 binds Ran-GTP more efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Our statement that Slx9-1 is impaired in RanGTP binding stems from the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, which is a pull down of RanGTP using GST-Slx9 or GST-Slx9-1, which were performed in the absence of Rio2.</p><p>We do observe that Slx9-1 binds more strongly to Rio2 than Slx9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 6). In addition, the GST-Rio2:Slx9-1 complex appears to bind more strongly to RanGTP than the GST-Rio2:Slx9 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 7). However, we also observe that Rio2 alone also binds RanGTP (eg. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lane 2). Since, in these experiments, there are two potential RanGTP binding sites (one on Slx9 and one on Rio2), it is difficult to conclude anything regarding the affinity between Slx9/Sxl9-1 and RanGTP in these pull downs.</p><p><italic>7) The authors should explain what the biophysical property of GGG is and how they imagine this will affect the presentation of the NES. What do they mean that the GGG mutant “destabilizes” the NES?</italic></p><p>We apologize for the oversight for not explaining the use of glycine mutants clearly. Because glycine residues lack a side chain, they allow greater conformational flexibility for the polypeptide backbone of these residues (Ramachandran G N, Sasisekharan V, 1968 Adv Protein Chem) as well as to the neighboring NES, thus destabilizing it. Therefore, introduction of glycines are expected to lower the affinity of an NES for Crm1 by locally disturbing the secondary structure that is important to orient and insert the residues of the NES into the hydrophobic pockets of Crm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Güttler et al., 2010</xref> NSMB). A short explanation has now been included in the text.</p><p><italic>8)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C</italic></xref> <italic>is intended to show that Slx9-1 interacts more strongly than Slx9 (i.e., lane 6 versus 2, respectively). While this is apparent on the immunoblot, inspection of the stained gel reveals little if any difference. Similarly, the input lanes show Slx9 and Slx9-1 at seemingly equal levels on the stained gel, yet give clearly different signals by immunoblot. This raises the somewhat worrisome possibility that differences see in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref> <italic>(and elsewhere) are a blotting artifact, which is remarkably common when comparing proteins that migrate differently or are mutated. Such potential discrepancies are worth clarifying</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that there is a slightly stronger signal for Slx9-1 in the Western blot. We have analyzed the differences by carefully running equalized samples of the two proteins, and this difference is small, but present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>). However, whether Slx9-1 binds slightly better to GST-Rio2 in vitro or to the pre-ribosomal particle (Enp1-TAP) in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) does not change the major conclusion of our experiments: Slx9-1 is expressed <italic>in vivo</italic> and recruited to the 40S pre-ribosome. Therefore, we have altered the description of the interaction studies to say that Slx9-1 binds at least as well as the wild-type.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05745.017</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Comparison of Coomassie staining and Western blot signals of Slx9 and Slx9-1 proteins. 0.5 µM Slx9 or 0.5 µM Slx9-1 were separated on SDS-PAGE (top panel) and either stained with Coomassie or detected by Western analysis with Slx9 antibody (lower panel).

However, our statement regarding the impaired binding is based on the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> (which shows that Slx9-1 on its own is impaired in binding RanGTP as compared to wild-type Slx9) and the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, which shows that, although the Rio2: Slx9-1 complex can recruit RanGTP, the resulting complex is significantly impaired in recruit Crm1. Since this defect is not due to the interaction between Rio2 and Slx9-1, and because Slx9 does not interact with Crm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) we propose that the defect must stem from RanGTP binding by Slx9.</p><p><italic>10) I am not sure what the basis of the ‘stepwise assembly’ claim is. I realize they have often biochemically performed the reactions in a certain order, but given the various pairwise interactions that are shown in the paper, I cannot see how an order is forthcoming (beyond Crm1 arriving last). The authors should either provide a clear rationale for a specific assembly order, or remain more agnostic on the issue</italic>.</p><p>The stepwise assembly model that we favor is based on the <italic>in vitro</italic> interactions that we have identified and the cellular context in which these interactions must occur. Slx9 at steady state is localized to the nucleolus/nucleoplasm and Rio2 is nucleoplasmic/cytoplasmic (mainly cytoplasmic). Further, based on TAP purifications and Western analyses Slx9 is recruited to the earliest 40S pre-ribosome in the nucleolus. Once the pre-ribosome becomes nuclear Rio2 and RanGTP join, followed by Crm1.</p><p><italic>11) The authors make a number of statements regarding kinetic parameters such as cooperativity, but I fail to see how many of these claims can be supported on the basis of relatively qualitative GST-pulldown assays.</italic></p><p>Our use of the term “cooperativity” is based on previous studies, which have shown that the binding of RanGTP and the NES containing cargo to Crm1 is cooperative i.e. the affinity for each binding partner is increased in the presence of the other. For example as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>: The NES of SsbC does not bind Crm1 alone, but only in the presence of excess of RanGTP.</p><p>In this manuscript, we show that such a cooperative mechanism cannot be behind the recruitment of Crm1 to the Rio2-Slx9-RanGTP complex, since RanGTP and Crm1 are added in separate steps (so the affinity of the first protein can’t be improved by the presence of the second protein). Although we have been unable to perform more quantitative binding assays, our findings support a stepwise mechanism rather than cooperativity, and therefore we believe that these assays have merit.</p><p><italic>12) Words such as ‘unexpectedly’ are not all that useful in the Abstract since it is unclear what was unexpected or why, without further explanation. In general, I struggled with the repeated claims of novelty and non-canonical mechanisms when the concept appeared to this reader as a variation on that seen with RanBP3/Yrb2. A less exaggerated tone seems preferable, although I realise different authors will have different writing styles</italic>.</p><p>We have removed “unexpectedly” from the Abstract and altered the tone of the discussion as suggested by the reviewers.</p><p>We do not quite agree with the reviewers that the concept we are promoting is a variation to RanBP3/Yrb2 for the following reasons:</p><p>A) Yrb2 binds RanGTP and Crm1 in a cooperative manner and then the complex is presented to the NES containing cargo. In our case, Slx9 binds RanGTP and the NES containing cargo, and this complex is able to recruit Crm1 directly.</p><p>B) Yrb2 functions by populating the strained Crm1:RanGTP bound conformation that favors NES binding. Here, we present different mutational studies that suggest that within the Rio2:Slx9:RanGTP complex, Slx9 optimally orients the NES and improves its affinity for Crm1. For example, Rio2<sup>3G</sup> mutant is unable to cooperatively bind Crm1 and RanGTP is able to do so, when in complex with Slx9.</p></body></sub-article></article>
