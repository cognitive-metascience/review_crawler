A part of the brain at the back of the head, called the cerebellum, is organised into particularly well-defined modules and is important for fine-tuning and learning new movements. However, it is not clear if the pattern of connections between modules in the brain is broadly the same across different animals from the same species, or if it varies between individuals. This is partly because it has not been possible to identify the same cells across different individual animals, and thus measure whether the connections are different.</p><p>Valera et al. used genetically engineered mice that produced a fluorescent marker in specific subsets of easily identifiable neurons in the cerebellum known as Purkinje cells. These groups of labeled Purkinje cells helped identify the boundaries of modules in the cerebellum. Valera et al. then stimulated another group of neurons, called the granule cells, that connect to Purkinje cells from several different modules. Measuring the resulting changes in the electrical activity of the Purkinje cells revealed the pattern of connections between these two types of neurons. These experiments showed that granule cells can connect Purkinje cells from distant modules and that neighbouring Purkinje cells often display similar connection patterns.</p><p>Valera et al. also found that Purkinje cells from different animals but at the same location in the cerebellum had similar patterns of connections with granule cells. This suggests that, in identified modules, there is little variability in connection patterns between individuals. However, the patterns of connectivity could be altered by processes related to learning, indicating that they can be organized in different ways and still work. Further experiments then showed that different individuals display consistent patterns of connectivity between granule cells and other major cell types in the cerebellum. This finding suggests that while the basic modules in the cerebellum are similar across different individuals, the connections between modules can be shaped by experience.</p><p>An important challenge for the future is now to understand how the connected modules combine the information they receive and drive the output of the cerebellum. This knowledge will help better describe how movements are controlled.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09862.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09862.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>module</kwd><kwd>purkinje cell</kwd><kwd>granule cell</kwd><kwd>zebrin</kwd><kwd>microcircuit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valera</surname><given-names>Antoine M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRM 2014 DEQ20140329514</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isope</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2010-JCJC-1403-1 MicroCer</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isope</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European funds for Regional Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FEDER, #A31</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isope</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-13-SAMA-0010-01 CERBAIS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isope</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functional synaptic organization in the cerebellar cortex is stereotyped and associates distant modules through parallel fibers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Long-range connectivity between brain areas and the basic organization of microcircuits has been widely studied in many brain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shepherd and Grillner, 2010</xref>). However, the synaptic connectivity at the mesoscale level, that is, the precise functional synaptic arrangement between cortical modules, has been described in few brain areas since module boundaries are often ill defined. In the rodent barrel cortex and visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Callaway and Katz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briggs and Callaway, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shepherd et al., 2003</xref>), anatomical modules contain a wide array of neuronal types that interconnect within complex neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harris and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cossell et al., 2015</xref>) and reveal inter-modular communication that might influence the output of individual modules (e.g. see multi-whisker stimuli; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Estebanez et al., 2012</xref>). However, whether neighboring modules strictly follow the same functional and cellular organization rules or display subtle differences in local architecture or neurochemical expression that determine module-specific function or processing rules is not established.</p><p>In the cerebellar cortex, where anatomical modules are well defined and are associated with different features of motor control, the crystalline structure of the cortex initially led to the concept that different functions arose through distinct patterns of input/output connectivity as observed in the barrel cortex with a given vibrissa targeting one specific barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ito, 1984</xref>). However, much anatomical and functional evidence suggests that cerebellar modules consist of an array of microcircuits, each of which has a specific identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scott, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lange et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brochu et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dehnes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mateos et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sarna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Cerebellar modules are defined by the topographical organization of climbing fiber (CF) inputs to Purkinje cells (PCs), originating in the inferior olive, and PC to cerebellar nuclei connections. Olivo-cortical and cortico-nuclear projections delimit parasagittal zones and subzones of the cerebellar cortex called ‘microzones’ having similar CF receptive fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oscarsson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Voogd and Glickstein, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sugihara and Shinoda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Voogd and Ruigrok, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buisseret-Delmas and Angaut, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Voogd, 1967</xref>). Thus, a microzone corresponds to the cortical element of a cerebellar module. PCs from a given microzone receive and integrate information from specific parts of the body and project to restricted areas of the cerebellar nuclei, which in turn send the cerebellar computation to the cerebral cortex, brainstem or spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Voogd and Glickstein, 1998</xref>). The complete olivo-cortico-nuclear loop defines the cerebellar module (Figure 1A; Figure 1—figure supplement 1; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ruigrok, 2011</xref>). Mossy fiber (MF) inputs, the second major excitatory pathway of the cerebellum, partially overlap with the receptive fields of CFs when originating from the same body part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garwicz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pijpers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Voogd et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, it has been suggested that the cerebellar cortex is subdivided into individual microzones each controlling a given set of muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apps and Garwicz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thach et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>Some boundaries between different microzones can be identified by a family of neurochemical markers, the zebrins, selectively expressed in PCs (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apps and Hawkes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brochu et al., 1990</xref>). The level of expression of some of these markers has been associated with specific synaptic properties and intracellular transduction pathways at the parallel fiber (PF)-PC or CF-PC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Paukert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cerminara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hawkes, 2014</xref>) leading to the description of different intrinsic properties of PCs and different rules for plasticity induction between zebrin positive and negative bands. Combined with the regional differences in the cytoarchitecture of the cerebellar cortex (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cerminara et al., 2015</xref>), these findings demonstrate that the cerebellar cortex is composed of an ensemble of heterogeneous modules. Therefore, an appealing hypothesis would be that cell identity relies on its position in the cerebellar cortex and that specific communication rules between neighboring microzones might arise from this anatomical and neurochemical heterogeneity.</p><p>Intermodular communication might involve granule cells (GCs), which relay the MF input within the cerebellar cortex. GCs have long transverse axons, the PFs, that make glutamatergic synapses with hundreds of PCs across several microzones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harvey and Napper, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thach et al., 1992</xref>). PFs could thus define an associative pathway that enables MF inputs from one original microzone to communicate with a distant one. Paradoxically, several studies have shown that PCs are excited by a unique set of GCs localized in the same microzone as themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen and Yarom, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bower and Woolston, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown and Bower, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Isope and Barbour, 2002</xref>). These results suggest that local GCs provide the major input to PCs and that the majority of GC-PC synapses are silent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ekerot and Jorntell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Isope and Barbour, 2002</xref>). In contrast, other studies demonstrated that PCs can be driven by a restricted subset of GCs belonging to a different microzone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ekerot and Jörntell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dean et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jörntell and Ekerot, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ekerot and Jorntell, 2001</xref>). Finally, recent studies have suggested that PCs can be excited by a broad range of GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Walter et al., 2009</xref>) and that feedforward inhibition through the MF-GC-molecular interneuron pathway might play a role in the restriction of receptive fields in PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cramer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Santamaria et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, this wide range of functional connectivity might explain the regional differences in information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cramer et al., 2013</xref>) underpinned by the molecular and cellular heterogeneity between individual microzones and by the specific topographical organization of MF and CF inputs in the cerebellar cortex.</p><p>We therefore investigated the functional synaptic organization of the excitatory MF-GC-PC pathway. In order to understand how information is processed in individual and adjacent microzones, we systematically mapped the functional synaptic organization between GC and PCs, molecular interneurons (MLIs) and Golgi cells (GoCs), targeting one set of identified cortical microzones in cerebellar modules of lobules III and IV of the anterior lobe. We describe here an activity-dependent stereotyped and predictable modular organization of GC inputs mediated by PFs, which pinpoints the operational rules of information processing in cerebellar modules.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Targeting microzones in acute cerebellar slices</title><p>In order to address the hypothesis of specific functional synaptic communication between cerebellar microzones, we developed an experimental protocol that allowed us to target microzones in the medial parts of lobules III and IV, which receive inputs from the proximal hindlimb and forelimb. This region of the cortex is involved in the adaptive control of posture and locomotion; also, CF and MF inputs have already been well described in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ji and Hawkes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Voogd and Ruigrok, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sugihara and Shinoda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garwicz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson and Oscarsson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matsushita et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matsushita and Tanami, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matsushita, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yaginuma and Matsushita, 1987</xref>). Microzones are defined by their CF and cortico-nuclear projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson and Oscarsson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oscarsson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Voogd and Ruigrok, 2004</xref>). Since CF projections share common boundaries with the zebrin II pattern of expression in PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apps and Hawkes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sugihara and Shinoda, 2004</xref>), experiments were performed in the EAAT4-GFP strain of mice, in which zebrin II bands are defined by the expression of eGFP in PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gincel et al., 2007</xref>). The use of two distinct specific antibodies against zebrin II/aldolase C (Materials and methods) confirmed that EAAT4-eGFP mice express GFP in zebrin II bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). By comparing EAAT4-eGFP/zebrin II expression and cortico-nuclear projections, we postulated that seven putative microzones extend to the P2<sup>+</sup> band on both sides of the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>So that the description of the cerebellar afferents could be completed, bilateral MF projections were reconstructed after the in vivo unilateral injection of AAV2/1-GFP viruses (N = 4 animals) or fluoro-ruby (N = 2 animals) into the external cuneate nucleus, which relays inputs from the forelimbs, or AAV2/1-GFP viruses into the lumbar spinal cord (L3–L5; N = 1 animal), which conveys inputs from the hindlimbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; Materials and methods). Projections from these two precerebellar nuclei were mutually exclusive in lobules III and IV, identifying an alternation of two to three parasagittal bands (mean width = 193 ± 24 µm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>; n = 13 slices, N = 4 animals for cuneate projections; n = 4 slices, N = 1 animal for spinal projections) in the mediolateral axis. Intensity plot profiles of GFP labeling in the GC layer (Materials and methods) allowed us to determine the boundaries of individual MF bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Notably, when measuring the GFP level of expression, 22% of cuneate projections were found in the contralateral vermis, illustrating the importance of bilateral MF inputs. Interestingly, the comparison of the zebrin II pattern with MF inputs identified overlapping parasagittal bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ji and Hawkes, 1994</xref>) with one shared boundary at the P2<sup>+</sup>/P2<sup>−</sup> transition. Also, MF inputs subdivided the P1<sup>−</sup> band into smaller regions. Finally, CF and MF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) inputs delimit 13 regions having a unique combination of inputs between P2<sup>+</sup><sub>ipsi</sub> and P2<sup>+</sup><sub>contra</sub>. These regions might therefore correspond to smaller processing units than microzones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ozden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsutsumi et al., 2015</xref>). Using this anatomical description, we then targeted individual microzones in acute transverse cerebellar slices, and determined the spatial organization of GC excitatory inputs to PCs, GoCs and MLIs.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09862.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of anatomical cortical microzones by the zebrin II bands (<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of two cerebellar modules.</title><p>One module is composed of a cortical microzone (light red area), the target area of Purkinje cells (PC, red) in the cerebellar nuclei (black and white cells) and a group of olivary cells (gray) sending their climbing fibers (CF, gray line) to the cortical microzones and cerebellar nuclei.

Individual PCs (n = 49 cells, N = 18 animals) were whole-cell patch-clamped in P1<sup>+</sup>, P1<sup>−</sup> and P2<sup>+</sup> zebrin II bands of EAAT4-GFP mice, and RuBi-glutamate was systematically uncaged in the GC layer using point-scan laser photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; width mapped = 664 µm centered on the recorded cell; Materials and methods) on both sides of the midline while inhibitory transmission was blocked. As uncaging led to a compound synaptic current in PCs initiated by trains of action potentials in GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; Materials and methods), the efficacy of GC patches in eliciting synaptic current in PCs was assessed by calculating the mean synaptic charge expressed as a Z-score (Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). This representation allowed us to compare GC input maps between PCs with different background noise. Since MFs from the external cuneate and the spinal cord project to the entire depth of the granule cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), glutamate uncaging sites at various depths of the GC layer but at the same mediolateral position were pooled and the evoked maximal synaptic input was considered. This maximal response was used as an indicator of the connectivity strength between the GCs and the PC along the mediolateral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>). Interestingly, patterns of GC inputs in PCs were found to be highly heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), with dense local inputs (mean local charge = 10.3 ± 13.8 pC, n = 49) and silent sites, that is, no GC patch had a Z-score &gt; 3.09 at any depth of the GC layer (38% of sites were silent; Z-score &lt; 3.09; Materials and methods). Remotely connected GC patches separated by silent sites were always found and were also frequently observed on contralateral sites (mean charge in distant patches = 6.1 ± 8.8 pC. Mean distance from the local peak = 215 ± 86 µm). In five cells out of 49, no obvious local inputs were observed although distal inputs were present. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that while local GCs make a strong connection with PCs most of the time, exceptions may occur. Also, GCs located at several hundred micrometers from the recorded PC can make strong connections via their PFs, while neighboring patches can be silent, indicating that information originating in distant microzones can have a strong influence on a given PC.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09862.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Granule cell input patterns to Purkinje cells reveal hotspots of connectivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design and simplified diagram of the cortical microcircuit.

Also, a single group of GCs is unlikely to influence a microzone by targeting a single PC. Therefore, if microzones communicate together via the PFs, PCs belonging to a given microzone should share several groups of functionally connected GCs from a distant microzone. We tested this hypothesis by recording pairs of neighboring PCs having the same zebrin identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and determined their connectivity map.

PCs were grouped based on their position in the mediolateral axis between the P1<sup>+</sup> and P2<sup>+</sup> bands of lobule III/IV (group width = 100 µm; shift between two groups = 10 µm; N = 49 PCs from 18 mice; Materials and methods). In each PC group, the median pattern was determined (Materials and methods) and correlated with the median pattern of all the other groups of PCs. A correlation matrix was then built using the Pearson coefficient (r) as a marker of correlation between GC input patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; Materials and methods). Strikingly, the correlation matrix revealed four clusters of PC groups displaying a highly correlated GC connectivity map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; clusters 1–4). Cluster identity was verified using a spectral co-clustering algorithm that simultaneously clusters rows and columns of a matrix without positional assumption (Materials and methods). The four clusters found were all centered on the diagonal line indicating that correlated PCs are neighbors. They are identified on the correlation matrix by dashed blue squares (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These results strongly argue that PCs from different animals but at the same specific location in the mediolateral axis (i.e. the vermal part of lobule III/IV) have selected similar GC sites. Notably, none of these clusters clearly matches with a set of anatomical boundaries as illustrated by the comparison with zebrin II bands and MF inputs from the external cuneate and the spinal cord (green rectangles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) indicating that boundaries of the functional organization between microzones differ from a pure anatomical description.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09862.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Granule cell input patterns to Purkinje cells from different animals define stereotyped clusters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Correlation matrix of groups of neighboring Purkinje cells (PCs; N = 49 cells in 18 animals). Each group corresponds to the median granule cell (GC) input pattern of PCs located within a 100 µm window.

PCs defining cluster 1 displayed strong connections with local GCs and GCs located below ipsilateral and contralateral P2<sup>+</sup> but did not display any inputs from a large part of contralateral P1<sup>−</sup>. The P2<sup>+</sup>/P2<sup>−</sup> boundary also clearly identifies limits for cluster 2 that is characterized by weak local inputs. Also, in this group of PCs, a narrow contralateral band of GCs located 200 µm from the midline was always strongly connected. Contrasting with these two clusters, PCs that extend between 200 and 270 µm from the midline (cluster 3) were found to be broadly and strongly connected ipsilaterally by GCs spanning all zebrin positive and negative bands. Finally, PCs from the fourth cluster, located essentially in P2<sup>+</sup>, were contacted by local GCs and GCs located in medial P1<sup>−</sup> and P2<sup>−</sup> bands. As for the four identified clusters of correlated PCs, no systematic link between GC hotspots and anatomical boundaries has been observed. However, it should be noted that for all PC groups, strong GC connections were always found in ipsilateral P2<sup>+</sup> while a large area of the P1<sup>−</sup> band was silent. These findings showed that the highly heterogeneous patterns of GC connectivity are stereotyped and associated with four identified clusters of PCs, suggesting that a distinct functional organization linking distant regions might be superimposed on the anatomical microzonal framework.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>GC input patterns to GoCs and MLIs</title><p>In the cerebellar cortex, GCs also contact local interneurons, MLIs and GoCs, which respectively perform feedforward inhibition onto local PCs and feedback inhibition onto GCs. We therefore tested whether GC connectivity patterns to GoCs and MLIs displayed similar spatial functional properties. GC inputs to GoCs were examined using GlyT2-EAAT4-GFP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; Materials and methods). As opposed to PCs, patches of GCs connected to GoCs (n = 19 cells) were always found in the vicinity of the recorded cell. Within the mapped area, we found that 81% of GC synaptic inputs to GoCs were made by local GCs as assessed by the histogram of the median Z-score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), for GoCs recorded in any of the four clusters of PCs identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since dendritic gap junctions might have shunted and filtered GC inputs located in distant apical GoC dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vervaeke et al., 2012</xref>), potentially resulting in undetectable current at the soma, one subset of GoCs (n = 6) was recorded with the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone (100 µM) in the bath. No differences were observed in these mappings, and all cells were pooled. The pattern of GC inputs was centered on GoCs with a mean extension of 114.1 ± 70.1 µm, which falls within the average range of the reconstructed GoC axonal plexus (214 ± 30 µm, n = 10; inset <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Neither the connectivity map nor the extension of the axonal plexus were limited by zebrin boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) as opposed to GoC apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sillitoe et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, unlike GC inputs to PCs, excitatory inputs to a given GoC appear to be mostly restricted to GCs that can be targeted by the local axon of the same GoC, confirming that they implement a local inhibitory feedback circuit in the GC layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cesana et al., 2013</xref>).

Similarly to GC-PC and GC-GoC connectivity, local GC inputs were identified. However, several patches of distant GC connections were also found in the histogram of the median Z-score of synaptic events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; local peak, 80 µm from midline, two ipsilateral peaks, 195 µm and 320 µm from midline, and one contralateral peak, 135 µm from midline).

The initial averaged map was then compared site by site to the averaged updated map following stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6A-figure supplement 1</xref>). After plasticity induction, 86 sites (22%; n = 8 cells) displayed a significant modification in synaptic charge (△Z-score &gt; 3.09 or &lt; −3.09; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6A-figure supplement 1</xref>; Materials and methods), while no effect was observed in the remaining sites. As already observed, this protocol induced postsynaptic LTP (green squares, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coesmans et al., 2004</xref>) or LTD (blue squares, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hartell, 1996</xref>) at the GC-PC synapse, indicating that we stimulated different PF beams converging on the recorded PC. All these changes were blocked by a combination of drugs that prevented the induction of plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). A negative correlation was observed (slope 0.31 and r = 0.38) between the initial synaptic weight of the GC site (high Z-score) and the sign of the effect after induction, with stronger connections leading to LTD while weaker connections undergo LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, selecting strong connections (Z-score &gt; 6.5) and determining the averaged time course for all these sites led to a mean depressed charge of 27% after plasticity induction. Conversely, of the 56 sites (14% of total sites) that were potentiated, 33 were silent in the initial map (white ‘x’ in green squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that previously undetectable synaptic connections were awakened and that the overall connectivity map can be modified by activity. Indeed, we compared the histograms of the median Z-score of charge of this set of PCs before and after plasticity induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Although a few percent of the total number of PFs crossing the dendritic tree of the PCs had been stimulated, a new distant region, initially silent, became significantly connected to the PCs belonging to cluster 1, demonstrating that the connectivity map is adjustable (see * in the panel ‘Difference’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Therefore, functional microzones may communicate through the selection of GC-PC synapses in a specific set of PC clusters.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09862.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Tunable maps of granule cell inputs to Purkinje cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Photostimulation grid superimposed on a reconstructed slice before (top) and after (bottom) the long-term synaptic plasticity induction protocol (300 stimulations at 1 Hz). The stimulation pipette was positioned in the molecular layer far from the recorded Purkinje cell (PC).

Hotspots were frequently observed at several hundred micrometers from the recorded PC or MLI. At first glance, these findings appear to be in contradiction with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harvey and Napper, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Walter et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Walter et al. (2009)</xref> demonstrated that GC inputs are evenly distributed in the mediolateral axis although local connections were slightly stronger. However, as patterns of GC inputs were aligned on PC somas, positional information could not be considered in this study. Indeed, removing the positional information from our dataset reproduced these findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the identification of the organization of GC input patterns is position specific. Therefore, whether we define a microzone by the topography of the CF inputs or the combination of CF and MF inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), our results strongly argue that PFs communicate excitatory MF information between distant microzones. Because inhibition was blocked in our experiments, we have to acknowledge that the GC input patterns of connectivity described here do not describe the net excitatory/inhibitory balance affecting PC dendrites. However, although no prediction about PC discharges can be made, the GC connectivity map onto MLIs observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> suggests that PCs can be potentially inhibited by GCs from specific locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Indeed, several studies demonstrated that feedforward inhibition participates in controlling the firing rate of PCs in individual microzones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dizon and Khodakhah, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Santamaria et al., 2007</xref>) and prevents the activation of distant PCs. Nonetheless, our data provide the first description of a conserved and predictable functional synaptic organization between one cortical layer – the granule cell layer – and the output stage of the cerebellar cortex – the Purkinje cell layer. The preferred organization of GC inputs to PCs and MLIs (in lobules III and IV of the anterior vermis) among different animals suggests that microzones may have specific roles in the context of the behavioral tasks associated with this cerebellar region, notably during adaptive locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apps and Garwicz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dean et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our results are in agreement with in vivo studies demonstrating that PCs are activated by a restricted group of distant GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ekerot and Jörntell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2003</xref>), although in these studies, local GC inputs were never observed. There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy: (1) the different areas of the cerebellum studied (i.e. the C3 zone rather than medial lobules III and IV) might have specific operational rules. Indeed, other groups studying other regions of the cerebellar cortex have demonstrated that local GCs provide the majority of inputs for the underlying PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bower and Woolston, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen and Yarom, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Isope and Barbour, 2002</xref>), for example in Crus I and II. Furthermore, in a recent in vivo study, while restricted patches of PC activation were observed in Crus II following forelimb stimulation, beam-like PC excitation elicited by PFs from distant GC inputs were identified in Crus I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cramer et al., 2013</xref>). (2) In vivo, the receptive fields were defined by modulation of the PC firing rate. This parameter could have been misleading since a null net effect could still have masked correlated modifications of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Notably, local GCs activate both PCs and MLIs in our experiments, suggesting that the resulting PC discharge is difficult to predict. In vivo, excitation or inhibition could be favored depending on the subset of GCs activated in a given context.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Tunable patterns of GC inputs</title><p>Because similar patterns of GC inputs to PCs, GoCs and MLIs were found in the different animals tested, a major issue was to assess whether this organization was the result of a genetically encoded developmental program or if it could be modified by activity. We demonstrated that PF stimulation could induce either LTD at individual sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hartell, 1996</xref>) or LTP at individual sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coesmans et al., 2004</xref>) indicating that activity-dependent processes can tune GC input maps. Such variability in the sign of the plasticity is due to the fact that the stimulation pipette sampled a limited set of PFs constituting a small proportion of the total number of PFs in the lobule, but belonging to many different GC patches. This explains why only 22% of GC patches were affected by plasticity. At the center of the stimulated PF beam, focal synaptic inputs to PC dendrites have likely evoked large calcium transients, similar to CF inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hartell, 1996</xref>), and thus induced LTD at these specific GC-PCs synapses. Focally evoked calcium transients could have been amplified at GC-PC synapses with a high synaptic weight, as stronger depolarization would have been elicited. Although focal stimulation in the molecular layer may appear non-physiological, a recent study demonstrated in vivo that sensory inputs can lead to clustered activation of PFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilms and Häusser, 2015</xref>). At the periphery of the stimulation beam, sparse activation of PFs might have induced moderate calcium transients leading to LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coesmans et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, new connections appeared systematically when we used a plasticity-inducing protocol at silent sites, demonstrating that quiescent synapses can be awakened following GC activation. These findings explain the appearance of a new peak of connected GCs in the median histogram of the Z-score of charges after plasticity induction. Indeed, plasticity occurred at almost every position in the mediolateral axis (see difference in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), but at silent sites a strong bias toward LTP was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because of the high efficiency of the stimulation protocol to awaken silent synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), a strong alteration of the GC connectivity map was likely to occur. Further experiments using specific MF stimulation will be required to assess whether such modifications in GC input maps are observed in physiological conditions. However, our results clearly demonstrate that the heterogeneity of the spatial map is an active process. These results are in agreement with previous in vivo studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jörntell and Ekerot, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schonewille et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badura et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that distant microzones are associated through PFs by LTP mechanisms. LTP could favor information transfer between a set of GCs from one microzone and a group of PCs from another microzone. Conversely, LTD, which is physiologically induced by the conjunction of PF and CF inputs to PCs, could limit the communication between these microzones.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The functional units process information from different origins</title><p>We have demonstrated here that PFs can link distant cortical regions that do not always match with known zebrin band markers or MF inputs. Notably, neither the PC clusters nor the GC spatial patterns of connections strictly match with the topography of the spinocerebellar or cuneate MF inputs carrying information from the hindlimb and forelimb, indicating that GC patches cannot simply be identified by the anatomical organization of a single source of MFs, and might combine MF information from different sources, as suggested in two recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chabrol et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bengtsson and Jorntell, 2009</xref>). Discrepancies between anatomical and functional boundaries have also been shown using in vivo calcium imaging of CF signaling in PCs following sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsutsumi et al., 2015</xref>). Since P2<sup>+</sup> bands receive specific MF inputs from the hindlimb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jörntell et al., 2000</xref>), the functional organization observed in our experiments might illustrate the importance of connecting cortical microzones controlling similar muscles in both limbs.</p><p>The term microzone was originally associated with both the description of the fine anatomical CF projection and the concept of unitary functional unit in the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oscarsson, 1979</xref>). We described here clusters of neighboring PCs and MLIs having similar GC input connectivity maps that might represent individual functional units. However, they differ from the original <italic>anatomical microzone</italic> definition as they can span multiple zebrin bands. Therefore, a <italic>functional microzone</italic> likely computes information from different sources of MF inputs and frequently belongs to two adjacent zebrin bands as also proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">(Graham and Wylie, 2012)</xref>. Since zebrin bands also define an array of biochemical markers that can have an important role in synaptic transmission, signal integration and plasticity (for example EAAT4 transporter, PLCbeta3 and 4, IP3R1 and mGluR1a receptors follow a specific zebrin pattern of expression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cerminara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hawkes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Paukert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</xref>), a functional microzonal unit might then combine several toolboxes in order to process incoming information. In light of the stereotyped organization of GC input patterns to PCs and MLIs, and the local restriction of the GC inputs to GoCs, we postulate that the area between P2<sup>+</sup> ipsi- and contralateral bands could be composed of 10–13 functional units with a mean extension of 70–100 µm, as already suggested by in vivo imaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ozden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsutsumi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schultz et al., 2009</xref>). In the posterior lobe, zebrin bands and cerebellar inputs have a different topographical organization, notably in the vestibular lobules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Voogd, 2011</xref>), but a modular system has also been described suggesting that the communication between microzones through PFs is a general mechanism involved in information processing in the cerebellum. However, whether conserved and stereotyped patterns across animals is the rule in the posterior lobe needs to be demonstrated. In Crus I/II, animal-specific processing linked to vibrissa tactile discrimination might lead to unique communication rules, as sensory discrimination relies on individual history.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that cortical functional microzones of the cerebellar cortex communicate via the PFs and underlie an important level of coordination between cerebellar modules.

A glass pipette was positioned in the upper half of the molecular layer, 500 µm away from the recorded PC, and 300 stimulations were performed at 1 Hz in current-clamp mode. After a resting period of 5 min, photostimulation was resumed and the entire mapping was repeated at least four times. Perfusion contained picrotoxin, strychnine, CGP52432 and AM251 at the concentrations described above. For plasticity experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, the following internal solution was used (in mM): K-gluconate 136, KCl 4, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, HEPES 10, Na<sub>2</sub>ATP 4, NaGTP 0.4, sucrose 16, pH 7.3, and inhibition was blocked with bicuculine (20 µM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Photostimulation</title><p>Uncaging experiments were performed using bath-applied RuBi-glutamate (100 µM, Ascent Scientific), as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fino et al., 2009</xref>. We used the point-scan mode of a confocal microscope (FV300, Olympus, Japan) for illumination, mounted with a diode-pumped solid-state blue laser (20 ms and 30 mW laser pulses at 473 nm [CrystaLaser, USA], through a 20× objective [Olympus, Japan]). The beam of blue light (473 nm) was controlled by a set of mirror galvanometers and focused using a low-aperture objective (20×/0.5 NA). This optical arrangement was designed to generate an almost cylindrical beam that could penetrate the slice, as assessed by the constant synaptic charge recorded when the focal plane of the photostimulation was increased to a depth of 100 µm in the slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Mapping was carried out using a software-based point-scan stimulation (PAPP, Fluoview 300) at identified positions, with a step of 41.5 µm every 3.5 s. The stability of the photostimulated current was assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>In each experiment, the recorded cell was placed at the center of the field and the slice was positioned with the PC layer aligned with the X-axis of the grid. Grid extension was 332 µm on each side of the recorded cell above the GC layer. A range of 34–85 sites was sampled several times for each cell (mean number of mappings/cell = 5.1 ± 2.3). No sites were stimulated with frequencies higher than 0.008 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Controls for photostimulation</title><p>RuBi-glutamate uncaging was used to study the functional excitatory synaptic connectivity of the cerebellar cortex. This compound was chosen because it incurs fewer non-specific effects than MNI-glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fino et al., 2009</xref>) during quantitative laser-scanning photostimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shepherd et al., 2005</xref>). Since these caged compounds partially block GABAergic currents, GC inhibitory transmission was blocked.</p><p>The diffusion of uncaged RuBi-glutamate during laser stimulation was estimated by recording currents evoked in PC dendrites in the horizontal plane in 20 µm steps(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Action potentials were blocked with tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 µM). Because of the thickness of the PC dendritic tree itself, direct stimulation of glutamate receptors yielded an upper limit for the size of the spot (half-width = 33.0 ± 1.8 µm, n = 9). Since the lateral extension of GC dendrites could increase the responsive area, we also estimated this extent by recording GCs both in loose cell-attached mode (measuring evoked action potentials, the half-width of evoked action potentials was 45.5 ± 10.9 µm, n = 7) and in whole-cell mode (measuring evoked currents, the half-width of direct stimulation was 59.6 ± 2.1 µm, n = 7) while uncaging glutamate in10 µm steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). The average maximum number of evoked action potentials at the center of the spot was 19.6 ± 6.6 (n = 7) indicating that even GC-PC connections with a very low probability of release could evoke a current to the recorded PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Isope and Barbour, 2002</xref>). The distance between two photostimulated sites (41.5 µm) was chosen to ensure that neighboring sites were almost independent, and that all parts of the granular layer was sampled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We estimated that each beam could illuminate several hundred GCs per 10 µm of slice thickness. A burst of action potentials was triggered in this population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), where glutamate uncaging elicited currents of up to 10 pC. Since the synaptic weight of a single GC-PC connection is approximately 0.1 pC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Isope and Barbour, 2002</xref>), tens of active GC connections (depending on the depth of the GC layer in the slice) could be stimulated simultaneously, attesting to the efficacy of the photostimulation protocol.</p><p>We estimated the impact of the focal plane on GC responses. GC inputs were recorded in PCs while the focal plane was changed in 10 µm steps. The average current was not significantly different between focal planes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Since the detection of distal connected GCs could be affected by the inclination of the slice, we used GFP-positive Lugaro cell axons, which run parallel to the PF, from EAAT4-GlyT2-GFP slices and determined granule cell layer slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). A total of 130 axons were traced in 13 slices after the experiment, and the mean deviation from the horizontal axis was 0.85 ± 0.82 deg, suggesting that the absence of distal responses was not due to a tilt in the slice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of synaptic charge</title><p>Measurements and analyses were performed using Python software written in-house and open source software, OpenElectrophy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neuralensemble.org/OpenElectrophy/">http://neuralensemble.org/OpenElectrophy/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garcia and Fourcaud-Trocmé, 2009</xref>). Data were stored in SQL databases. Synaptic charges evoked by photostimulation of granule cells were detected during a window of 0–200 ms after illumination<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. The standard deviation of the background noise was detected as follows: peak amplitude was detected using a 200 ms window at the end of each trace, then the histogram of noise was built and its standard deviation was determined. The Z-score of synaptic charges for each site was calculated using the following equation: Z-score<sub>site</sub> = (mean synaptic charge at one site − mean charge of the noise)/(standard deviation of the noise). A Z-score of 3.09, corresponding to a significance level of 0.001, was chosen to define significant and silent sites. This conservative choice of threshold was chosen in agreement with visual inspection of the traces, to ensure that any evoked current was not simply due to spontaneous activity.</p><p>Although glutamate uncaging in the GC layer did not evoke direct currents in PCs, the direct stimulation of GoC somata or basolateral dendrites occurred at some sites. The slow direct current was filtered using a median filter applied to each individual trace. Evoked synaptic currents are much faster and were slightly affected. The MLI Z-score was determined using the number of individual EPSCs evoked by glutamate uncaging in a time window of 200 ms after uncaging compared to the number of individual EPSCs in a distant time window.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Reconstruction of GC input patterns and correlation matrix</title><p>After the recordings, slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and zebrin bands were identified using a monoclonal (gift from Richard Hawkes, Calgary) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brochu et al., 1990</xref>) or polyclonal (Izumi Sugihara, Japan) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sugihara and Shinoda, 2004</xref>) antibody against aldolase C. Biocytin/neurobiotin-filled cells were visualized with a streptavidin Alexa Fluor conjugate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). In order to compared reconstructed cell positions between animals, the average width of zebrin bands in lobules III and IV was determined (average P1<sup>+</sup> width = 48.5 ± 13.6 µm, average P1<sup>−</sup> width = 275.6 ± 70.3 µm, average P2<sup>+</sup> width = 64.6 ± 19.3 µm and average P2<sup>−</sup> width = 445.2 ± 60.5 µm, n = 89) and cells were positioned within these coordinates. A 3D reconstruction of GoCs was obtained using the free software Vaa3d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peng et al., 2014</xref>). In each mediolateral position of the GC layer, the site with the maximum Z-score value was used to build spatial patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). For paired correlation and median Z-score histograms, spatial patterns were convolved, using a triangular kernel (half-width = 18 µm).</p><p>The correlation matrix was built as follows: the representative pattern of GC inputs at each position was given by the median Z-score of synaptic charges for a group of PCs in a range of 100 µm. A full set of median patterns was generated by shifting the averaging window by 10 µm. The Pearson correlation was calculated between each couple of median patterns, and the reported location in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> corresponds to the center of the median pattern. Biclustering was performed using spectral co-clustering from the sklearn Python library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2014</xref>). In brief, the algorithm rearranges the rows and the columns of the correlation matrix to make biclusters contiguous without assumption. If the order of rows and columns is not changed, it indicates that the initial data order already presented a clustered organization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Means are reported with standard deviations, while error bars in figures represent SEMs or MADs (median absolute deviation) in cases where the mean or the median, respectively, was used.

The approach is an interesting one: pairs of PCs are recorded with one being a reference cell and a second positioned variable distances from the reference cell. Groups of granule cells were activated by a glutamate uncaging spot that was scanned across the tissue slice in a grid pattern. The location of the midline and of zebrin labeling allowed the investigators to establish reproducible reference points that enabled pooling of data across animals.

They map connectivity of GCs to PCs using photo-uncaging of glutamate in discreet regions of the granule cell layer and find stereotyped but heterogeneous connectivity patterns. Contrary to previous findings, granule cell populations immediately subjacent to recorded Purkinje neurons were not necessarily stronger; indeed in some cases distal GC populations showed preferred connectivity. These maps, when viewed with respect to anatomical boundaries, appear to follow loose rules and show richer connectivity patterns that other cell types such as Golgi cells and molecular layer interneurons. Together the results suggest a previously unrecognized organization of connectivity between granule cells and Purkinje neurons and a point to a role for parallel fibers in cerebellar functional circuitry where before they have appeared functionally elusive.</p><p>I find the take home message to be compelling and interesting. I do feel a deep sense of reservation that the data were recorded in the presence of GABAA receptor blockers (among many others) that could severely alter the functional relevance of the findings. The manuscript could be strengthened to better articulate the findings, justify certain analytical approaches, clarify figures, and more thoroughly address the discrepancies with previous findings. These ideas are fleshed out below:</p><p>1) Previous studies have identified a role for molecular layer interneurons in inhibiting distant Purkinje neurons through a lateral inhibition mechanism (Dizon &amp; Khodakhah, 2011). It is therefore surprising that relatively little attention is paid to the role of inhibition in shaping GC-PC maps in the present study. Do the authors expect that the interesting heterogeneous patterns they uncovered here are robust to inhibition? Might inhibition further sculpt the patterns? How might the plane of section influence the findings (Rieubland et al. 2014)? While I think the results as presented are interesting on their own, without data on the maps with inhibition intact, it is difficult to surmise how relevant these maps are to normal physiological function of the cerebellum. At a very minimum these caveats should be more thoroughly discussed.</p><p>2) The authors should be commended in taking the initial interesting observation of structured spatial GC-PC organization to the next logical question regarding the stability of these maps after plasticity events. Yet this part of the manuscript would benefit from the most attention. I found the display of data to be a bit puzzling since the color scheme indicating changes in connectivity shifts completely from pre and post-induction. While I don't want to micromanage, it would seem that at a minimum, unchanged sites should not change color before and after induction as they currently do (black to dark gray; white to light gray, etc.). In short, the representation of data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 A</xref> should be reworked.</p><p>Similarly, the idea that motivated these experiments (that complex spatial maps of connectivity may be altered with use) is not well explored with this dataset. The authors emphasize that silent sites strengthen and strong sites weaken, but bringing the analysis back to the original point of maps is lacking. I would like to see a few lines of binaried map analysis parallel to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> for the 8 cells that underwent plasticity induction. Illustrating the before-and-after heat maps would seem to me to be essential for evaluating whether the &quot;map&quot; is plastic, rather than a few sites that increase or decrease their strength. Short of this, the finding that the maps are under plastic control seems weak.</p><p>3) One of the major findings is that GC-PC connectivity patterns show complex spatial patterns. On its face, this finding of course conflicts with interpretations of experiments using similar techniques that emphasize a primary role for subjacent granule cells in driving overlying Purkinje neurons. Yet the spatial map of GC connection probability in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (and Figure 8—figure supplement 1) reveal that local GCs, in general, provide the strongest influence to overlying PCs. At first I scratched my head at this seemingly contradictory finding because the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> clearly do not show strong local connectivity. Looking more closely at the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> heat map, however, it is apparent that Purkinje neurons recorded in the P1<sup>–</sup> zone were unique in lacking strong local GC input. Since these cells formed the basis of several figures as examples but are different from the overall trend in their weak local input, I think the authors should highlight this difference as a finding that is otherwise obscured by the predominant effect of local GC input on the maps and in the previously published literature.</p><p>4) Relatedly, the finding that correlations in map patterns drop off with distance, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) seems like a preliminary analysis given the pattern separation described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Rather than emphasize that cells nearest the midline are similar and that this similarity drops off, a pairwise cross correlation marching across the population of PCs organized spatially may offer a quantitative description of the drifting GC input pattern and an objective criterion for classifying pattern types in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Indeed, it would be important to provide some quantitative criterion for these pattern classes. Short of that they are descriptive but not rigorously defined.</p><p>5) Summary illustrations in Figure 8 are largely ineffective and should be re-worked. The symbols atop panel A for example are puzzling: the hashtags in A are not described until the end of the B panel legend text; numbers and descriptors might be more intuitive.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Stereotyped spatial patterns of functional synaptic connectivity in the cerebellar cortex&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers. The manuscript has been greatly improved, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Both reviewers (one from the first round and one new reviewer) found the revised manuscript interesting and important, as well as improved over the first version, as indicated in their general comments, included below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their revised manuscript, Valera et al. have improved upon their original manuscript by simplifying displays and performing extra analyses that bolster their conclusions. I find their report to be convincing and important. They find that the synaptic strength of parallel fibers onto Purkinje neurons, as read out by postsynaptic currents, varies along the length of the fiber. Rather than systematic changes in strength, they find highly heterogeneous synapses that nevertheless produce stereotyped patterns of synaptic strength. These patterns do not correspond to known anatomical boundaries set up by zebrin stripes. At least 4 pattern groups exist and they cluster depending upon anatomical location. The patterns reflect experience because a plasticity induction protocol changes the synaptic strength pattern. Finally, these functional synaptic strength patterns differ for Golgi cells and MLIs. This study provides a glimpse into a hitherto unknown functional organizational pattern in cerebellar cortex dictated by activity-dependent mechanisms that will almost certainly play an important role in sculpting spatiotemporal patterns of Purkinje activity during behavior.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper by Philippe Isope and colleagues provides a major contribution to unraveling the functional operations of cerebellar architecture. As far as this reviewer knows this is one of the first times distant cerebellar connectivity is shown at the network level. Although somewhat descriptive, its consistent nature across animals points toward important implications.</p><p><italic>Minor comments (both reviewers) [abridged]:</italic></p><p>1) Introduction, end of second paragraph: The build up towards this sentence suggests that the organization of the MF input contributes to, or is even essential for the concept of microzones. It should be made clear that microzones are primarily defined based on efferent fibers and CF input (see e.g. De Zeeuw et al., 2011 Nat Rev Neur), rather than mossy fibers.</p><p>2) Results: Along the same line, the authors state that &quot;boundaries of the functional microzones might slightly differ from a pure anatomical description&quot;. At first sight, the boundaries seem to significantly differ from those of the zebrin II pattern. Please explain the chosen wording.</p><p>3) I am missing a description of the efficacy of the cuneate/spinal cord injections. In other words, which percentage of the cuneate nucleus or of the lumbar spinal cord was colored? Was there any reason to assume heterogeneity within these nuclei in relation to the staining pattern in the cerebellar cortex? How specific were the injections (were also neighboring areas affected, for instance)?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>:</p><p>A) What do the authors mean with &quot;area mapped = 664 µm&quot; (subsection “Heterogeneous GC input maps to PCs revealed distant GC inputs“): radius or area?</p><p>B) The authors disregard the variation in stimulating at different depths within the granular layer. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> the variation caused by using different depths is at least equal to that caused by using different lateral distances to the recorded Purkinje cell. Please comment also on the impact of depth.</p><p>C) &quot;No GC patch had a Z-score &gt; 3.09 at any depth of the GC layer&quot; should read: &quot;al all depths&quot;?</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: Several clusters appear to be slightly larger in lateral direction.

It has been shown by Gerrits and Voogd that the MFs in particularly the anterior lobe are organized in zones, whereas those in the posterior lobe are not. The patterns of MF projections in the posterior lobe are dramatically different from those in the anterior lobe.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09862.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>We recognized the value to cerebellar specialists of your demonstration of patterned input as well as measurements of the strength of connectivity.

A critical point is to understand how information is processed in individual modules and communicated to other modules. Parallel or distributed processing are certainly underpinned by different functional organization of neuronal networks. In the barrel cortex of rodents, initial suggestion that information from individual whiskers are processed mostly in one cortical column and combined at a later stage was largely broken by data demonstrating that intermodular communication can drive modular processing (see for example Estebanez et al., 2012 Nat Neurosci. 2012 Dec;15(12):1691-9.). Furthermore, as written now in the Introduction of the manuscript, &quot;whether neighboring modules strictly follow the same functional and cellular organization rules or display subtle differences in local architecture or neurochemical expression that would determine module-specific function or processing rules is not established&quot;.</p><p>In the cerebellar cortex, if anatomical modules are well defined, subtle differences in the functional anatomy and the physiology have been shown that lead to the idea that each module might have its own identity. Our results demonstrate that these individual modules communicate together and collaborate in order to process information. Moreover this functional link can be tuned but is conserved between animals demonstrating that it is a rule not a simple selection of synaptic inputs. We think that the observed patterns actually highlight new operational rules for the coordination of information in the cerebellar cortex that might illustrate a more general mechanism. A similar description has been performed for example in Cossell L et al. (Nature. 2015 Feb 19;518(7539):399-403.). Although our observations are made in the cerebellar cortex, cell-specific connectivity profiles underlying inter-modular and intra modular information processing might be of general interest, since modular systems are present in many cortical structures. Therefore, we think that instead of being descriptive, our work provides the proof of concept for the activity dependent (as shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) selection of conserved sets of synapses that underlie modular communication. More specifically, our findings demonstrate that:</p><p>1) Granule cells (the input stage of the cerebellar cortex) originating in different functional microzones (modules) communicate their information through the parallel fiber excitatory pathway to Purkinje cells from local and distant microzones in a specific and reproducible manner. Granule cell input maps are specific for one type of connection since granule cell-Purkinje cell and granule cell-molecular interneuron synapses define different maps. Also, the fact that one type of synapse, the granule cell-Golgi cell synapse, does not participate in the communication between microzones, is a surprising result in regard to the morphology of this interneuron, and an important new characteristic of the cerebellar cortical network.</p><p>2) These granule cell input maps are conserved from animal to animal indicating that one given area of the granule cell layer dealing with specific mossy fiber inputs contacts preferentially identified microzones, linking the microzones through the parallel fiber pathway. This illustrates how local association rules between cerebellar modules could influence the coordinated output of the cerebellar cortex. On a more practical point of view, the fact that these patterns are reproducible, and that their position is easy to identify (the midline is easy to find even without zebrin markers) and relatively easy to observe (lobule IV is accessible to in vivo imaging), give them a great potential for any future studies interested in studying how modules coordination works in vivo and in vitro.</p><p>This is one of the first demonstration that functional synaptic connectivity can be specifically conserved between animals.</p><p>3) These results definitely answer one of the longest controversy in the field: the organization of synaptic functional organization of granule cell to Purkinje cell connection. By monitoring Purkinje cell discharge in vivo, several groups suggested that only local granule cells (through the ascending part of the granule cell axon) can drive Purkinje cells firing (see Bower and Woolston, J Neurophysiol. 1983 Mar;49(3):745-66; Cohen and Yarom, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Dec 8;95(25):15032-6.) indicating that information in the cerebellar cortex might be process in parallel and that coordination between microzones might occur at a downstream level, maybe outside the cerebellum. Conversely, other groups suggested that Purkinje cells are only driven by one restricted group of granule cells, but not local (for review Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 Jan;11(1):30-43.). However, studies performed in vivo, monitored the discharge of the Purkinje cells following stimulation of cerebellar inputs, a very indirect assessment of granule cell-Purkinje cell functional organization. Ultimately, based on in vitro uncaging techniques, another group suggested that granule cells give a broad input onto Purkinje cells (Walter et al., 2009 J Neurosci. 2009 Jul 1;29(26):8462-73.). However, they did not consider the location of the recordings in their study, smoothing heterogeneities.</p><p>Our data provide a direct proof conciliating both hypotheses: distant microzones communicate through parallel fibers in the cerebellar cortex and local granule cells provide a strong input to Purkinje cells.</p><p>The strength of our study is that it extents classical synaptic observations to the level of the microcircuit organization, by recording targeted anatomical modules.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p> <italic>[…] I find the take home message to be compelling and interesting. I do feel a deep sense of reservation that the data were recorded in the presence of GABAA receptor blockers (among many others) that could severely alter the functional relevance of the findings.

At a very minimum these caveats should be more thoroughly discussed.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. We acknowledge and anticipate that the granule cell-MLI-Purkinje cell feedforward pathway and the off-beam inhibition through basket cells will result in a net effect that might differ from our excitatory maps, and we now discuss this point in the text. However, it is important to keep in mind that inhibition won't change in any way the structure of the granule input maps that we have described here, which are only excitatory connection maps. We also would like to insist on the fact that distant granule cells hardly contact local Golgi cells and that the axon of Golgi cells is restricted to the local area. Consequently, feedback inhibition is restricted to local area which will affect only local granule cells. The excitatory communication lines described here between microzones are thus physiologically relevant even if the final effect on Purkinje cell discharge is ultimately linked to the balance between direct excitation from granule cells and disynaptic inhibition from molecular layer interneurons.</p><p>As now stated in the Discussion, recordings were intentionally performed with GABAA antagonist as well as blocker of plasticity in order to determine the precise organization of the granule cell inputs to Purkinje/MLI and Golgi cells.</p><p>Nevertheless, studying the inhibitory input map would be interesting for the prediction of the physiological outcomes of information processing, however RuBi-glutamate or MNI-glutamate partially block GABAA receptors (see Fino et al., 2011), then another set of techniques should be used to tackle this question.</p><p>Again, I would like to emphasize that inhibition, although physiologically relevant, won't change the outcomes of this study, since distant microzones will be connected together through granule cell-Purkinje cell synapses or by the way granule cell-MLI-Purkinje cell synapses. Our striking results demonstrating that <italic>functional synaptic connectivity can be conserved between animals</italic> won't be affected by inhibition. Therefore the cortical coordination of microzones by granule cells is a robust phenomenon.</p><p> <italic>2) The authors should be commended in taking the initial interesting observation of structured spatial GC-PC organization to the next logical question regarding the stability of these maps after plasticity events.

In short, the representation of data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> should be reworked.</italic> </p><p>We agree, this figure has been rebuilt and focused on the modification of the granule cell input map after plasticity induction (see next point) as rightly pointed out by the reviewer.</p><p><italic>Similarly, the idea that motivated these experiments (that complex spatial maps of connectivity may be altered with use) is not well explored with this dataset. The authors emphasize that silent sites strengthen and strong sites weaken, but bringing the analysis back to the original point of maps is lacking.

Short of this, the finding that the maps are under plastic control seems weak.</italic> </p><p>The group of cells experiencing plasticity did not allow us to rebuild a map for all 4 clusters, but 7 cells recorded in Cluster 1 (see text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) accurately reproduced the GC input pattern. Therefore, we reanalyzed the dataset and described the median histogram of the z-score of charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) for this group of Purkinje cells. We then demonstrated that a new group of connected sites appeared at a specific position in the mediolateral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We then concluded that the map has changed, suggesting that plastic modification can tune the map. As expected from a stimulation protocol targeting granule cells at random location, the effect was particularly obvious in regions where granule cells were initially silent.</p><p> <italic>3) One of the major findings is that GC-PC connectivity patterns show complex spatial patterns. On its face, this finding of course conflicts with interpretations of experiments using similar techniques that emphasize a primary role for subjacent granule cells in driving overlying Purkinje neurons. Yet the spatial map of GC connection probability in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (and Figure 8—figure supplement 1) reveal that local GCs, in general, provide the strongest influence to overlying PCs. At first I scratched my head at this seemingly contradictory finding because the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> clearly do not show strong local connectivity.

As mentioned in the main text, distant hotspots of connected granule cells are sometimes stronger than the local input. Also, as pointed out by the reviewer, one group of cells show no (or weak) local inputs (however, it represents less than 10% of the cells). This point has been clarified.</p><p><italic>4) Relatedly, the finding that correlations in map patterns drop off with distance, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) seems like a preliminary analysis given the pattern separation described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Rather than emphasize that cells nearest the midline are similar and that this similarity drops off, a pairwise cross correlation marching across the population of PCs organized spatially may offer a quantitative description of the drifting GC input pattern and an objective criterion for classifying pattern types in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.

The binarization has been abandoned because a simpler and more straightforward analysis lead to similar results. As suggested by the reviewer, a correlation matrix has been built (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) using groups of Purkinje cells in order to minimize the noise and extract the median pattern at a given position of the granular layer. Regions that displayed similar GC input patterns in our previous analysis (old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">figure 4</xref>) are now highly correlated in the correlation matrix. This approach is more precise and quantitative. We also applied a bi-clustering algorithm (see Methods) that allowed us to extract the boundaries of clusters of neighboring Purkinje cells.

We have now included a description of the injection sites in the Methods section and corrected a mistake in the description of the spinal cord injection. A supplementary figure has also been added.</p><p>In brief, our injections were mostly focused on cuneate injections (4 animals have been injected with AAV2/1-GFP and 2 with fluoro-ruby). In 4 out of 6 animals, injection site spread into the entire lateral and dorso-ventral axes and 350-400 µm in the antero-posterior axis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) of the external cuneate. Cortical projections in lobule III and IV have been measured in 13 different slices in these 4 animals. Also, one large injection (1.2 µl) injection in the lumbar segments of one animal has been performed in the spinal cord which led to an infected area ≈1 cm centered around L3-L5 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of Huang CC et al., Elife. 2013 Feb 26;2:e00400 for cuneate projections.</p><p>We therefore postulate that the boundaries of the mossy fiber projections observed in our experiments represent anatomical limit of specific group of mossy fiber inputs originating in the cuneate nucleus of the spinal cord.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>:</italic></p><p><italic>A) What do the authors mean with &quot;area mapped = 664 µm&quot; (subsection “Heterogeneous GC input maps to PCs revealed distant GC inputs“): radius or area?</italic> </p><p>This is the width (in the mediolateral axis) of the granule cell layer mapped using our photostimulation system. The term &quot;area&quot; has been corrected for width.</p><p><italic>B) The authors disregard the variation in stimulating at different depths within the granular layer. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> the variation caused by using different depths is at least equal to that caused by using different lateral distances to the recorded Purkinje cell. Please comment also on the impact of depth.</italic> </p><p>We agree that GC inputs varied at different depth of the GC layer as well as in the medioloateral axis (although a distal response could often be observed at several depth of the granular layer). However, since our study focused on the communication between distant microzones, we considered that one connected site (a third of the depth of the GC layer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) to a given microzone is sufficient to consider that some information can be communicated between the 2 microzones. For this reason, we choose to attribute the maximum GC inputs observed in the entire depth of a GC column to the mediolateral position. Furthermore, mossy fiber from one specific nucleus project to all depths of the GC layer, at identified mediolateral position (see our paper and aforementioned articles in point 3). Therefore, two adjacent GC sites in the mediolateral axis may carry information from different type of mossy fiber inputs while sites at different depth of GC layer are likely to convey information from similar sources. This point is mentioned in the text (subsection “Heterogeneous GC input maps to PCs revealed distant GC inputs”).</p><p><italic>C) &quot;No GC patch had a Z-score &gt; 3.09 at any depth of the GC layer&quot; should read: &quot;al all depths&quot;?</italic> </p><p>Yes, this has been corrected.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: Several clusters appear to be slightly larger in lateral direction. I understand the cluster analysis is free, and thus these results are not hand-picked, but how do the authors interpret these extensions, including the 5th cluster attached to #4?</italic></p><p>Indeed, the biclustering algorithm has been applied without assumption of shape or size for the clusters. In the matrix, the median pattern of groups of PCs in a 100 µm window has been correlated. Since two adjacent groups are separated by only 10 µm, they share some patterns. Therefore, several lines of the matrix are necessary to separate different profiles. For this reason, clusters based only on the correlation matrix are larger, explaining the extensions from the result of the biclustering algorithm. Regarding the 5th cluster, because it is situated at the edge of the field (&gt;300 µm from the midline), it contains fewer patterns and has not been detected by the biclustering algorithm.</p><p><italic>6) With regard to the importance of the consistency, please discuss to what extent these findings, which taken exclusively from the anterior lobe, may be extrapolated to the other parts of the cerebellum, in particular the posterior lobe. It has been shown by Gerrits and Voogd that the MFs in particularly the anterior lobe are organized in zones, whereas those in the posterior lobe are not. The patterns of MF projections in the posterior lobe are dramatically different from those in the anterior lobe.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the overall topographical organization of the posterior lobe is different than the anterior lobe with zebrin positive bands wider and zebrin negative bands much thinner. However, anatomical evidences suggest that a microzonal organization can also be observed in the posterior lobe. This has been reviewed for example by Jan Voogd several times (Voogd, J. (2014). Front. Syst. Neurosci. <italic>8</italic>, 1–14.). The group of Richard Apps also described the organization of discrete modules in the posterior lobe (Cerminara, N.L., Aoki, H., Loft, M., Sugihara, I., and Apps, R. (2013). J. Neurosci. <italic>33</italic>, 16427–16442.). Matsuo Matsushita showed that mossy fibers can project in bands in lobule VIII (Figures 14-15 of Yaginuma and Matsushita J Comp Neurol. 1987 Apr 1;258(1):1-27). Interestingly mossy fibers projecting to anterior lobule III/IV make collaterals to posterior lobule VIII suggesting that common mechanisms may apply to this lobule (Voogd, J., Pardoe, J., Ruigrok, T.J.H., and Apps, R. (2003). J. Neurosci. <italic>23</italic>, 4645–4656). Although anatomical differences are obvious, we suggest that communication between microzones through PFs could be a general mechanism involved in information processing in the cerebellum.</p><p>However, whether conserved and stereotyped patterns across animals will be the rule in other part of the cerebellum needs to be demonstrated. For example, in crus I/II, it is possible that animal specific processing linked to vibrissa tactile discrimination leads to unique communication rules, as sensory discrimination relies on individual history.</p><p>This statement has been added to the Discussion (subsection “The functional units process information from different origins”, second paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
