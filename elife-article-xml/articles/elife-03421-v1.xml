reductive process to edit disulfides during the maturation or degradation of secreted proteins. To critically examine the widely held assumption that reduced ER glutathione fuels disulfide reduction, we expressed a modified form of a cytosolic glutathione-degrading enzyme, ChaC1, in the ER lumen. ChaC1<sup>CtoS</sup> purged the ER of glutathione eliciting the expected kinetic defect in oxidation of an ER-localized glutathione-coupled Grx1-roGFP2 optical probe, but had no effect on the disulfide editing-dependent maturation of the LDL receptor or the reduction-dependent degradation of misfolded alpha-1 antitrypsin. Furthermore, glutathione depletion had no measurable effect on induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR); a sensitive measure of ER protein folding homeostasis. These findings challenge the importance of reduced ER glutathione and suggest the existence of alternative electron donor(s) that maintain the reductive capacity of the ER.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03421.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03421.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03421.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are basically strings of amino acids that have folded into a specific three-dimensional shape, and this shape is often important for the protein's function. Some proteins have bonds between pairs of cysteines—an amino acid that contains sulfur—in different parts of the protein to maintain its correct shape.</p><p>In eukaryotes, such as plants and animals, these so-called ‘disulfide bonds’ are formed inside a structure within each cell called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is where many proteins are folded. Occasionally, disulfide bonds form in the wrong place in a protein, so they need to be broken and re-positioned—a process sometimes called editing—for the protein to fold correctly. It was widely assumed that a chemical called ‘reduced glutathione’ fuels the breaking of disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum, but to date few researchers have tried to test this assumption.</p><p>Tsunoda et al. have now taken an enzyme that degrades glutathione elsewhere in the cell and modified it in a way that allows it to work inside the endoplasmic reticulum. When this modified enzyme was produced in human cells grown in the laboratory, it purged the endoplasmic reticulum of glutathione. However, the lack of glutathione had no effect on the folding of a large protein with 30 disulfide bonds, many of which need to be edited at one time or another for the protein to fold correctly. The destruction of a poorly folded protein, via a process that also needs this protein's disulfide bonds to be broken down, was also not affected by a lack of reduced glutathione in the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>Furthermore, decreasing these levels of glutathione did not affect the unfolded protein response: a stress response in cells that are experiencing a build-up of unfolded or poorly folded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>As such, the findings of Tsunoda et al. challenge the importance of reduced glutathione in the endoplasmic reticulum and suggest that other chemical processes might be involved in editing disulfide bonds. Further work is now needed to investigate the other known processes that might complete this task instead to see which, if any, are involved.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03421.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03421.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>protein folding</kwd><kwd>UPR</kwd><kwd>redox</kwd><kwd>glutathione</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome 084812/Z/08/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EU FP7 Beta-Bat No: 277713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome 100140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/QUI-BIQ/119677/2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pinho Melo</surname><given-names>Eduardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Adapting a cytosolic enzyme that breaks down glutathione to function in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum challenges the long-held view that reduced glutathione fuels disulfide rearrangements during protein folding.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Disulfide bonds have a critical role in stabilizing correctly folded secreted and membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fass, 2012</xref>). Dedicated enzymatic machinery, consisting of disulfide exchange catalysts of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) class, rapidly introduces disulfide bonds into nascent polypeptide chains. The recycling of PDIs back to their oxidized form is mediated by upstream oxidases, exemplified by ERO1 and back-up enzymes, such as PRDX4 and VKOR that exploit O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and vitamin K epoxide, respectively, as downstream electron acceptors. Defects in components of this electron transfer chain markedly affect protein folding homeostasis in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sevier and Kaiser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rutkevich and Williams, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zito, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Many disulfides introduced by the oxidative machinery are not native and must be broken down in an editing process that is catalyzed by reduced forms of PDIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hatahet and Ruddock, 2009</xref>). This editing entails attack by the reduced N-terminal cysteine of PDI's active site on the misplaced disulfide following resolution of the mixed disulfide. The latter proceeds either by way of a zero-sum re-shuffling process entailing an attacking second reduced cysteine in the client polypeptide, which releases reduced PDI and establishes a new disulfide, or by a net reductive process involving an attack on the mixed disulfide by the C-terminal active site cysteine, in which PDI ‘escapes’ in its oxidized form, having reduced its client protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Walker et al., 1996</xref>). Both mechanisms require a pool of reduced PDI, the maintenance of which is not trivial, given the oxidative environment in the ER. This challenge is especially great in case of the second mechanism, which is a set-up for iterative cycles of net oxidation-reduction-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schwaller et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The crucial role of reduced PDI to oxidative protein folding is supported by in vitro experiments in which PDI's ability to accelerate folding is not monotonically increased by its oxidized fraction, but rather is optimal in a redox buffer that also contains a high concentration of reduced glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lyles and Gilbert, 1991</xref>). Yeast genetics reveal that disulfide shuffling (which requires reduced PDI) is <italic>PDI1</italic>'s essential function, as an active-site mutant that has lost the ability to produce disulfides (but has selectively retained activity as a disulfide reductase) is nonetheless able to rescue the lethal phenotype of <italic>pdi1</italic> nullizygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Laboissiere et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The reductive facet of oxidative protein folding in the ER is especially important to the maturation of large proteins such as the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R), in which it has been estimated that most disulfides that form early during biogenesis are non-native and must be rearranged before the protein clears ER quality control and traffics to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jansens et al., 2002</xref>). This editing process appears to involve a specific PDI family member, ERdj5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oka et al., 2013</xref>). ERdj5 may have specialized in disulfide reduction, as its redox function also accelerates the clearance of misfolded ER proteins such as the null Hong Kong mutant α1-antitrypsin (NHK-A1AT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ushioda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hagiwara et al., 2011</xref>), but the identity of ERdj5's reductase remains unknown.</p><p>Reductive editing of disulfides is also observed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> periplasm. Where the transfer of electrons from reduced thioredoxin in the cytosol maintains a reduced pool of the periplasmic isomerases, DsbC and DsbG. Electrons are conveyed across the inner-membrane space by a specialized transmembrane protein DsbD. This protein relay-based mechanism enables DsbC/DsbG-dependent disulfide shuffling despite the absence of a soluble small molecule redox buffer in the periplasmic space of gram negative bacteria (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho and Collet, 2013</xref>). By contrast, the mammalian ER contains up to 15 mM glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Montero et al., 2013</xref>) whose reduced form is widely believed to fuel the reductive aspects of secreted protein metabolism in eukaryotes, by serving as a terminal electron donor to reduce PDI family members (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kojer and Riemer, 2014</xref>).</p><p>To critically examine the role of ER glutathione in the reductive re-shuffling of non-native disulfides and in the reductive steps believed to be associated with degradation of misfolded ER proteins, we devised a method to selectively deplete the ER of glutathione and examined the consequences on the organelles' capacity to handle well-characterized sentinel proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A glutathione-degrading enzyme suited to the oxidizing conditions of the endoplasmic reticulum</title><p>Kumar et al. recently reported that the mammalian pro-apoptotic gene <italic>ChaC1</italic> encodes a glutathione-specific γ-glutamyl cyclotransferase that efficiently degrades glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>).

The enzymatic activity was selective towards reduced glutathione (GSH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Therefore, the aforementioned in vitro observations indicating tight coupling of Grx1-roGFP2 to glutathione (and relative indifference to PDI) suggested that the rate of re-oxidation of an ER-localized Grx1-roGFP2 probe following a reductive pulse might be affected by the presence of glutathione in the ER lumen. To examine this further, we first compared the rate of re-oxidation of ER-localized roGFP2 with that of ER-localized Grx1-roGFP2 following a reductive pulse of dithiothreitol (DTT) and its washout. At steady-state both probes were highly oxidized and both were similarly reduced by the DTT pulse. However the recovery of ER-Grx1-roGFP2 was accelerated compared with ER-roGFP2 alone, with a half-time to recovery of 75.3 ± 7.7 s in case of the former and 167.3 ± 16.8 s in case of the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>).

To focus the measurements on cells co-expressing the roGFP probe and the ChaC1 enzyme, the latter was tagged at its C-terminus with mCherry. Oxidation of ER-roGFP2 was unaffected by the presence of active ChaC1, but the kinetic advantage of ER-Grx1-roGFP2 over the ER-roGFP2 alone was abolished by expression of an active, glutathione-degrading enzyme in the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>).</p><p>We were unable to reproducibly measure glutathione concentrations in microsomal fractions of cultured cells; however, the effect of ChaC1 over-expression on total cellular glutathione was quantifiable.

However, ER-localized ChaC1<sup>CtoS</sup> markedly enhanced glutathione depletion by low concentrations of buthionine-sulfoxide (BSO, an inhibitor of the rate limiting step of glutathione biosynthesis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).

More surprising was the lack of any measurable effect of glutathione depletion on processes that require a pool of reduced PDI enzymes: the disulfide shuffling-dependent maturation of nascent LDL-R and the degradation of a folding incompetent mutant NHK-A1AT. Furthermore, depletion of ER glutathione was without effect on two sensitive, broad-spectrum UPR reporters, arguing that glutathione is indeed dispensable to a broad range of processes required for protein folding homeostasis in the ER of cultured mammalian cells.</p><p>The dispensability of glutathione to reductive processes in the ER has been hinted at previously: in yeast deletion of <italic>GSH1</italic> (encoding gamma glutamylcysteine synthetase that performs the rate-limiting step in glutathione biosynthesis) does not adversely affect the maturation of the disulfide-bonded lysosomal hydrolyze CPY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frand and Kaiser, 1998</xref>). However, the extent of ER glutathione depletion attained by this genetic manipulation is unclear and, given the essential role of cellular glutathione to yeast growth, may have been limited by toxicity. Similar reservations apply to the use of enzyme inhibitors, such as BSO, which subject the cell to the consequences of glutathione depletion in other compartments where it has an essential role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>), but whose effect on the ER pools of glutathione may be partial.</p><p>How complete was depletion of ER glutathione by ChaC1? In vitro the re-oxidation of Grx1-roGFP2 is half-maximal at 18 µM glutathione (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, the abolition of the kinetic advantage of Grx1-roGFP2 over roGFP2 in cells expressing enzymatically active ChaC1 argues that, despite the enzyme's relative low affinity for its substrate (in the millimolar range, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), glutathione levels were purged to micromolar levels by the high concentration of the enzyme. This conclusion is also supported by the effects of ER ChaC1 on total cellular glutathione levels: At similar levels of expression, cytosolic ChaC1 led to near complete depletion of total cellular glutathione, whereas ER ChaC1 had a more modest effect on total cellular pools. Given the 10-fold greater volume of the cytosol over the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stefan et al., 1987</xref>), the aforementioned observations indicate substantially higher local concentration of ER vs cytosolic ChaC1. Thus, the preservation of total cellular glutathione levels in cells expressing high levels of ChaC1 in their ER confirms that transport of glutathione into the ER, from its site of synthesis in the cytosol, is slow (as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>), and therefore, that depletion of ER stores by ChaC1 is profound.</p><p>The redundancy of glutathione could be explained by other small molecule thiols fueling reduction in the ER.

Alternatively, eukaryotes may have a protein-driven apparatus akin to bacterial DsbD for ferrying reducing equivalents from the cytosol to reduce PDI family members.</p><p>Despite its apparent dispensability, ER glutathione does equilibrate with protein thiols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Appenzeller-Herzog et al., 2010</xref>), indicating that it is a redox buffer in the organelle. However, it is possible that despite seemingly rapid equilibration of glutathione to protein thiol redox, the kinetics are insufficient to render glutathione essential and that other, even faster processes, maintain an adequate pool of reduced and oxidized PDIs in the mammalian ER, with glutathione following passively. It is noteworthy, in this vein, that ERO1-deficient cells, with compromised ER thiol oxidative power, have an elevated ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Appenzeller-Herzog et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rutkevich and Williams, 2012</xref>). It has been speculated, reasonably, that this reflects the action of an alternative oxidative pathway that kicks-in when the major oxidases are compromised and exploits oxidized glutathione to couple to protein thiol oxidation. However, our finding that ER glutathione depletion does not further compromise protein thiol oxidation kinetics in oxidase-deficient cells suggests that here too glutathione follows passively the rearrangements in redox pathways and does not participate actively in their implementation.</p><p>Across distant phyla, ER redox is not indifferent to cellular glutathione levels. Depletion of glutathione, by <italic>GSH1</italic> deletion, rescues the oxidative defect in ERO1-deficient yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cuozzo and Kaiser, 1999</xref>), and cytosolic glutathione influences disulfide-bonding of glutenin in the ER of wheat endosperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lombardi et al., 2012</xref>). These observations, which fall short of directly indicting glutathione in reducing ER disulfides, nonetheless argue for participation of glutathione in a shared economy of reducing equivalents across the ER membrane. Prolonged (48 hr) depletion of glutathione by high concentrations of BSO (1 mM) synergize with ER hyperoxidation to degrade cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hansen et al., 2012</xref>). Further support for the idea of a shared economy of glutathione is provided by the phenotype of yeast over-expressing a plasma membrane glutathione transporter HGT1. Glutathione over-load in these cells compromises protein folding in the ER and triggers an unfolded protein response, the basis of which appears to be unregulated re-cycling of PDI from its oxidized to its reduced state imposed by the excessive glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>). While our state of ignorance in regard to the genes responsible for glutathione transport into the yeast ER preclude assigning a role to luminal glutathione in this consequences of cellular glutathione overload, the observations of Kumar et al. clearly argue that glutathione may participate in ER redox.</p><p>In mammalian cells too, glutathione stands to impact the maturation of some secreted or membrane proteins: In a study agnostic of its enzymatic activity, over-expression of wild-type cytosolic ChaC1 in mouse ganglionic eminence cells profoundly inhibited the maturation of the Notch precursor to its furin-cleaved form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chi et al., 2012</xref>). Whereas anti-oxidants that restore impaired glutathione metabolism to normality have been shown to improve the capacity of liver cells to secrete factor VIII, a heavily disulfide bonded serum protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Malhotra et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, conservatively interpreted, our observations lead to the conclusion that ER glutathione is not generally required to maintain protein thiol redox nor folding homeostasis in the ER of cultured mammalian cells. It may now be informative to examine the impact of an ER glutathione purge elicited by ER-localized ChaC1<sup>CtoS</sup> on the fate of specialized secretory cells and their specialized secretory cargo proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>It is widely accepted that reduced glutathione in the ER is the primary driver of the disulfide reduction needed for thiol editing as proteins mature. This paper uses an elegant approach to test this assumption directly. By expressing specifically in the ER a glutathione-degrading enzyme the authors assess the effect on various well established assays of folding, maturation and quality control. Surprisingly, none of the processes examined were affected by the loss of glutathione.</p><p>This represents a radical challenge to the current models. The experiments are thorough and carefully controlled. The authors discuss the implications carefully and quite conservatively but are forced to conclude that the presence of a glutathione-driven enzyme system in the ER lumen is not necessary for at least much of the protein folding and redox homeostasis in this organelle.</p><p>All three reviewers found this paper to be provocative, well done, and rigorous. The data are of outstanding quality, and they are succinctly and clearly described and discussed. There was a clear consensus that it was appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> with some relatively minor amendments, outlined below.</p><p>The experiments and controls are logical but some of them are quite complex. Diagrams of the experimental logic might help in some cases.</p><p>Nomenclature should be standardized. Glutathione vs. GSSG vs. tripeptide (the latter being a bit jargony, unless explained). When <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> is described in the text the ER-ChaC1-CtoS has lost the 'CtoS'.</p><p>Related to the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, depletion of total cellular glutathione with BSO has been described previously as aggravating the toxicity of ERO1* (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hansen et al 2012</xref>). The authors should offer some discussion as to how this prior observation can be reconciled with their conclusion that ER-ChaC1 has no impact on ER homeostasis in cells expressing ERO1* as measured by UPR induction.</p><p>It would be helpful to further explain the FACScans in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. For example, a few basic sentences of explanation such as “a shift to the right for the GFP signal depicts UPR induction” would be helpful. In addition, what do the boxes denote in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03421.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The experiments and controls are logical but some of them are quite complex.
