detailed structural information on the ATP-dependent remodeling reactions is largely absent. The single subunit remodeler Mot1 (modifier of transcription 1) dissociates TATA box-binding protein (TBP):DNA complexes, offering a useful system to address the structural mechanisms of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP, DNA, and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 (NC2). Our data show that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC2 interactions and unbends DNA as compared to the TBP:DNA:NC2 state, suggesting that Mot1 primes TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data suggest that the Swi2/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2, thereby revealing parallels to some nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a structural framework for how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07432.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07432.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07432.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>An organism’s DNA contains thousands of genes, not all of which are active at the same time. Cells use a number of methods to carefully control when particular genes are switched on or off. For example, proteins called transcription factors can activate a gene by binding to particular regions of DNA called promoters. One such transcription factor is called the TATA-binding protein (TBP for short). Mot1 is a remodeling enzyme that can form a “complex” with TBP by binding to it, and in doing so remove TBP from DNA. This silences the genes at those sites. The freed TBP can then bind to other promoters that lack Mot1 and activate the genes found there.</p><p>In 2011, researchers revealed the structure of the complex formed between TBP and Mot1 after TBP has been detached from DNA. However, the structure of the complex that forms while TBP is still bound to the DNA molecule was not known. Butryn et al. – including several of the researchers involved in the 2011 work – have now described the structure of this complex using X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy. Another protein called negative cofactor 2 is also part of the complex, and helps to stabilize it.</p><p>Butryn et al. found that Mot1 reduces the strength of the interactions between DNA and both TBP and negative cofactor 2. Binding to TBP and negative cofactor 2 causes the DNA molecule to bend; however, if Mot1 is also in the complex, the DNA becomes less bent. By making these changes, Mot1 is likely to prime TBP to detach from the DNA. Since the current structures do not yet reveal the atomic structure of Mot1’s ATP dependent DNA motor domain, the next challenge is to visualize the entire complex at atomic resolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07432.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07432.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Mot1</kwd><kwd>NC2</kwd><kwd>TBP</kwd><kwd>transcription regulation</kwd><kwd>hybrid method</kwd><kwd>Swi2/Snf2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 646</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hopfner</surname><given-names>Karl-Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ATMMACHINE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hopfner</surname><given-names>Karl-Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM55763</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Auble</surname><given-names>David T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK1721</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Förster</surname><given-names>Friedrich</given-names></name><name><surname>Hopfner</surname><given-names>Karl-Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A structural analysis of the transcription regulator Mot1 in complex with promoter DNA and the proteins TBP and NC2 provides a first structural framework for how a Swi2/Snf2 type remodeler interacts with a histone fold protein:DNA complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Swi2/Snf2 (switch/sucrose non-fermenting 2) ATPases form a large and diverse class of proteins and multiprotein assemblies within the SF2 superfamily of helicases/translocases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Flaus et al., 2006</xref>). Swi2/Snf2 enzymes are best known as the principal catalytic subunits of large chromatin remodeling complexes that regulate the spatial arrangement and histone composition of nucleosomes, e.g. SWI/SNF, ISWI, CHD, and INO80 remodelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gangaraju and Bartholomew, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>). Current models propose that Swi2/Snf2 ATPases track the minor groove of DNA, thereby generating tension that induces transient or permanent alterations in molecular assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Saha et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Whitehouse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zofall et al., 2006</xref>). Although high-resolution structures of some Swi2/Snf2 domains and their substrate-interacting domains associated with DNA and protein have been previously described, detailed structural information about these ATPases bound to substrate proteins and DNA is largely absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dürr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thomä et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shaw et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hauk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sharma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yamada et al., 2011</xref>). The lack of structural insights is owed to the complex, often multisubunit architecture of Swi2/Snf2 enzyme-containing complexes and their inherent structural flexibilities.</p><p>Mot1 (modifier of transcription 1, also denoted BTAF1) is conserved from protozoa to humans and was the first Swi2/Snf2 member for which the biochemical activity has been demonstrated in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Auble and Hahn, 1993</xref>). Mot1 dissociates TATA box-binding protein (TBP) from DNA in an ATP-dependent manner, thereby directly regulating transcription initiation process and global redistribution of TBP in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Auble and Hahn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dasgupta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Darst et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zentner and Henikoff, 2013</xref>). In contrast to the majority of other Swi2/Snf2 enzymes, Mot1 does not require any associated subunit for its essential activity and serves as a useful model system for studying Swi2/Snf2 enzymes in vitro<italic>.</italic> The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of <italic>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</italic> Mot1 (Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>) in complex with TBP showed that Mot1 consists of 16 HEAT repeats (Huntingtin, elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, lipid kinase TOR) that are arranged in a horseshoe-like shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wollmann et al., 2011</xref>). Of note was that a long loop between HEAT repeats 2 and 3, denoted as the ‘latch’, can bind to TBP's concave site and block TBP–DNA association. Therefore, previous analyses have revealed not only how Mot1 binds TBP, but also that Mot1 functions as a TBP chaperone. Numerous biochemical and more recent structural studies of the Mot1:TBP complex predicted the approximate positioning of the ATPase domain (Mot1<sup>CTD</sup>) with respect to the DNA upstream of the TATA box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Auble and Hahn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Auble et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Darst et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gumbs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sprouse et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wollmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moyle-Heyrman et al., 2012</xref>). A limitation of our previous work on Mot1:TBP was the finding that the crystallized state evidently represents the ‘product’ state after the remodeling reaction took place, but it remained unclear how Mot1 directly impacts the TBP:DNA ‘substrate’ state prior to the remodeling reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wollmann et al., 2011</xref>). Obtaining a substrate state with DNA and TBP turned out to be difficult because Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> can disrupt TBP:DNA by its latch. However, we found that the Mot1:TBP:DNA complex is much more stable in the presence of negative cofactor 2 (NC2), another global transcriptional regulator, whose occurrence coincides with Mot1 and TBP at many genomic locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrau et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dasgupta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hsu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Van Werven et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Spedale et al., 2012</xref>). NC2 is a heterodimer composed of α and β subunits, which highly resemble histones H2A and H2B, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kamada et al., 2001</xref>). We crystallized <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> in complex with TBP, NC2, and a TATA promoter DNA fragment and present here the crystal structure of this complex at 3.8 Å resolution along with biochemical, electron microscopy, and cross-linking studies of the full-length Mot1 complex. Our study provides the first pseudoatomic view of a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase in complex with a DNA:protein substrate complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mot1, TBP, and NC2 form a stable complex on promoter DNA in vitro</title><p>Previous studies found that <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Mot1 and NC2 can simultaneously bind to the TBP:DNA complex and could be isolated as a complex from yeast extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Darst et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Van Werven et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that TBP:NC2 is a physiological substrate for Mot1. In contrast, human NC2 was reported to replace the human Mot1 homolog BTAF1 bound to TBP:DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Klejman et al., 2004</xref>). These observations prompted us to explore whether <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> Mot1, TBP, NC2α, and NC2β form a stable complex with DNA in vitro. In line with the results demonstrated in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Darst et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Van Werven et al., 2008</xref>), we were able to reconstitute the Mot1:TBP:NC2α:NC2β complex in the presence of a TATA box consensus sequence-containing oligonucleotide and to purify it by gel filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> also formed a stable complex with TBP, NC2, and DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). From these data, it appears that complex formation between Mot1, TBP, and NC2 on TATA DNA is evolutionary conserved. Furthermore, specific interactions between Mot1 and TBP—and not for instance interactions between the Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> and the DNA—are sufficient for formation of the pentameric complex.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07432.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Size exclusion chromatography of the <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex.</title><p>Upper panel: elution profiles of Mot1:TBP:DNA complex (gray) and Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex (black).

Mot1 and NC2 occupy opposite binding surfaces on TBP and completely encircle the DNA-bound TBP molecule, which recognizes the minor groove of the TATA sequence. The Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> is oriented towards the upstream DNA (the 5’ end of the TATA box-containing strand) and predominantly binds the convex (‘top’) side of TBP. Furthermore, like in the human TBP:DNA:NC2 complex, NC2 locks TBP onto the promoter utilizing its histone fold domain (NC2<sup>HF</sup>), which is bound to the underside of the DNA, and the C-terminal helix <italic>H5</italic> of NC2β, which reaches around the DNA and binds the convex side of TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kamada et al., 2001</xref>). Of note is that no interpretable electron density of the Mot1 latch residues 98–142 is observed. Therefore, it is probable that the latch is ordered only after binding to TBP's DNA-binding surface.

Although the contacts of Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> and NC2 within the complex are mainly TBP- and/or DNA-mediated, which is consistent with the lack of a stable interaction between Mot1 and NC2 in the absence of DNA in vitro (data not shown), we observed several notable conformational differences. In comparison with the Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>:TBP ‘product’ state, the interaction between the Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> and the convex site of TBP prominently extends towards the C-terminus of Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>, engaging HEAT repeats 4 to 10 and the insertion domain. Additionally, the ‘anchor’ helix <italic>H5</italic> of NC2β bound to the upper side of TBP contacts the insertion domain of Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>, the only non-HEAT repeat stretch in the N-terminal part of Mot1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The additional interactions between the loops and structural elements of the Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> and TBP result in a considerable compaction of the α-helical HEAT repeat array. Therefore, since the capability to rearrange was shown to be an essential property of long α-helical solenoids, shape adaptation and conformational changes of the Mot1's HEAT domain might play an important role in the dissociation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grünwald et al., 2013</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07432.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Features of the Mot1-bound ‘substrate’ complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of the ‘product’ (left, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wollmann et al., 2011</xref>), ‘substrate’ (right, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kamada et al., 2001</xref>), and Mot1-bound ‛substrate’ complex (center).

This observation is of potential importance since the upstream part of DNA binds to the Mot1's Swi2/Snf2 domain, which immediately follows the C-terminus of Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Auble and Hahn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Auble et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sprouse et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Darst et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wollmann et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the linker helix <italic>H4</italic> of NC2β adopts a partially unfolded conformation and its interaction with the major groove of the downstream DNA is lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, Mot1 might influence the C-terminal stirrup of TBP indirectly via interaction with NC2. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, due to the changed DNA geometry, NC2<sup>HF</sup> is moved and rotated with respect to TBP. Despite this change, the direct interaction between the NC2<sup>HF</sup> and DNA does not seem to be affected and is similar to the interaction of histones H2A/H2B with DNA in the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). However, it has to be noted that both sides of the DNA molecule are engaged in the formation of crystal contacts; thereby, we cannot exclude the possibility that the DNA conformation is affected by crystal packing. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that crystal lattice formation can entirely explain the change in DNA trajectory (see ‘Discussion’). In summary, in the Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex crystal structure, we observe a variety of small to medium conformational changes. The observed changes indicate reduced strength of the TBP–DNA and DNA–NC2 interactions as well as stabilization of Mot1–TBP interface due to Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>In the presence of ATP analogs Mot1 ATPase domain adopts a ‘closed’ conformation</title><p>Upstream DNA was shown to play a crucial role not only in the stabilization of Mot1:TBP:DNA complexes, but also in the ATP-mediated dissociation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Auble and Hahn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Darst et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gumbs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sprouse et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moyle-Heyrman et al., 2012</xref>).

Therefore, in order to define the location of the Swi2/Snf2 domain in the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex, we analyzed the full-length complex by chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry (CX-MS) as well as by negative stain electron microscopy (EM, see below).</p><p>To facilitate this analysis, we formed the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex on long TATA box-containing DNA (at least 26 base pairs upstream from the TATA box) and used ADP·BeF<sub>X</sub>, ATPγS, and ADP to lock the ATPase domain in ATP- and ADP-bound states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ponomarev et al., 1995</xref>).

Importantly, on the basis of related SF2 helicases, ATP was shown to bind to the interface of the RecA-fold subdomains and stabilize a ‘closed’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sengoku et al., 2006</xref>). The CX-MS approach can provide insights into the architecture of protein complexes with domain to motif resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nguyen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tosi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Politis et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, to gain insights into the conformation of the Swi2/Snf2 domain in different nucleotide states, we analyzed the 32 cross-links that we detected between the two RecA-fold subdomains within Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> and mapped them onto homology models of Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> in different conformations, based on ‘open’, ‘semi-closed’ and ‘closed’ states. Among these cross-links, 18 do not distinguish between these conformations, since they are all either below (14) or above (4) the distance cutoff of 30 Å, which accounts for the length of the cross-linker and two lysine side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Politis et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> part A). From the cross-links, which do distinguish between the conformations, two were present in all three data sets (ADP, ATPγS, ADP·BeF<sub>x</sub>) and are thus non-informative (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> part B). However, the remaining 4 cross-link sites (8 cross-links total) were detected only in the presence of ADP·BeF<sub>x</sub> and ATPγS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> part C).

Thus, our data suggest that the ATP-mimicking ADP·BeF<sub>x</sub> and ATPγS analogs stabilize a more ‘closed’ conformation. Since we did not detect any cross-links that would be unique for the ADP-supplied sample, whether Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> adopts a distinct state in the presence of this nucleotide or is simply more flexible remains to be addressed in future studies.<table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07432.017</object-id><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Distances of the cross-links detected between RecA1 and RecA2 subdomains of Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> mapped on different structural models</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07432.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07432.017</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"/><th colspan="2">Detected linkages</th><th colspan="3">Euclidean C<sub>α</sub>–C<sub>α</sub> distance [Å]</th><th colspan="3">Total number of detected cross links</th></tr><tr><th>Residue 1</th><th>Residue 2</th><th><italic>Sso</italic>Rad54-like (‘open’)</th><th><italic>Dr</italic>Rad54 (‘closed’)</th><th><italic>Sc</italic>Chd1 (‘semi-closed’)</th><th>ADP·BeF<sub>x</sub></th><th>ATPγS</th><th>ADP</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="7">A</td><td>796</td><td>1013</td><td>16</td><td>22</td><td>20</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>796</td><td>1200</td><td>25</td><td>17</td><td>16</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>842</td><td>1055</td><td>58</td><td>52</td><td>52</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>864</td><td>1039</td><td>39</td><td>49</td><td>50</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1003</td><td>1013</td><td>12</td><td>11</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1003</td><td>1200</td><td>15</td><td>18</td><td>16</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1008</td><td>1200</td><td>12</td><td>14</td><td>12</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">B</td><td>864</td><td>1200</td><td>34</td><td>24</td><td>24</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>919</td><td>1086</td><td>25</td><td>42</td><td>47</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">C</td><td>865</td><td>1200</td><td>31</td><td>20</td><td>21</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>919</td><td>1051</td><td>63</td><td>22</td><td>43</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>919</td><td>1055</td><td>57</td><td>19</td><td>36</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>919</td><td>1060</td><td>51</td><td>25</td><td>36</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Part A shows the cross links, which do not distinguish between the conformations.

Accounting for slight rearrangements within the HEAT repeats, the analysis implies that Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> would contact DNA not further than ∼20 bp upstream from the TATA sequence. This would be in agreement with the requirement reported for the yeast Mot1, which was shown to contact around 17 bp upstream from the TATA box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wollmann et al., 2011</xref>).

The release of TBP from DNA by Mot1, however, does not appear to involve highly processive ATP-dependent DNA tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Auble and Steggerda, 1999</xref>). The changes in the TBP:DNA and NC2:DNA interactions observed in the Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>:TBP:DNA:NC2 crystal structure suggest that Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> binding leads to an alteration of the interaction with promoter DNA. Such a potential destabilization—due to the ring that is formed around DNA by TBP and NC2—does not generally result in removal from TBP from DNA, consistent with our biochemical observations. However, it is possible that TBP:NC2 has an increased lateral mobility on DNA. Interestingly, in single-molecule experiments, NC2 induces dynamic conformational changes in the TBP:DNA interface, enabling TBP to laterally move on DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schluesche et al., 2007</xref>). Consequently, NC2-induced lateral mobility of TBP was proposed to explain how NC2, by sliding TBP, could lead to TBP repositioning from/towards the promoter sites. Although the underlying conformational changes have not been seen in the TBP:DNA:NC2 crystal structure, our structural analysis indeed indicates changes in the DNA trajectory that are consistent with increased lateral mobility. Thus, the analysis of our structural data suggested two models for the observed dissociation of the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex in the presence of ATP. One possibility is that Mot1 uses a Swi2/Snf2 translocase activity to translocate the TBP:NC2 ring along DNA like a sliding clamp without disrupting it. In our EMSAs, the complex would eventually dissociate from DNA when the DNA end is reached. Alternatively, Mot1-induced conformational changes in the TBP:DNA:NC2 substrate could directly dissociate the complex from DNA without translocation along the DNA. To distinguish between these two options, we performed EMSAs using digoxygenin-labeled DNA, the ends of which were blocked with an anti-digoxygenin antibody. The DNA probes used were not much longer than the minimal DNA required for the formation of the complex, consisting of just 30 bp of DNA upstream of the TATA box and 9 bp of DNA downstream. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, we observed no significant impact of the presence or placement of antibody block on either side of the DNA on the efficiency of the remodeling reaction. Therefore, in this setting Mot1 does not appear to apply highly processive sliding of TBP:NC2 along DNA but rather utilizes a more direct, local disruption mechanism consistent with previous studies of TBP–DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Auble and Steggerda, 1999</xref>). Since NC2 and TBP encircle the DNA and do not interact in the absence of DNA, Mot1 likely disrupts the TBP:NC2 interaction as well.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07432.021</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Mot1-mediated displacement of TBP and NC2 from end-blocked DNA templates.</title><p>Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis of ATP-dependent disruption of Mot1:TBP:DNA complexes with and without NC2 as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, but using DNA substrates that carry a digoxygenin label at one end (circle) and fluorescein for DNA detection at the other end (star).

Mot1, apart from being an essential gene regulator, serves as an attractive model system for structural and mechanistic studies of Swi2/Snf2 enzymes. Here, we provide a pseudoatomic structure of the Swi2/Snf2 enzyme Mot1 bound to its protein:DNA substrate and a detailed structural framework for the interaction of Mot1 with the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex.</p><p>Swi2/Snf2 enzymes typically remodel protein:DNA complexes by disrupting the interface between the nucleic and protein partners of the target complex. ATP hydrolysis-dependent translocation of the Swi2/Snf2 ATPase domain could provide most if not all of the chemomechanical force, but a question is whether binding of the remodeler induces conformational changes in the target. Indeed, we find that the association of Mot1 with the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex results in some unexpected conformational changes that may have implications for understanding the ATP-dependent dissociation mechanism. Binding of Mot1 leads to subtle but consistent conformational changes between substrate proteins and DNA, which could prime the complex for ATP-dependent disruption. Although the interface between Mot1 and NC2 that we observe in the crystal structure of the Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex is arguably very small, the contact between Mot1's insertion domain and NC2 could help separate NC2's main TBP anchor helix <italic>H5</italic> from TBP and <italic>H4</italic> from DNA. In support of this, the very C-terminal unstructured region of NC2β following helix <italic>H5</italic> has been previously shown to be responsible for the repressive role of NC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yeung et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yeung et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, compared to the state in the absence of Mot1, the conformation of the upstream DNA appears to be altered. Indeed, recent experiments have shown that Mot1:TBP:DNA and TBP:DNA:NC2 complexes are mobile and flexible due to an equilibrium between bent and unbent DNA states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schluesche et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moyle-Heyrman et al., 2012</xref>). However, consistent with the observation that Mot1-induced dynamic DNA behavior in the TBP:DNA complex occurs also on DNA templates which are too short to directly contact the ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moyle-Heyrman et al., 2012</xref>), we propose that even minimal Mot1-dependent conformational changes could have a critical impact on the TBP–TATA box interaction, especially as the severely bent TATA box itself might accelerate dissociation by acting as a ‘spring’ for rapid release of TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tora and Timmers, 2010</xref>). This would be in line with, for example, DNase I footprinting experiments, which showed that Mot1 binding alters TBP's TATA DNA protection pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Auble and Hahn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Darst et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sprouse et al., 2006</xref>), its ability to discriminate between classical and mutated TATA sequences, and why Mot1:TBP:DNA complexes can be formed by TBP mutants which are defective for TBP:DNA and Mot1:TBP complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gumbs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Klejman et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>We also note that the conformation of TBP bound to DNA in the presence of Mot1 and NC2 is somewhat distinct from that of TBP bound to DNA alone and more similar to TBP bound to Mot1 alone (‘product’ complex, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), although TBP remains in a rather similar conformation. The idea that Mot1 might directly influence TBP structure has been broadly discussed, although there has not yet been any direct evidence for it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Auble et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamkewicz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Darst et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gumbs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sprouse et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Auble, 2009</xref>). Therefore, inducing substantial conformational changes in the conserved TBP core domain seems to be rather unlikely. Nevertheless, according to our observations, Mot1 could still indirectly perturb TBP's C-terminal stirrup, thereby affecting phenylalanine residues responsible for sharp DNA bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>NC2 prevents assembly of TBP with other general transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Meisterernst and Roeder, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Inostroza et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2008</xref>) but is retained on DNA in the absence of functional Mot1 in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Geisberg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schluesche et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Van Werven et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">de Graaf et al., 2010</xref>). While Mot1 forms a stable complex with DNA-bound TBP and NC2, it is fully capable of disrupting this complex in the presence of ATP. Thus, our data suggest that the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex is not only a <italic>bona fide</italic> but perhaps even preferential substrate for Mot1. It is possible that NC2 marks the TBP-containing complexes for Mot1-catalyzed disassembly, e.g., to prevent the formation of aberrant transcription preinitiation complexes on intragenic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Van Werven et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Spedale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Koster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Koster and Timmers, 2015</xref>). In this context, it is important to note that NC2, similarly to histones, has been shown to undergo phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dephoure et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Van Hoof et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Huttlin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alcolea et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the impact of NC2 modifications on Mot1 recruitment and activity needs to be further investigated, especially given that the remodeling activity of Swi2/Snf2 family members can be controlled by post-translational modification of histone substrates or remodeler subunits themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clapier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ferreira et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dutta et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the CX-MS analysis uncovered unanticipated interactions between Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> and NC2. The position of Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> relative to NC2<sup>HF</sup> in our CX-MS- and EM-derived models is analogous to the association of a Swi2/Snf2 domain bound to superhelical location 2 (SHL2), i.e., in direct proximity to the H3/H4 histone pair slightly away from the dyad axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dang and Bartholomew, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dechassa et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, most of the cross-links between the Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> and NC2<sup>HF</sup> map to the protrusion region of the RecA2-like subdomain, the major family-specific insertion region of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Flaus et al., 2006</xref>). A general role for the Swi2/Snf2 protrusions in distorting local DNA structure has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hauk and Bowman, 2011</xref>). For example, Snf2 has been suggested to disturb histone:DNA contacts by wedging the RecA2 lobe between DNA and protein substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dechassa et al., 2012</xref>). In our model, the Swi2/Snf2 protrusions, especially from the RecA2 subdomain, are well positioned to directly affect DNA and NC2:DNA contacts. Therefore, the close proximity of the Mot1 Swi2/Snf2 domain to the NC2 histone fold reveals interesting parallels to the proposed interactions of nucleosome remodelers and histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), although more detailed structural investigation is necessary to elucidate the extent to which these architectures are conserved or distinct.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07432.022</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Remodeling of substrate protein:DNA complexes by Mot1 and comparison to the ISWI-type nucleosome remodeler.</title><p>Left side: the binding of Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> (yellow) induces destabilization of TBP:DNA and NC2:DNA interactions (TBP is shown in blue, NC2 is represented by a green shape).

Our structural analyses suggest a two-step mechanism for the remodeling of TBP:DNA:NC2 by Mot1 that could be relevant for other remodelers that act on histone fold protein substrates. It seems plausible to reason that in the first step, TBP's and NC2's interaction with DNA is destabilized by Mot1 binding in an ATP-independent manner. ATP binding does not result in the disassembly of the complex. The formation of the Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>:NC2 clamp ensures robust dependence on ATP hydrolysis, which triggers the final dissociation step, and which most probably occurs by very short-range translocation of the Swi2/Snf2 domain along the minor groove. Considering the relative orientation of Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> and DNA in our model as well as the 3′–5′ tracking direction shown for other Swi2/Snf2 enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Whitehouse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zofall et al., 2006</xref>), Mot1 may move along upstream DNA towards TBP, disrupting the TBP:promoter interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>N-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged full-length <italic>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</italic> Mot1 (1–1256) and Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> (1–778) and N-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged full-length TBP (1–198) were expressed and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wollmann et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 Rosetta(DE3) cells (Novagen, Germany) were used to co-express His<sub>6</sub>-tagged full-length NC2β (1–147) with the untagged full-length NC2α (1–95).

All reported distances between detected cross-linked lysines refer to the Euclidean C<sub>α</sub>–C<sub>α</sub> distances between the residues.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Figure preparation</title><p>The figures were prepared using UCSF Chimera package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>), PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (v. 1.5.0.4 Schrödinger, LLC) and OriginPro 8 G (OriginLab, Northampton, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Accession NUMBERS</title><p>The coordinates and structure factors of the crystal structure were deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 4WZS.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Gregory D. Bowman, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>SWI/SNF family ATPases play diverse cellular roles, with different classes specialized for different substrates and outcomes. A key aspect of transcriptional regulation and activation is recycling of TATA binding protein (TBP). This recycling is stimulated by the Snf2-type ATPase Mot1. This study builds on previous work by the authors in which they crystallized the HEAT repeat containing N-terminal domain of Mot1 bound to TBP alone. The authors refer to this as representing the “product state”. In this work, to characterize the “substrate state”, the authors solve the crystal structure of the Mot1 N-terminal domain bound to a complex of TBP, DNA and the transcriptional regulator NC2. They provide complementary structural and biochemical analysis to generate a model for the complete Mot1 protein bound to TBP-NC2-DNA. Based on cross-linking mass-spec data and negative stain EM data on full-length Mot1 bound to TBP–DNA–NC2, the authors suggest how the ATPase domain may engage the substrate. Biochemical data are presented to assess how the presence of NC2 affects Mot1 function. The authors present a model in which Mot1 binding to TBP-DNA-NC2 causes an ATP-independent distortion of the DNA that poises the complex for further ATP-dependent destabilization. In this model, interactions between Mot1 and NC2 are coupled to the DNA distortion and the latch domain of the Mot1 N-terminus binds to the DNA-binding surface of TBP to promote full dissociation of TBP from the DNA. The authors further speculate based on cross-linking data that the RecA2-like subdomain of Mot1 may directly affect NC2-DNA contacts.</p><p>Overall the work is of high quality and provides new insights into the mechanism of action of Mot1, as well as new structural models for how transcriptional regulators like NC2 affect Mot1 action. In addition, given that NC2 has histone folds, there are potential parallels to nucleosome remodeling enzymes. Specifically, the authors suggest that interactions between NC2 and the Mot1 N-term observed in the crystal structure and the proposed interactions between the RecA2-like lobe and NC2 HF region inferred from cross-linking data may, together, provide a model for how nucleosome remodelers disrupt histone-DNA interactions.</p><p>Major points that must be addressed:</p><p>1) The fitting of cross-linking data to the ATPase motor modeled in different conformations is used to provide evidence for nucleotide dependent orientations of the ATPase domains. This is interpreted as providing evidence for the “open” conformation in the presence of ADP, as well as a “closed” conformation with ATP-mimics. From the data presented, these conformations appear to be under-determined. In particular, the “open” conformation is unusual, so determining that it is present in the context of a Mot1–TBP–DNA–NC2 complex is potentially an important finding. However, the data to support this more controversial aspect are not compelling. Either this conclusion should be dropped, or a detailed map of cross-links that are gained and lost in support of this large conformational change should be provided. Likewise, there do not appear to be great differences between cross-links of the “semi-closed” and “closed” modeled states. While it is expected that ATP-mimics will stabilize a tightly closed state, the support for one state over the other requires more convincing evidence from cross-linking data to make these claims.</p><p>2) The reviewers are concerned that the model presented by the authors may have the direction of translocation backwards. Based on 3' to 5' directionality, the Snf2 insertions should contact the DNA downstream (in front of, as for the location of helicase “pins”) of the contacts conserved among SF2-type helicases. Since the authors orient the insertions toward TBP, it is likely that TBP would be “pushed” rather than “pulled”, assuming that TBP translocates before disruption. Thus, the experiment to test pulling TBP off the DNA ends (with the digoxygenin-Antibody block), shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, doesn't make sense. The authors should clarify this point.</p><p>3) If the Mot1-based disruption is the same with or without the histone-fold NC2 domains, then this interaction is presumably not critical. While it is fine to speculate on the parallel between the Mot1/NC2-DNA complex and the interaction of chromatin remodelers with nucleosomal DNA, the conclusions are overstated. The authors could test the functional significance of these interactions (between the insertion domain and NC2-<italic>H5</italic>) by mutagenesis. Do mutations in these regions affect the stability of the complex an/or also the rate of remodeling? If the authors feel that such experiments are beyond the scope of this work then they should tone down the claims regarding the parallel to nucleosomal remodelers.</p><p>Other points to address:</p><p>1) The authors conclude that the latch is strictly required in the presence of NC2. Quantification of TBP displacement, preferably as a function of time (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), is needed to make this conclusion rigorous.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, it will help to label the different bands on the gel.</p><p>3) The change in the DNA bend is an important conclusion from this work, but it is difficult to discern in the figures presented. A clearer figure focusing the colors on the DNA bend with and without Mot1 will help.</p><p>4) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the reactions appear to be essentially finished after the first time point. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to say that the rate of the reaction is beyond the time resolution of the experiment, whether NC2 is present or not. The authors should not conclude from this that NC2 does not affect the rate.</p><p>5) The crystallographic analysis is at quite low resolution (3.9 Å). When the structure is first introduced, an explanation should be provided of the steps taken to verify that the structure is being interpreted accurately.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07432.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The fitting of cross-linking data to the ATPase motor modeled in different conformations is used to provide evidence for nucleotide dependent orientations of the ATPase domains.

We rewrote the relevant paragraph (last paragraph of the subsection “In the presence of ATP analogs Mot1 ATPase domain adopts a ‘closed’ conformation”) and we have additionally included the list of the cross-links between the RecA-like subdomains detected in the presence of different nucleotides (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) together with the distances between the cross-linked sites mapped on the three models, each representing different conformation to address the reviewers’ point. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> shows that apart from the cross-linked sites detected in all three experiments or cross-links that cannot be used to distinguish between different conformations, we also detected several cross-links that were present in one and were absent in the other data sets and for which the distances significantly differ depending on the model used for mapping. All of these cross-links were detected in both the ADP·BeF<sub>x</sub> and ATPγS data sets or exclusively in the ADP·BeF<sub>x</sub> data set. Remarkably, all of them are consistent with the “closed” conformation and not with the “open” or “semi-closed”. Thus, our cross-linking data supports the finding that in the presence of ATP-mimicking nucleotides RecA-like subdomains of Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> adopt “closed” conformation. This conclusion is stated in the revised manuscript. The placement of these cross-links was also depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. The graphs showing the distance distributions was moved from the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> to new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref> we showed only the inter-subdomain, and not as before both inter- and intra-subdomain cross-links. Because of the relatively small size of the RecA-like subdomains, with few exceptions all of the cross-links detected within each RecA-like fold lie within the “allowed” distance. We think that this new representation better emphasizes the correlation between the anticipated conformation and the nucleotide state.</p><p>The reviewers rightly pointed out that our cross-linking data does not support the finding that in the presence of ADP the Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> adopts an “open” conformation. Indeed, no cross-links that were unique for the ADP data set were detected. We have dropped the conclusion regarding the “open” conformation and modified this section of the manuscript accordingly (last paragraph of the subsection “In the presence of ATP analogs Mot1 ATPase domain adopts a ‘closed’ conformation”).</p><p>Although the differences between the “closed” and “semi-closed” conformations did not appear to be much different in the initial representation, the data included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> help to distinguish between the fully functional and “semi-closed” autoinhibited state. For this and other reasons we prefer to keep the cross-link distribution mapped on the “semi-closed” conformation represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>. We are convinced that it will be of interest to readers, since only these three crystal structures of eukaryotic/archaeal Swi2/Snf2 domains are available to date.</p><p><italic>2) The reviewers are concerned that the model presented by the authors may have the direction of translocation backwards. Based on 3' to 5' directionality, the Snf2 insertions should contact the DNA downstream (in front of, as for the location of helicase “pins”) of the contacts conserved among SF2-type helicases. Since the authors orient the insertions toward TBP, it is likely that TBP would be “pushed” rather than “pulled”, assuming that TBP translocates before disruption. Thus, the experiment to test pulling TBP off the DNA ends (with the digoxygenin-Antibody block), shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref><italic>, doesn't make sense. The authors should clarify this point</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out our mistake regarding the predicted directionality of the translocation. Indeed, according to the model derived from the CX-MS data, the anticipated Mot1’s movement would likely take place towards in the downstream direction. This mistake was corrected and the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> was modified accordingly.</p><p>Regarding the digoxygenin-antibody block, this is perhaps a misunderstanding. Our dissociation experiments represented by EMSA shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> were designed to distinguish between Mot1 sliding the TBP:NC2 clamp along the DNA over <italic>long distances</italic> using its Swi2/Snf2 translocase domain or alternatively <italic>local</italic> disruption of Mot1:TBP:NC2 complex. The tracking of Mot1:TBP was tested before and it was found that Mot1 does not track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Auble and Steggerda, 1999</xref>). However, TBP in complex with NC2 forms a sliding clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schluesche et al., 2007</xref>), so it is plausible that Mot1:TBP:NC2 tracks, instead of just dissociating. In a physiological context, tracking could redistribute TBP:NC2 in <italic>cis</italic>, while an immediate dissociation could redistribute it in trans (e.g. to different promoters). Our experiment shows that the mechanism employing long-distance processive tracking as shown for chromatin remodeling enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Saha et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Whitehouse et al., 2003</xref>) is not likely to occur in the Mot1:TBP:NC2 system. We believe that Mot1 disrupts TBP and TBP:NC2 via a non-processive mechanism, e.g. by 1 or a few bp “translocation”, which in principle would be enough to dissociate the protein substrates from a highly constrained DNA. We have used two different DNA substrates that had the antibody block placed on either end to test for both possible tracking directions. We hope that the revised manuscript clarifies this concern.</p><p><italic>3) If the Mot1-based disruption is the same with or without the histone-fold NC2 domains, then this interaction is presumably not critical. While it is fine to speculate on the parallel between the Mot1/NC2-DNA complex and the interaction of chromatin remodelers with nucleosomal DNA, the conclusions are overstated. The authors could test the functional significance of these interactions (between the insertion domain and NC2-</italic>H5<italic>) by mutagenesis. Do mutations in these regions affect the stability of the complex an/or also the rate of remodeling? If the authors feel that such experiments are beyond the scope of this work then they should tone down the claims regarding the parallel to nucleosomal remodelers</italic>.</p><p>We thank the referees for pointing this out. We indeed think that analysis of mutants would require in vitro as well as in vivo assays and are beyond the scope of this work. As suggested, we toned down the claims regarding the parallel to nucleosome remodelers.</p><p><italic>Other points to address</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The authors conclude that the latch is strictly required in the presence of NC2. Quantification of TBP displacement, preferably as a function of time (as in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic>B</xref><italic>), is needed to make this conclusion rigorous</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting this experiment. We performed kinetic analyses as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> but using the Mot1<sup>∆latch</sup> protein. Fully consistent with our prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wollmann et al., 2011</xref>), we found that Mot1<sup>∆latch</sup> was impaired in dissociation of TBP–DNA, but not completely dead catalytically. We found that Mot1<sup>∆latch</sup> was also defective for dissociation of TBP:DNA:NC2 complexes, but in contrast to the steady-state distribution of complexes after long ATP incubation times, there was no significant difference in the catalytic activity of Mot1<sup>∆latch</sup> for TBP:DNA vs TBP:DNA:NC2 complexes in this kinetic assay. It was clear from the EMSA data in the original submission that such a differential effect was at best modest; in the revised manuscript we state that the requirement for the latch is no different using complexes with and without NC2 (“The latch was important for this process in reactions both with and without NC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>)”), and we have included the new kinetic data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>, it will help to label the different bands on the gel</italic>.</p><p>We added the labels to the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) The change in the DNA bend is an important conclusion from this work, but it it is difficult to discern in the figures presented.

The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> shows the comparison of the DNA bound to TBP in the presence and absence of Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> from TBP’s bottom (concave) side. We have moved the old panel C from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>.

We have modified this statement in the text accordingly (“However, we were not able to detect any significant changes in the Mot1-catalyzed TBP:DNA dissociation rate or the ATP hydrolysis rate of this process in the presence of NC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>)”).</p><p><italic>5) The crystallographic analysis is at quite low resolution (3.9 Å).

In particular, we mention in the main text that chain tracing is validated by the anomalous signal of the selenium atoms. After the manuscript was submitted we further improved our model. We noticed some radiation damage in the later frames and could process the data to higher resolution (from 3.9 to 3.8 Å) improving also data and model statistics: significantly lowered R<sub>meas</sub>, at the same <italic>I</italic>/σ<italic>I</italic> and completeness level (see updated <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We then re-refined our model against the revisited data, which lowered R<sub>free</sub> calculated against copied and extended R<sub>free</sub> set.
