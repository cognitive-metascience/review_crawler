motor rhythmicity. The identity of <italic>C. elegans</italic> oscillators remains unknown. Through cell ablation, electrophysiology, and calcium imaging, we show: (1) forward and backward locomotion is driven by different oscillators; (2) the cholinergic and excitatory A-class motor neurons exhibit intrinsic and oscillatory activity that is sufficient to drive backward locomotion in the absence of premotor interneurons; (3) the UNC-2 P/Q/N high-voltage-activated calcium current underlies A motor neuron’s oscillation; (4) descending premotor interneurons AVA, via an evolutionarily conserved, mixed gap junction and chemical synapse configuration, exert state-dependent inhibition and potentiation of A motor neuron’s intrinsic activity to regulate backward locomotion. Thus, motor neurons themselves derive rhythms, which are dually regulated by the descending interneurons to control the reversal motor state. These and previous findings exemplify compression: essential circuit properties are conserved but executed by fewer numbers and layers of neurons in a small locomotor network.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motor neuron</kwd><kwd>rhythm</kwd><kwd>Central Pattern Generator (CPG)</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>C. elegans</kwd><kwd>oscillation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP93619 MOP123250</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhen</surname><given-names>Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>262112-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhen</surname><given-names>Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS-082525</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhen</surname><given-names>Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31671052</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Shangbang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Junior Thousand Talents Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0222170004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Shangbang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wuhan Morning Light Plan of Youth Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017050304010295</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Shangbang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM084491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alkema</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS-035546</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Yishi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS-084835</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fang-Yen</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Motor neurons are rhythm generators for backward locomotion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Central pattern generators (CPGs) are rhythm-generating neurons and neural circuits with intrinsic oscillatory activities. Across the animal phyla, CPGs underlie rhythm of motor behaviors that are either continuous, such as breathing and heartbeat, or episodic, such as chewing and locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grillner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grillner and Wallén, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kiehn, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marder and Bucher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marder and Calabrese, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Selverston and Moulins, 1985</xref>). CPGs that drive locomotor behaviors generally require signals from the central or peripheral nervous systems for initiation or reconfiguration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pearson, 1993</xref>).</p><p>The concept of locomotor CPGs originated from the observation that decerebrate cats could sustain rhythmic hind limb muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown, 1911</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown, 1914</xref>). In deafferented locusts, flight motor neurons (MNs) exhibited rhythmic activity in response to non-rhythmic electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wilson, 1961</xref>). Isolated nerve or spinal cords from the leech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggman and Kristan, 2006</xref>), lamprey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wallén and Williams, 1984</xref>), rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Juvin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kiehn et al., 1992</xref>) and cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guertin et al., 1995</xref>) are able to generate rhythmic MN activity and/or fictive locomotion. These findings imply that locomotor systems can intrinsically sustain rhythmic and patterned electrical activitives, independent of inputs from the descending neural networks or sensory organs.</p><p>Locomotor CPGs have been located in several animals. For most invertebrates, they consist of premotor interneurons (INs) that drive MN activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marder and Bucher, 2001</xref>). In vertebrates, they reside in the spinal cords, where multiple pools of premotor INs instruct and coordinate the output of different MN groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grillner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kiehn, 2006</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">, 2016</xref>). MNs can retrogradely regulate the activity of CPG INs or premotor INs in the crayfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heitler, 1978</xref>), leech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rela and Szczupak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Szczupak, 2014</xref>), <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Song et al., 2016</xref>) in a conserved, mixed electric and chemical synapse configuration.</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> generates rhythmic and propagating body bends that propel either forward or backward locomotion. Synaptic wiring of the adult locomotor system has been depicted by serial electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">White et al., 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">White et al., 1986</xref>). There are five MN classes: A, B, D, AS and VC in the ventral nerve cord. The A (A-MN), B (B-MN), and D (D-MN) classes contribute the vast majority of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in the body. Each class is divided into subgroups that innervate dorsal or ventral muscles. Repeated motor units comprised of the A-, B- and D-MNs make tiled dorsal and ventral NMJs along the body.</p><p>Both B- and A-MNs are cholinergic and excitatory, potentiating muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao and Zhen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nagel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Richmond and Jorgensen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">White et al., 1986</xref>), whereas D-MNs are GABAergic and inhibitory, promoting muscle relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao and Zhen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liewald et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McIntire et al., 1993</xref>). B- and A-MNs form dyadic synapses, with body wall muscles and D-MNs that in turn contralateral muscles as co-recipients. This configuration supports reciprocal dorsal-ventral cross-inhibition for body bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">White et al., 1986</xref>).</p><p>Descending and ascending premotor INs innervate excitatory MNs. Three pairs of INs - AVA, AVB, and PVC - extend axons along the ventral nerve cord, and form synapses to all members of the MN classes that they partner with. They contribute to two sub-circuits: a forward movement-promoting unit, where AVB and PVC make electrical and chemical synapses with the B-MNs, respectively, and a backward movement-promoting unit, where AVA innervate the A-MNs through both electrical and chemical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">White et al., 1986</xref>; illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Reciprocal inhibition between the two sub-circuits underlies stabilization of, and transition between the forward and reversal motor states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kawano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roberts et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29915.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Body bends persist upon the ablation of premotor INs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The removal of premotor INs or MNs exerts different effects on body bends. <italic>Upper panel</italic>: schematics of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> motor circuit components and connectivity in wildtype animals (i) and upon ablation of respective neuronal populations (ii, iii).

One minute after the transfer, a 2-minute video of the crawling animal was recorded on a modified Axioskop 2 (Zeiss, Germany) equipped with an automated tracking stage MS-2000 (Applied Scientific Instruments, Eugene, OR) and a digital camera (Hamamatsu, Japan).</p><p>Imaging plates were prepared as follows: a standard NGM plate was seeded with a thin layer of OP50 12–14 hr before the experiment. Immediately before the transfer of worms, the OP50 lawn was spread evenly across the plate with a sterile bent glass rod. Movements exhibited by <italic>C. elegans</italic> were recorded using an in-house developed automated tracking program. All images were captured with a 10X objective at 10 frames per second. Data recorded on the same plate and on the same day were pooled, quantified and compared.</p><p>Post-imaging analyses utilized an in-house developed ImageJ Plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kawano et al., 2011</xref>) and in-house written MATLAB scripts. Images from each animal were divided into 33 body segments. The mid-point was used to track and calculate the velocity and direction of movements between each frame. The percentage of total frames exhibiting pausing, backward or forward locomotion was defined by the mid-point displacement: between –1 pixel/second (- movements toward the tail) and + 1 pixel/second (+ movements toward the head) was defined as pause, less than –1 pixel/second backward, and more than + 1 pixel/s forward movement. The angle between three joint points was used to calculate the curvature of the middle point loci. The curvature value for each body segment was plotted, from the head to tail over time, and converted as a color map of movements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Calcium imaging of immobilized or crawling animals</title><p>DA9 recording from immobilized intact animals (all calcium imaging figures except <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) was carried out as follows: animals were glued as described for electrophysiological recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2015</xref>), and imaged with a 60X water objective (Nikon, Japan) and sCMOS digital camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0V2, Japan) at 100 ms per frame. Data were collected by MicroManager and analyzed by ImageJ.</p><p>Simultaneous imaging of multiple A-MNs (VA10, VA11, and DA7) in moving animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) was performed as described in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kawano et al., 2011</xref>). Animals were placed on a 2% agarose pad on a slide, suspended in the M9 buffer, covered by a coverslip, and imaged with a 63X objective. Neurons were identified by their stereotypic anatomical organization. Multiple Regions Of Interest (ROI) containing the MN soma of interest were defined using an in-house developed MATLAB script. Videos were recorded with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu C2400, Japan) at 100 ms per frame. Simultaneous velocity recording at each time point was measured using an Image J plug-in developed in-house (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kawano et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In both preparations, GCaMP and RFP signals were simultaneously acquired using the Dual-View system (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ), and the GCaMP/RFP ratios were calculated to control for motion artifacts and fluorescence bleaching during recording. Late L4 stage animals were used for all calcium imaging experiments, when the <italic>Punc-4</italic> promoter exhibits strongest expression in A-MNs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Region-specific light-ablation of MNs and behavioral analyses</title><p>Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> were collected from animals where A-type MNs were ablated using three strains, where A- or A/B-MNs were labeled by RFP. For miniSOG-based ablation, ZM9062 <italic>hpIs583</italic> (A- and B-MNs miniSOG) or YX167 <italic>hpIs366/qhIs4; qhIs1</italic> (A-MNs miniSOG) L2 larva were immobilized on a 4% agar pad with 5 mM tetramisole. Region-specific illumination was performed by targeting a 473 nm laser at an arbitrary portion of the animal using a digital micromirror device (DMD) through a 20X objective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leifer et al., 2011</xref>). The final irradiance at the stage was approximately 16 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>. The DMD was set to pulse the laser with a duty cycle of 1 s on, 0.8 s off, for a total of 300 of total ON time. Each animal was immobilized for a maximum of 30 min.</p><p>Most posterior MNs (VA12-DA9) ablation was also performed in YX148 <italic>qhIs4; qhIs1</italic> (A/B RFP) by a pulsed infrared laser illumination system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churgin et al., 2013</xref>) modified with increased output power. L2 animals were immobilized in the same manner. A single 2 ms pulse was applied to each neuron through a 60X objective visualized by RFP. This procedure never affected VA11, the nearest non-targeted neuron. Following ablation, each animal was transferred to an OP50-seeded NGM plate and allowed to grow to the day 1 adult stage. Controls were animals of the same genotype treated identically except without blue or infrared laser illumination.</p><p>For behavior recordings, each animal was transferred to an unseeded NGM plate, and on plate crawling was recorded for at least 5 min under bright field illumination. If the animal became sluggish or idle, the plate was agitated using the vibration motor from a cell phone. After recordings, each animal was imaged at 40X for RFP pattern for the entire body and we manually assigned present and missing neurons based on their relative positions and commissural orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">White et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">White et al., 1986</xref>). For YX167, where A- and B-MNs were labeled, two researchers independently analyzed the same image and discussed, and agreed on the identification. We only included data from animals where we were confident of the identity of neurons.</p><p>Analyses of locomotion of ablated and control animals were carried out using WormLab (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT) and in-house Matlab codes. Data from all three ablation methods were pooled to generate the summary statistics. Bouts of reversals that lasted at least 3 s were analyzed for the speed of wave propagation. Curvature segmentations from the behavioral recordings were constructed using WormLab (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT). Wave speed was measured as a function of body coordinate and time, by taking the derivative of each curvature map with respect to time (dκ/dt), and to body coordinate (dκ/dC). Wave speed was defined as the ratio between these gradients (body coordinate/s). Wave speed was averaged over the length of each bout, and binned for the anterior (5–25% of body length from the head), mid-body (40–60%), and posterior (75–95%) region in each bout.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Electrophysiology and optogenetic stimulation</title><p>Dissection and recording were carried out using protocols and solutions described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao and Zhen, 2011</xref>), which was modified from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mellem et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Richmond and Jorgensen, 1999</xref>). Briefly, 1- or 2-day-old hermaphrodite adults were glued (Histoacryl Blue, Braun, Germany) to a sylgard-coated cover glass covered with bath solution (Sylgard 184, Dowcorning, Auburn, MI). After clearing the viscera by suction through a glass pipette, the cuticle flap was turned and gently glued down using WORMGLU (GluStitch Inc., Canada) to expose the neuromuscular system. The integrity of the anterior ventral body muscle and the ventral nerve cord were visually examined via DIC microscopy (Eclipse FN1, Nikon), and muscle cells were patched using 4–6 MΩ-resistant borosilicate pipettes (1B100F-4, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Pipettes were pulled by micropipette puller P-1000 (Sutter, Novato, CA), and fire-polished by microforge MF-830 (Narishige, Japan). Membrane currents and action potentials were recorded in the whole-cell configuration by a Digidata 1440A and a MultiClamp 700A amplifier, using the Clampex 10 and processed with Clampfit 10 software (Axon Instruments, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Currents were recorded at holding potential of –60 mV, while action potentials were recorded at 0 pA. Data were digitized at 10–20 kHz and filtered at 2.6 kHz. The pipette solution contains (in mM): K-gluconate 115; KCl 25; CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.1; MgCl<sub>2</sub> 5; BAPTA 1; HEPES 10; Na<sub>2</sub>ATP 5; Na<sub>2</sub>GTP 0.5; cAMP 0.5; cGMP 0.5, pH7.2 with KOH,~320 mOsm. cAMP and cGMP were included to maintain the activity and longevity of the preparation. The bath solution consists of (in mM): NaCl 150; KCl 5; CaCl<sub>2</sub> 5; MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1; glucose 10; sucrose 5; HEPES 15, pH7.3 with NaOH,~330 mOsm. Chemicals and blockers were obtained from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Experiments were performed at room temperatures (20–22<sup>o</sup>C).</p><p>Optogenetic stimulation of transgenic animals was performed with an LED lamp, at 470 nm (from 8 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) for <italic>hpIs166</italic> and <italic>hpIs279</italic>, and at 625 nm (from 1.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), for <italic>hpIs569</italic> and <italic>hpIs578</italic>, respectively, controlled by the Axon amplifier software. One-second light exposure, a condition established by our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2015</xref>), was used to evoke the PSC bursts.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Akinao Nose (Reviewer #2); David Biron (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very interesting manuscript that is very important for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> model system, but has real general interest as well. It dissects the motor system of <italic>C. elegans</italic> by selective cell ablation and mutant analysis and uses behavior and electrophysiology as assays to identify and define the reverse locomotion &quot;CPG&quot;. While CPG may not be the right term in the minds of many, the authors do indeed identify a source of endogenous oscillation in motor neurons that underlies rhythmic reverse locomotion. For reverse locomotion the conclusion must be that the A-MNs, which are known to be dedicated to reverse locomotion, form a chain of motor neuron oscillators. The implication is that the B-MNs motor neurons, which are known to be dedicated to forward locomotion, form a similar chain of oscillators, but it is not nailed down completely and a head oscillator certainly exists that is not characterized. The limitation of the detailed analysis to reverse locomotion is not a real drawback, however, because the analysis uncovers important properties of the reverse locomotion circuit. Membrane potential oscillations are supported by HVA Ca channels (UNC-2), and very interestingly, premotor interneurons are not necessary for reverse (or forward) locomotion but exert state dependent control over A-MN oscillations and reverse locomotion initiation and maintenance. A-type-INs make mixed heterotypic and rectifying gap junction and excitatory chemical synapses on A-MNs to exert this control. At rest, AVA-A gap junctions dampen the excitability of coupled premotor INs and oscillatory activity of MNs to reduce propensity for reversals. Upon activation, AVA potentiate AMNs predominantly through excitatory chemical synapses, with a minor contribution from gap junctions. This is a truly interesting and important finding and should be more front and center in Discussion.</p><p>The work is very carefully and thoroughly done with appropriate controls, and the data analyzed appropriately. Necessary data appear in figures in an easily accessible form.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please explain why B-MNs, in addition to premotor INs, have to be ablated for the A-MN to show intrinsic rhythmic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). If the authors' model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>) is correct, the presence or absence of B-MNs should have no consequence on the intrinsic activity of the A-MN.</p><p>2) Subsection “A-MNs exhibit oscillatory activity independent of premotor IN inputs”, last paragraph: The authors state that all A-MNs show oscillating activity but with differences in the intensity. However, the authors only show results on DA9 in the figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Can other A-MNs be illustrated, perhaps in supplementary figures to this figure? We also wonder what the phase relations are among the A-MNs in different segments and between antagonistic A-MNs (e.g., VA10 and DA7). Are they activated simultaneously, with phase difference, or with no phasic relationship? This is an important point in considering the nature of the CPG.</p><p>3) The full distributions of velocities (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) are useful. It would be convenient to also have summary statistics available at a glance. Could mean velocities and respective standard deviations be added to each of the velocity distribution panels throughout the manuscript? Preferably, on the figure itself as opposed to the caption/text. This seems more useful than p&lt;0.001, which is quite obvious from the plot.</p><p>4) Subsection “A-MNs exhibit oscillatory activity independent of premotor IN inputs”, fourth paragraph: the data in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 is interpreted without much justification. Why did peaks in A-20% qualify as rPSC bursts while peaks in B-1% didn't? What were the criteria?</p><p>5) Subsection “A-MNs exhibit oscillatory activity independent of premotor IN inputs”, last paragraph: calcium imaging was performed in L4 larvae as opposed to measuring rPSCs in adult preps. Was this due to body thickness? Could development have contributed to the difference in the frequencies? Is there a difference in reversal behavior between L4 and adult B-MN / INs ablated worms?</p><p>6) The Results section &quot;UNC-2 is an endogenous constituent of A-MN oscillation&quot; is not sufficiently clear regarding the calcium flows. The second paragraph states that loss of function of the VGCC UNC-2 severely reduces calcium oscillations. Prior to explaining <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D-F</xref>, it bears mentioning that UNC-2 is thought to play two separable roles in A-MNs: promoting synaptic transmission and somatic Ca oscillations. This notion is supported by localizing UNC-2 to MN somas but that is only mentioned at the end of the section. Similarly, adding &quot;despite the somatic oscillations remaining intact&quot; to the end of the first paragraph would clarify. Finally, could the authors comment about the origin of the calcium they observe? The key role of UNC-2 seems to suggest that it is predominantly extracellular. Is this a valid conclusion?</p><p>7) A simple prediction of the model is that in the absence of B-MNs/INs or if AVA is optogenetically activated, <italic>unc-7</italic> mutants should exhibit increased reversal speed and/or persistence. Unfortunately, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> does not contain <italic>unc-7</italic> behavioral (reversal velocity/persistence) data. The optogenetic experiment may well be too onerous. Scoring reversal speed/persistence for an existing strain or explaining why the simple prediction is wrong may fall within the scope of this work.</p><p>8) &quot;[P]ersistent body bends in premotor IN-less animals mainly originated from A-MN activity.&quot; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> seems to suggest that B-less worms are quite persistent (albeit slow) in their forward motion. Are the authors referring to the higher curvature of the backward-motion body waves here? If so, it is not clear. Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows that ~25% of forward motion is replaced by pauses (as compared to reversals). Could this just be a result of the fact that the independent oscillator(s) in the head are somewhat effective at interfering with forward body waves while no equivalent independent oscillator resides in the tail?</p><p>9) The manuscript does not comment on the ~50s calcium oscillation cycle in A-MNs. Does it correspond to some behavioral timescale or have a hypothesized significance? Do the mean velocities seem related? It may be the case that there is not much to say on the subject.</p><p>10) The writing needs reconsideration. Much of the important information is in the figure legends and the paper is thus tedious to follow. Putting more description of the figure in the text would help. The figures are very complicated and the data could be separated out into smaller figures. Word choice is not always the best and led to confusion for this reviewer. Many detailed examples of words that need clarifying are made on the manuscript pdf in Discussion and Introduction. The kymograms could be better explained so that readers unfamiliar with them can understand what the complex patterns in these kymograms from ablated and mutant animals mean.</p><p>11) The concept of CPG is not well articulated and its meaning is stretched a bit. You are really dealing with individual neuronal oscillators and not CPGs and equating the structure of the reverse locomotion circuit in <italic>C. elegans</italic> with vertebrate spinal cord or even invertebrate networks like that for leech swimming will be a hard sell to a veteran CPG person like myself. To my mind this is not the real interest of the paper. There are two major impacts arising from this work. 1) You have solved a pressing problem in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurobiology which has plagued the field for over a decade. This should be emphasized. 2) You have made a truly brilliant discovery of the state dependent regulation of A-MN oscillations by the conjoint electrical and chemical synapses of premotor interneurons. This should be a centerpiece of the paper. The ideas on circuit compression are not compelling. Is the circuit compressed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> or is it expanded by evolution in leech? The first neurons in evolution were probably multifunctional (sensory-motor) and then evolution led to proliferation of neurons and specialization. That invertebrate neurons are very multifunctional has to be a truism since I was a graduate student and that motor neurons can be oscillatory has also been known as long. These arguments should be deemphasized.</p><p>12) Title could be shortened and refocused to match the revised Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29915.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very interesting manuscript that is very important for the C. elegans model system, but has real general interest as well.

Further, we present additional calcium imaging and behavioural results that support the state-dependent dual-regulation model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The work is very carefully and thoroughly done with appropriate controls, and the data analyzed appropriately. Necessary data appear in figures in an easily accessible form.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please explain why B-MNs, in addition to premotor INs, have to be ablated for the A-MN to show intrinsic rhythmic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). If the authors' model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>) is correct, the presence or absence of B-MNs should have no consequence on the intrinsic activity of the A-MN.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion. A-MN’s intrinsic activity does not depend on the presence or absence of B-MNs; B-MNs only interfere with their propagation after premotor INs are removed. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and others, the purpose of removing B-MNs along with premotor interneurons was to ensure that rPSC signals that we examined were from A-MNs.</p><p>The behavioural phenotype of premotor IN ablated animals (Kawano et al., 2011; this study), either alone or in combination with A-MNs or B-MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) indicate that in the absence of premotor INs, A-MNs and B-MNs underlie the antagonizing driving force for reverse and forward movements, respectively. The shallow bending after the co-ablation of premotor interneurons and A-MNs indicates that B-MNs have lower intrinsic activity. A previous study showed that body bending can activate B-MNs (Wen et al., 2012). Hence, if A-MNs remain active in the absence of premotor interneurons, the resulted body bending may subsequently activate B-MNs that reside at the region. Without removing B-MNs, we could not be certain that the observed oscillatory signals were from A-MNs.</p><p>Consistent with this notion, we performed the complementary experiment. In preparations where we removed A-MNs along with premotor INs, the mini frequencies were drastically reduced, but the rPSC burst was not increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). These results confirmed that rPSCs we observed upon removing premotor INs were primarily driven by A-MNs. We explained this point (subsection “A-MNs exhibit oscillatory activities independent of premotor IN inputs”, third paragraph).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29915.027</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Co-ablation of premotor INs and A-MNs did not increase the rPSC burst.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example traces of postsynaptic currents (recorded at -60 mV) in animals without (Control) and with (Ablated) premotor IN- and A-MN-ablation.(B, C) Quantification of the PSC burst and minature PSC (mPSC) frequency, without (Ctrl) and with (Ablated) the ablation of premotor INs and A-MNs.

However, the authors only show results on DA9 in the figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Can other A-MNs be illustrated, perhaps in supplementary figures to this figure? We also wonder what the phase relations are among the A-MNs in different segments and between antagonistic A-MNs (e.g., VA10 and DA7). Are they activated simultaneously, with phase difference, or with no phasic relationship? This is an important point in considering the nature of the CPG.</p></disp-quote><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the DA9 calcium imaging experiments were performed in animals immobilized by glue. This preparation was to examine A-MN activity with minimal proprioceptive feedback or coupling. DA9 exhibited the most robust calcium signals than other A-MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29915.028</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>An example trace of simultaneous DA9 and VA11 calcium oscillation in an immobolized animal after the ablation of premotor INs/B-MNs.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29915-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig><p>We thought that the phasic relationships among multiple A-MNs should be analyzed in moving animals. This was why we performed simultaneous calcium imaging data for three A-MNs (VA10, DA7 and VA11) in animals where we removed all premotor INs and B-MNs, and when animals were moving (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref> in the original manuscript, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in the revised manuscript). We show that these A-MNs exhibited phasic relationships that correlated with alternative dorsal/ventral bending and anterior/posterior propagation during movement. Specifically, DA7, which activates dorsal muscles, exhibited activity changes that were anti-phasic to that of ventral muscle activators (VA10 and VA11), whereas VA11’s activity changes preceded that of VA10.</p><p>To clearly convey the information, we now show these results in a separate figure, with an illustration of the spatial relationship of these neurons(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The full distributions of velocities (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) are useful. It would be convenient to also have summary statistics available at a glance. Could mean velocities and respective standard deviations be added to each of the velocity distribution panels throughout the manuscript? Preferably, on the figure itself as opposed to the caption/text. This seems more useful than p&lt;0.001, which is quite obvious from the plot.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful suggestion. We added mean velocities and deviations in figures where they help to clarify their effect on animals’ motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) or velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The key message for other figures such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> was the change in preference of direction: in the absence of premotor interneurons, ablation of B-MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>) or A-MNs (Figure 2ii) led to predominantly forward or reversal movements, whereas ablating D-MNs (Figure 2iii) did not change the ‘kink’ state. So we did not show mean velocities in these figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “A-MNs exhibit oscillatory activity independent of premotor IN inputs”, fourth paragraph: the data in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 is interpreted without much justification. Why did peaks in A-20% qualify as rPSC bursts while peaks in B-1% didn't? What were the criteria?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion. We applied the criteria that were defined in a previous study (Gao et al., 2015). Briefly, rPSC bursts consisted of a train of depolarization events (-50 – -300 pA, 3–10 Hz), which is distinct from the high-frequency monophasic and multiphasic mPSC events (subsection “A-MNs exhibit oscillatory activities independent of premotor IN inputs”, second paragraph). Events in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 (B-1%) fell in the second category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29915.029</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Power spectrum analysis of the current traces in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 A-20% and B-1% revealed no ~10Hz rPSCs burst phase in B-1%.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29915-resp-fig3-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “A-MNs exhibit oscillatory activity independent of premotor IN inputs”, last paragraph: calcium imaging was performed in L4 larvae as opposed to measuring rPSCs in adult preps. Was this due to body thickness? Could development have contributed to the difference in the frequencies? Is there a difference in reversal behavior between L4 and adult B-MN / INs ablated worms?</p></disp-quote><p>We used L4 animals for calcium imaging analyses for two reasons: 1) we used L4 animals for behavioural analyses; 2) the Punc-4 promoter that we used to express the calcium sensor is strong in A-MNs in L4, but falls off sharply afterwards, making recording in adults more noisy. We don’t think that the developmental difference leads to the two-fold difference of the frequency of rPSC and calcium oscillation. In a few DA9 calcium imaging recordings that we obtained in young adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>), they exhibited similar frequency as in L4.</p><fig id="respfig4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29915.030</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Example traces of DA9 calcium oscillation in a young adult before (Control) and after ablation (Ablated) of premotor INs/B-MNs.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29915-resp-fig4-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The Results section &quot;UNC-2 is an endogenous constituent of A-MN oscillation&quot; is not sufficiently clear regarding the calcium flows. The second paragraph states that loss of function of the VGCC UNC-2 severely reduces calcium oscillations. Prior to explaining <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D-F</xref>, it bears mentioning that UNC-2 is thought to play two separable roles in A-MNs: promoting synaptic transmission and somatic Ca oscillations. This notion is supported by localizing UNC-2 to MN somas but that is only mentioned at the end of the section. Similarly, adding &quot;despite the somatic oscillations remaining intact&quot; to the end of the first paragraph would clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have revised this section accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, could the authors comment about the origin of the calcium they observe? The key role of UNC-2 seems to suggest that it is predominantly extracellular. Is this a valid conclusion?</p></disp-quote><p>These results are indeed consistent with UNC-2 being the origin of extracellular calcium. We did not make an explicit claim previously because of the possibility that release from the intracellular calcium store, upon such an extracellular entry, also contribute to the observed calcium profile in DA9 soma. We have now clarified this point (e.g. subsection “The P/Q/N-type VGCC underlies A-MN oscillation independently of synaptic transmission”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) A simple prediction of the model is that in the absence of B-MNs/INs or if AVA is optogenetically activated, unc-7 mutants should exhibit increased reversal speed and/or persistence. Unfortunately, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> does not contain unc-7 behavioral (reversal velocity/persistence) data. The optogenetic experiment may well be too onerous. Scoring reversal speed/persistence for an existing strain or explaining why the simple prediction is wrong may fall within the scope of this work.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions. We performed new experiments on <italic>unc-7</italic> mutants, results from which further validate the hypothesis that AVA premotor INs inhibit A-MN activity through gap junctions to reduce propensity for the reverse motor state.</p><p>First, AVA-specific restoration of UNC-7 was sufficient to restore inhibition of A-MN oscillation in <italic>unc-7</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D-F</xref> in revised manuscript). Previously, we showed that in <italic>unc-7</italic> mutants, DA9 exhibited calcium oscillation in the presence of premotor INs, implicating that AVA failed to inhibit A-MN’s activity in the absence of gap junction coupling. Because UNC-7 expression is not restricted to AVA, we performed the rescue experiment to confirm that this effect was due to the specific loss of UNC-7 in AVA. Through the FLT-FRT system, we generated AVA-specific restoration of UNC-7 in <italic>unc-7</italic> mutants, and found that DA9 calcium oscillation was indeed attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D-F</xref> in revised manuscript).</p><p>Next, we performed behavioural analyses to examine the effect of AVA-A gap junction coupling. In the presence of premotor INs/B-MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G-I</xref> in revised manuscript), as predicted from the model, <italic>unc-7</italic> mutants exhibited a drastic increase in the propensity for reverses at the expense of forward movement; the restoration of UNC-7 in AVA alone restored the animal’s preference for the forward movement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) &quot;[P]ersistent body bends in premotor IN-less animals mainly originated from A-MN activity.&quot; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> seems to suggest that B-less worms are quite persistent (albeit slow) in their forward motion. Are the authors referring to the higher curvature of the backward-motion body waves here? If so, it is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry about the lack of clarity. We reworded relevant sections in the revised manuscript; a more detailed explanation follows.</p><p>In the absence of premotor INs, animals continued to exhibit body bends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). When we further ablated A-MNs, animals were able to move forward slowly, but with little bending (Figure 2Bii). When we further ablated B-MNs, premotor INs-less animals executed reverse movement with body bending. These results suggest that A-MNs have higher intrinsic activities than B-MNs.</p><p>But in the absence of premotor interneurons, B-MNs strongly antagonize A-MN-driven reverse movements. Because B-MNs are activated by body bending (Wen et al., 2012), a simple interpretation is that in the absence of premotor INs, body bending primarily results from the high intrinsic A-MNs, which may subsequently potentiate B-MNs that reside in the body segment to interfere with their propagation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows that ~25% of forward motion is replaced by pauses (as compared to reversals). Could this just be a result of the fact that the independent oscillator(s) in the head are somewhat effective at interfering with forward body waves while no equivalent independent oscillator resides in the tail?</p></disp-quote><p>While the ‘pause’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) describes the lack of centroid displacement in either A- or B-ablated animals, causes for pauses were different. We consistently observed that 1) premotor IN/A-MN ablated animals moved forward slowly and stalled frequently; 2) premotor IN/B-MN ablated animals reversed with deep body bends, but their reversals were often interrupted by head bends that tried to pull the anterior body forward, and the pull hindered mid-point displacement (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that these behaviour results suggest that there is no equivalent independent reversal oscillator in the tail. Consistent with this notion, animals without premotor INs or MNs could exhibit high frequency oscillation of the head, but not of the tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref>).</p><p>We refrained from elaborating on these hypotheses because they suggest complex, yet-to-be addressed relationships between the forward and reversal oscillators. We hope to resolve it in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The manuscript does not comment on the ~50s calcium oscillation cycle in A-MNs. Does it correspond to some behavioral timescale or have a hypothesized significance? Do the mean velocities seem related? It may be the case that there is not much to say on the subject.</p></disp-quote><p>In our calcium imaging experiments on crawling animals, after the ablation of premotor INs/B-MNs, they exhibited ~10s reversal undulation cycle on plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in revised manuscript). DA9’s ~50s oscillatory cycle was observed in glued animals; the 5-fold difference in frequency likely reflects the effect of proprioceptive feedback.</p><p>Despite the difference in their absolute value, A-MN’s calcium oscillation is positively correlated with the animal’s undulation frequency, hence velocity in crawling animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in revised manuscript). The loss and gain-of-function unc-2 mutants exhibited lengthened and shortened DA9’s oscillation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in revised manuscript); they exhibited decreased and increased reversal undulation frequency and velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> in revised manuscript). The difference between DA9 calcium oscillation and undulation frequency was also ~5 fold for unc-2(gf) mutants. We commented on the correlation between A-MN calcium oscillation and velocity (e.g. subsection “A-MNs exhibit oscillatory activities independent of premotor IN inputs”, last paragraph; subsection “A-MNs are rhythm generators”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The writing needs reconsideration. Much of the important information is in the figure legends and the paper is thus tedious to follow. Putting more description of the figure in the text would help. The figures are very complicated and the data could be separated out into smaller figures. Word choice is not always the best and led to confusion for this reviewer. Many detailed examples of words that need clarifying are made on the manuscript pdf in Discussion and Introduction. The kymographs could be better explained so that readers unfamiliar with them can understand what the complex patterns in these kymographs from ablated and mutant animals mean.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the careful, constructive editorial comments. We thrive to make the description and illustration of ours and other’s work precise and clear. We have incorporated suggested editions, provided more descriptions for behavioural analyses, and reorganized figures to convey key messages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The concept of CPG is not well articulated and its meaning is stretched a bit. You are really dealing with individual neuronal oscillators and not CPGs and equating the structure of the reverse locomotion circuit in C. elegans with vertebrate spinal cord or even invertebrate networks like that for leech swimming will be a hard sell to a veteran CPG person like myself. To my mind this is not the real interest of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these comments. In the previous manuscript, we indeed did not make sufficient distinction between the usage of ‘CPG’ and ‘oscillator’. This in part reflects where the field was: the presence of oscillators was debated. Establishing that <italic>C. elegans</italic> motor rhythm is CPG-driven is important for <italic>C. elegans</italic> motor circuit, but we agree with you that ‘oscillator’ is a more appropriate word to define A-MNs’ activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are two major impacts arising from this work. 1) You have solved a pressing problem in C. elegans neurobiology which has plagued the field for over a decade. This should be emphasized. 2) You have made a truly brilliant discovery of the state dependent regulation of A-MN oscillations by the conjoint electrical and chemical synapses of premotor interneurons. This should be a centerpiece of the paper. The ideas on circuit compression are not compelling. Is the circuit compressed in C. elegans or is it expanded by evolution in leech? The first neurons in evolution were probably multifunctional (sensory-motor) and then evolution led to proliferation of neurons and specialization. That invertebrate neurons are very multifunctional has to be a truism since I was a graduate student and that motor neurons can be oscillatory has also been known as long. These arguments should be deemphasized.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the compliment to our work. We have revised the title, Abstract, Introduction, figures, and Discussion to emphasize and elaborate on the regulatory mechanisms on A-MN’s oscillatory activity. We further highlighted the similarity between our findings and previous discoveries in other small motor circuits.</p><p>We understand and respect your reservation with the usage of the word ‘compression’. We did not mean to use it in the context of evolution, but wanted to describe a nervous system property that we feel to be more specific than ‘multifunctionality’ (e.g. Getting, 1989). To our understanding, multifunctionality could also be used to describe the same group of neurons or connections to be reconfigured or recruited to generate different motor programs in the same animal. When <italic>C. elegans</italic> excitatory motor neurons play not only the roles of inducing muscle contraction, but also rhythm-generation, and possibly proprioceptive feedback and coupling, we feel that ‘compression’ better emphasizes the reduction of circuit layers by packing their functions into a single class of neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Title could be shortened and refocused to match the revised Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The title has been shortened.</p></body></sub-article></article>
