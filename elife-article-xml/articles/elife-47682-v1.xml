The tardigrade <italic>Ramazzottius varieornatus</italic> contains a unique nuclear protein termed Dsup, for damage suppressor, which can increase the resistance of human cells to DNA damage under conditions, such as ionizing radiation or hydrogen peroxide treatment, that generate hydroxyl radicals. Here we find that <italic>R. varieornatus</italic> Dsup is a nucleosome-binding protein that protects chromatin from hydroxyl radicals. Moreover, a Dsup ortholog from the tardigrade <italic>Hypsibius exemplaris</italic> similarly binds to nucleosomes and protects DNA from hydroxyl radicals. Strikingly, a conserved region in Dsup proteins exhibits sequence similarity to the nucleosome-binding domain of vertebrate HMGN proteins and is functionally important for nucleosome binding and hydroxyl radical protection. These findings suggest that Dsup promotes the survival of tardigrades under diverse conditions by a direct mechanism that involves binding to nucleosomes and protecting chromosomal DNA from hydroxyl radicals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47682.002</object-id><title>eLife digest :</title><p>Tardigrades, also known as water bears and moss piglets, are small animals found in many different environments on land and sea. These animals have the remarkable ability to survive extremes including very low temperatures, high levels of radiation and exposure to chemicals that are harmful to other forms of life. Tardigrades have even been found to survive the harsh conditions of outer space.</p><p>X-rays are a type of radiation naturally produced by lightning strikes and are also found in cosmic rays from outer space. High doses of X-rays can cause genetic mutations that may lead to serious illness or death. This is because when X-rays come into contact with water they split the water molecules to make particles known as hydroxyl radicals, which in turn damage the DNA inside cells.</p><p>The genomes of animals and plants are made of DNA, which is packaged into a structure called chromatin. Previous studies identified a protein named Dsup in a tardigrade called <italic>Ramazzottius varieornatus</italic> that can protect human cells from damage by X-rays. However, it was not known whether Dsup binds directly to chromatin or plays a more indirect role in protecting DNA.</p><p>Chavez, Cruz-Becerra, Fei, Kassavetis et al. used biochemical approaches to study Dsup. Their experiments revealed that Dsup from <italic>R. varieornatus</italic> binds to chromatin to protect the DNA from damage by hydroxyl radicals, and that the Dsup protein in another tardigrade species also works in a similar way. Further analysis showed that a region of Dsup that is needed to bind to chromatin is very similar to a region that had been previously found only in chromatin-binding proteins from humans and other vertebrates (animals with backbones). This connection between Dsup and vertebrate chromatin-binding proteins remains a mystery.</p><p>The new findings about tardigrade Dsup may help researchers develop animal cells that live longer under normal or extreme environmental conditions. In this manner, Dsup could be used to expand the range of applications of cells in biotechnology. It could also increase the effectiveness of current methods, such as the production of some pharmaceuticals, that depend upon the use of cultured cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tardigrade</kwd><kwd>damage suppressor protein</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>nucleosome</kwd><kwd>hydroxyl radicals</kwd><kwd>Ramazzottius varieornatus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM118060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kadonaga</surname><given-names>James T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dsup, a unique protein found only in tardigrades, is a nucleosome-binding protein that protects DNA from damage by hydroxyl radicals, such as those generated by ionizing radiation or oxidants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tardigrades, which are also known as water bears or moss piglets, are small invertebrate animals that are found in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats throughout the Earth (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guidetti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Møbjerg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weronika and Łukasz, 2017</xref>). They are typically about 0.1 to 1 mm in length, and comprise a head segment in addition to four body segments that each contains two legs with claws. Terrestrial tardigrades require a thin film of water to remain active. In the absence of water, they undergo anhydrobiosis into a dormant dehydrated state from which they can be rehydrated to an active form. In the anhydrobiotic state, tardigrades are resistant to extreme conditions of heat, cold, vacuum, pressure, radiation, and chemical treatments. Remarkably, they have been found to survive exposure to the vacuum and radiation of outer space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jönsson et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the unique properties of tardigrades have led to considerable interest in these animals. The analysis of their singular features should lead to significant new biological insights.</p><p>The molecular analysis of tardigrades has been advanced by the sequencing of the genomes of <italic>Ramazzottius varieornatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>) and <italic>Hypsibius exemplaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yoshida et al., 2017</xref>). [Note: the strain of tardigrades that was designated as <italic>Hypsibius dujardini</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yoshida et al. (2017)</xref> has since been found to be a new species that is now termed <italic>Hypsibius exemplaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">GĄsiorek et al., 2018</xref>). We will use the new terminology in this paper.] In <italic>R. varieornatus</italic>, the study of chromatin-associated factors revealed a tardigrade-specific protein, termed Dsup, for damage suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hashimoto and Kunieda, 2017</xref>). Dsup is a highly charged and largely unstructured nuclear protein that binds to DNA. Intriguingly, the expression of Dsup gene in human cells was observed to decrease DNA fragmentation induced by X-ray irradiation or treatment with hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, Dsup-containing human cells exhibited higher viability after X-ray irradiation than control cells. These findings suggest that Dsup is a unique protein that either directly or indirectly protects DNA.</p><p>In this work, we sought to examine the molecular function of Dsup. It was previously shown that Dsup interacts with free DNA in an apparently nonspecific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>). Because the natural form of DNA in the nucleus is chromatin, we investigated the binding of Dsup to nucleosomes. These experiments revealed that <italic>R. varieornatu</italic>s Dsup binds preferentially to nucleosomes relative to free DNA. Then, to test the relevance of these findings to other tardigrades, we examined the properties of a Dsup-like protein from <italic>H. exemplaris</italic>, and found that this protein appears to be an ortholog of <italic>R. varieornatus</italic> Dsup. Intriguingly, the Dsup proteins contain a region with sequence similarity to core consensus of the nucleosome-binding domain of vertebrate high mobility group N (HMGN) proteins, and the HMGN-like sequence in Dsup is important for its binding to nucleosomes. Furthermore, in a purified biochemical system, both Dsup proteins are able to protect chromatin from cleavage by hydroxyl radicals, which are generated in cells by ionizing radiation as well as by treatment with hydrogen peroxide. These studies thus reveal conserved functions by which Dsup maintains the integrity of chromosomal DNA under extreme conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>R. varieornatus</italic> Dsup binds preferentially to mononucleosomes relative to free DNA</title><p>The <italic>R. varieornatus</italic> Dsup protein is a largely disordered and highly charged nuclear protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hashimoto and Kunieda, 2017</xref>).

As with the 5S rDNA nucleosomes, we observed more efficient binding of Rv Dsup to the 601 mononucleosomes than to the 601 free DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, Rv Dsup binds preferentially to mononucleosomes relative to free DNA in a manner that appears to be independent of the specific DNA sequence.</p><p>Because the 147 bp DNA-containing mononucleosomes lack linker DNA that extends beyond the nucleosome core, we compared the binding of Rv Dsup to mononucleosomes that contain either 147 bp DNA or 181 bp DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These experiments showed that the presence of linker DNA did not substantially alter the efficiency of Rv Dsup binding to nucleosomes. It thus appears that Rv Dsup binds primarily to the nucleosome core rather than to the linker DNA.</p><p>In the gel shift experiments with Rv Dsup and mononucleosomes, there is typically a distinct major shifted band (denoted by black dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) along with a minor faster migrating band. This pattern can be seen particularly clearly in the titration of Rv Dsup with 147 bp 5S rDNA mononucleosomes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, and is suggestive of the binding of two molecules of Rv Dsup to the nucleosome. With the 5S rDNA mononucleosomes and high concentrations of Rv Dsup, we also observed a slower migrating band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which may reflect additional Rv Dsup binding to the nucleosomes and/or higher-order aggregation of the Rv Dsup-nucleosome complexes. In contrast, a distinct shifted band is not seen with Rv Dsup and free DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dsup is incorporated into periodic nucleosome arrays</title><p>To complement the studies with mononucleosomes, we tested whether Rv Dsup can be incorporated into extended periodic nucleosome arrays. In these experiments, we assembled nucleosomes onto plasmid DNA by using a purified and defined ATP-dependent chromatin assembly system with the ACF motor protein and the dNLP core histone chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fyodorov and Kadonaga, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khuong et al., 2017</xref>). We also included separate reactions with histone H1 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Woodcock et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Happel and Doenecke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kalashnikova et al., 2016</xref>) as a positive control for a nucleosome-binding factor.</p><p>The presence of Rv Dsup does not inhibit the efficiency of ACF-mediated chromatin assembly, as measured by the DNA supercoiling assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Partial MNase digestion analysis showed that the assembly of chromatin with Rv Dsup results in a small but distinct increase in the nucleosome repeat length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To analyze the binding of Rv Dsup to the nucleosome arrays, we extensively digested the ACF-assembled chromatin with MNase, and subjected the resulting mononucleosome species to nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This experiment revealed that Rv Dsup-bound mononucleosome particles are released from the chromatin upon extensive MNase digestion. We then compared the Rv Dsup-mononucleosome particles that were generated via ACF assembly followed by MNase digestion, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, with the Rv Dsup-mononucleosome particles formed by the addition of Rv Dsup to mononucleosomes, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, and found that the differently prepared Rv Dsup-nucleosome particles migrate at approximately the same rate during nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

We were therefore interested in testing whether histone H1 and Rv Dsup can bind simultaneously to nucleosomes.

It had been previously suggested that Dsup is not present in <italic>H. exemplaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yoshida et al., 2017</xref>). If true, that would have implied that Dsup is not generally important for tardigrades. Instead, the identification of Dsup as a chromatin-protective protein in two species suggests that it is a key factor that contributes to the unique properties of tardigrades.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Dsup proteins contain a region that exhibits sequence similarity to the conserved core of the nucleosome-binding domain of HMGN proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Moreover, the HMGN-like sequence in Rv Dsup is functionally important for its ability to bind to nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and to protect chromatin from hydroxyl radicals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Because the HMGN proteins have been found only in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">González-Romero et al., 2015</xref>), the origin of the HMGN-like sequences in the tardigrade Dsup proteins is, at present, a mystery. It is possible but not likely (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Doolittle, 1994</xref>) that the Dsup and HMGN proteins provide a very rare example of sequence convergence. In the future, detailed functional and evolutionary analyses might reveal the relation between these proteins.</p><p>The Dsup proteins are highly charged and largely disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hashimoto and Kunieda, 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). With respect to the latter, examination of the amino acid composition of the Dsup proteins reveals that they are enriched in serine, alanine, glycine, and lysine (SAGK) residues. Rv Dsup contains more than 60% SAGK residues, and He Dsup has over 50% SAGK residues. SAGK are disorder-promoting amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dunker et al., 2001</xref>), and the SAGK residues may form a diffuse mass of protein that protects the chromosomal DNA from hydroxyl radical-mediated cleavage in a variety of conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This model is consistent with the observation that tardigrades can survive high doses of ionizing radiation in the active as well as anhydriobiotic states (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jönsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Horikawa et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, these studies reveal molecular aspects of Dsup function and suggest how this intriguing protein may contribute to the unique biological properties of tardigrades.

In the future, the analysis of Dsup will reveal new insights into the physical and molecular bases of its functions and might further lead to its practical applications.

The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. For further purification, a portion of each sample (approximately 0.1 mg Dsup) was loaded onto a 300 µL anti-FLAG M2 agarose column that was pre-equilibrated in Buffer A2 [20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM EDTA, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol].

We also purified Dsup from the pellet of the bacterial cell lysate (prepared as described in the preceding paragraph) as follows.

The supernatant was loaded onto a 1 mL Ni-NTA agarose column, which was then washed with 11 mL Buffer E containing 6 M urea. The Dsup was renatured on the column with sequential 1.2 mL washes of Buffer E containing 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0 and 0 M urea. The column was washed with 0.8 mL Buffer E containing 200 mM imidazole to give the pre-elution fraction, and protein was eluted with 1.3 mL of the same buffer to give the elution fraction (containing approximately 1 mg/mL Dsup). A portion of the elution fraction (approximately 0.1 mg Dsup) was loaded onto a 300 µL anti-FLAG M2 agarose column that was pre-equilibrated in Buffer A2 [20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM EDTA, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol].

For nucleosome reconstitution, the DNA fragments were amplified by PCR and purified by 1.25% agarose gel electrophoresis and gel extraction (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit; Qiagen; Germantown, MD). After reconstitution, the quality of the nucleosomes was assessed by nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. If necessary, the histone:DNA ratios in the reconstitution reactions were adjusted to achieve the efficient conversion of the DNA into mononucleosomes. If multiple nucleosomal species (due to the presence of mixture of differently positioned nucleosomes) were observed, the samples were heated at 58°C for 10 min to facilitate the movement of the differently positioned nucleosomes to the most stable location.

Proteins were diluted into Buffer TEN containing 50 mM NaCl prior to use. For each series of reactions with a particular factor (such as Rv Dsup, He Dsup, or human TFIIB), the protein and its corresponding storage buffer were diluted in parallel and then used in a manner that ensured that each reaction was carried out under identical buffer conditions.

At this concentration of glycerol, we did not detect quenching of the hydroxyl radical cleavage reactions by the buffer medium.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper reports on the remarkable biochemical properties of tardigrade damage suppressor (Dsup) proteins which bind to single nucleosomes reconstituted on 5S and 601 sequences as well as nucleosome arrays, conferring protection from nuclease and hydroxyl radical cleavage. Authors show that Dsup does not interfere with ACF-mediated nucleosome assembly nor with binding of the linker histone H1. They also provide functional evidence for an orthologous protein from a different tardigrade species, highlighting the potentially general function of Dsup proteins in the enabling resistance of tardigrades to ionizing radiation. Overall, the quality of biochemical evidence presented is in keeping with the high standards of the Kadonaga laboratory. The study of these proteins has exciting implications for the prospects of engineering organisms to withstand extreme physical conditions and conditions that otherwise create genomic instability problems associated with aging and cancer.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The most critical issue for revision concerns the absence of a natural frame of reference to interpret the observed influence of Dsup on nucleosome binding and protection from hydroxyl radical cleavage. What is the Dsup-to-nucleosome stoichiometry in tardigrades? If Dsup protects tardigrade DNA from damage it would seem that the number of Dsup molecules would have to be on the same order as the number of nucleosomes. The authors should comment on the relative abundance of Dsup and nucleosomes in cells. This information is essential to interpret the findings that high Dsup to nucleosome ratios are needed for cleavage protection in the authors' experiments. The relative stoichiometry may be in the tardigrade literature, if so, authors should cite and discuss.</p><p>2) While the manuscript documents a highly interesting and potentially novel function for a distinctive nucleosome-binding protein, the current level of mechanistic understanding is limited. How do Dsups bind to nucleosomes in a way that blocks hydroxyl radical cleavage? Do Dsups cover major or minor DNA grooves or the phosphate backbone? What is the role of the SAGK motif in contacting nucleosomal DNA? Is DNA curvature sufficient for preferential binding to the NCP versus linker DNA, or are histones also involved in binding? The provision of additional exploration of mechanisms along some of these lines and inclusion of insights gained is necessary to justify accepting the current manuscript for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>3) In describing Figure 2A the authors state, &quot;These experiments revealed that Rv Dsup binds with a higher affinity to nucleosomes than to free DNA.&quot; Although this appears to be the case, the conclusion would be stronger if the authors quantitated the gels and estimated the affinities for Dsup binding nucleosomes and free DNA.</p><p>4) The DNA protection activity (in Figure 6B) is really intriguing data. Both RvDsup and HdDsup exhibited a substantial protection of DNA against hydroxyl radicals, which is really great. However, TFIIB is not a good control for this kind of experiment, because it is not a nucleosome-binding protein, and any nucleosome-binding factor may provide some protection of DNA against damage.

Upon receipt of the reviews, we suggested a strategy for addressing the issues that were raised in the Essential Revisions, and this plan was approved by editors at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Fortunately, in the course of our analysis of the structure and function of Dsup in the revision of this work, we made the remarkable discovery that a conserved region of Dsup exhibits sequence similarity to the core consensus nucleosome-binding domain of vertebrate HMGN proteins (new Figure 7A). Importantly, by mutational analysis, we found that the HMGN-like sequence in Dsup is functionally important for nucleosome binding (new Figure 7C) and protection of chromatin from hydroxyl radicals (new Figure 7D). These results provide the following: (i) strong evidence that the binding of Dsup is required for its protection of DNA against hydroxyl radicals; (ii) identification of a key region of Dsup that is important for binding to nucleosomes; and (iii) a surprising and intriguing relation between the tardigrade Dsup protein and HMGN proteins, which have been found only in vertebrates. These findings add an exciting new dimension to this work.</p><p>Importantly, these finding address the main conceptual issues raised by the reviewers. We also addressed the technical matters, such as the quantitation of the gel mobility shift data (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1), the re-naming of <italic>Hypsibius dujardini</italic> as <italic>Hypsibius exemplaris</italic>, and the revision of the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The most critical issue for revision concerns the absence of a natural frame of reference to interpret the observed influence of Dsup on nucleosome binding and protection from hydroxyl radical cleavage.

A Dsup peptide is in band B1, which is a major protein band in the chromatin fraction that is not seen in the soluble nuclear fraction. Dsup can also be seen to colocalize with chromatin in <italic>R. varieornatus</italic> embryos by immunofluorescence (Supplementary Figure 12). These methods do not, however, provide a quantitative assessment of the number of Dsup molecules per nucleosome in tardigrades. Such data are not yet available, and, given the challenges in analyzing pure tardigrade tissue, it may be many years before such data are obtained. Nevertheless, Dsup is sufficiently abundant to be identified in a chromatin fraction and to be clearly visualized by immunofluorescence. It would certainly be a point of concern if it could not be detected in tardigrades. Because it would be technically extremely challenging to obtain high quality quantitative data in tardigrades, we felt that it would not be reasonably possible to obtain such data for this paper or to make a meaningful comment on the existing data. Fortunately, the <italic>eLife</italic> editors agreed with this assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the manuscript documents a highly interesting and potentially novel function for a distinctive nucleosome-binding protein, the current level of mechanistic understanding is limited.

Because the hydrogen atoms on the 5' and 4' carbons are exposed in the minor groove of DNA, it appears that Dsup blocks access to the DNA minor groove. This point is now included in the paper as follows:</p><p>&quot;Because hydroxyl radicals react primarily with hydrogen atoms that are exposed in the minor groove of DNA (Balasubramanian et al., 1998), it appears likely that Dsup blocks access to the minor groove.&quot;</p><p>ii) There is no &quot;SAGK motif&quot;. Dsup is highly enriched in S, A, G, and K residues (&gt;60% of all aa residues in <italic>R. varieornatus</italic> Dsup), but they do not exist as an SAGK motif. To minimize the possibility that readers might inadvertently think that there is an SAGK motif, we changed (in the Discussion) &quot;… the SAGK-rich regions.…&quot; to &quot;… the SAGK residues.…&quot;</p><p>iii) The first two items address the specific questions raised in point 2 except for the issue of DNA curvature. From a broader perspective, it might be noted that additional data on the possible role of DNA curvature would not change the main conclusions of the paper. I was one of the original BREs for <italic>eLife</italic>, and I served as a BRE for three years (and then briefly as a Senior Editor). In our training sessions, we were told that <italic>eLife</italic> is not interested in requesting additional experiments that do not change the main conclusions of the paper. As far as I understand, this policy has not changed.</p><p>iv) Lastly, we did address the mechanism of Dsup binding to nucleosomes. These experiments are described in greater detail below in the response to Essential Points 4 and 5. In brief, we identified a conserved region of Dsup that is related to the nucleosome-binding region of vertebrate HMGN proteins. Mutation of this region of Dsup resulted in a reduction or near complete loss of the nucleosome binding and hydroxyl radical protection activities. It is interesting and intriguing that Dsup may bind to nucleosomes by a mechanism that is related to the binding of vertebrate HMGN proteins to nucleosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In describing Figure 2A the authors state, &quot;These experiments revealed that Rv Dsup binds with a higher affinity to nucleosomes than to free DNA.&quot; Although this appears to be the case, the conclusion would be stronger if the authors quantitated the gels and estimated the affinities for Dsup binding nucleosomes and free DNA.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided quantitative data. For the primary gel shift experiments (as in Figures 2A and 2B), we quantitated three independent experiments and provided graphs (mean +/– standard deviation of the percent bound DNA/nucleosomes versus Dsup:DNA/nucleosome molar ratio) in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1. These results further confirm the conclusions. We additionally provided quantitation of the gel shift data in Figures 5C and 7C. We did not attempt to estimate the absolute affinities, as the main point was to address whether Dsup binds with higher affinity to nucleosomes than to free DNA (and the absolute affinities would not alter the conclusions of the paper).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The DNA protection activity (in Figure 6B) is really intriguing data. Both RvDsup and HdDsup exhibited a substantial protection of DNA against hydroxyl radicals, which is really great. However, TFIIB is not a good control for this kind of experiment, because it is not a nucleosome-binding protein, and any nucleosome-binding factor may provide some protection of DNA against damage. Therefore, a different protein which is capable of binding nucleosomes should be examined as a comparison counterpart to Dsups. Also, please provide a clear description on the protein prep. for the hydroxy radical protection assay.</p></disp-quote><p>With regard to the issue of hydroxyl radical protection and the use of TFIIB as a control, we felt that it would be best to address these comments by further testing whether the binding of Dsup to nucleosomes is required for protection against hydroxyl radicals. Based on the data in the submitted paper, it was formally possible that Dsup generally protects DNA from hydroxyl radicals by a mechanism that does not involve binding to nucleosomes. To address this important question, we generated a mutant version of Dsup (M1 mutation) that has greatly reduced binding to nucleosomes (see new Figures 7A, 7B, and 7C). Importantly, we then found that the M1 mutant Dsup is severely defective in its ability to protect chromatin from hydroxyl radicals (Figure 7D). Thus, in this manner, we were able to show that Dsup-mediated protection against hydroxyl radicals depends upon the binding of Dsup to chromatin.</p><p>With regard to the protein purification, we revised and clarified the Materials and methods so that the exact method of preparation of Dsup for the hydroxyl radical protection assay is clearly indicated.</p><p> <italic>5) Previous work indicated that the C-terminus is sufficient for binding to DNA and entry to the nucleus, but is not sufficient for genome protection</italic> in vivo<italic>. Is the C-terminus sufficient for nucleosome-binding</italic> in vitro<italic>, or does nucleosome protection require additional domains than required than for binding DNA? Do Dsup proteins self-aggregate on nucleosome arrays?</italic> </p><p>In Hashimoto et al., 2016 (Supplementary Figure 14), it was shown that the C-terminal region of Dsup (an N-terminal deletion lacking N-terminal residues 2-207 out of 445 aa residues) can interact with DNA and localize to the nucleus. However, in the genome protection assay, Hashimoto et al., 2016, tested only the N-terminal region (i.e., a C-terminal deletion) and not the C-terminal region (Supplementary Figure 17). Thus, it was not shown that the C-terminal region &quot;is not sufficient for genome protection in vivo&quot;. Therefore, it is not possible to follow up on point 5 as stated because the genome protection data by the C-terminal region do not exist.</p><p>Importantly, we were nevertheless able to address questions that are related to the issues raised by the reviewers in this point. As shown in the new Figure 7, we made the surprising observation that a region that is conserved between Rv Dsup and He Dsup exhibits a striking sequence similarity to the central core region of the vertebrate HMGN proteins (new Figure 7A). This region is near the C-terminus of the Dsup proteins. We therefore generated a C-terminal deletion of Dsup (M1; deletion of amino acid residues 360-445) as well as a triple R to E amino acid substitution mutant Dsup (termed M2) (new Figure 7A). We then found that the M1 mutant is nearly completely defective for binding to nucleosomes and that the M2 mutant is moderately defective for nucleosome binding (new Figure 7C). We have thus identified a conserved region of Dsup that is important for binding to nucleosomes and protection against hydroxyl radicals (new Figure 7D). Intriguingly, this region is related to the core nucleosome-binding domain of vertebrate HMGN proteins. Because the HMGN nucleosome-binding domain has not been found outside of vertebrates, it is really quite unexpected and interesting to find a related and functionally important sequence in tardigrades.</p><p>With regard to the last point about aggregation of Dsup on chromatin, it should be noted that there is no evidence of aggregation of Dsup on nucleosome arrays, as seen in the partial MNase digestion analyses (Figure 3B and Figure 4C) as well as in the extensive MNase digestion analysis (Figure 3C) of nucleosome arrays containing Dsup.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Hypsibius dujardini, especially the strain used for the genome/molecular analyses, was recently reidentified as a new species, Hypsibius exemplaris. The authors should use the new species name with a short explanation on the re-identification of the species. cf.) Gąsiorek P, et al., 2018.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the update.
