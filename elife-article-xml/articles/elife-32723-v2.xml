pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32723.001</object-id><p>Collagen export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) requires TANGO1, COPII coats, and retrograde fusion of ERGIC membranes. How do these components come together to produce a transport carrier commensurate with the bulky cargo collagen? TANGO1 is known to form a ring that corrals COPII coats, and we show here how this ring or fence is assembled. Our data reveal that a TANGO1 ring is organized by its radial interaction with COPII, and lateral interactions with cTAGE5, TANGO1-short or itself. Of particular interest is the finding that TANGO1 recruits ERGIC membranes for collagen export via the NRZ (<underline>N</underline>BAS/<underline>R</underline>INT1/<underline>Z</underline>W10) tether complex. Therefore, TANGO1 couples retrograde membrane flow to anterograde cargo transport. Without the NRZ complex, the TANGO1 ring does not assemble, suggesting its role in nucleating or stabilising this process. Thus, coordinated capture of COPII coats, cTAGE5, TANGO1-short, and tethers by TANGO1 assembles a collagen export machine at the ER.</p></abstract><kwd-group

through evolution, mechanisms for their export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) must adapt concomitantly. Collagens, the most abundant secretory cargo in mammals - representing nearly 25% of the dry weight of the mammalian body, are some of the most challenging of all secretory cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kadler et al., 2007</xref>). Several requirements make collagen secretion a challenging task. <italic>First</italic>, in a complex multi-step process, collagens in the ER fold and trimerise into rigid, rod-like elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ishikawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kadler, 2017</xref>) of up to 400 nm in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgeson et al., 1985</xref>). The folding/assembly of collagen must be coupled to its export, to retain unassembled collagen in the ER, whilst ensuring that all rod-like fully assembled collagen is rapidly exported. <italic>Second</italic>, assembled collagens are too large to fit into generic COPII-coated vesicles that are usually less than 90 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Malhotra and Erlmann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miller and Schekman, 2013</xref>). <italic>Third</italic>, the rapidity with which this cargo exits the ER and passes through the secretory pathway, requires efficient transfer between compartments.</p><p>Our identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saito et al., 2009</xref>) and the subsequent characterisation of TANGO1 (<italic>8–11</italic>) has revealed a single protein, conserved through most metazoans, that stands at the crossroads of all these processes, modulating them to bring about bulky cargo export from the ER. TANGO1 is an ER exit site (ERES)-localized, transmembrane protein required for export of collagen and other bulky protein components of the extracellular matrix such as Dumpy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ríos-Barrera et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maiers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tomoishi et al., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is a schematic of three TANGO1 family proteins: TANGO1, TANGO1-short and cTAGE5.

(<bold>B</bold>) Three TANGO1-family proteins (TANGO1, TANGO1-short and cTAGE5) that form a stable complex at the ERES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maeda et al., 2016</xref>). TANGO1 is a type one single-pass transmembrane protein of 1907 amino acids, localised to ER exit sites. TANGO1 has an N-terminal lumenal SH3-like domain that interacts with collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saito et al., 2009</xref>) via the chaperone, HSP47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ishikawa et al., 2016</xref>). There is a transmembrane helix and, in close proximity, a membrane insertion helix. On the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane, TANGO1 has two coiled-coil (CC) domains (CC1 and CC2). CC1 is used by TANGO1 to recruit ERGIC membranes for producing a collagen carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Santos et al., 2015</xref>). CC2 binds to a similar coiled-coil domain in cTAGE5 (<italic>18</italic>). The proline-rich domain (PRD) binds ER exit site machinery Sec23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma and Goldberg, 2016</xref>) and Sec16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maeda et al., 2017</xref>). Alternative splicing of TANGO1 results in a short isoform, TANGO1-short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>), lacking the lumenal domain. The closely related protein cTAGE5 has a similar cytoplasmic domain organisation with two coiled-coil domains (CC1 and CC2) and a proline-rich domain (PRD). Via its CC1 it recruits Sec12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saito et al., 2014</xref>). cTAGE5 and TANGO1/TANGO1-short interact through their respective CC2 domains. In addition, the cTAGE5 CC2 also interacts with the retrograde v-SNARE Sec22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fan et al., 2017</xref>). Like the TANGO1/TANGO1-short PRDs, the cTAGE5 PRD also interacts with Sec23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma and Goldberg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-32723-fig1-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32723.003</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Constructs used in this study.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic representation of all the HA-epitope tagged constructs used in this study with different domains deleted from full length TANGO1.

TANGO1 contains a full transmembrane domain and a second membrane-inserted loop, which partially inserts into the inner leaflet of the ER membrane. The lumenal part contains a coiled-coil domain and, at the N terminus, an SH3-like domain. The SH3-like domain binds collagens via HSP47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma and Goldberg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maeda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>). The cytoplasmic part of TANGO1 is composed of two coiled-coil domains (CC1 and CC2) followed by a C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD). CC1 contains a domain called TEER (Tether for ERGIC at the ER) that recruits ERGIC-53-containing membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Santos et al., 2015</xref>); CC2 binds cTAGE5 (<italic>18</italic>), and PRD binds Sec23 and Sec16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma and Goldberg, 2016</xref>).</p><p>TANGO1-short is a spliced isoform of TANGO1. It is composed of 785 amino acids that arise from the same exons that encode the cytoplasmic domains of TANGO1. The sequence of TANGO1-short differs in the membrane-inserted helix, and it contains only 15 amino acids at the N terminus, within the ER lumen. It therefore lacks any capacity to interact directly with cargoes. We expect that TANGO1-short binds the same cytoplasmic proteins as TANGO1, but this has not been directly tested.</p><p>Evolutionarily, TANGO1 appears to have been duplicated early in metazoans, yielding a TANGO1-like protein (TALI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bosserhoff et al., 2003</xref>). Like TANGO1, TALI is expressed as two isoforms. The long isoform is expressed in select tissues while the short isoform (cTAGE5) has a ubiquitous expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Santos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bosserhoff et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pitman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pfeffer, 2016</xref>). cTAGE5 is composed of 804 amino acids, with a short lumenal stretch of 38 amino acids, followed by a single transmembrane domain. The organisation of cytoplasmic domains is the same as TANGO1, with two coiled-coil domains and a PRD. The first (CC1) of cTAGE5 interacts with Sec12; CC2 interacts with TANGO1 and Sec22, and the PRD, like TANGO1, interacts with Sec23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Raote et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>From the published data on these proteins, we can conclude that all three family members bind each other and Sec23. cTAGE5 binds Sec12 and Sec22. TANGO1 (and therefore TANGO1-short) does not bind Sec12. Of these proteins, only TANGO1 can bind cargo in the lumen. How different binding partners could affect the overall function of these proteins in ERES assembly and cargo export, remains untested.</p><p>A newly discovered feature of TANGO1 is its lateral organisation into rings of up to 300 nm diameter, which corral COPII coats at the ERES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Raote et al., 2017</xref>).

Full length TANGO1 formed distinct rings of somewhat uniform shape and size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, TANGO1ΔPRD also assembled into rings, but with two clear differences. First, rings were smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>); and second, some rings appeared fused with each other to form either a planar tessellation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>) or long linear assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–F</xref>).

Specifically, we fitted rings to an elliptical shape and measured the diameters of the ring in terms of major and minor axes of its fitted ellipse. This works well for regular-shaped ellipses, however for structures and shapes that deviate from an elliptical shape, a rectangular bounding shape is a more useful approximation. Therefore, maximum and minimum diameters (Feret’s maximum or minimum) were also extracted and all these values are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. From this quantification, we confirmed that rings formed by TANGO1ΔPRD, are significantly smaller than rings formed by TANGO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We used the aspect ratio (the ratio of the major to minor axes of the fitted ellipses) as a descriptor of the shape of rings.

These data suggest that the cytoplasmic domains of the TANGO1-family of proteins act as a single unit and any one can assemble into a ring, however TANGO1 brings cargo to the exit site. This suggests that overexpressing cytoplasmic isoforms (either TANGO1-short or cTAGE5) would increase the capacity of an ERES to export cargo, however TANGO1 is the only protein with the capacity to bring cargo to ERES. Collagen secreted in the absence of TANGO1 might thus be in an unfolded or unassembled form.</p><p>In a complementary experiment, we studied the effect of Sec23A depletion on TANGO1 ring formation in RDEB/FB/C7 fibroblasts. Depleting cells of all Sec23 could create cellular stress and affect endomembrane regulation, so we attempted to minimise such a potential stress by using siRNA that targeted exclusively Sec23A, and not Sec23B.

Improved structural understanding has revealed fascinating models for the mechanisms of membrane recruitment by tethers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murray et al., 2016</xref>). Our discovery of membrane recruitment by TANGO1 and its use of the NRZ tethering complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) has far reaching implications. A critical aspect of TANGO1 biology is that it functionally and physically couples anterograde to retrograde traffic at an ERES, coupling two successive compartments in the secretory pathway, allowing for more rapid and efficient cargo transport between the compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nogueira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Santos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). The NRZ tether would bind to, and recruit, any COPI-coated ERGIC-53-containing membranes in the vicinity of the ERES – but what of ERES closely apposed to the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi, and what of organisms such as <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, which have no discernible ERGIC compartment? Under such circumstances, the ‘carrier’ for collagen formed by the retrograde recruitment of COPI-coated membranes could just be the first Golgi cisterna. In other words, we could envisage a direct continuity or ‘tunnel’ between the ER and the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Malhotra and Erlmann, 2015</xref>), with a ring of TANGO1 and its associated exit site machinery holding together the two compartments, but also functionally delimiting them.</p><p>We have not observed a complete ring of tethers with TANGO1. The tethers instead appear as one or two puncta at the ring circumference. One can envisage that an initiation point of the TANGO1 ring recruits tethers and TANGO1 continues to assemble into a ring whereas the tethers remain at the nucleation site. This would explain the images presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Without the tethers, the reaction is stalled and TANGO1 fails to assemble further into a ring, providing an explanation for the requirement of tethers in TANGO1 ring assembly. An alternative is that the tethers are not recruited at the site of ring nucleation but present throughout, and we are unable to capture this final assembled state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>TANGO1 as filament around COPII coat</title><p>We had proposed that TANGO1 functioned by binding to and stabilising the inner COPII coat to delay the recruitment of the outer coat and the subsequent fission of a newly forming carrier, for as long as is required to assemble and pack the bulky cargo collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saito et al., 2009</xref>). We would like to suggest a possible physical mechanism of how TANGO1 rings are assembled and maintained by means of protein-protein interactions and eventually regulate the formation of a collagen-containing megacarrier. First, based on our observations of TANGO1 rings by STED microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Raote et al., 2017</xref>), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and our data indicating the different protein–protein interactions between the members of the TANGO1 family, we propose that a fence of TANGO1 can be described as a filament, held together by these lateral protein–protein interactions, which normally surrounds COPII patches at the ERES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maeda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, this description of the ring as a filament will remain an approximation until the molecular composition and structural alignment of individual components is known. Such a filament would be subjected to elastic strains and stresses and would hence resist bending. Second, COPII subunits polymerise into structures of growing size. COPII subunits at the periphery of a polymerising domain have free binding sites and hence higher chemical energy than fully polymerised subunits at the centre of the domain, which, in physical terms, translates into the existence of an effective line-energy of the ERES. As proteins of the TANGO1 family physically interact with Sec23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma and Goldberg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maeda et al., 2017</xref>), Sec16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maeda et al., 2017</xref>), and Sec12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saito et al., 2014</xref>), we propose that upon adsorption to the ERES by binding peripheral COPII subunits, TANGO1 would effectively reduce the ERES line energy. A tug-of-war between the filament bending and the effect on COPII stabilisation created by the adsorption of TANGO1 filaments around ERES would then dictate whether and how TANGO1 rings are formed. Interestingly, it has been shown that the line tension of the polymerising protein coat can play a key role in controlling the timing and size of clathrin-coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saleem et al., 2015</xref>). We thus propose that the stabilising effect of TANGO1 while adsorbing around ERES would serve as a physical mechanism to delay and enlarge the COPII vesicle, commensurate with cargo size. Furthermore, TANGO1 rings could serve as a mould to impose a cylindrical curvature at the base of a growing carrier by coupling to the first layer of the COPII coat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>), as proposed by Ma and Goldberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma and Goldberg, 2016</xref>).</p><p>We expect that the diameter of a TANGO1 ring and associated components, will be maximal, proximal to the plane of the membrane. The more distal parts of the proteins for example the PRD (of TANGO1, cTAGE5 and TANGO1-short) will have two extreme positions:1, lying pointing radially inward like spokes of a wheel and 2, pushed aside to the ring periphery by the growing carrier. It is therefore difficult to make definitive statements about relative locations - based on antibodies that bind to distal parts of the molecule - within the ring. We have also not tested whether cTAGE5, or for that matter TANGO1 short, can assemble into a ring in cells lacking TANGO1. We have not been able to create a form of cTAGE5 and TANGO1-short with a label or an antibody to visualise the domains proximal to the membranes, which makes it difficult to discern their location precisely, even in the presence of endogenous TANGO1. However, within these limitations, based on the involvement of various parts of TANGO1 and its interactors into discrete rings for collagen export, we could now begin to address the placement of various proteins such as TFG, KLHL12 or sedlin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McCaughey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gorur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Venditti et al., 2012</xref>) in collagen export from the ER.</p><p>Under these conditions, there is the possibility that a mega carrier, of the form recently reported by Schekman and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gorur et al., 2017</xref>), is produced. Regardless of the final form adopted by the cells to transfer collagen from the lumen of the ER to the Golgi, with the data presented herein, we have taken the first steps toward arriving at a quantitative understanding of this hypothesis.

Two-channel colocalisation analysis was performed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health), and the Manders’ correlation coefficient was calculated using the plugins JaCop or Coloc 2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>STED microscopy</title><p>STED images were taken on a TCS SP8 STED 3 × microscope (Leica Microsystems) on a DMI8 stand using a 100 × 1.4 NA oil HCS2 PL APO objective and a pulsed supercontinuum light source (white light laser). Images were acquired and deconvolved exactly as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Raote et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Three-colour STED: Due to incompatible species specificities of primary antibodies available (for RINT1, TANGO1 and ERGIC-53), we were forced to use sub-optimal secondary antibodies. We used Alexa 488, Alexa 594 and Alexa 647. This required that we set the depletion laser (775 nm) at only 3–8% intensity for the Alexa 647 channel to prevent rapid bleaching.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Morphology quantification of TANGO1 rings</title><p>Multichannel 3D stacks were acquired with a z-step size of 100 nm and subsequently deconvolved using Huygens deconvolution software (Scientific Volume Imaging) for STED modes using shift correction to account for drift during stack acquisition. Sum-Intensity Projections were then generated from a subset of the deconvolved stack slices where the rings were present. Projected images showed a large fraction of the GFP signal as random dots or big aggregates in which no particular structural organisation could be distinguished. Also, a significant amount of well-defined non-random structures, i.e. both full and incomplete (arc-shaped or dotted) rings, as well as chain-like assemblies of rings.</p><p>To ensure a systematic and unbiased analysis, these structures are first segmented via a trainable pixel level classifier, and subsequently labelled either as rings, incomplete rings or dots, or ring aggregates, on object level. Both pixel and object classification used a machine learning based open-source software, ilastik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sommer et al., 2011</xref>). Afterwards, we calculated different parameters for each object to compare them quantitatively in shape and size. Specifically, we measured the diameters of the ring in terms of major and minor axes of its fitted ellipse and the maximum and minimum Feret’s diameter. Statistical testing was performed using Student’s t test (continuous data, two groups). One asterisk indicates Student’s t test value p&lt;0.06; three asterisks p&lt;0.006; ns indicates not significant.</p><p>To quantify the frequency of rings after depletion of specific gene products, deconvolved STED images of each condition were manually scored for rings/clusters of TANGO1. A ring is defined as an independent structure with an internal hole. A cluster however, is at least four such conjoint rings. Statistical testing was performed using Student’s t test (continuous data, two groups). One asterisk indicates Student’s t test value p&lt;0.02; three asterisks p&lt;0.002; ns indicates not significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Collagen secretion assay in RDEB/FB/C7 fibroblasts</title><p>The secretion assay was carried out exactly as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nogueira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Santos et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, RDEB/FB/C7 fibroblasts were transfected in suspension on two consecutive days with siRNA (either a pool of control, non-targeting RNA or RNA targeting a specific gene). 48 hr later, cells were washed thoroughly and incubated for 20 hr in OptiMEM supplemented with 1 mM ascorbate. Cell lysates and media were harvested and processed for Western blotting of collagen VII and tubulin/actin as loading/lysis controls.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Advanced Light Microscopy Unit at the CRG, Javier Diego Iñiguez, Verena Ruprecht and members of the Malhotra laboratory for valuable discussions. V Malhotra is an Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats professor at the Centre for Genomic Regulation, the work in his laboratory is funded by grants from the Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad Plan Nacional (ref.

Malhotra and colleagues recently showed show TANGO1 assembles into a ring that encircles COPII components. They have shown that growth of transport carriers for bulky cargoes requires addition of membranes; TANGO1 remains at the neck of the newly forming transport carrier, which grows in size by addition of ERGIC-53-containing membranes to generate a transport intermediate for collagen export.</p><p>In this paper, the authors explore the domain requirements for RING formation and explore a computational model for how these structures grow and form. First they find that removal of TANGO1's proline rich region (PRD) changes the structures formed in cells to smaller rings (is it clear they are not small patches?) or interesting long linear assemblies (Figure 2N not K). This suggests that interaction with Sec23 redirects a self-assembly process into a productive carrier formation event. This leads the authors to propose a model whereby free ends have more &quot;energy&quot; than occupied subunits, creating &quot;line energy&quot;; they propose that TANGO1 proteins act as lineactants upon binding Sec23 (they showed that Sec23 availability alters the polymerization of TANGO proteins.) In compelling STED images, they add new data showing a role for the NRZ tether in collagen secretion, linked to TANGO.</p><p>Overall, there is important and interesting data here but the story is not told in an adequately documented and coherent manner. This reviewer feels that the roles of domains should be better documented for each of the constructs (more images, better quantitation) and the theoretical lineactant model presented elsewhere as it does not add to the present story and should be based on actual data for filament stiffness etc. Better statistics are needed to discern the probability of colocalization of the tether with ERGIC and TANGO1 (and to substantiate all the structural forms). Also, care should be taken in analyzing Sec23 knockdowns as cells (and ER) will not be normal. Finally, the paper would be greatly enhanced by EM analysis of purified protein constructs but this is likely not yet possible.</p><p>The authors propose a model whereby &quot;filament resistance to bending leads to ERES wetting or dewetting by TANGO1 filaments.&quot; This is one of many possibilities. Models are valuable when they can be tested directly, and the model seems far ahead of the available data presented. At this point, it does not add to the story, and should be presented with testable predictions to support it. Thus, this reviewer feels strongly that the model should be presented elsewhere until tests can be included. Also, the authors propose a model for ring fusion with no data that they actually fuse.</p><p>Many references to figure legends are not correct and legends should be made clearer; please include page numbers.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> should include what happens after long collagen exceeds length of TANGO.</p><p>Number of cells counted; number of particles scored are both missing throughout.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper continues the investigation by the Malhotra lab into the ER export of bulky cargoes such as collagen, and the role of TANGO1 in this process. The goal is to understand how TANGO1 forms a ring of a specific size around COPII at ER exit sites (ERES). A new role for the NRZ (NBAS/RINT1/ZW10) tether in generating TANGO1 rings and linking TANGO1 to ERGIC membranes is described. These data are integrated into a model for the &quot;collagen export machine&quot; at the ER.</p><p>The domain structure of TANGO1, and the functions of the individual domains, are now fairly well understood. This information is exploited here by deleting individual domains to test how TANGO1 assembles into rings. Deletion of the COPII-binding proline-rich domain generates fused or linear assemblies of rings. This observation is interpreted in terms of a rather elaborate theoretical model, which assumes that TANGO1 and its partners can form linear filaments that normally interact with COPII. The conclusion is that TANGO1 acts as a &quot;lineactant&quot; at ERES. I was unfamiliar with this term, but it implies that TANGO1 acts to reduce line tension at the edges of ERES.</p><p>This analysis is intriguing and may well have validity, but it would benefit from direct evidence that TANGO1 and its partners have the intrinsic ability to form filaments. While the experiments described here are useful for elucidating the roles of TANGO1 domains and partner proteins in ring formation, they do not directly show that filaments are present. It would also be nice if the model made a testable and nontrivial prediction of a phenomenon that had not already been observed. Despite these reservations, the modeling seems to have been useful for guiding the structure-function analysis.</p><p>Other points from the experimental data:</p><p>1) I'm not clear on the significance of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, which shows that deleting the luminal SH3 domain disrupts TANGO1 rings. Was that result expected? If so, why? The explanation in the text about elastic properties of the TANGO1 filament lacks a clear justification.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, cTAGE5 associates with TANGO1 rings, but the two signals do not overlap. If these proteins co-polymerize in a filament, shouldn't they have very similar distributions?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is confusing. I can't see any difference between TRUNC1 and TRUNC2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, aren't TRUNC1 and TRUNC2 reversed? The text says that TRUNC2 showed no recruitment, but it gives the higher Manders' coefficient. Also, the text seems to have errors in referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and a nonexistent Figure 5G.</p><p>4) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, are ERES still present when the NRZ tether is depleted? In other words, is the effect on TANGO1 rings direct or indirect? The interactions described here between TANGO1 and the NRZ tether seem to be real, but the mechanistic interpretation remains to be clarified.</p><p>My overall impression is that this manuscript is ambitious and interesting. It provides a substantial amount of new data about TANGO1 domain functions and protein-protein interactions at ERES. The ideas are stimulating, but they go further beyond the data than may be prudent.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors continue their quest to understand how large cargoes are accommodated in COPII vesicles. In a recent JCB paper, they reported that TANGO1, known to be important for collagen export from the ER, assembles into rings around COPII coats at ER exit sites. Here they use high-resolution imaging and deletion mutagenesis to further characterize lateral interactions that stabilize the rings, including a potential role for the not-too-well-characterized NRZ tethering complex. They also use modeling to generate a theoretical phase diagram for ring formation and fusion (my first encounter with the word &quot;lineactant&quot;, which according to a bit of Googling is rather obscure). I'm on the fence about whether this work represents a sufficient advance for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>I think the most novel, and potentially most interesting, finding is that the NRZ tether complex is directly involved in TANGO ring formation. Knocking down RINT-1, however, strikes me as a blunt instrument for testing this hypothesis – how can we know that the effect on ring formation (which in any case is not quantified) is direct, given the central role of this complex in trafficking within the early secretory pathway? I wonder if the authors also have their doubts, since a direct role for the NRZ complex in ring formation is not depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><p>I'm not, unfortunately, qualified to critique the modeling component of this manuscript. Nonetheless, I am not convinced of the wisdom of combining in vivo experiments like the ones presented here – rather drastic manipulations in a complex milieu – with abstract mathematical modeling, absent some intermediate in vitro measurements on model membranes using defined protein components. The authors tout the success of the model in predicting that reducing the interaction energy between TANGO1 filaments and COPII subunits enhances ring fusion. Yet it seems to me that there is a 50:50 chance that any such prediction would prove correct by random chance – after all, ring fusion is bound to be either more efficient or less efficient. Quantitative agreement over a range of experimental conditions would support the modeling work much more compellingly. Without it, I wonder if the modeling belongs.</p><p>None of the explanations offered for the smaller rings observed in vivo for TANGO1deltaPRD strike me as likely. For example, why (if the domains are independent, which is the rationale behind the whole approach) would deleting PRD affect the bending rigidity or preferred curvature of the filament?</p><p>Maybe I missed it, but I didn't understand what the authors take to be the mechanistic implications of the finding that &quot;the minimal TEER is exactly the same forty amino acids we identified in the previous section, as those required for the self-association of TANGO1. This had clear implications for the coupling of the tethering function of TANGO1 with its structure, homo-oligomerisation and thereafter, assembly into rings.&quot; What are the implications?</p><p>I had a lot of trouble with the figures, ranging from figures that weren't there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) to figures that were bizarrely laid out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is really quite extraordinary, with font sizes that must differ by an order of magnitude and panel labels in every imaginable place) to Figure 4—figure supplement 2 which, in my view, represents modeling malpractice.</p><p>Finally, what could be the purpose of including line numbers while omitting page numbers?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Building a machine for collagen export from the endoplasmic reticulum&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Malhotra recently showed in JCB that TANGO1 assembles into a ring at the ER that encircles COPII components. Here they go on to show that ring formation requires Sec23, self-interaction and interaction with cTAGE5, and the presence of the RINT tethering complex.</p><p>In general the work will be of broad interest. However, the manuscript could benefit from careful rewriting in a few places, as the reviewers had a difficult time parsing all the abbreviations, mutations, and relationship to multiple isoforms of TANGO proteins. The following presentation improvements will enhance the ability of a reader to understand the story.</p><p>1) Perhaps the most important new and unexpected finding shown here is the recruitment of the RINT complex to the TANGO rings. The RINT forms a clear focus of staining on one side of the ring, yet seems essential for RING assembly. What fraction of TANGO rings showed RINT association? How many were counted? The authors should also present categorizations of where the RINT labeled the rings – (inside? at edge? outside?) The authors include hand-waving explanations for why a full RINT ring may not have been seen but should really think about how a focus of RINT could nevertheless stabilize a RING structure and discuss this thoughtfully.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. It would help the reader to indicate that the cytoplasmically oriented PRD is at the C-terminus here (indicate -COOH and include parenthesis PRD). So many words detract from the clarity. Could the authors use arrows from interacting proteins to the indicated domains? If function is unknown, it is not necessary to state this in the diagram. References can go in the legend. Entire figure could be 1/4 the size. The linear version at the bottom should be removed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> should be shown at the top of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> as TEER domain is not mentioned in diagram.</p><p>3) It was very hard for this reader to be able to compare wild type and mutant form rings because they are all shown at slightly different magnifications. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-E, H and I</xref>, should be presented at the same mag. Same for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-E</xref>; In any frame in which the mag bar is 20µm, please outline the cell. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, what is the difference between C, D and E? In general, if the figure is very crowded, please consider multiple figures to make the beautiful images be best appreciated by <italic>eLife</italic> readers.</p><p>4) Does cTAGE5 make rings in cells lacking TANGO1? Please summarize what the data reveal about roles of TANGO versus TANGO short (please define!) versus cTAGE5.</p><p>5) Linear filaments in a planar membrane could generate rings, but association of the rings with one another must require multivalent interactions that go beyond head-to-tail filament formation. This point should be mentioned.</p><p>6) The authors propose that &quot;TANGO1/cTAGE5 interactions with COPII […] act as an inward attractant, holding the filament in a ring-like configuration.&quot; But then why would the δ-PRD mutant still form rings? Perhaps they mean to state that the COPII interaction constrains the size and placement of the rings.</p><p>7) The minimal TEER is the same 40 amino acids that are required for TANGO1 self-association. What does this mean? A crucial point that should be addressed is whether these two interactions are mutually exclusive.</p><p>8) Subsection “Compartment tethering in a TANGO1 ring assembly pathway”, tenth paragraph: the text refers to quantitation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, but should it be <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>?</p><p>9) &quot;In all cases, exit sites (as marked by TANGO1 and SEC31) are still recruited to intracellular collagen accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).&quot; I don't see that result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, and actually, I'm not sure what that supplemental figure is intended to show.</p><p>10) Abstract: &quot;for&quot;? its self-association?</p><p>Subsection “Binding of TANGO1 to COPII controls TANGO1 ring formation”, second paragraph: TANGO1-short is not defined anywhere.</p><p>&quot;CTAGE is on the periphery of rings.&quot; How many rings were counted to give confidence to this conclusion?

While the experiments described here are useful for elucidating the roles of TANGO1 domains and partner proteins in ring formation, they do not directly show that filaments are present. It would also be nice if the model made a testable and nontrivial prediction of a phenomenon that had not already been observed. Despite these reservations, the modeling seems to have been useful for guiding the structure-function analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have removed the model to alleviate the concerns raised here about our inability to test this directly.

If these proteins co-polymerize in a filament, shouldn't they have very similar distributions?</p></disp-quote><p>It is very hard to capture these images with STED because of the quality of reagents, the plane of the ER, and the spatial distance between antibody epitopes in these proteins.

The text says that TRUNC2 showed no recruitment, but it gives the higher Manders' coefficient.

In a recent JCB paper, they reported that TANGO1, known to be important for collagen export from the ER, assembles into rings around COPII coats at ER exit sites. Here they use high-resolution imaging and deletion mutagenesis to further characterize lateral interactions that stabilize the rings, including a potential role for the not-too-well-characterized NRZ tethering complex. They also use modeling to generate a theoretical phase diagram for ring formation and fusion (my first encounter with the word &quot;lineactant&quot;, which according to a bit of Googling is rather obscure).</p></disp-quote><p>The concept of <italic>lineactant</italic> or <italic>line active</italic> agents has been studied in soft matter physics and biophysics in the context of lipid domain formation (see e.g. the works on line active lipids by Sam Safran or Siewert Jan Marrink or Marcus Müller). One of us (Malhotra) also had to spend considerable time in trying to understand the principle of lineactant. But, as mentioned above, our biophysicists friends started the evaluation of our data by summarizing it as a lineactant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I'm on the fence about whether this work represents a sufficient advance for eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that given the current understanding of how cargoes, especially of the bulky and complicated kind, are exported form the ERES, and our data on how TANGO1 interacts with components of COPII and ERGIC via the tethers, we are helping to illuminate this rather dark spot in membrane traffic. We sincerely hope that the kind reviewer is persuaded to side with us.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think the most novel, and potentially most interesting, finding is that the NRZ tether complex is directly involved in TANGO ring formation. Knocking down RINT-1, however, strikes me as a blunt instrument for testing this hypothesis – how can we know that the effect on ring formation (which in any case is not quantified) is direct, given the central role of this complex in trafficking within the early secretory pathway?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now tested each of the three proteins of the tether complex individually and describe quantitatively, that all proteins of this complex have an equal effect on ring formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I wonder if the authors also have their doubts, since a direct role for the NRZ complex in ring formation is not depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for not showing NRZ in a ring of TANGO1 is because we do not detect these proteins in a ring.

Nonetheless, I am not convinced of the wisdom of combining in vivo experiments like the ones presented here – rather drastic manipulations in a complex milieu – with abstract mathematical modeling, absent some intermediate in vitro measurements on model membranes using defined protein components. The authors tout the success of the model in predicting that reducing the interaction energy between TANGO1 filaments and COPII subunits enhances ring fusion. Yet it seems to me that there is a 50:50 chance that any such prediction would prove correct by random chance – after all, ring fusion is bound to be either more efficient or less efficient. Quantitative agreement over a range of experimental conditions would support the modeling work much more compellingly. Without it, I wonder if the modeling belongs.</p></disp-quote><p>Sadly, we have removed the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>None of the explanations offered for the smaller rings observed in vivo for TANGO1deltaPRD strike me as likely.

However, it is apparent that we were unable to provide a clear explanation of our model's results, as we agree entirely with the reviewer in thinking that the intrinsic bending rigidity and preferred curvature of a filament should remain unaffected. Yet the rings are smaller, which we explained based on the results of our model, by the fact that TANGO1 proline rich domain, by binding to Sec23 and Sec16, has the ability to modify normal ERES dynamics (included in the model as the coupling parameter f_0) (see e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> or Appendix Figure 1H in our initial submission).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Maybe I missed it, but I didn't understand what the authors take to be the mechanistic implications of the finding that &quot;the minimal TEER is exactly the same forty amino acids we identified in the previous section, as those required for the self-association of TANGO1.
