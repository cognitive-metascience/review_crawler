They interact with particular viral RNAs, most of them being still unknown. To decipher the viral RNA signature on RLRs during viral infection, we tagged RLRs (RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2) and applied tagged protein affinity purification followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of associated RNA molecules. Two viruses with negative- and positive-sense RNA genome were used: measles (MV) and chikungunya (CHIKV). NGS analysis revealed that distinct regions of MV genome were specifically recognized by distinct RLRs: RIG-I recognized defective interfering genomes, whereas MDA5 and LGP2 specifically bound MV nucleoprotein-coding region. During CHIKV infection, RIG-I associated specifically to the 3’ untranslated region of viral genome. This study provides the first comparative view of the viral RNA ligands for RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 in the presence of infection.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11275.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11275.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11275.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>An immune system can protect against disease-causing microbes such as viruses. Human cells contain three different receptors that can recognize and respond when a virus enters and begins to replicate inside. These receptors include RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2, and they are collectively known as the RIG-I-like receptors. RIG-I-like receptors specifically recognize viruses that store their genetic material in the form of molecules of RNA. However, the specific viral parts that trigger RIG-I-like receptors to respond remain almost completely unknown.</p><p>RNA viruses include well-known and re-emerging viruses such as polio and measles, as well as chikungunya – a virus that is spread by mosquitoes and causes illness worldwide. This means that understanding how RIG-I-like receptors identify RNA viruses and then trigger an immune response to eradicate them has the potential to inform the development of vaccines and antiviral therapies for many diseases.</p><p>Sanchez David et al. now describe and validate a new experimental approach to determine the distinct viral regions that are recognized by human RIG-I-like receptors. The approach involves purifying the RIG-I-like receptors out of infected cells and then working out the sequence of RNA fragments that bind to the receptors. This approach revealed that each of the three human RIG-I-like receptors detected different viral RNA sequences during a measles infection. On the other hand, only RIG-I could recognize a specific part of the chikungunya virus genome.</p><p>All together, the experiments illustrate how to identify the RNA sequences recognized by any of the three human RIG-I-like receptors during infection by a RNA virus. With the ability to gain this kind of insight, it may soon be possible to develop ways of using the RIG-I-like receptor pathway to control viral infections and enhance the body’s immune response to vaccination.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11275.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11275.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>RIG-I-like receptors</kwd><kwd>virus-host interactions</kwd><kwd>PAMP</kwd><kwd>PRR</kwd><kwd>ribonucleoproteins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDT20140931129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanchez David</surname><given-names>Raul Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003323</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le Sida et les Hepatites Virales</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSS1-AO 2012-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tangy</surname><given-names>Frédéric</given-names></name><name><surname>Komarova</surname><given-names>Anastassia V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003323</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le Sida et les Hepatites Virales</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSS1-AO 2012-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Komarova</surname><given-names>Anastassia V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An experimental approach allowing characterization of viral RNA ligands recognized by RIG-I-like receptors during infection by any RNA viruses is established and validated.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Because of increasing global population and worldwide exchanges, infections by RNA viruses are expanding with a huge impact on public health. New infections are emerging almost every year (pandemic flu, West Nile encephalitis, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, chikungunya, Ebola), tropical fevers are expanding (dengue, zika) and even previously controlled diseases are re-emerging (measles, poliomyelitis). Although several efficient vaccines against RNA viruses are used in human medicine, we still lack potent therapeutic treatments for the majority of viral infections as well as rational strategies to create efficient new vaccines. Recent progress in our understanding of cellular pathways controlling viral replication suggests that modulating host cell functions early upon viral infection could inhibit a large panel of RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shirey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Es-Saad et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lucas-Hourani et al., 2013</xref>). The RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) appear to be located at the frontline of the evolutionary race between viruses and the host immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vasseur et al., 2011</xref>). These are cellular proteins that detect invasion of viral nucleic acid species inside the cytoplasm and initiate innate immune responses against viral infections that limit virus replication and trigger an adequate adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Errett and Gale, 2015</xref>). RLR signalling operates ubiquitously. Hence, RLRs represent attractive strategies for antiviral therapy and vaccine development.</p><p>The RLR family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is a group of cytosolic RNA helicases that can identify viral RNA as non-self <italic>via</italic> binding to pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) motifs. To date three RLR members have been identified: RIG-I (Retinoic acid-Inducible Gene-I), MDA5 (Melanoma-Differentiation-Associated gene 5), and LGP2 (Laboratory of Genetics and Physiology 2) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loo and Gale, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dixit and Kagan, 2013</xref>]). They share a number of structural similarities including their organization into three distinct domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): i) an N-terminal region consisting of tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD), ii) a central DExD/H box RNA helicase domain with the capacity to hydrolyze ATP and to bind RNA, and iii) a repressor domain (RD) embedded within the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). These RNA helicases interact with particular signatures of viral RNA, most of which are still unknown. Upon ligand recognition, RLRs bearing the CARD domain (MDA5 and RIG-I), undergo a conformational change that permits the CARD domain to be recruited and to oligomerize with MAVS either in the peroxisome or the mitochondrion. This activates signalling pathways leading to translocation of the transcription factors IRF3, IRF7 and NF-kB into the nucleus to initiate expression and secretion of type I IFNs and other proinflamatory cytokines. Secreted type I IFNs bind to their receptors and activate the JAK/STAT signalling pathway inducing the expression of more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) bearing IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Veer et al., 2001</xref>). If the virus has no means for subverting the interferon pathway, the infected tissue turns into an antiviral state leading to i) apoptosis of the infected cells, ii) limited propagation of the virus by the expression of ISGs in neighbouring cells and iii) generation of a cytokine storm that triggers the specific adaptive immune response as well as favouring immune cell infiltration from the cardiovascular system.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11275.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rig-I Like Receptor (RLR) gene expression in stable cell lines encompassing ST-RLRs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the protein domains for each RLR.

RIG-I confers recognition of hepaciviruses and of members of the <italic>Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae</italic>, and <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> families. For example, 5’copy-back defective-interfering (DI) genomes produced by numerous negative-sense RNA viruses specifically associate with RIG-I and activate IFN induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Strahle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Komarova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Runge et al., 2014</xref>). MDA5 detects members of the <italic>Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae</italic>, and <italic>Coronaviridae. Flaviviridae, Reoviridae, and Arenaviridae</italic> are detected by both MDA5 and RIG-I.

Several DNA viruses have also been reported to activate the RLR pathway, including Herpes simplex virus-1, Adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Vaccinia virus and Hepatitis B virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sato et al., 2014</xref>).

In addition, only few studies characterised molecular features of the RLR ligands in the presence of viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deddouche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Runge et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it is difficult from existing observations to get a clear picture of i) the biological ligands for each of the RLRs and ii) the functional differences between RLRs.</p><p>To study virus-host RNA-protein interactions during viral infection, we previously developed and validated a high-throughput riboproteomic approach based on One-STrEP-tagged protein affinity purification and next-generation sequencing (NGS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Komarova et al., 2013</xref>). This protocol allows exploring biologically active macromolecular complexes within infected cells. Here, we applied this method to study viral RNA signatures sensed by RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 cytosolic receptors upon infection with both negative- and positive-sense RNA viruses. Such study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms and roles of RLR associated RNAs. It helps to conceive new therapeutic approaches such as modulators of innate immunity or new vaccine adjuvants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of stable cell lines expressing One-STrEP-tagged RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2</title><p>To identify and compare RLRs viral RNA partners upon infection with different viruses, we generated human HEK293 cell lines stably expressing One-STrEP-tagged LGP2, or MDA5, or RIG-I proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). One-STrEP tag provides a reliable, rapid and efficient protocol for ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and protein complexes purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Komarova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2013</xref>). We tagged the RLRs N-terminally since previous studies have shown that adding N-terminal tags to RLRs had no negative effect on functional interactions with their RNA ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pichlmair et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rehwinkel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deddouche et al., 2014</xref>). These cell lines were assigned ST-RLR cells (ST-LGP2, ST-MDA5 and ST-RIG-I, respectively). In addition, a stable cell line (assigned ST-CH) expressing the Cherry protein instead of tagged RLRs was generated as a negative control to allow subtraction of non-specific RNA binding. Using RT-qPCR analysis and affinity purification followed by western blot analysis we validated the expression of tagged RLRs by each stable cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F</xref>). We then analysed the functional profiles of the ST-RLR cell lines upon transfection with RIG-I and MDA5 agonists by using a classical IFN-β promoter activity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We observed that transfection of ST-MDA5 and ST-LGP2 cells with MDA5 agonist poly(I:C) elicited an increased IFN-I response. In contrast, transfection of ST-LGP2 cells with the RIG-I agonist 5’triphosphate-RNA (5’3P) masked the IFN-I response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These observations are in accordance with previous studies showing that over-expression of MDA5 or simultaneous co-expression of MDA5 and LGP2 synergize type I IFN response upon activation with MDA-specific agonists or upon infection with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruns et al., 2013</xref>). LGP2 over-expression has also been previously found to inhibit RIG-I signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moresco and Beutler, 2010</xref>). Altogether this demonstrates that the three stable cell-lines that we established express tagged RLRs that are functional and can be purified by affinity chromatography.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RNA virus replication in cells expressing tagged RLRs</title><p>To test whether the over-expression of RLRs influences the efficiency of RNA virus replication we infected ST-RLR stable cell lines with a representative of negative- or positive-sense RNA virus: measles virus (MV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), respectively.</p><p>MV belongs to the family <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> (order <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>) and is often considered as a prototypical member of negative-sense RNA viruses.

Non-structural proteins (NSP1-4) are directly translated from the viral genome (49S) at early stage of viral replication, whereas structural proteins C-E3-E2-6K-E1 (capsid C, envelope glycoproteins E3, E2 and E1 and the ion channel protein 6K) are encoded by subgenomic mRNA (26S mRNA) during the late viral cycle. To assess CHIKV replication kinetics in tagged RLR cell lines we used a molecular clone of CHIKV (CHIKV-Rluc) at different MOI: 0.05, 1, 2.5.

All experiments were performed in triplicates. Approximately, 16 million reads of 51 nucleotides in length were obtained from each sequencing sample and were mapped to the viral genome. This gave MV genome coverage ranging from 274X to 2433X. We also performed NGS analysis of total RNA samples. Total RNA results provided a classical example of the transcription gradient, which is the characteristic of the order <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>.

As above, RIG-I/RNAs were analysed by NGS. Again as a control, we used CH/RNA samples purified in a parallel experiment. As previously, the experiments were performed in triplicate, sequencing reads were mapped to MV genome and statistical analysis was performed. As expected, when normalized read counts were represented along MV genome, a vast majority of reads aligned to the 5’-end of the genome with sequences of both positive and negative polarities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This 5’ MV genome region perfectly corresponds to the 1236 nts-long 5’ copy-back DI genome characterized above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data clearly confirm the role of RIG-I in sensing 5’ copy-back DI RNAs and suggest a role of the MV-V protein in controlling the DI genome’s formation.

The obtained enrichment in mRNA coding for MV-N protein in MDA5/RNA sample was compared to the CH/RNA sample. This qPCR analysis used three different probes aligning at the beginning and the end of the MV-N mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) and validated that MDA5-associated RNAs most likely represent transcripts coding for the MV-N protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). As negative control three other MV mRNAs coding for M, P and H proteins were looked for and not found to be enriched in MDA5/RNA samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). We then validated that LGP2 specifically binds the 5’-end of the coding region of the N gene, as only the RNA fragment located the farthest to the 5’-end of the N mRNA (N1) was significantly enriched using qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Further, we validated the specific interaction of RIG-I with the 3’-end of CHIKV genome. For this, we used a pair of primers detecting only the 49S genomic RNA (CHIKV2), and three others detecting both the 49S genomic and 26S subgenomic RNAs (CHIKV5, 6, 11) of which only CHIKV11 was located at the 3’-end of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>).

These cytoplasmic proteins detect invasion of viral RNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells and trigger innate immunity. The inflammatory response is necessary for limiting viral replication and initiating a specific adaptive immune response. Most of the studies on RLR specific viral RNA ligands are performed in the absence of a productive virus infection (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yoneyama et al., 2015</xref>]). These studies are based on transfection within cells of RNAs coming from infected cells, expression of viral-coding sequences from plasmids, or transfection of in vitro transcribed RNA or synthetic RLR agonists such as poly(I:C). Recently, to characterize RNA ligands of RLRs in the presence of active viral infections (Sendai and Influenza viruses, then MV and EMCV), NGS has been applied on RNAs isolated from infected cells by co-IP. In these studies the methodological approach was based on either Photo Activable-Ribonucleoside-enhanced CrossLinking and co-IP (PAR-CLIP) or simple co-IP followed by NGS. Using these approaches for Sendai and Influenza viruses only RIG-I specific RNA partners were analysed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baum et al., 2010</xref>), for EMCV only LGP2-specific RNA partners were sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deddouche et al., 2014</xref>), and for MV RIG-I and MDA5 specific RNA partners were studied simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Runge et al., 2014</xref>). The disadvantages of RNA-protein isolation by co-IP approaches are that (i) they rely on the availability of high-affinity antibodies against the protein of interest and (ii) they often lack an appropriate negative control. Negative control antibodies with different affinities and directed against proteins that are absent from the cells can easily underestimate the background noise generated by co-IP followed by NGS. Also, for the PAR-CLIP methodology, the incorporation of the nucleoside analogue 4-thiouridine (4SU) within RNA during the active cycle of viral replication could change the molecular properties of viral and cellular RNAs, thus creating an artificial environment.</p><p>To overcome these problems we applied One-STrEP-tag fusion protein affinity chromatography to purify RLRs. For this, we generated three single-clone stable cell lines expressing either tagged RIG-I, or MDA5, or LGP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, a stable cell line expressing CH protein fused to the same One-STrEP-tag was used as a control for non-specific binding. These tools allow studying the three RLRs in the same setting and to characterize their specific viral RNA ligands in the course of infection. Indeed, we isolated specific RLR RNA ligands from these cells infected with MV and CHIKV, respectively a negative- and a positive-sense RNA virus. Three biological replicates were performed for each RLR and an appropriate negative control (CH/RNA) allowed subtracting non-specific binding and to perform rigorous statistical analyses.</p><p>Despite the fact that these cells over-expressed one RLR, they were susceptible to infection with different RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). By applying multiple functional tests we determined the best conditions for ST-RLR cells infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We validated that they were efficient for RLR-specific RNA ligands purification and allowed extraction of immunoactive RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Consistent with previous studies we observed that RIG-I/RNAs provided a stronger immunostimulatory activity in comparison to MDA5/RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikegame et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Runge et al., 2014</xref>). In the same experimental set-up we showed that LGP2-specific RNA had a similar immunostimulatory activity to RIG-I/RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, for the two infections more immunoactive RNA ligands were purified with LGP2 and RIG-I than with MDA5.</p><p>For CHIKV infection, specific RNA ligands of cytosolic RLRs have not been established yet. The inflammatory response in non-hematopoietic cells is known to be dependent on MAVS, the adaptor molecule necessary for both RIG-I and MDA5, however which of the two receptors is involved in sensing CHIKV is still unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schilte et al., 2010</xref>). We found that RIG-I specifically interacts with the 3’-UTR of CHIKV genome. Despite the higher coverage of the CHIKV genome compared to MV genome in our NGS data, we failed to observe specific enrichment in CHIKV reads on LGP2 and MDA5 receptors. The observation that RIG-I specifically interacts with CHIKV 3’-UTR is very promising (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Indeed, the 3’-UTR of positive-sense RNA viruses has already been shown to be particularly immunoactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saito et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schnell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kell et al., 2015</xref>). CHIKV 3’-UTR contains multiple 21 nucleotide-long repeated sequence elements forming dsRNA structures, which are possible targets for RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2013b</xref>). Interestingly, the 3’-UTR has recently been described as a region particularly sensitive to the evolutionary pressure exerted by mosquito vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we observed that in the mammalian host RIG-I targets the same viral region. To our knowledge this is the first time that RIG-I affinity for the 3’-end of a positive-sense RNA virus is demonstrated in physiological conditions.</p><p>For MV infection we compared our NGS data with those previously published for RIG-I and MDA5 using the PAR-CLIP coupled to NGS approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Runge et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly our study and the Runge <italic>et al.</italic> data showed that i) RLRs preferentially interact with MV-N and MV-L derived RNA, ii) RIG-I and not MDA5 interacts with viral RNA of both negative- and positive-sense polarities originating from MV 5’ copy-back DI genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Runge et al., 2014</xref>]). However, we observed several discrepancies. We found that MDA5 and not RIG-I specifically interacted with MV-N coding sequences. RIG-I specific positive- and negative-sense reads only represented 5’ copy-back DI-genome and were equally distributed along the 5’-end of the MV genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Similar NGS profile of the 5’ copy-back DI genome on RIG-I was previously observed in the context of Sendai virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baum et al., 2010</xref>). In this study only a single population of 546 nts-long 5’ copy-back DI RNA genome has been specifically enriched on RIG-I. Thus, the concordance of our results for RIG-I with Baum et al. study nicely confirms the relevance of our strategy.</p><p>In the future, a deeper NGS study should be done to explain why the RIG-I/RNA sample collected during MV infection possesses immunostimulatory activity despite the absence of MV RNA ligands specifically bound to RIG-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>). We propose that self-RNA molecules processed by the action of the antiviral endoribonuclease RNaseL on cellular RNA could be specific RNA ligands that bind RIG-I and induce IFN-β expression. Indeed, RNaseL induces type I IFN <italic>via</italic> production of short-length RNA molecules of viral and cellular origins by the mechanism that includes interaction with MDA5 and RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Malathi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2010</xref>). In the current experimental setup we used a sample multiplexing that allowed an appropriate analysis of relatively long viral-derived RNA and not cellular RNA molecules. Alternatively, it is possible that MV RIG-I-specific RNA ligands are short length and thus not compatible with the classical Illumina NGS protocol applied in this study. In the future this protocol will be adapted to study small size RLR partners and to study RLR-specific cellular partners.</p><p>Recently Deddouche <italic>et al.</italic> have isolated a pertinent MDA5 agonist by co-IP of LGP2/RNA complexes purified from cells infected with EMCV, a positive-sense RNA virus. Using NGS, they mapped this RNA on the L region of the EMCV genome. Numerous functional assays were performed to validate that the L region is a key determinant of the MDA5 stimulatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deddouche et al., 2014</xref>). This work supported previous studies showing that in an infected cell, MDA5 and LGP2 positively cooperate with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Venkataraman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Satoh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruns and Horvath, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Childs et al., 2013</xref>). In vitro studies of MDA5 suggested that MDA5 hypothetically recognizes long dsRNA molecules like poly(I:C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kato et al., 2008</xref>). MDA5 binds dsRNA from the stem of the molecule and starts forming filaments towards its extremities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peisley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Recent studies of autoimmune disorders have proposed that MDA5 detects aberrant secondary structures formed by self mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liddicoat et al., 2015</xref>). All these are evidences that most certainly MDA5 natural ligands are RNA stem structures embedded within different RNAs. In concordance with this, our results show that MDA5 recognizes the integrity of the MV-N mRNA, certainly through the recognition of stem loop structures. Further, our in silico (Mfold) prediction of RNA secondary structures within the different parts of the MV genome suggested that MV-N mRNA had a potential to form stem loop structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).</p><p>It has recently been shown that LGP2 can stabilize shorter filaments of MDA5 around dsRNA of 100 nts in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bruns et al., 2014</xref>). Our data further confirmed this MDA5/LGP2 synergy. We demonstrated that upon MV infection MDA5 and LGP2 were binding similar viral RNA ligands. Indeed, these LGP2 specific RNAs were encompassing the MV-N segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). However, while the whole MV-N mRNA was bound by MDA5, the LGP2-specific reads were mostly localized in the 5’-end of the N region. Furthermore, when transfecting in vitro transcribed RNAs corresponding to the MDA5- and LGP2-specific regions of the MV genome in human epithelial cells, we identified a higher immunostimulatory activity of the 5’-end of the N mRNA compared to RNA fragments of similar size but coming elsewhere from the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). These data suggest that, upon MV infection, LGP2 and MDA5 specifically interact with the same RNA agonist and that LGP2 could be involved in stabilizing short MDA5 filaments formed on secondary structures localized at the 5’-end of the MV-N mRNA.</p><p>In summary, using One-STrEP-RLRs affinity chromatography purification and NGS we provide the first simultaneous visualisation of specific RNA ligands for RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 in living cells and in the presence of different RNA viruses. Our results show that each of these cytosolic sensors has its individual RNA profile upon infection with different RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated RIG-I specific binding to the AU- and polyU/UC-rich regions of viral genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saito et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schnell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Runge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kell et al., 2015</xref>). In our results RLR-specific binding cannot simply be explained by primary RNA composition or AU/GC content of RNA ligands. Indeed, we found RIG-I preferential binding to the AU-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), but this binding was observed only when a dsRNA-containing DI genome was produced by the recombinant MV△V. These results suggest that RIG-I recognizes specific RNA secondary structures. MDA5 and LGP2 specificity to AU-rich RNAs was less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). Additional studies should be performed to obtain a clearer view on the similarities and the differences of RNA structures recognized by each of the three RLRs. For this, we are currently applying our One-STrEP-RLR approach to three other RNA viruses as well as to an intracellular bacterium. As a consequence, this work offers new strategies for immune and antiviral therapies by targeting the RLR pathway for the therapeutic control of viral infections, enhancing the immune response for vaccines, and conceiving strategies for immune suppression to control inflammation or specific autoimmune diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells, plasmids and recombinant viruses</title><p>HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney, ATCC CRL-1573), Hela (human cervix adenocarcinoma epithelial, ATCC CCL-2) and A549 cells (human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial, ATCC CCL-185) were maintained in DMEM-Glutamax (GIBCO, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) and 100 U/ml/100 μg/ml of Penicillin-Streptomycin (GIBCO).

For all cell lines mycoplasma contamination testing status was routinely verified (#30-1012K, ATCC). To establish clonal stable cell lines expressing One-ST-RLR, we used a modified pEXPR-IBA105 plasmid carrying GW cassette (pEXPR-IBA105GW) kindly provided by Dr. Yves Jacob (Unité de Génétique Moléculaire des Virus ARN, Institut Pasteur). First, the RLR sequences (LGP2, MDA5 or RIG-I) were amplified by standard PCR from a human spleen cDNA library (Invitrogen) using specific primers with AttB1 and AttB2 sequences included (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The corresponding DNA fragments were cloned by in vitro recombination into pDONR207 entry vector (BP reaction, Gateway, Invitrogen). RLR genes (MDA5: AF095844; LGP2: AAH14949 RIG-I: CCDS6526.1) were finally recombined from pDONR207 to One-STrEP-tag pEXPR-IBA105GW by in vitro recombination (LR reaction). These new plasmids were transfected into HEK-293 cells using JetPrime reagent (#114–15, Polyplus Transfection, Strasbourg, France). Two days later, culture medium was removed and replaced by fresh medium containing G418 at 500 µg/ml (#G8168, SIGMA, St. Louis, Missouri).

To prevent V protein expression from MV, a two-step PCR strategy was used to generate MVΔV virus. Two PCR fragments were amplified using MV2313 (5’-ATCTGCTCCCATCTCTATGG) and MV2504 (5’-TCTGTGCCCTTCTTAATGGG) for the first fragment and MV2485 (5’-CCCATTAAGAAGGGCACAGA) and MV3385 (5’-AGGTTGTACTAGTTGGGTCG) for the second fragment.

It is known that three RLR members (RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2) are playing the cytosolic receptor to response for RNA viruses. However, their individual biological ligands are not clear and the molecular mechanism between RLRs and the associated viral RNAs is also unknown. To address this issue, the authors established the One-STrEP-tagged RLRs assay system. This system is well designed and has not disturbed the biological functions of RLRs in stable cell lines. The authors also optimized the best time points to purify the RLR-associated viral RNA ligands under various conditions. The NGS study showed that the MDA5 recognizes the positive strand of MV N region and LGP2 recognizes both stands of L region. For CHIKV infection, RIG-I accesses both strands of 3'UTR in viral genome. The whole data set reveals how RLRs recognize the viral RNA ligands during infection.</p><p>My major concern is the NGS analysis data. The significant enriched reads represented in red and non-significant reads in blue from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. But the normalized read counts are not many in L region of LGP2-MV in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. The scale of the y-axis is shorter than MDA5-MV, thus how is the specificity of each region represented in this data? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, where is the position of V region of MVΔV? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, there are many enrichment reads around C/E2 region in RIG-I-CHIKV sample. What is the biological meaning of these differences?</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic> </p><p>In the article entitled &quot;Comparative analysis of viral RNA signatures on different RIG-I-like receptors&quot;, Dr. Komarova and colleagues developed a high-throughput riboproteomic approach based on One-STrEP-tagged protein affinity purification and NGS. Using this approach they compared RNA signatures in MV and CHIKV that could specifically be recognized by RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2. They observed that 1) RIG-I recognized defective interfering genomes whereas MDA5 and LGP2 specifically bound MV nucleoprotein coding region and 2) RIG-I associated specifically to the 3' untranslated region of CHIKV viral genome. How does host immune system recognize RNA signatures, and what kind of RNA signatures could be recognized by RNA sensors, are two important questions regarding innate immunity and development of antiviral strategy. This study has explored a new approach to identify immunostimulatory viral RNA signatures and found new features of RLR-mediated RNA sensing. Generally, this study is of significance and broad interests in this field. However, key concerns should be further clarified, and more information should be provided for evaluation of the significance of the current work.</p><p>1) This study is based on a HEK293 cell model after overexpression of tagged RLRs. This cell line is different in expression of the three endogenous RLRs. So could these differences affect the enrichment of RNAs for NGS? Moreover, single cell clones were used to perform the infection and RNA isolation, which may also bias the enriched RNAs. In fact, it is better to use a RLR-deficient cell (cell line) with rescue of respective RLR. I may also encourage the authors to use a typical virus-permissive immune cell model instead of HEK293.</p><p>2) Previously, some studies have revealed the RNA features of several RNA viruses using different approaches. Despite the proposals of advantages of current approach by the authors, I am more interested in the similarities and differences identified by these researches for RNA viruses. Did common sequence or structural similarities exist for recognition by individual RLR? Otherwise, did common sequence or structural similarities exist in RNA viruses that could be recognized by RLRs? Additionally, did the authors find particular self-RNA in the enriched RNAs? More bioinformatics analysis data should be performed, and these concerns may need further discussions.</p><p>3) To evaluate the stimulatory effects of the enriched RNAs, total pooled RNAs were used to activate the IFNβ reporter. Since RNA signatures in MV and CHIKV have been revealed by the study, it may be better for the authors to use these individual &quot;RNA signatures&quot; to examine the effects in IFNβ induction. Considering that IFNβ expression is rather complicated than transactivation, I suggest the authors to use an immune cell to examine the IFNβ levels after transfection of the identified signature RNAs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11275.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Although the work is of interest and significance, both reviewers have raised questions regarding your work.

Our studies concluded that not specific RNA sequences but rather structural elements are more likely to be linked to RLRs functionality. The relevant results are presented and discussed.</p><p><italic>4) For the confirmation of the detected RNA signatures, it can be performed in alternative permissive cells that naturally respond to the viruses using the enriched RNAs.</italic> First, we would like to provide a short introduction about MV and CHIKV permissive cells.</p><p>For CHIKV the main virus-permissive cells are dermal fibroblasts, migrating monocytes/macrophages, and endothelial cells (Sourisseau et al. 2007,PMID: 17604450; Solignat et al. 2009, PMID: 19732931; Vanlandingham et al., 2005, PMID: 15891138; Kumar et al. PMID: 23253140). Using our RLR-tagged approach we have found that RIG-I specifically interacts with CHIKV 3’-UTR. CHIKV 3’-UTR contains multiple 21 nucleotide-long repeated sequence elements forming dsRNA structure. The evolutional pressure exerted by mosquito vectors on this region and the length of CHIKV 3’-UTR are directly linked to the viral pathogenesis (Chen et al., 2013, PMID: 24009512; Stapleford et al., 2016, PMID: 26807575). We are currently performing additional studies in various cell types in which 3’-UTR of different CHIKV strains and mutant genomes are used. These studies will be later published elsewhere.</p><p>Monocytes and dendritic cells of respiratory tract are the first targets of MV that is transmitted <italic>via</italic> aerosols or droplets. Further, MV enters local lymphatic tissues and during the systemicphase of infection MV spreads by mononuclear cells that carry the virus to various organs (skin, intestine, liver, lung and kidney). So in the late stage of the infection epithelial cells are the main targets of MV(Schneider-Schaulies et al., 2001, PMID: 11899069; Esolen et al., 1993, PMID: 8515132; Osunkoya et al., 1990, PMID: 2271420; Yanagi et al., 2006, PMID: 16963735).</p><p>Taking into account that immune cells (macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells) harbour TLR7/8 that recognise viral single- stranded RNA in endosomes of infected cell and lead to activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and activation of type I IFN production, we used in our validation experiments MV-permissive epithelial cells (A549) naturally lacking TLR 7/8 receptors.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, a validation of MV RNA signatures for RLR has been added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>, subsection “Validation of NGS data using conventional approaches”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1: My major concern is the NGS analysis data. The significant enriched reads represented in red and non-significant reads in blue from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. But the normalized read counts are not many in L region of LGP2-MV in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. The scale of the y-axis is shorter than MDA5-MV, thus how is the specificity of each region represented in this data?</italic></p><p>The low number of read counts corresponding to the L region of MV is biologically well known. MV belongs to the order <italic>Mononegavirales,</italic> in which the relative efficiency of expression of the various viral genes depends on a gradient of transcription. Indeed, MV transcription is initiated from a single promoter at the 3’ end of the genome and at each gene junction the virus RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase either falloff or continue the transcription of the downstream gene (Collins et al., 1980, PMID: 7420539; He et al., 1999, PMID: 10400712; Plumet et al., 2005, PMID: 15890929). Thus, due to this gradient of transcription, promoter-proximal genes are expressed more efficiently than promoter-distal genes, a differential level that corresponds to the virus needs. To provide a clear vision of MV transcriptome, we now introduced a figure with NGS analysis of total RNA from MV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and discussed this in the revised manuscript (subsection “NGS analysis reveals that distinct regions of MV genome are specifically recognized by distinct RLRs”, first paragraph).</p><p>The specificity of NGS data analysis refers to the ability of the analysis to recognize truly not enriched positions, avoiding the risk to have false positives. It is impossible to independently assess the specificity of each region (because all positions are considered simultaneously in the analysis), nor to compute this specificity because we do not know which positions are truly not enriched (no reference population). However, we used statistical methods that are well adapted to analyse count data with a low number of replicates. These methods have been shown to be among the most reliable (Soneson and Delorenzi, 2013, PMID: 23497356) and to control the false positive rates to expected levels.</p><p>It is true that read counts are low in the L region, but this is the situation where the statistical analysis has less power. So the fact that read counts in this region are significant over the whole L region gives even more confidence about the significance of the difference.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, where is the position of V region of MVΔV?</italic> </p><p>We modified MV genome scheme to show that V region was deleted.

What is the biological meaning of these differences?</italic> This global enrichment in sequencing reads corresponding to the C-E2-E1 region has also its biological reason. Indeed, previous studies have shown that alphaviruses subgenomic RNA is more abundant than genomic RNA in cytoplasm of infected cells (Pushko et al., 1997, PMID: 9434729; Strauss and Strauss, 1994, PMID: 7968923)</p><p>To provide a better vision on CHIKV NGS results, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> has been modified with a schematic representation of the genomic RNA and the position of subgenomic RNA transcription start site added to the Figure. Also, a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>) was added to present the CHIKV transcriptome (total RNA) and discussed in the revised manuscript (subsection “NGS analysis reveals that RIG-I recognizes specifically the AU-rich 3’ region of CHIKV genome”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2: 1) This study is based on a HEK293 cell model after overexpression of tagged RLRs.

Indeed, we did not detect any of the three RLRs by western blot in the background HEK293 cells when using RLR specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-F</xref>). RLR specific signals were only observed in cells over-expressing each of the RLRs. The same results were systematically observed in cells infected with MV and CHIKV (data not shown). Additionally, our qPCR analysis of RLR mRNA expression in ST-RLR cells showed that the numbers of mRNA coding for RIG-I and MDA5 were increased 100 fold and for LGP2 10,000 fold in the corresponding ST- RLR cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, we believe that we do not need to use “a RLR-deficient cell line with rescue of respective RLR” and that the bias for NGS due to the presence of endogenous RLRs in our ST-RLR cells should be minimal if any.</p><p><italic>I may also encourage the authors to use a typical virus-permissive immune cell model instead of HEK293.</italic> </p><p>We are grateful to the reviewer #2 for suggesting this experiment. In the revised manuscript we applied immuno-precipitation of MDA5 from human monocytes infected with MV and validated MDA5 predisposition to bind the MV-N mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In order to assess the immunostimulatory activity of RLR-specific RNA fragments synthesised in vitro and containing the RLR specific signatures, human PBMCs were transfected ex vivo. Indeed, we observed an increased secretion of type-I IFN. However, we were unable to discriminate what percentage of the response was TLR-dependent or RLR- dependent. In the presence of TLR7/8 inhibitor, the cytokine response was strongly reduced (Data not shown). Therefore, using immune cells represented a technical bias that makes it complicated to address this question in the allotted period. However, we believe that studying the RLR response in non-immune cells that do not respond through the TLR pathway is highly pertinent. Indeed, RLRs are ubiquitously expressed, and any cell is susceptible of recognizing viral RNA in their cytoplasm. In addition, non-immune cells are classically used as a model to study the RLR response (Plumet et al., 2005, PMID: 15890929; Runge et al. 2014, PMID: 24743923 Schilte et al., 2012, PMID: 20123960). Consequently, validation experiments were done using MV-permissive epithelial cells naturally lacking TLR7/8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>).</p><p>The Results, Discussion, Materials and methods sections as well as the Figure legends were modified accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
