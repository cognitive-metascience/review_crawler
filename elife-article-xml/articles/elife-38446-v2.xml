The transformation of the odor code from OB to PCx is profound: mitral and tufted cells in olfactory glomeruli respond to individual odorant molecules, whereas pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the PCx responds to multiple, apparently random combinations of activated glomeruli. How these ‘discontinuous’ receptive fields are formed from OB inputs remains unknown. Counter to the prevailing view that olfactory PNs sum their inputs passively, we show for the first time that NMDA spikes within individual dendrites can both amplify OB inputs and impose combination selectivity upon them, while their ability to compartmentalize voltage signals allows different dendrites to represent different odorant combinations. Thus, the 2-layer integrative behavior of olfactory PN dendrites provides a parsimonious account for the nonlinear remapping of the odor code from bulb to cortex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>piriform cortex</kwd><kwd>odor representation</kwd><kwd>dendritic spikes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schiller</surname><given-names>Jackie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012213</institution-id><institution>Rappaport Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schiller</surname><given-names>Jackie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Allen and Jewel Prince Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schiller</surname><given-names>Jackie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Adelis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Brain Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schiller</surname><given-names>Jackie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dendrites of pyramidal neurons in piriform cortex can initiate NMDA spikes, which may serve to amplify odor responses, and provide combination selectivity underlying 'discontinuous' odor receptive fields in these neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The piriform cortex (PCx) is the main cortical station in olfactory processing. It receives direct odor information from the olfactory bulb, as well as contextual information from higher brain regions, and is thought to be the brain’s primary site for odor discrimination and recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gottfried, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Olfaction starts at the nasal epithelium where a single odor activates multiple odorant receptors (ORs). At the olfactory bulb, information from like ORs converge to ~1000 mirror symmetric pairs of glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mombaerts et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Isaacson, 2010</xref>). Thus, on either side of the brain an odor is represented as a distributed pattern of activation over ~1000 glomeruli, which together form a molecular map of the odor. Mitral and tufted (M/T) cells, the glomerular outputs, carry the olfactory signal next to the PCx via the lateral olfactory tract (LOT). LOT axons traverse layer 1 of the PCx and form synaptic contacts with the thin distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons and layer 1 interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gottfried, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bekkers and Suzuki, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Unlike other sensory cortices which are topographically organized, the connectivity scheme between the OB and PCx lacks any apparent spatial structure: individual LOT axons from the bulb terminate in broad overlapping swaths of the PCx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buonviso et al., 1991a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buonviso et al., 1991b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ojima et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miyamichi et al., 2011</xref>) so that each glomerulus excites a widely dispersed and apparently randomly distributed population of PCx neurons. In turn, each pyramidal neuron in PCx receives synaptic input from roughly ~10% of the 1000 glomeruli, also apparently randomly sampled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miyamichi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davison and Ehlers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nagayama, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soucy et al., 2009</xref>). In keeping with the notion of random convergence and divergence of OB axons in PCx, electrophysiological studies show that each odorant activates an apparently random population of from 3% to 15% of the neurons in layer 2 of the PCx at low concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Pyramidal neurons in the piriform cortex are the main integration units within which the discrete molecular information channels of the OB are combined to form ‘odor objects’, but the biophysical and circuit-level mechanisms that remap LOT inputs into the olfactory code in PCx remain poorly understood. Three features of the mapping of LOT excitation into pyramidal neuron activity in PCx are noteworthy, and in the context of the existing literature, lead to a conundrum:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Pyramidal neurons are driven by LOT inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bekkers and Suzuki, 2013</xref>), even though LOT synaptic contacts onto PNs are formed on distal tuft dendrites, are few in number (~200 total contacts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miyamichi et al., 2011</xref>), and are sparsely activated (just 1% of glomeruli activated in the OB reliably drives many PCx pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davison and Ehlers, 2011</xref>). This suggests pyramidal neurons in PCx have some means of amplifying weak distal inputs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pyramidal neurons in PCx are combination selective, that is, they respond supralinearly to specific combinations of glomerular inputs but not others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davison and Ehlers, 2011</xref>). These combinations are of relatively high order, so that a pyramidal neuron that responds strongly to an odorant may respond weakly to a chemically similar odorant that activates a heavily overlapping pattern of glomeruli .</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pyramidal neurons in PCx have ‘discontinuous’ receptive fields, that is, they respond to multiple chemically diverse odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rennaker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kadohisa and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>), while failing to respond to re-combinations of those odorants’ component parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davison and Ehlers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apicella et al., 2010</xref>). For example, a pyramidal neuron that is unresponsive to individual odor components A, B, or C may respond strongly to combinations AB but fail to respond to combination AC or BC.</p></list-item></list><p>What biophysical mechanism(s) could account for a pyramidal neuron’s ability to (1) amplify distal LOT inputs; (2) enforce combination selectivity on those inputs; and (3) maintain multiple ‘discontinuous’ recognition subunits? A possible mechanism could be compartmentalized NMDA spikes in pyramidal neuron dendrites, which could provide both the thresholding nonlinearity that enforces combination selectivity, and the amplification that allows distal inputs to drive somatic action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Poirazi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Polsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sheffield and Dombeck, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nevian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Milojkovic et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Weighing against this hypothesis, however, the one study that has analyzed dendritic responses of olfactory PNs using current injections and focal electrical stimulation reported that pyramidal neurons in the PCx lack sufficient NMDA (or other) regenerative currents that could provide either the combination selectivity or amplification of LOT inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bathellier et al., 2009</xref>). Rather, Bathellier et al. reported that pyramidal neurons in PCx, unlike their counterparts in other cortical areas, act as intrinsically linear summing units. This leads to a conundrum: the only alternative source of nonlinearity that would seem capable of producing combination selectivity – recurrent network effects mediated by intracortical inputs (IC) to pyramidal neurons – has also apparently been ruled out: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apicella et al., 2010</xref> tested whether a pyramidal neuron’s ability to respond selectively to LOT input combinations depends on IC inputs, which outnumber a pyramidal neuron’s LOT inputs 10 to 1, but they found no reduction in a pyramidal neuron’s combination selectively when its IC inputs were blocked with baclofen.</p><p>Given the importance of understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying odor representation in PCx, we revisited the question as to whether pyramidal neuron dendrites in PCx can generate local spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nevian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lavzin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Major et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Larkum and Nevian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stuart and Spruston, 2015</xref>). We found that robust NMDA spikes can indeed be generated in dendrites of PCx pyramidal neurons, both in layer 1a and layer two which receives direct LOT input, and using a model we show that these local spikes can effectively amplify clustered versus distributed LOT inputs forming the basis for a discontinuous receptive field. We also show that supralinear summation of LOT inputs is largely confined to a single dendrite, whereas nonlinear interactions of LOT inputs between dendrites are weak. These findings support the idea that a pyramidal neuron in PCx can represent multiple distinct glomerular combinations within its apical dendritic arbor, which fulfills the basic requirements for a discontinuous receptive field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>). Finally, we show that interactions between LOT and IC inputs are also nonlinear, a fact that will likely be important for understanding the recurrent pattern completion functions of the PCx.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Glutamate uncaging evoked NMDA spikes in apical dendrites of PCx pyramidal neurons</title><p>To directly address the fundamental question of whether dendrites of pyramidal neurons in PCx can generate dendritic spikes we used focal glutamate uncaging (MNI-glutamate) to activate specific dendritic locations while recording the somatic voltage. Neurons were loaded with the calcium sensitive dye OBG-6F (200 µM) and CF633 (200 µM) to visualize the dendritic tree and perform calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The majority of our recorded neurons were pyramidal neurons from layer 2, as determined from the Dodt contrast image and somatic firing pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2006</xref>). Gradually increasing the laser intensity to uncage glutamate evoked EPSP-like potentials, which increased progressively up to a threshold laser activation, beyond which a local spike was initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>; n = 10 cells). We then perfused the slices with specific blockers for voltage-gated sodium, calcium and NMDAR channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Major et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schiller et al., 2000</xref>). Addition of the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker TTX (1 µm) did not significantly change the peak of the slow spikes (90.8 ± 6.0% of control; p = 0.16; n = 5). In some cases, we recorded a fast spikelet that preceded the prolonged voltage plateau, reminiscent of the sodium spikelets observed in CA1 pyramidal dendrites and tuft dendrites of neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ariav et al., 2003</xref>); we verified that the fast spikelet was blocked by TTX (an example of a fast spikelet is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref> and Figure 4b). An added cocktail of voltage-gated calcium channel blockers (w-agatoxin 0.5 µM, conotoxin-GVIA 5 µM; SNX 482 200 nM, nifedipine10 µM) had a small, non-significant effect on the peak of the dendritic spike (85.4 ± 4.2% of control; p = 0.08; n = 5). Finally, APV (2-amino 5-phosphonovalerate; 50 µM) a specific NMDAR channel blocker, completely abolished spike initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–d</xref>). These results indicate that as in fine dendrites of hippocampal and neocortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stuart and Spruston, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Major et al., 2013</xref>), NMDA spikes can be initiated in dendrites of pyramidal neurons in PCx. An ANOVA test for comparison of all four groups (control, TTX, Ca blockers and APV) showed statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05). Post-hoc analysis (Dunnett test) comparing each of the three groups (TTX, Ca blockers and APV) to the control yielded a significant difference only for comparison of APV to the control (p &lt; 0.05). Voltage gated sodium and calcium channels only minimally contributed to the slow component of the spike, while the majority of the current was carried by NMDAR channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Major et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schiller et al., 2000</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38446.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Glutamate uncaging evoked NMDA spikes in dendrites of PCx pyramidal neurons.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Fluorescence image reconstruction of a pyramidal neuron filled with CF633 (200 µM) via the patch recording electrode.

Input one was activated over a full range of intensities, up through NMDA spike initiation.

We first established that the model cell can generate NMDA spikes in response to concentrated synaptic excitation at any location along a pyramidal neuron's apical dendrite, and that both the threshold for spike initiation and the spike amplitude measured at the soma increase as the site of spike initiation moves closer to the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The threshold lowering power of an IC bias input on the same branch was somewhat reduced compared to a bias input activated within the LOT itself, consistent with a mild distance-dependent attenuation of synaptic interactions on pyramidal neurons on same apical dendrites. In addition, the model replicated the experimental finding that IC bias inputs on sister and different branches had a significantly weaker effect than an IC bias on the same branch (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2g</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>), though the degree of compartmentalization of IC inputs was, as in the experiments, and as expected from passive cable theory, less pronounced than the compartmentalization of LOT inputs. These nonlinear synaptic interactions persisted for non-synchronized inputs: our simulations revealed strong supralinear LOT and IC input summation when either of the inputs was temporally shifted by 20 ms, and in some cases more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>).

In particular, we predicted that combination selectivity would be observed for glomerular activation patterns that resulted in clustered excitation on apical dendrites, since this would tend to activate NMDA spikes and powerfully drive the cell, whereas input combinations that activated apical dendrites diffusely would fail to trigger NMDA spikes and therefore drive the pyramidal neuron only weakly.</p><p>To test this idea, we distributed LOT inputs in the distal apical tree in either a clustered or dispersed fashion, along with inhibitory inputs targeting both the distal apical dendrites (representing feedforward inhibition), as well as the perisomatic region (representing feedback inhibition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). In addition to these stimulus-specific inputs, we randomly distributed an additional 100 excitatory and 20 inhibitory ‘background’ synapses over the entire apical dendritic tree to mimic the elevated background synaptic activity in-vivo. These ‘background’ synapses were driven by randomly generated temporal patterns and depolarized the cell by 11.2 ± 2.3 mV above the resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>).</p><p>To further replicate in-vivo like conditions, LOT inputs were activated with in vivo-like firing patterns designed to mimic mitral cell responses to odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>, bottom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davison and Ehlers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolding and Franks, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tantirigama et al., 2017</xref>);). The timing and kinetics of feedforward and feedback inhibitory inputs were likewise designed to mimic in-vivo like activation as described in the literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sheridan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sturgill and Isaacson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Large et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Large et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>We compared clustered activation of LOT inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, black) to the same number of synaptic inputs dispersed randomly over the entire LOT-receiving area of the dendritic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, pink). As predicted, we found that that clustered LOT inputs reliably evoked NMDA spikes, powerfully amplifying postsynaptic signal compared to Ohmic (voltage-independent) NMDAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). In contrast, dispersed LOT activation typically failed to overcome the local spike threshold on any dendrite, due both to the lack of concentrated excitation and the presence of inhibition, and therefore resulted in significantly smaller local dendritic and somatic voltage responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b–d</xref>, pink). The difference between clustered and dispersed synaptic distributions was evident over a large input range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c–d</xref>), leading to preferential amplification of input combinations that target individual postsynaptic branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). This effect was entirely dependent on regenerative NMDAR currents: stimulation with Ohmic NMDARs, eliminated the strong dependence of postsynaptic responses on the spatial distribution of synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>, inset,).</p><p>Last, we tested whether the simulated neuron exhibited the fundamental capability needed to support a discontinuous receptive field: receiving equal inputs from multiple glomeruli, but responding only to specific combinations of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e–h</xref>). In keeping with the same-branch vs. different branch logic discussed above, we selected two dendrites as targets of stimulation from three glomeruli. Glomeruli A and B targeted the same terminal apical dendrite of the pyramidal cell, while glomerulus C innervated a different branch that originated from a distinct primary dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>). We then examined whether the cell would respond strongly to combination AB while ignoring combination AC, in line with our previous results and theoretical predictions. We found the AB combination produced strong supralinear responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref> left, g, black), whereas the AC combination produced only a weak depolarization and mostly linear or sublinear summation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref>, right, g, pink). Thus, even in the presence of significant trial-to-trial variability introduced by random background activity and biologically-realistic presynaptic firing patterns, the model olfactory pyramidal neuron was able to use clustered glomerular activation as a basis for representing certain ‘odor’ combinations but not others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8h</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>How pyramidal neurons in piriform cortex integrate their bulb inputs to generate olfactory percepts has been an unsettled question. To address this, we studied the integrative properties of pyramidal neuron dendrites in PCx using glutamate uncaging, focal synaptic stimulation, and compartmental models. Our primary aim was to determine whether local spike generation in the dendrites of PCx pyramidal neurons could serve the dual purposes of amplifying pyramidal neuron responses to LOT inputs impinging on their distal dendrites, as well as provide a nonlinear binding mechanism that could underlie a pyramidal neuron's selectivity for multiple distinct odorant combinations.</p><p>We found that pyramidal neurons in PCx can generate local spikes throughout their apical dendrites, and that a spike in a dendritic branch can powerfully depolarize the soma (i.e. producing up to 40–50 mV depolarizations depending on distance and cell size). Our results are consistent with two key properties of local spikes seen in thin (basal, apical oblique, and tuft) dendrites of pyramidal neurons in other cortical areas. First, the majority of dendritic spikes we observed in PCx pyramidal neurons are mediated primarily by NMDAR channels similar to thin dendrites in other pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Polsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nevian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lavzin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schiller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ariav et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Major et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, in a subset of cases we observed fast spikes reminiscent of sodium spikelets observed in thin tuft and basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons in other cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Major et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ariav et al., 2003</xref>). Second, the NMDA spike amplitude (measured at the soma) increase progressively as the site of spike initiation moves closer to the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Major et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behabadi et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Beyond the properties of NMDA spikes per se, we found that the logic of synaptic integration in pyramidal neuron dendrites in PCx, particularly the pronounced difference between same-branch and between-branch summation, is also consistent with that seen in other types of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Poirazi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archie and Mel, 2000</xref>). In particular, synaptic inputs to a PCx pyramidal neurons are processed via a 2-layer computation. First, LOT inputs are combined within individual dendrites as roughly a weighted sum (i.e. linearly) up to the local spike threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), so that an individual dendrite behaves comparably to a ‘neuron’ in a conventional artificial neural network. A telltale sign of this type of linear-nonlinear (LN) input-output function <italic>within</italic> a dendrite is the nearly pure left-shifting of a ‘control’ input's sigmoidal input-output curve caused by a constant ‘bias’ input activated on the same branch – an effect seen in both our experimental data and simulation results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the second layer of processing, the outflows from the separately thresholded dendritic ‘subunits’ are combined linearly at the soma as a prelude to output spike generation. A telltale sign of linear summation <italic>between</italic> dendrites is the uniform lifting of one branch's input-output curve (especially over its subthreshold range where saturation effects are minimal) by the constant somatic bias voltage generated by another dendrite. This is best seen in the peak amplitude curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b and d</xref>, and in the model input pairing figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref> second sign of (relatively) independent functioning of different dendrites is the much smaller threshold shift in a dendrite's i/o curve seen when a bias input is applied to a different branch, where the least nonlinear crosstalk occurs between LOT-receiving zones in ‘cousin’ branches, and only slightly more between directly adjoining ‘sister’ branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7e</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1g</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behabadi and Mel, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The 2-layer architecture of a pyramidal neuron in PCx allows it to respond selectively to specific high-order odorant combinations – those whose LOT activity patterns deliver concentrated (suprathreshold) excitation to at least one apical dendrite – without responding to the vast majority of LOT patterns that produce more diffuse, and therefore subthreshold, excitation to multiple branches within the dendritic arbor. This ability to respond to multiple distinct high-order combinations, without responding to re-combinations of the same odor components, may account for this cell type's hallmark physiological property, namely its ‘discontinuous’ receptive field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rennaker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kadohisa and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>).

Rather, may result from a more distributed axonal recruitment compared to our stimulation conditions as evident by the large AMPA responses in their recordings (see their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Transformation of the odor code from olfactory bulb to piriform cortex</title><p>Anatomical data indicate that (1) axons originating in the olfactory bulb and traveling along the LOT terminate broadly throughout the piriform cortex, targeting a dispersed population of pyramidal neurons, and (2) single pyramidal neurons receive inputs from multiple broadly distributed olfactory glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miyamichi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nagayama, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>). Lacking any evidence for a patterning of these connections, the anatomical projection from the olfactory bulb to the cortex is generally assumed to be random. In keeping with this assumption, physiological data show that different odors activate a unique set of neurons widely distributed across the PCx, and that individual olfactory pyramidal neurons respond to a small, unpredictable subset of odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roland et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, whereas the bulb forms a molecular-based code wherein M/T cells in a given glomerulus respond to any odor containing that glomerulus' associated molecule, pyramidal neurons in PCx fire only to high-order glomerular combinations, but respond to multiple combinations that appear to have little to no chemical overlap with each other.</p><p>This transformation from molecule-specific responses in olfactory glomeruli to multi-combination selectivity in pyramidal neurons in PCx requires a nonlinear transformation, and indeed several in-vivo and in-vitro studies have indicated that single pyramidal neurons in PCx do integrate odor information nonlinearly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davison and Ehlers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apicella et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poo and Isaacson, 2011</xref>). In particular, activation of a single glomerulus or LOT fiber generates only a small subthreshold depolarization in most connected PCx pyramidal neurons. On the other hand, when multiple glomeruli or multiple LOT inputs are activated simultaneously, or combinations of odorants are presented to an animal, PCx pyramidal neurons produce strong supralinear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davison and Ehlers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kadohisa and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apicella et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilson, 2003</xref>).</p><p>What mechanism underlies the supralinear integration of convergent LOT inputs onto single PCx pyramidal neurons? Apicella et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apicella et al., 2010</xref>). showed that the supralinear summation of LOT inputs onto pyramidal neurons, required neither cooperative interactions in the bulb, nor participation of recurrent IC inputs in PCx. However, the nonlinearity described by Apicella is consistent with either dendritic amplification mechanisms or axonal thresholding effect. Indeed, another potential source of supralinearity would be the cell's output spiking mechanism: a high threshold for somatic action potential generation could in principle be used to limit a pyramidal neuron's responses to only those stimuli that activate N (or more) connected LOT axons. However, without dendritic subunitization, the cell should respond to <italic>any</italic> combination of N LOT inputs, destroying the combination selectivity needed to account for a PCx pyramidal neuron’s discontinuous RF. In contrast, our results support the idea that the dendritic thresholding nonlinearity provided primarily by regenerative NMDA currents can mediate the supralinear integration of LOT inputs observed previously both in-vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The softer compartmentalization of IC inputs, and its implications</title><p>In our exploration of the nonlinear interactions between driver inputs within the LOT and bias inputs delivered either within the LOT or at the IC-receiving regions of the apical tree, we found that the threshold-lowering effects of IC inputs were less well compartmentalized. The effect can be traced to passive cable theory: IC inputs are closer to the branch points where sister and cousin dendrites connect to each other, so that their effects are felt more widely. In quantitative terms, beginning with a ‘control’ input-output curve generated by an LOT input, we found that the threshold-lowering power of a second LOT input on the same branch was roughly 10 times that of an LOT input delivered to a different branch. In contrast to this strong compartmentalization, the threshold-lowering effect of an IC bias input on the same branch is only twice that of an IC bias delivered to a different branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). The observation that IC inputs modulate more globally comes with a caveat, however: it was previously shown that the degree of nonlinear crosstalk between dendritic branches tends to be overestimated in subthreshold summation experiments, compared to a cell operating in the firing regime which enhances subunit independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behabadi and Mel, 2014</xref>). This is because the somatic spike-generating mechanism acts as a sort of time-averaged ‘voltage clamp’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holt and Koch, 1997</xref>) that suppresses subthreshold voltage communication between dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behabadi and Mel, 2014</xref>). In light of this effect, it remains to be determined whether the softer compartmentalization of IC inputs seen in both our experiments and simulations will persist to the same degree under normal operating conditions in the olfactory cortex.</p><p>Both the existence of nonlinear interactions between feedforward LOT and recurrent IC inputs to PCx pyramidal neurons, and the (unknown) degree to which IC inputs act locally (i.e., have modulatory effects confined to a single dendrite) vs. globally (affecting some or all dendrites) in vivo, suggest there remains much to learn about the functioning of the recurrent odor recognition network in piriform cortex. Besides carrying feedback from other pyramidal neurons in the area, IC inputs provide contextual information from higher-order cortical regions including the entorhinal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, potentially allowing the assignment of cognitive and emotional value to odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gottfried, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2000</xref>). The nonlinear interaction of LOT and IC inputs mediated by NMDA regenerativity could provide a biophysical mechanism for binding odor with contextual information in piriform cortex. If so, the dendritic subunitization of PCx pyramidal neurons, and the possibility of some locality of IC modulation within a neuron, could allow contextual information to be bound to certain odorant combinations represented by a neuron and not others.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Possible role of NMDA spikes in dendrite-specific plasticity induction</title><p>Backpropagating action potentials in apical dendrites of PCx pyramidal neurons attenuate significantly as they propagate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bathellier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johenning et al., 2009</xref>), making it less likely that bAPs contribute to spike timing dependent plasticity of distal LOT synapses. In contrast, given that NMDA currents can produce large localized calcium transients in apical dendrites, confined to within ±20 µm of the activated site, such spikes could serve as local induction signals for plasticity of LOT synapses. In accordance with this notion, it was recently shown that NMDA spikes contribute to long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dendrites of CA3 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandalise and Gerber, 2014</xref>). In the same way, a group of LOT synapses that fire together on the same dendrite in PCx could trigger a local plasticity event that induces LTP of the activated synapses. When the same odor is re-encountered at a later time, and re-activates the group of now potentiated synapses, an even more powerful NMDA-dependent response might be generated, signaling odor recognition (for a discussion of related ideas see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu and Mel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weber et al., 2016</xref>)). Further work will be needed to determine the ways and conditions in which synaptic plasticity contributes to the learning-related functions of the olfactory cortex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrophysiology and calcium imaging</title><p>Coronal brain slices 300 µm thick from a 28–40 day old Wistar rats (male and femal) were prepared from the anterior part of the piriform cortex in an ice-cold artificial cerebro-spinal fluid (ACSF) solution saturated with 95% oxygen and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Three pyramidal cells were reconstructed from z-stacks of fluorescently labeled neurons using Simple Neurite Tracer (ImageJ, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Longair et al., 2011</xref>). The cells were subdivided into 493–544 compartments, with a maximum length of 19 µm. The soma area was 829 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Isaacson, 2010</xref>), the total dendritic length was 2238–2516 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mombaerts et al., 1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buonviso et al., 1991a</xref>). The resting membrane potential was −70 mV; the membrane resistance was 25,000 Ω·cm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mombaerts et al., 1996</xref>); the axial resistance was 100 Ω·cm and the membrane capacitance was set to 1 µF/µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buonviso et al., 1991b</xref>). The simulations that included sodium and potassium voltage-gated currents used the Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics formalism. Specifically, fast sodium channels (reversal potential = 50 mV, gNa = 1000 mS/cm<sup>2</sup>), and delayed rectifier and slow non-inactivating potassium channels (reversal potential = −87 mV, gKdr = 500 mS/cm<sup>2</sup>, gKs = 20 mS/cm<sup>2</sup>) were used to allow for spike generation and adaptation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lavzin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To study the synaptic integration in PCx pyramidal neurons, we modeled physiologically realistic patterns of synaptic bombardment. We distributed the excitatory synapses from LOT presynaptic cells in the PCx pyramidal neurons according to known anatomical and physiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bekkers and Suzuki, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davison and Ehlers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franks and Isaacson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2012</xref>). The firing rates and the number of spikes for individual LOT presynaptic cells were drawn from random distributions that matched the known in-vivo firing properties of Mitral/PCx pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davison and Ehlers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolding and Franks, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tantirigama et al., 2017</xref>). The stimulation intensity of a single presynaptic cell was set to produce an EPSC of 30 ± 19 pA, corresponding to a 1.4 ± 0.82 mV somatic EPSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2011</xref>). Inhibitory inputs were randomly placed either in the LOT recipient band, even with the LOT excitation, or in the proximal apical dendritic region within 100 µm of the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Large et al., 2016b</xref>). For a clustered synaptic distribution, all excitatory inputs were placed on a single distal dendrite. In the dispersed distribution, excitatory inputs were allowed to target any LOT-recipient branch. To model intermediate clustering levels, we divided the excitatory input into two pools, one clustered and the second dispersed, and changed the proportion between the number of inputs in each pool. Background activity was mediated by a separate synaptic population consisting of 100 excitatory (AMPA-only) and 20 inhibitory inputs distributed randomly over the apical tree. Background activation was random and unique between different trials with a mean firing rate of 10 Hz. The net result of the background activity was a ~ 11 mV depolarization of the postsynaptic resting potential. Presynaptic neurons were represented by NetStim processes that generated temporal triggers for synaptic activation. Each presynaptic cell gave rise to a single synapse on the modeled cell. Synaptic inputs were driven by a unique spike train for each presynaptic cell, which was generated by setting the ‘noise’ parameter of the NetStim process to 0.5. Excitatory spike trains began at simulation time of 100 ± 6 ms, and inhibitory inputs followed 10 ms later (110 ± 6 ms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2012</xref>). The ISI and the number of presynaptic action potentials in the excitatory/inhibitory presynaptic populations were described by normal distributions (mean ± SD) of 8 ± 5 ms and 5 ± 3/10 ± 3 respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davison and Ehlers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sturgill and Isaacson, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Excitatory postsynaptic synapses contained AMPA-Rs and NMDA-Rs. Inhibition was mediated by GABA-A synaptic currents. GABA-A currents had an instantaneous rise time, a decay time of 7 ms, unitary conductance of 2 nS and reversal potential of −70 mV. All excitatory inputs reversed at 0 mV. AMPA-R currents had an instantaneous rise time and a decay time of 1.5 ms. The average unitary AMPA-R conductance was 1 nS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bathellier et al., 2009</xref>). NMDA-R currents had a rise time of 2 ms and a decay time of 80 ms, and the average NMDA-R conductance was 2 nS. The NMDA-R conductance voltage dependence was modeled as follows: gNMDA = 1/(1 + 0.25·exp(−0.08·V<sub>m</sub>)) where V<sub>m</sub> is the local membrane potential. In some simulations we canceled out the voltage dependence of the NMDA-R current by setting the V<sub>m</sub> to −70 mV for the whole duration of the simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lavzin et al., 2012</xref>). Presynaptic vesicular release was explicitly modeled; each synapse was assumed to contain five vesicles, each with an independent release probability (Pr) of 0.1. The presynaptic pool was replenished with a rate of 100 sec<sup>−168</sup>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Y Schiller for helpful discussions throughout the project and helpful comments on the manuscript.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;NMDA spikes mediate amplification of odor pathway information in the piriform cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Dendrites had been thought to be passive cables. Important work in other brain areas over the past few decades, including that from Schiller and Mel, has revealed that dendrites are often active, are compartmental, and can support both Na and NMDA spikes, all of which may increase their computational power. If dendrites in piriform cortex (PCx) pyramidal cells were similarly active, it could affect how odor information is integrated and transformed in the PCx. However, the only previous study to examine this question directly (Bathellier et al., 2009) concluded that these dendrites were largely passive, resulted in a simple, linear summation of inputs across the dendritic arbor.</p><p>Kumar et al. now revisit this question. Recording in acute rat brain slices, they can reliably evoke NMDA spikes (and sometimes Na spikelets) in PCx pyramidal cell dendrites using either glutamate uncaging or focal electrical stimulation of either lateral olfactory tract (LOT) or intra-cortical (IC) inputs. Computational studies support the sufficiency of their conclusions. This result may have important implications for understanding how odor information is integrated in PCx. It appears that both the Bathellier and the present works are done well, and it remains unclear how to resolve the discrepancy.</p><p>Although all the reviewers found this work to be potentially very interesting, they raised a number of concerns that the authors need to address before publication of this work in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Discrepancy between the present and the Bathellier paper. All three reviewers raised the issue why the present authors see NMDA spikes in the PCx and others did not. Although the reviewers thought that it is not required to fully explain the difference, it warrants more careful discussion.</p><p>Figure 1 shows that NMDA spikes can be evoked by uncaging, which has been little used in PCx, but most of the paper uses a very standard electrical stimulation protocol (50 Hz train of 3 weak stimuli, &lt;20 µA) to show very clear regenerative responses at the soma. Many papers have used a similar train protocol in PCx (not just Bathelier et al.) with no sign of this strong somatic response.</p><p>Although the authors suggest that the discrepant results are due to a difference in the orientation of slice sectioning, this argument is not very convincing. The parasagittal cutting angle of Bathellier et al. (2009) preserves the physiologically relevant LOT and piriform architecture that is being examined in the current study. Cutting coronally severs physiological LOT inputs, and it is unclear why this cutting angle was chosen for the current study, given this disadvantage/complication. Did the authors perform experiments with the slice orientation of Bathellier et al.? Showing data recorded with slices in the Bathellier et al. orientation would significantly strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>There are other clear differences between their results and the results of Bathellier and co-workers that should be discussed. For example, the off kinetics after each stimulation in the stimulation train appear to differ markedly (see Figure 7 of Bathellier et al.). Did the authors ever find fast off kinetics? Also, the intracellular solutions are different. Please reconsider the evaluation of differences in the two protocols. Would stimulating LOT fibers in a more physiologically relevant manner (as in Bathellier et al.) reveal similar NMDA spikes in the pyramidal neurons?</p><p>It is not enough to mention their use of coronal slices (subsection “Mismatch to the currently accepted view of olfactory pyramidal neurons”) because many other papers also use coronal slices. Is it something about the age of the mice (a bit older than usual) or the recording temperature (a bit higher than usual)? If so, do these responses disappear with younger mice at lower temperatures?</p><p>Incidentally, it is puzzling that the authors observe occasional spontaneous large events (Figure 2), which are rarely seen in healthy slices but are sometimes seen in compromised tissue (which might be the case for older slices at warmer temperatures). Could NMDA spikes be related to quasi epileptiform activity in compromised tissue? Recall that PCx is highly epileptogenic because of its profuse associational (intracortical) connections, and network hyperexcitability might be confused with intrinsic electrogenesis (i.e. with NMDA spikes).</p><p>Pyramidal cells have postsynaptic GABA-B receptors. Did baclofen alter the cells' resting membrane potential? If so, surely this alone would directly alter the dendritic excitability independent of any effects on blocking transmitter release from IC inputs.</p><p>In the Materials and methods, the authors say that bicuculline was used in some of the experiments. The authors should be more specific about which experiments were done with inhibition blocked or intact, and whether or not that made any difference.</p><p>We hope that some of the above issues be addressed experimentally. If the authors choose not to perform further experiments, these issues need to be discussed more carefully.</p><p>2) Missing information about cell types: The paper is about &quot;pyramidal cells&quot; in the PCx but many of the figures do not show pyramidal cells. There are at least 4 main types of glutamatergic principal cells in PCx: layer 2a semilunar (SL), layer 2b superficial pyramidal (SP) cells, and layer 3 deep pyramidal and multipolar cells. The anatomical, circuit and intrinsic electrical properties of these different classes have been studied by many investigators over many years and the authors need to respect this previous work. It is also important to their interpretation. For example, the SL cells shown in Figures 2A, 3A and 4D have been shown by a number of groups to receive very weak intracortical inputs on their proximal dendrites, which means that claims of NMDA spikes triggered by proximal stimulation of this cell type could not be believed. Were any layer 3 principal cells studied? These are different again. The data need to be reanalyzed with careful consideration of the cell type, determined from the soma location and dendritic morphology.</p><p>3) Dendritic crosstalk experiments are hard to interpret: This is a key part of the paper that the authors use to infer function, but there are concerns. There seems to be an assumption that &quot;beams&quot; of axons can be separately stimulated within the LOT/layer 1a or within associational layers, like for Schaffer collaterals in CA1, but anatomical studies have shown that axons within the afferent and association layers of PCx do not travel straight and are highly branched (e.g. Haberly et al., 1978, 1984, 2001, etc). Thus, it is hard to accept that &quot;local&quot; extracellular stimulation can be used to separately activate two LOT inputs, or specifically activate sister branches, or selectively activate more proximal intracortical synapses by moving the stimulating electrode closer to the soma. The analysis of these data is also unclear. The idea of a constant &quot;bias&quot; input is used to look for threshold shifts vs. vertical shifts in the input-output plots and infer non-linear interactions. It is stated that threshold shifts are seen, but some plots show a mixture, not discussed (e.g. Figures 4G, 5C, 6C, 6E). If the two inputs are simply recruiting overlapping synapses with variable degrees of overlap, one might expect a complex picture of the kind that is seen. It is also a concern that &quot;sister branches&quot; and &quot;different branches&quot; are defined so loosely, without quantification, especially when noting that SL and SP cells have very different patterns of dendritic branching yet these cell types were not distinguished.</p><p>4) The authors allude to the fact that LOT inputs arrive first followed by IC inputs (subsection “NMDA spikes can be generated throughout the apical tree, and by both LOT and IC inputs”). However, they only examine simultaneous stimulation of different dendritic branches. What happens if they temporally offset, for example, stimulation of LOT and IC inputs? For example, Franks et al. (2011) showed the effectiveness of pairing subthreshold LOT and IC inputs depended on the order in which they were activated, which they attributed to recruiting feedback inhibition. Might dendritic non-linearities partially underlie this effect as well?</p><p>5) Functional importance: The authors hypothesize that clustered synaptic inputs can drive NMDA spikes that powerfully drive the cell under in vivo-like conditions, producing discontinuous receptive fields (subsection “Modeling”). The first part of this hypothesis is reasonable, based on the precedent from other cortical areas, although it is not convincing that the model replicates 'in vivo' conditions. Because of this, how these dendritic events alter somatic spiking (i.e. output) remains unclear.</p><p>For example, PCx neurons in vivo are constantly bombarded with synaptic inputs, depolarizing them well above the -70 mV found in the model. Also, little is actually known about inhibitory inputs in vivo, despite what is stated earlier; most of the supporting citations here refer to slice experiments. Thus, conclusions from the model are expected to be highly approximate. Furthermore, the connection between NMDA spikes and discontinuous receptive fields is not strongly argued. It is widely thought in the field that circuit phenomena, like recurrent inhibition, are more likely to be important than the cell-autonomous effects proposed in this paper. While it has been reported that baclofen blocks associational inputs but leaves the receptive field properties intact, baclofen is a dirty drug in this context (e.g. it also suppresses inhibition and causes epilepsy in PCx in vivo) so the authors should be wary about reading too much into this finding.</p><p>6) Figure 2A is described as showing focused stimulation of LOT fibers eliciting evoked posy-synaptic potentials recorded in the soma, and this is backed up by a decrease of the evoked potentials by APV. But, was there direct stimulation of the dendrite? Was the evoked potential completely blocked by inhibition with APV and CNQX (as Apicella et al., 2010)? Is this really a &quot;synaptic&quot; stimulation as stated in subsection “Initiation of NMDA spikes by activation of LOT inputs using focal synaptic stimulation.”?</p><p>7) Ca imaging in dendrites provides important information for the argument of local NMDA spikes. However, did the authors record from neighboring dendritic trees? Do these data demonstrate the independence of local dendrite responses?</p><p>8) What was the criterion used to determine whether stimulation was in the LOT vs the cortical input? I assume it was the DIC image. Please provide an image.</p><p>9) A t-test cannot be used for tests of significance between more than two samples (e.g. Figure 1D). Either use ANOVA if the assumption of normality is met, or a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis (KW) ANOVA with post-hoc tests of between sample significance or use t-test corrected for multiple comparisons.</p><p>For example, in Figure 5E the &quot;sister&quot; and &quot;different&quot; branches were each compared with &quot;same&quot;, but it was concluded that &quot;threshold coupling between branches was weaker still when the bias was delivered to a different branch&quot;, i.e. a conclusion is now being made about differences between &quot;sister&quot; and &quot;different&quot; branches, which was not tested. This kind of statement requires a multivariate statistical test, e.g. ANOVA. A great deal of the Discussion draws upon results of this kind so it is important.</p><p>Along these same lines, the authors claim there is a significant interaction effect for co-activation of two LOT inputs (subsection “Combination selectivity and compartmentalization of pyramidal neuron dendrites”) on a single dendrite, yet no statistical assessment of an interaction (ANOVA, KW-ANOVA) was performed. These data should be analyzed properly with F-scores and degrees of freedom listed in the Results section and figure legends.</p><p>10) In the “Statistical procedure” subsection, the authors state that sample size was chosen based on &quot;standards used in the field as well as our own vast experience…&quot; While it is acceptable to use common standards in the field (though a power analysis based on previous results would be preferred), it is inappropriate to appeal to authority (&quot;vast experience&quot;) in lieu of proper statistical procedures. Please remove that appeal to authority from the statistics section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;NMDA spikes mediate amplification of inputs in the rat piriform cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

All three reviewers raised the issue why the present authors see NMDA spikes in the PCx and others did not. Although the reviewers thought that it is not required to fully explain the difference, it warrants more careful discussion.</p><p>Figure 1 shows that NMDA spikes can be evoked by uncaging, which has been little used in PCx, but most of the paper uses a very standard electrical stimulation protocol (50 Hz train of 3 weak stimuli, &lt;20 µA) to show very clear regenerative responses at the soma. Many papers have used a similar train protocol in PCx (not just Bathelier et al.) with no sign of this strong somatic response.</p><p>Although the authors suggest that the discrepant results are due to a difference in the orientation of slice sectioning, this argument is not very convincing. The parasagittal cutting angle of Bathellier et al. (2009) preserves the physiologically relevant LOT and piriform architecture that is being examined in the current study. Cutting coronally severs physiological LOT inputs, and it is unclear why this cutting angle was chosen for the current study, given this disadvantage/complication. Did the authors perform experiments with the slice orientation of Bathellier et al.? Showing data recorded with slices in the Bathellier et al. orientation would significantly strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>There are other clear differences between their results and the results of Bathellier and co-workers that should be discussed. For example, the off kinetics after each stimulation in the stimulation train appear to differ markedly (see Figure 7 of Bathellier et al.). Did the authors ever find fast off kinetics? Also, the intracellular solutions are different. Please reconsider the evaluation of differences in the two protocols. Would stimulating LOT fibers in a more physiologically relevant manner (as in Bathellier et al.) reveal similar NMDA spikes in the pyramidal neurons?</p><p>It is not enough to mention their use of coronal slices (subsection “Mismatch to the currently accepted view of olfactory pyramidal neurons”) because many other papers also use coronal slices. Is it something about the age of the mice (a bit older than usual) or the recording temperature (a bit higher than usual)? If so, do these responses disappear with younger mice at lower temperatures?</p><p>Incidentally, it is puzzling that the authors observe occasional spontaneous large events (Figure 2), which are rarely seen in healthy slices but are sometimes seen in compromised tissue (which might be the case for older slices at warmer temperatures). Could NMDA spikes be related to quasi epileptiform activity in compromised tissue? Recall that PCx is highly epileptogenic because of its profuse associational (intracortical) connections, and network hyperexcitability might be confused with intrinsic electrogenesis (i.e. with NMDA spikes).</p><p>Pyramidal cells have postsynaptic GABA-B receptors. Did baclofen alter the cells' resting membrane potential? If so, surely this alone would directly alter the dendritic excitability independent of any effects on blocking transmitter release from IC inputs.</p><p>In the Materials and methods, the authors say that bicuculline was used in some of the experiments. The authors should be more specific about which experiments were done with inhibition blocked or intact, and whether or not that made any difference.</p><p>We hope that some of the above issues be addressed experimentally. If the authors choose not to perform further experiments, these issues need to be discussed more carefully.</p></disp-quote><p>A major concerned raised is the discrepancy between the Bathellier paper and the results presented in this manuscript with regard to the regenerativity capabilities of PCx pyramidal neurons dendrites. We observed both sodium spikelet’s and NMDA spikes while the Bathellier paper failed to observe these regenerative events. Here are our answers to the various issues raised in Point #1:</p><p>a) Additional experiments with similar experimental conditions as in Bathellier paper. To address the reviewers’ concerns head on, we performed additional experiments using sagittal slices, identical intracellular solution (especially in light of the comment regarding the intracellular chloride concentration, see below) and temperature (see next point). Using the Bathellier slice conditions it was easily possible to evoke NMDA spikes in PCx pyramidal neurons. These spikes were robust, completely blocked by the NMDAR blocker APV. The residual synaptic response was further completely blocked with the AMPAR blocker CNQX. We show that these NMDA spikes evoke local calcium transients in the stimulated branch and fail to propagate to sister branches as it could not evoke significant calcium transients in sister unstimulated branches. These results are now shown in new Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p>b) Recording temperature. The reviewer commented about the temperature which is stated to be 36°C in our experimental conditions. Upon more precisely measuring the bath temperature we noticed that our routine <italic>bath</italic> temperature is 34°C, 36°C was measured more distally at the tube. Thus the temperature in all our experiments is similar to that used by Bathellier et al. This is now corrected in the Materials and method section. With regard to the age of the animals used, since we did not perform experiments on young animals we cannot comment whether NMDA spikes can be initiated at a younger age in PCx pyramidal neurons.</p><p>c) Intracellular chloride concentration. The reviewer raises the question of intracellular chloride concentration we used and its physiological relevance. In our experiments we used “low chloride” concentration (4 mM) while Bathellier et al. used “high chloride” (20 mM). The question of what is the intracellular physiological chloride concentration is complex as chloride concentration is actively regulated. However, several groups have directly measured the intracellular chloride concentration in cortical neurons. For example, Boffi et al. (2018) measured an intracellular chloride concentration of 6 ± 2 mM in anesthetized and awake mice using Cl<sup>-</sup> indicator with two photon microscopy. (See also Price and Trussell, 2006; Berglum et al., 2008.) Note that in the past our lab has used a “high chloride” intracellular concentration; we moved to lower concentrations as we believe that it is more physiological.</p><p>d) Spontaneous NMDA spikes. The reviewer commented about the occurrence of spontaneous NMDA spikes and the possibility this might be a sign of compromised slices. We note that spontaneous NMDA spikes occur rarely during an experiment. The resting membrane potential does not show any depolarization and we did not observe spontaneous firing of action potentials in neurons, thus it is unlikely that these spontaneous dendritic events represented an epileptic state. We should stress that using calcium imaging we are able to show that NMDA spikes are very localized to a dendritic branch supporting an isolated activation rather an epileptic-like state. We think that these spontaneous NMDA spikes may represent activation of a small connected subnetwork in the slice, which provides the physiological “substrate” for NMDA spike generation in vivo. Also, an important control that establishes that the regenerativity we describe is a local spike, and not due to recurrent epileptic network effects, is that these spikes are blocked with intracellular NMDAR blocker MK801 (Figure 2E).</p><p>e) Resting membrane potential. The editor commented about the possibility that the resting membrane potential may change with baclofen. The average resting membrane potential without baclofen is -75.51 ± 2.77 and after addition of baclofen is -75.77 ± 2.74 (p&gt;0.5). This comparison has been added to the revised manuscript in subsection “NMDA spikes can be generated throughout the apical tree, and by both LOT and IC inputs”. It is also important to note that baclofen was used in a small subset of experiments (only for Figure 4D-H). We observed NMDA spikes without addition of baclofen both with synaptic stimulation and with glutamate uncaging. Thus it is unlikely that changes in resting membrane potential or any other nonspecific effects of baclofen are the cause of NMDA spike initiation.</p><p>f) Bicuculline. We now mention more clearly in the Materials and method section when bicuculline was used.</p><p>g) Discussion in the manuscript. As our new experiments (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) have ruled out some obvious possible factors such as slicing and solution composition conditions, we are left with speculative explanations as to the difference between our results and those of Bathellier et al. One difference we note is a more distributed recruitment of axons with their synaptic stimulation compared to ours, which is evident by the large AMPA responses in their recordings (see their Figure 6). We feel that a positive result obtained under standard conditions needs less explanation, rather the burden of proof should be passed to the group that reported negative results. With regard to other labs not reporting these spikes, actually we believe that the underlying supralinear summation seen by Davison and Ehlers (2011), for example their Figure 6D, and by Apicella et al. (2010) is probably related to NMDA spike initiation in dendrites of pyramidal neurons. This possibility is raised in the manuscript in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Missing information about cell types: The paper is about &quot;pyramidal cells&quot; in the PCx but many of the figures do not show pyramidal cells. There are at least 4 main types of glutamatergic principal cells in PCx: layer 2a semilunar (SL), layer 2b superficial pyramidal (SP) cells, and layer 3 deep pyramidal and multipolar cells. The anatomical, circuit and intrinsic electrical properties of these different classes have been studied by many investigators over many years and the authors need to respect this previous work. It is also important to their interpretation. For example, the SL cells shown in Figures 2A, 3A and 4D have been shown by a number of groups to receive very weak intracortical inputs on their proximal dendrites, which means that claims of NMDA spikes triggered by proximal stimulation of this cell type could not be believed. Were any layer 3 principal cells studied? These are different again. The data need to be reanalyzed with careful consideration of the cell type, determined from the soma location and dendritic morphology.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up the issue of cell types in the context of piriform cortex. We are aware of the cell types mentioned by the reviewer. However, to reduce complexity, we intentionally chose to concentrate on the pyramidal neurons, leaving out the semilunar neurons. We disagree with the reviewer that the neurons shown on Figures 2A, 3A and 4D are semilunar. As pointed in Suzuki and Bekkers (2006), semilunar neurons are neurons found in the upper layer 2a and lack basal dendrites altogether. We apologize that the layer drawings were not accurate in Figure 2, and the reconstruction in Figure 3 was not elaborate enough with respect to the basal tree. However, all had basal dendrites and were not found in upper layer 2a. We remade the figures to highlight better the basal tree and corrected the layer drawing in Figure 1A and added the layer boundary for all neuron drawings where we have kept the DIC image. In line with Suzuki and Bekkers (2006), we also add somatic firing of the cells shown, to further support the claim that these are pyramidal neurons and not semilunar. Thus all of our neurons were either from layer IIA or layer IIB, and none were from layer 3 (this is now stated in the text).</p><p>As to the comment made by the reviewer regarding Figures 2A, 3A and 4D, in all of these cases stimulation was distal and presumably involved very few intracortical fibers. Thus even if they were semilunar (which they are not) this would not compromise our claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Dendritic crosstalk experiments are hard to interpret: This is a key part of the paper that the authors use to infer function, but there are concerns. There seems to be an assumption that &quot;beams&quot; of axons can be separately stimulated within the LOT/layer 1a or within associational layers, like for Schaffer collaterals in CA1, but anatomical studies have shown that axons within the afferent and association layers of PCx do not travel straight and are highly branched (e.g. Haberly et al., 1978, 1984, 2001, etc). Thus, it is hard to accept that &quot;local&quot; extracellular stimulation can be used to separately activate two LOT inputs, or specifically activate sister branches, or selectively activate more proximal intracortical synapses by moving the stimulating electrode closer to the soma. The analysis of these data is also unclear. The idea of a constant &quot;bias&quot; input is used to look for threshold shifts vs. vertical shifts in the input-output plots and infer non-linear interactions. It is stated that threshold shifts are seen, but some plots show a mixture, not discussed (e.g. Figures 4G, 5C, 6C, 6E). If the two inputs are simply recruiting overlapping synapses with variable degrees of overlap, one might expect a complex picture of the kind that is seen. It is also a concern that &quot;sister branches&quot; and &quot;different branches&quot; are defined so loosely, without quantification, especially when noting that SL and SP cells have very different patterns of dendritic branching yet these cell types were not distinguished.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises concerns that our stimulation might not be as focal as we think, thus leading to overlapping stimulation of different branches when we think we are stimulating branches separately. This in turn would cause a mixture of shifting and lifting of the input-output curves. We will try to answer this point in multiple ways:</p><p>a) We first mention evidence that our stimulation technique is for the most part focal. The technique of extracellular synaptic stimulation we use was specifically designed to produce a very concentrated current within a small volume. We use a double-barrelled electrode and pull the electrode to a final size of 2-3 µm. The two barrels serve as a bipolar electrode, thus constraining the current flow locally. With this method we are successful in stimulating only a small number of axons – those that are very close to the electrode. In previous projects we used calcium imaging to test the number of spines stimulated within a branch by this method of stimulation (Polsky et al., 2004; Sandler et al., 2016). We find that with this method we can activate a small dendritic segments with an average of 8 activated spines which run within 5 µm of our stimulating electrode. In this manuscript as well, the calcium imaging data strongly support our claim of focal stimulation (see Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p>b) Our data support the notion that individual dendrites of PNs in PCx integrate their inputs largely independently of each other, which is a signature feature of a 2-layer model. Theoretically, in a perfect 2-layer model with independent dendritic subunits, a constant bias on the same branch would lead to a clean left shift of the sigmoidal input-output curve, and a constant bias on a sister or any other branch would cause no shifting, but would instead lead to a pure lifting of the input-output curve, because the summation between the branches would be only at the soma. The clear and robust effect that we see, both in the individual experiments as well as the summary plots, is a much more pronounced shifting of the input-output curve for within-branch cases compared to sister or different branch cases (see Figure 5C and 6C-E). Thus, when a bias input is delivered to a sister or different branch, the i/o curves undergo much less shifting, and more uniform lifting. If there were crosstalk in the stimulation pattern, which is the reviewer’s concern, this would tend to <italic>reduce</italic> the difference between same branch and different branch cases, and correspondingly reduce the appearance of independence between dendrites. Thus, if crosstalk is occurring, then the level of independence we show is an underestimate of the actual degree of independence between the dendrites.</p><p>c) Specifically, to further address experimentally the issue, we conducted a new set experiments where we replaced one stimulating electrode with an uncaging spot. In these experiments we activated two LOT “inputs” one with focal synaptic stimulation and the other with uncaging within one branch, and later moved the synaptic stimulation to a different branch while keeping the uncaging spot in place. As is shown in a new Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 and in the text in subsection “Combination selectivity and compartmentalization of pyramidal neuron dendrites”, we observed a large spike threshold reduction with the synaptic bias that was delivered to the same branch, but not to the different branch (Threshold was lowered by 52.2 ± 2.34% and 15.6 ± 4.2% for bias in same or different branch respectively). These data are consistent with the results presented in Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors allude to the fact that LOT inputs arrive first followed by IC inputs (subsection “NMDA spikes can be generated throughout the apical tree, and by both LOT and IC inputs”). However, they only examine simultaneous stimulation of different dendritic branches. What happens if they temporally offset, for example, stimulation of LOT and IC inputs? For example, Franks et al. (2011) showed the effectiveness of pairing subthreshold LOT and IC inputs depended on the order in which they were activated, which they attributed to recruiting feedback inhibition. Might dendritic non-linearities partially underlie this effect as well?</p></disp-quote><p>To test this interesting point experimentally will require a large set of data which we feel is beyond the scope of the present manuscript. To start teasing apart the mechanisms at the single-cell level, we used computer simulations which showed that strong supralinear LOT and IC input summation persisted when either of the inputs was temporally shifted by up to 20 ms. This is now described in Figure 8—figure supplement 3 and in the text in subsection “Modeling”. This result, which is in line with our previous findings (Polsky et al., 2004), suggests that although the supralinear integration time window is not entirely symmetrical, still a supralinearity can be obtained with either ordering. Simulations that include the effects of feedforward and feedback inhibition require many more parameters and assumptions, including at the network level. So as we say above regarding experiments, we feel that modeling the effects of inhibition on nonlinear dendritic integration in PCx is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Functional importance: The authors hypothesize that clustered synaptic inputs can drive NMDA spikes that powerfully drive the cell under in vivo-like conditions, producing discontinuous receptive fields (subsection “Modeling”). The first part of this hypothesis is reasonable, based on the precedent from other cortical areas, although it is not convincing that the model replicates 'in vivo' conditions. Because of this, how these dendritic events alter somatic spiking (i.e. output) remains unclear.</p><p>For example, PCx neurons in vivo are constantly bombarded with synaptic inputs, depolarizing them well above the -70 mV found in the model. Also, little is actually known about inhibitory inputs in vivo, despite what is stated earlier; most of the supporting citations here refer to slice experiments. Thus, conclusions from the model are expected to be highly approximate.</p></disp-quote><p>The question of whether olfactory receptive field can be discontinuous in a cell that is exposed to synaptic bombardment from cortical neurons is indeed highly interesting. To explore this issue, we modified our model. In its revised formulation, olfactory inputs are activated in conjunction with a background synaptic bombardment mediated by excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Because the actual cortical feedback onto principal cells is largely unknown, as mentioned by the reviewers, we decided to model a ‘difficult’ scenario in which this background conductance is large and highly variable (depolarizing the cells by ~11 mV). Our new results indicate that the synaptic integration rules we described before, still hold true even in this scenario. In addition, we now explicitly test for branch selective, discontinuous receptive fields in the model. We show that background excitatory and inhibitory bombardment doesn’t preclude the cell from detecting the spatial arrangement of active olfactory inputs. Postsynaptic depolarization was consistently and significantly larger when simulated glomerular inputs innervated the same distal apical branch compared to segregation of those input to two or more distinct dendrites. Thus, NMDA spikes can promote discontinuous receptive fields in a neuron that incorporates in vivo like background synaptic activity. This data is presented in new Figure 8 and is described in the text in subsection “Modeling”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the connection between NMDA spikes and discontinuous receptive fields is not strongly argued. It is widely thought in the field that circuit phenomena, like recurrent inhibition, are more likely to be important than the cell-autonomous effects proposed in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that presently the field views discontinuous receptive fields as a purely circuit phenomena, but one reason for this is that a cell-autonomous mechanism of the kind we demonstrate here was supposedly ruled out by Bathellier et al. leaving a circuit-level mechanism – still undefined – as the accepted theory (even though it is inconsistent withDavison and Ehlers (2009) and Apicella et al. (2010) who showed that cortical feedback is not required for supralinear summation of glomerular outputs and odor responses.</p><p>By showing that nonlinear dendritic amplification mechanisms <italic>can</italic> support supralinear summation, our paper rules back in the possibility that cell-autonomous mechanisms could mediate discontinuous receptive fields in PCx. Of course, it is possible that both single-neuron and circuit-level mechanisms could play a role in establishing discontinuous RFs, but settling the question of the relative importance of each of these mechanisms is a matter to be taken up in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While it has been reported that baclofen blocks associational inputs but leaves the receptive field properties intact, baclofen is a dirty drug in this context (e.g. it also suppresses inhibition and causes epilepsy in PCx in vivo) so the authors should be wary about reading too much into this finding.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that baclofen has multiple pharmacological effects. For example, Gerrard et al. (2018) demonstrated that activation of GABA-B receptors in vivo both suppresses and enhances activity in principal neurons, leading to hyper-depolarization due to a direct effect of baclofen on GABA-B receptors and epileptic bursts due to disinhibition of the network. However, in our experimental conditions, namely brain slices stimulated at sub-threshold intensities, we never observed any epileptiform-like discharges in any of our experiments. In our experimental conditions cells stayed subthreshold to action potential initiation. In the literature baclofen was used in multiple previous articles to distinguish LOT and intra-cortical inputs, and thus we felt compelled to repeat our experiments with this experimental paradigm. Our experimental results, of clean separation between the effects of Baclofen on the dendritic regions closer to the cell body, known to be mainly intra-cortical, and the lack of effect on synaptic signals in the distal regions of the LOT, is a clear indication of the validity of this approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 2A is described as showing focused stimulation of LOT fibers eliciting evoked posy-synaptic potentials recorded in the soma, and this is backed up by a decrease of the evoked potentials by APV. But, was there direct stimulation of the dendrite? Was the evoked potential completely blocked by inhibition with APV and CNQX (as Apicella et al., 2010)? Is this really a &quot;synaptic&quot; stimulation as stated in subsection “Initiation of NMDA spikes by activation of LOT inputs using focal synaptic stimulation.”?</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer comment we performed experiments to show that APV blocks the NMDA spikes but leave the AMPA synaptic potentials intact and further addition of CNQX blocks the AMPA synaptic potentials altogether (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and text in subsection “Initiation of NMDA spikes by activation of LOT inputs using focal synaptic stimulation.”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Ca imaging in dendrites provides important information for the argument of local NMDA spikes.

Do these data demonstrate the independence of local dendrite responses?</p></disp-quote><p>As a routine we use calcium imaging to determine that our stimulation is focal as shown in Figure 2B. Also we measured the full calcium profile of an NMDA spike as shown in Figure 3. In response to the reviewer comment we also now show calcium imaging of EPSPs just subthreshold to NMDA spike generation, and NMDA spike evoked calcium transients in the stimulated and unstimulated dendrite. We find that using our focal synaptic stimulation method, we observe significant calcium transients only in stimulated branches. This is now shown in new (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and text subsection “Initiation of NMDA spikes by activation of LOT inputs using focal synaptic stimulation.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) What was the criterion used to determine whether stimulation was in the LOT vs the cortical input? I assume it was the DIC image. Please provide an image.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we used Dot gradient contrast video microscopy to identify the LOT region. An example is provided in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) A t-test cannot be used for tests of significance between more than two samples (e.g. Figure 1D). Either use ANOVA if the assumption of normality is met, or a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis (KW) ANOVA with post-hoc tests of between sample significance or use t-test corrected for multiple comparisons.</p><p>For example, in Figure 5E the &quot;sister&quot; and &quot;different&quot; branches were each compared with &quot;same&quot;, but it was concluded that &quot;threshold coupling between branches was weaker still when the bias was delivered to a different branch&quot;, i.e. a conclusion is now being made about differences between &quot;sister&quot; and &quot;different&quot; branches, which was not tested. This kind of statement requires a multivariate statistical test, e.g. ANOVA. A great deal of the Discussion draws upon results of this kind so it is important.</p><p>Along these same lines, the authors claim there is a significant interaction effect for co-activation of two LOT inputs (subsection “Combination selectivity and compartmentalization of pyramidal neuron dendrites”) on a single dendrite, yet no statistical assessment of an interaction (ANOVA, KW-ANOVA) was performed. These data should be analyzed properly with F-scores and degrees of freedom listed in the Results section and figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these statistical issues. We now corrected the statistical tests as requested in the main text (subsection “Combination selectivity and compartmentalization of pyramidal neuron dendrites”) and figure legends (Figures 1 and 5). Statistical tests were performed with Prism 7 (Graphpad) software.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In the “Statistical procedure” subsection, the authors state that sample size was chosen based on &quot;standards used in the field as well as our own vast experience…&quot; While it is acceptable to use common standards in the field (though a power analysis based on previous results would be preferred), it is inappropriate to appeal to authority (&quot;vast experience&quot;) in lieu of proper statistical procedures. Please remove that appeal to authority from the statistics section.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specifically, all the reviewers found this work of importance and are positive for publication of your work at eLife. The revision has addressed almost all of their previous concerns. However, there are a few points to which we would like to see further revisions. For example, we would like you to address the concern regarding the cell types of investigation (Reviewer 2, the second paragraph).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed many of my criticisms, although I would like to place on record that I'm still concerned about the discrepancy with Bathelier et al. (2009). I note the authors' comment that the burden of proof should be on Bathelier et al. to come up with an explanation, but a general principle is that authors should aim to show both why they are right and why everybody else is wrong.</p></disp-quote><p>We generally agree, we indeed made great experimental efforts to come up with an answer, but with no success.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point #2 about cell types is still a concern. Semilunar cells do not necessarily lack basal dendrites altogether (see Choy et al., 2017, who report that SL cells can have basal dendrites). The cell shown in Figure 1A appears to have its soma located in layer 2a, which is where SL cells are located, and looks very like the SL cells reported by Choy et al. (2017). I suggest the authors say they studied principal cells located in layer 2 but concentrated on superficial pyramidal cells. Saying that would be accurate, would avoid the possibility of raised eyebrows, and would not detract from the paper in any way.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now corrected in the manuscript as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I suggested that the authors state that they studied principal cells located in layer 2, mainly focusing on superficial pyramidal cells. I note that the term &quot;pyramidal cells&quot; is deeply embedded in their manuscript and it's unlikely they will change this now, especially given that a number of other groups in the field use a similar terminology. Hence, I'm prepared to overlook this. However, the authors must at least correct the statement in the Results:</p><p>&quot;All our recorded neurons were pyramidal neurons from layer 2, mainly in the upper layer as determined by the Dodt contrast image and somatic firing pattern.&quot;</p><p>This is simply untrue. The cell shown in Figure 1A is not a pyramidal neuron, for multiple reasons noted previously. Pyramidal neurons are not located in the upper layer (presumably meaning upper layer 2?), as confirmed by multiple authors. And the neurons shown in Figure 2A and Figure 9A clearly do not have their somas located in upper layer 2, instead, they are in deep layer 2 or layer 3. This sentence needs to be changed to:</p><p>&quot;The majority of our recorded neurons were pyramidal neurons from layer 2, as determined from the Dodt contrast image and somatic firing pattern.&quot;</p><p>By saying this, the authors avoid stating an untruth at the very start, and at least gloss over the point that neuroscientists from Cajal onward have recognised that the PCx contains more than just one type of &quot;pyramidal&quot; principal neuron.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the sentence in the manuscript as suggested.</p><p>References:</p><p>Boffi JC, Knabbe J, Kaiser M, Kuner T.
