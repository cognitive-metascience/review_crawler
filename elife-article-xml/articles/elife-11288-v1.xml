However, its precise function in cancer remains largely uninvestigated. Here we show the clinical significance and metastatic mechanism of NIFK in lung cancer. NIFK expression is clinically associated with poor prognosis and metastasis. Furthermore, NIFK enhances Ki-67-dependent proliferation, and promotes migration, invasion <italic>in vitro</italic> and metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic> via downregulation of casein kinase 1α (CK1α), a suppressor of pro-metastatic TCF4/β-catenin signaling. Inversely, CK1α is upregulated upon NIFK knockdown. The silencing of CK1α expression in NIFK-silenced cells restores TCF4/β-catenin transcriptional activity, cell migration, and metastasis. Furthermore, RUNX1 is identified as a transcription factor of <italic>CSNK1A1</italic> (CK1α) that is negatively regulated by NIFK. Our results demonstrate the prognostic value of NIFK, and suggest that NIFK is required for lung cancer progression via the RUNX1-dependent CK1α repression, which activates TCF4/β-catenin signaling in metastasis and the Ki-67-dependent regulation in cell proliferation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11288.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11288.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11288.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer cells can rapidly divide to form a tumor. Small groups of cells can leave the tumor to migrate to other sites in the body, and it is these “secondary” tumors that are often responsible for the death of cancer patients. Many proteins influence how and when cells divide and migrate. One such protein called Ki67 is only produced when cells are dividing and it is often used in the clinic as a marker to indicate whether cells have become cancerous. However, it is not clear how Ki67 regulates the progression of cancer.</p><p>Ki67 interacts with another protein called NIFK, and Lin, Su et al. have now investigated the role of NIFK in cancer. First, publicly available data on the levels of proteins in tumor samples from cancer patients were analyzed. This revealed that, in several different types of cancer, tumors that produced more NIFK were more likely to spread to other parts of the body than tumors that produced smaller amounts of NIFK.</p><p>Next, Lin, Su et al carried out experiments using human lung cancer cells. This revealed that cells that produced larger amounts of NIFK were more likely to migrate, while cells with lower levels of NIFK divided and migrated less often. Further experiments showed that NIFK increases the activity of genes that are involved in cell migration. NIFK achieves this by reducing the production of a protein that inhibits the activity of another protein called β-catenin.</p><p>Lin, Su et al.’s findings reveal a new role for NIFK in promoting the development of cancer. A future challenge is to find out whether chemicals that inhibit NIFK could be used in the treatment of lung cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11288.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11288.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>NIFK</kwd><kwd>lung cancer</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>casein kinase 1 alpha</kwd><kwd>runx1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001869</institution-id><institution>Academia Sinica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AS-101-TP-B02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Tsung-Chieh</given-names></name><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Chia-Yi</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Pei-Yu</given-names></name><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Wen-An</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsai</surname><given-names>Ming-Daw</given-names></name><name><surname>Hsiao</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NIFK promotes lung cancer metastasis via Runx1-dependent repression of CK1α, which activates TCF4/β-catenin signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Ki-67 protein plays a specific but enigmatic role in cancer. Since its discovery as an antigen for a monoclonal antibody against a Hodgkin lymphoma cell line more than 30 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerdes et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerdes et al., 1984</xref>), Ki-67 serves as the most useful biomarker of cancer in clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and Gatter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yerushalmi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martin et al., 2004</xref>). The finding that Ki-67 is exclusively expressed in the nucleus during all active cell cycle phases (G1, S, G2, and mitosis) in actively proliferating cells but not in quiescent cells renders it a reliable marker for proliferation fraction assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerdes et al., 1984</xref>). In many cancer types including breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luporsi et al., 2012</xref>), lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jakobsen and Sorensen, 2013</xref>), brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abry et al., 2010</xref>), and prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fisher et al., 2013</xref>), the Ki-67 expression level represents a proliferation index, and Ki-67 overexpression predicts poor prognosis. Moreover, Ki-67 has also been used to determine cancer treatment strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dowsett et al., 2011</xref>). Ki-67 silencing was recently reported to elicit the disappearance of perichromosomal layers in mitosis and the smaller nuclei of daughter cells leading to the problem in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2014</xref>). However, although Ki-67 is known to play an important role in cell proliferation, the mechanism by which Ki-67 regulates cancer progression remains unclear.</p><p>As a nuclear protein, Ki-67 interacts with other nuclear proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sueishi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takagi et al., 2001</xref>). Increasing research focused on the interaction between Ki-67 and other nuclear proteins has paved the way for the elucidation of the mechanism by which Ki-67 regulates cancer progression. <underline>N</underline>ucleolar protein <underline>i</underline>nteracting with the forkhead-associated (<underline>F</underline>HA) domain of p<underline>K</underline>i-67 (NIFK) is a nucleolar and cytoplasmic protein that interacts with Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takagi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byeon et al., 2005</xref>). NIFK binds to the FHA domain of Ki-67 by two key regulators of mitosis: cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and glycogen synthase kinase GSK-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byeon et al., 2005</xref>), and the NIFK sequential phosphorylation at Thr238 and Thr234 is required for the Ki-67 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byeon et al., 2005</xref>). During mitosis, both NIFK and Ki-67 are recruited to the chromosome periphery, and the localization of NIFK at the peripheral of mitotic chromosome is disrupted in the absence of Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Van Hooser et al., 2005</xref>). This critical role of the NIFK-Ki-67 interaction in regulating mitosis renders NIFK as a promising target of cancer research. However, to date, studies focused on the importance of NIFK in cancer are lacking, and no clear evidence has emerged to elucidate whether and how NIFK regulates cancer progression.</p><p>The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is critical during tumorigenesis and metastasis in various types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polakis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sinnberg et al., 2010</xref>). Stabilization and nuclear import of β-catenin activates downstream transcriptional targets, <italic>MMP7, MYC, TCF4, CCND1</italic> and <italic>CD44</italic> which are related to cell cycle, differentiation and metastasis regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schwartz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2011</xref>). β-catenin is constantly synthesized but is normally controlled at restricted low concentration by proteasome-mediated degradation. Degradation of β-catenin is shown to be regulated via sequential phosphorylation by casein kinase 1α (CK1α) first, and then by GSK-3, which facilitates the formation of the destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2012</xref>). CK1 family members including CK1α are constitutively active in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Price MA, 2006</xref>). Therefore, CK1α function is determined by its intracellular level. However, the mechanism of CK1α expression regulation in tumors, especially in lung cancer remains obscure.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to characterize the role of NIFK, an important Ki-67 binding partner, in cancer progression. The significant association between NIFK and Ki-67 expression in approximately 20 cancer types based on samples from over 7000 patients in a public database confirmed the importance of NIFK in cancer. We focused our study on lung cancer due to the strongest prognostic value of NIFK for lung cancer. Surprisingly, our results revealed NIFK significantly promotes cancer migration and invasion <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumor metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic> in addition to its ability to regulate cancer proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NIFK modulates lung cancer metastasis by regulating TCF4/β-catenin signaling via the alternation of Casein kinase 1α (CK1α) expression. Our study indicates that NIFK expression promotes cancer metastasis and proliferation leading to poor clinical outcomes; thus, NIFK may represent a prognostic indicator and a promising therapeutic target for lung cancer patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NIFK expression is most concurrently elevated with Ki67 in lung cancer and lung cancer patients displaying high NIFK level exhibit frequent lymph node and distant metastasis</title><p>Due to the well-known characteristics of NIFK as a Ki-67-interacting protein, we first analyzed the expression level of NIFK and Ki-67 based on a public database. Using The UCSC cancer genomics browser web resource, 16 cancer types from the TCGA pan-cancer cohort were analyzed. A significantly positive correlation between <italic>MKI67IP</italic> (NIFK) and <italic>MKI67</italic> (Ki-67) was observed in almost all cancer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). High <italic>MKI67IP</italic> expression was observed in lung, colorectal, breast, uterine, bladder, head and neck, melanoma, cervical, and ovarian cancer. In these high <italic>MKI67IP</italic>-expressing cancer types, the most significant positive correlation between <italic>MKI67IP</italic> and <italic>MKI67</italic> expression was detected in lung cancer (ρ = 0.488, p&lt;0.001). Based on the heat map, we also observed that the normal tissue group tended to display low <italic>MKI67IP</italic> expression. IHC analysis revealed significantly higher expression of NIFK in the samples from our patient cohort than in the paired normal tissue for lung and colorectal cancer but not breast cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To identify the cancer types in which NIFK exerts the most significant impact on cancer progression, we examined the prognostic value of NIFK for various cancer types using the PrognoScan database. High <italic>MKI67IP</italic> expression was associated with poor survival in several cancer types, including lung, breast, and blood cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By ranking the hazard ratios from the Cox proportional hazards survival model, we determined that high <italic>MKI67IP</italic> expression corresponded to the highest hazard ratio in lung cancer patients (hazard ratio = 4.71, Cox p value = 0.000308). Based on clinicopathological analysis of lung cancer, the patients displaying high NIFK protein expression exhibited more frequent nodal involvement (p = 0.032) and distant metastasis (p = 0.036), as well as a higher pathological stage (p = 0.059) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similar results were observed in a lung cancer cohort from the TCGA database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). According to the above results, NIFK displayed the greatest clinical significance for lung cancer and may be associated with lung cancer progression by regulating tumor metastasis.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11288.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NIFK expression is most concurrently elevated with Ki67 in lung cancer and lung cancer patients displaying high NIFK level exhibit frequent lymph node and distant metastasis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the TCGA pan-cancer cohort, significantly positive correlations between <italic>MKI67IP</italic> (NIFK) and <italic>MKI67</italic> (Ki-67) RNA expression were observed in almost all cancer types.

Knocking down Ki-67 expression by shRNA1 in NIFK-overexpressing PC13 cells and H1299 cells did not impact NIFK-induced cell migration or invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). Therefore, we performed microarray analysis of PC13 cells overexpressing NIFK. The signature of genes displaying a≥1.5-fold change in expression upon NIFK overexpression was subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and MetaCore database analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Based on the MetaCore enrichment analysis, Wnt signaling, a previously identified pivotal pathway in regulating cancer metastasis was most strongly affected by NIFK overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>). The levels of CK1α and the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-AXIN-CK1α-CTNNβ-GSK3β complex were decreased following NIFK overexpression, indicating that CK1α is a key molecule in the NIFK-regulated Wnt signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on these bioinformatics results, we hypothesized that NIFK overexpression downregulates CK1α, thereby decreasing the levels of the APC-AXIN-CK1α-CTNNβ-GSK3β complex, which in turn increases intracellular β-catenin protein stability. The increased nuclear fraction of β-catenin was observed upon NIFK overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) as well as the reduced β-catenin phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, we determined whether TCF/β-catenin transcriptional activity is affected by the NIFK/CK1α axis. The results of TCF/β-catenin reporter assay revealed the decreased luciferase activity in the NIFK-silenced cells. Additional knockdown of CK1α restored TCF/β-catenin transcriptional activity in both NIFK-silenced H661 and H1299 cells (p&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>).

In addition, NIFK overexpression using a lentivirus decreased CK1α expression and increased β-catenin level in A549 and PC13 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, Right). A similar result was observed following transient overexpression of NIFK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To investigate the potential mechanism underlying the NIFK-mediated regulation of <italic>CSNK1A1</italic> (CK1α) transcription, we performed a search using the TFSEARCH website to identify putative transcription factors that may bind to the promoter. Several potential transcription factors were identified according to the matched consensus binding sequences of each candidate transcription factor to the <italic>CSNK1A1</italic> (Ensembl:ENSG00000113712) promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). RUNX1 and SRY scored 100 with respect to the matched sequences. The promoter region from -969 to -127 bp was found to be important for transcriptional activation, indicating the potential involvement of SRY and RUNX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, we determined the involvement of these transcription factors in regulating the expression level of CK1α. Silencing of RUNX1 and SRY expression in H1299 cells using shRNA decreased the CK1α expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), whereas no change in CK1α expression was detected following knockdown of another putative transcription factor, CdxA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, The ChIP assay was performed on NS H1299 cells and the NIFK-silenced H1299 cell clone sh6 to explore whether the binding of the predicted transcription factors to the promoter region is regulated by NIFK. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, increased promoter binding of RUNX1 was observed in the NIFK-silenced H1299 cell clone sh6 compared with the NS control clone (Top panel). In a complementary experiment, the overexpression of NIFK in PC13 cells decreased the promoter binding of RUNX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, Bottom panel). However, this regulation was not significantly observed for SRY based on the ChIP experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, we ruled out the involvement of SRY in the NIFK/CK1α axis. To further determine whether RUNX1 affects CK1 promoter activity, we performed the reporter assay. Our results revealed increased CK1 reporter activity after NIFK knockdown in H1299 cells, which was decreased by RUNX1 knockdown (p&lt;0.001, Left, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In addition, the relative luciferase activity was dose-dependently decreased by NIFK overexpression in PC13 cells (p&lt;0.001, Right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>RUNX1</italic> mRNA level was found to be destabilized upon NIFK overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), and the promoter activity was decreased by NIFK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Inversely, RUNX1 was increased upon NIFK silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). In addition, the NIFK-mediated RUNX1 repression might be relevant to its FHA and RRM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, the binding of NIFK with <italic>RUNX1</italic> mRNA and with RUNX1 protein were not detected (RNA binding protein IP and protein IP data not shown). Therefore, the mechanism needs further to be investigated. In the lung cancer cohort, the NIFK and RUNX1 or CK1α RNA levels were inversely correlated, whereas the RUNX1 and CK1α RNA expression levels were positively correlated (p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).

These results suggested that the effect of NIFK on cell migration may be regulated by CK1α.

The formation of surface lung nodules was significantly restored due to CK1α knockdown in the H661 and H1299 sh6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>, upper left).

Lung cancer patients displaying high NIFK expression exhibited poor prognosis and frequent lymph node and distant metastasis. Although Ki-67 has been a research emphasis of cancer, Ki-67-interacting proteins have not been given the attention that they merit and are generally considered to regulate cancer proliferation via their physiological roles in mitosis and the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byeon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Florian and Mayer, 2011</xref>). Hklp2/KIF15, another Ki-67 interacting protein, plays a critical role in the maintenance of spindle bipolarity during cell division and was reported to serve as a breast cancer tumor antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Florian and Mayer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rath and Kozielski, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scanlan et al., 2001</xref>). NIFK was previously implicated as a c-Myc-responsive gene in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Musgrove et al., 2008</xref>). The significant cancer metastasis-promoting characteristics of NIFK demonstrated by our results provide novel insight into the role of NIFK in cancer. Furthermore, aside from its role as a proliferation marker, Ki-67 has been demonstrated to be associated with metastasis and lymphovascular invasion in cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pollack et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inwald et al., 2013</xref>). However, our results imply that Ki-67 may not affect cancer metastasis via its interaction with NIFK.</p><p>We showed the NIFK-induced cell proliferation is dependent on Ki-FHA binding motif indicating the requirement of NIFK-Ki-67 interaction in lung cancer proliferation. Ki-67 was reported as a key factor organizing chromosomal periphery during cell mitosis, and silence of Ki-67 might elicit cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2014</xref>). NIFK interacts with Ki-67 in mitotic phase, and whether the interaction is critical in nuclear organization remains to be explored. Our previous study characterized the role of NIFK in U2OS cell proliferation as well as the requirement of its RRM for rRNA maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pan et al., 2015</xref>). However, Ki-67 interacting motif of NIFK also plays a role in regulating cell proliferation especially after long-term incubation as compared with the immediate response of RRM deletion in U2OS cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pan et al., 2015</xref>). Both results evidently point on NIFK as a gatekeeper in the maintenance of well-regulated cell cycle. The discrepancy of RRM efficacy in proliferation among two studies might potentially due to the difference in cell type-specific mechanism.</p><p>CK1α, a component of the β-catenin destruction complex, is characterized as a negative regulator that blocks Wnt signaling pathway-mediated metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clevers, 2006</xref>). In the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, the level of intracellular β-catenin is modulated by proteasomal degradation mediated by destruction complex, which is composed of APC, Axin, CK1α, and GSK3β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MacDonald et al., 2009</xref>). Given that β-catenin and APC mutation is less commonly observed in lung cancer than in other cancer types such as colon cancer, understanding the mechanism by which these Wnt signaling inhibitors regulate the β-catenin destruction complex is crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stewart, 2014</xref>). Many studies have demonstrated that the downregulation of the members of the β-catenin destruction complex, including CK1α, is commonly observed in lung cancer cell lines and cancer tissue and correlates with poor prognosis or poor clinicopathological characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Srivastava et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). In our study, we found that NIFK acts as a critical regulator that prevents CK1α-mediated β-catenin degradation, which in turn leads to cancer metastasis. Therefore, these results highlight NIFK as a novel regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.</p><p>In our study, we also observed the sole downregulation of CK1α upon NIFK overexpression, whereas the expression levels of other components of the destruction complex were not significantly altered. Recently, a negative feedback loop of Wnt signaling activation was reported via the Huwe-1-dependent ubiquitylation of Dishevelled (Dvl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Groot et al., 2014</xref>). Upon Wnt signaling activation, Dvl recruits Axin and GSK3-β away from the destruction complex, thereby inhibiting β-catenin destruction complex formation and, subsequently, β-catenin degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Groot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stambolic et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behrens et al., 1998</xref>). Correspondingly, we detected significant Huwe-1 upregulation based on the microarray data of NIFK overexpression, suggesting the activation of an alternative negative feedback loop via the decrease in Dvl activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Although this negative feedback might serve to regulate lung cancer progression via GSK-3β, CK1α, as the downstream rate-determining enzyme that sequentially phosphorylates β-catenin prior to GSK3β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>), remains to play a significant role in NIFK regulated β-catenin degradation.</p><p>An additional interesting finding in our data is that higher levels of NIFK were observed in p53 loss-of-function mutation H661 cell lines and in p53-null H1299 cell lines. The repression of CK1α expression significantly restored the tumor metastatic ability inhibited by NIFK downregulation in these p53-deficient cell lines. These results implicated the critical role of the NIFK-CK1α-β-catenin pathway in p53-deficient lung cancer. Previous studies have demonstrated that CK1α plays a role as a tumor suppressor in p53-inactivated cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elyada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). The loss of heterozygosity of CK1α results in highly invasive carcinoma in a p53-deficient mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elyada et al., 2011</xref>). Because p53 inactivation is a major pathogenic event in lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herbst et al., 2008</xref>), further research is necessary to determine the role of NIFK-mediated CK1α expression in p53-deficient lung cancer.</p><p>Our study revealed that the molecular mechanism underlying NIFK-mediated CK1α downregulation in lung cancer is RUNX1-dependent at the transcriptional level. RUNX1 was originally recognized to display tumor-suppressive ability due to its role in acute myeloid leukemia tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyoshi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Silva et al., 2003</xref>). The loss of RUNX1 from intestinal epithelial cells significantly induced tumorigenesis in a conditional knockout mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fijneman et al., 2012</xref>), and the knockdown of RUNX1 in breast cancer cells resulted in hyperproliferation and abnormal morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janes, 2011</xref>). Cancer metastasis due to the inhibitory effect of NIFK on the binding of RUNX1 to the CK1α promoter region, as demonstrated by our study, represents a novel tumor progression mechanism that merits further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, NIFK, a Ki-67-interacting protein, is first identified with clinical significance in lung cancer progression. NIFK enhances the metastatic ability of lung cancer cells via the Runx-1-dependent repression of CK1α expression and activates TCF/β–catenin signaling, thereby promoting metastasis in lung cancer. In addition, cell proliferation is positively regulated by NIFK via Ki-67. High NIFK expression correlates with poor prognosis and tumor metastasis in clinical lung cancer patients, suggesting that NIFK is an independent prognostic indicator and a promising therapeutic target.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patients</title><p>Tissue samples of non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer from patients were included to further analyze the clinicopathological role of NIFK.

The PCR products were gel-purified, digested with KpnI/NheI, and subcloned into pGL4.20 firefly luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The sequences of cloned promoter region were confirmed by DNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay</title><p>ChIP assay was performed according to the manufacture’s instruction (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Briefly, Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde and quenched by 1.25 M glycine. Cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated overnight with antibodies against RUNX1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) or SRY (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). After immunoprecipitation, protein A beads were added for 1 hr to capture the immune complexes. The beads were washed, and the cross-link was further reversed. DNA was purified and analyzed by RT-PCR analysis. The primer sequences were as follows: RUNX1: 5’- ACTGAGGTTTTCAACAAGACCA -3’ (sense) and 5’-ATCCCCCTGCCATCCTATGT-3’ (antisense) with product size of 223 bp. SRY: 5’-ACCATGGAGTTTTCTTTCGTGA-3’ (sense) and 5’-TGGTCTTGTTGAAAACCTCAGT-3’ (antisense) with product size of 214 bp.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and real-time PCR amplification analysis</title><p>Total cellular RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Advantage RT for PCR Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) at 42°C for 1 hr as described in the manufacturer's protocol. PCR conditions for rat leptin were 94°C for 5 min and 37 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 56 C for 30 s and 72°C for 60 s, followed by a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min by Bio-Rad icycle (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences were as follows: human <italic>CCND1</italic>: 5’-GACCTTCGTTGCCCTCTGT-3’ (sense) and 5’-TGAGGCGGTAGTAGGACAGG-3’ (antisense) with product size of 180 bp; human <italic>MMP7</italic>: 5’-TGGGAACAGGCTCAGGACTAT-3’ (sense) and 5’-CGTCCAGCGTTCATCCTCAT-3’ (antisense) with product size of 504 bp; human <italic>TCF4</italic>: 5’-CCGATGACGAGGGTGATGAG-3’ (sense) and 5’-CCGAGGACACCTTCTCTTCC-3’ (antisense) with product size of 399 bp; human <italic>CD44</italic>: 5’-GGATCCACCCCAACTCCATC-3’ (sense) and 5’-AGGTCCTGCTTTCCTTCGTG-3’ (antisense) with product size of 702 bp; human <italic>MKI67IP</italic> (NIFK): 5’-AGGTGGCGCAGGTTCGCAAG-3’ (sense) and 5’-TGGTGTGGGGCCCTGGCTATC-3’ (antisense) with product size of 632 bp; human <italic>GAPDH</italic>: 5’-GTCCACTGGCGTCTTCACCACC-3’ (sense) and 5’-AGGCATTGCTGATGATCTTGAGGC-3’ (antisense) with product size of 161 bp. For each combination of primers, the kinetics of PCR amplification was studied. The number of cycles corresponding to plateau was determined and PCR was performed at exponential range. PCR products were then electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining in UV irradiation. The mRNA levels were also determined by real-time PCR with ABI StepOnePlus real-time PCR system according to the manufacturer’s instructions. GAPDH was used as endogenous control. PCR reaction mixture contained the SYBR PCR master mix, 50 ng cDNA, and primers. Relative gene expression level that the amount of target were normalized to endogenous control gene was calculated using the comparative Ct method formula E<sup>-△△Ct</sup>. The primer sequences were as follows:</p><p>RUNX1_F:5’-AGCCCCAACTTCCTCTGCTC-3’</p><p>RUNX1_R:5’-TCATCATTGCCAGCCATCAC-3’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Estimates of the survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared using the log-rank test. The association between clinicopathological categorical variables and NIFK expression was analyzed using the chi-squared test. Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used for other statistical analyses. All data are presented as the mean ± S.D. The p values at the following levels were considered to be significant: *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, and ***p&lt;0.001.

NIFK overexpression and shRNA-mediated knockdown was used to investigate the function of NIFK in human lung cancer cell lines.</italic> </p><p><italic>NIKF is upregulated in lung cancer and regulates lung cancer proliferation and metastasis.</italic> </p><p><italic>Mechanistically, the authors showed that NIFK downregulates CK1α, resulting in increased activity of β-catenin signaling. The authors also highlight Ki-67 dependent and independent mechanisms of NIKF action. NIKF mediated RUNX1 and CK1alpha regulation and their subsequent effect on WNT signaling has been well elucidated and adds to general understanding of the mechanism of NIKF action.</italic> </p><p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) RUNX1 levels in microarray of PC13 cells overexpressing NIFK have not been indicated. They should be shown along with CK1a levels. Also, please highlight the WNT transcriptional target genes in the microarray.</italic> </p><p>We thank reviewers for pointing out the question and giving us suggestion. We re-checked the microarray data of PC13 cells transiently overexpressing NIFK. RUNX1 level was not significantly downregulated (-1.14 in fold change). We therefore performed microarray analysis of PC13 cells stably overexpressing NIFK by lentiviral infection to confirm the axis. Please refer to the gene signatures listed in new , which showed significant CK1a (CSNK1A1) and RUNX1 downregulation upon NIFK overexpression (labeled in green). In addition, WNT signaling transcriptional target genes were labeled in red in the list. We further performed IPA analysis to identify the β-catenin transcriptional targets that are upregulated by NIFK. Please refer to the β-catenin transcriptional network in .</p><p><italic>2) Mechanism of destabilization of RUNX1 mRNA has not been well studied, and needs further work. a. Does RUNX1 mRNA bind directly with NIKF?</italic></p><p> <italic>b. Do deletion/mutant constructs of NIKF that affect its binding activities have the same effect on RUNX1 mRNA levels.</italic> </p><p>We thank reviewers for this important question. We analyzed the effects of NIFK deletion/mutant on RUNX1 mRNA levels. The result showed that RUNX1 mRNA was down regulated in A549 cells upon overexpression of wildtype NIFK. Furthermore, FHA, RRM domain deletion and T234A/T238A mutant all alleviated the repression effect toward RUNX1 at RNA level, suggesting that the molecular mechanism underlying the attenuated RUNX1 mRNA upon overexpression of NIFK is complicated and requires further investigation. Please refer to the result showed in .</p><p> <italic>c. Is the decrease in RUNX1 binding to the CK1a promoter upon NIFK overexpression simply due to decreased RUNX1 protein or is there another mechanism? Could NIFK interact with RUNX1 protein? Here, RUNX1 protein levels need to be shown.</italic> </p><p>Furthermore, the NIFK-mediated RUNX1 repression was reversely demonstrated in H1299 cells upon NIFK silencing. The silencing of NIFK promoted the level of RUNX1 protein that is presumably due to the attenuated repression of RUNX1 mRNA in the presence of NIFK, although a regulation at protein level in terms of stability may not be excluded. Please refer to the Western blot data in .</p><p><italic>d. A RUNX1 reporter construct can be used to show that RUNX1 mRNA transcription is not affected but its stability is affected, as a supplement to the actinomycin experiment.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion and we have performed the experiment accordingly. We have cloned RUNX1 promoter into pGL4.20 for reporter assay. Unexpectedly, we observed a significant decrease in promoter activity in A549 cells upon NIFK overexpression. This result together with our previous finding suggests the NIFK-mediated repression of RUNX1 mRNA is likely through a dual pathway mechanism. Please refer to the data showed in .</p><p><italic>3) In , the effect of CK1 upregulation and β-catenin downregulation is very modest.

We have performed quantitative measurements for and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6<italic>—</italic>figure supplement 1</xref> using Gel-Pro Analyzer software. Band intensity was normalized to corresponding internal control (β-actin). The results collectively support our previous interpretation.

The authors did not report levels of phosphorylated β-catenin, and need to do so.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion. We studied the phosphorylated β-catenin in A549 and PC13 cells. In agreement with the decreased level of CK1 α protein upon overexpression of NIFK (), our new results showed that the phosphorylation level of β-catenin were also decreased in response to overexpression of NIFK. Please refer to the result showed in .</p><p><italic>5) In , RNA levels need to be quantified by QPCR.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion. RNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR using specific primer targeting RUNX1 in A549 cells upon treatment of Actinomycin D. The trend is similar to what we previously showed in that overexpression of NIFK induced instability of RUNX1 mRNA. Please refer to the data showed in .</p><p><italic>6) Also add a correlation scatter plot for NIKF and CK1alpha from TCGA samples.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate for the suggestion. We re-analyzed the correlation for NIFK and CK1alpha from the same TCGA lung cancer cohort database (genomic_TCGA_LUNG_exp_HiSeqV2_exon_clinical). However, the correlation is not as predicted. Another cohort with 513 cases of lung adenocarcinoma patients from TCGA (genomic_TCGA_LUAD_exp_HiSeqV2_percentile_clinical) was retrieved and analyzed. The result showed the statistically significant correlation among NIFK, RUNX1 and CK1alpha. Please refer to the new scatter plot in the manuscript ().</p><p><italic>7) Are any of the observed effects of NIFK dependent on its interaction with Ki-67?</italic></p><p>This question is critical for illustrating the role of Ki-67 in NIFK-mediated effects. In this study, we reported that NIFK-mediated cell proliferation likely depends on its interaction with Ki-67 in which (1) silencing of Ki-67, (2) truncation of FHA domain-interacting motif of NIFK, and (3) T234A/T238A mutation of NIFK all showed attenuated abilities in promotion of cell proliferation compared to NIFK wildtype overexpression group ().</p></body></sub-article></article>
