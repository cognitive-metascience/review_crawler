A clearer understanding of this intrinsic circuitry would afford new opportunities to modulate protein function. Here, we have identified allosteric sites in protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) by combining multiple-temperature X-ray crystallography experiments and structure determination from hundreds of individual small-molecule fragment soaks. New modeling approaches reveal 'hidden' low-occupancy conformational states for protein and ligands. Our results converge on allosteric sites that are conformationally coupled to the active-site WPD loop and are hotspots for fragment binding. Targeting one of these sites with covalently tethered molecules or mutations allosterically inhibits enzyme activity. Overall, this work demonstrates how the ensemble nature of macromolecular structure, revealed here by multitemperature crystallography, can elucidate allosteric mechanisms and open new doors for long-range control of protein function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36307.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins perform many important jobs in each of the cells in our bodies, such as transporting other molecules and helping chemical reactions to occur. The part of the protein directly involved in these tasks is called the active site. Other areas of the protein can communicate with the active site to switch the protein on or off. This method of control is known as allostery.</p><p>Switching proteins on and off could help us to develop treatments for certain diseases. For example, a protein called PTP1B reduces how well cells can respond to insulin. Switching this protein off could therefore help to treat diabetes. However, much like it’s hard to guess how a light switch is wired to a light bulb without seeing behind the walls, it is hard to predict which remote areas of a protein are ‘wired’ to the active site.</p><p>Keedy, Hill et al. have now used two complementary methods to examine the structure of PTP1B and find new allosteric sites. The first method captured a series of X-ray images from crystallized molecules of the protein held at different temperatures. This revealed areas of PTP1B that can move like windshield wipers to communicate with each other. The second method soaked PTP1B crystals in trays with hundreds of drug-sized molecules and assessed which sites on the protein the molecules bound to. The molecules generally bound to just a few sites of the protein. Further tests on one of these sites showed that it can communicate with the active site to turn the protein on or off.</p><p>Further work will be needed to develop drugs that could treat diabetes by binding to the newly identified allosteric sites in PTP1B. More generally, the methods developed by Keedy, Hill et al. could be used to study allostery in other important proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>allostery</kwd><kwd>protein dynamics</kwd><kwd>phosphatase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002112</institution-id><institution>A.P.

id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteins are collections of atoms that are mechanically coupled to one another, which gives rise to coordinated motions within the constraints of the folded structure. These motions are critical for many processes in molecular biology, including small-molecule and protein:protein binding interactions, catalytic cycles in enzymes, and allosteric communication between active sites and distal regulatory sites. Allostery in particular is now recognized to occur not only in classical oligomeric proteins like hemoglobin but also in monomers -- and indeed may be inherent to nearly all protein structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Motlagh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gunasekaran et al., 2004</xref>). However, we do not yet understand at a fundamental level how mechanically coupled atoms underlie communication through protein structures, which prevents us from mapping their intrinsic allosteric ‘circuitry’. Moreover, because protein surfaces are large and intermolecular interactions are complex, it is difficult to predict which surface sites can bind an effector (such as a small molecule) that will allosterically communicate with the active site. These gaps severely limit our ability to elucidate natural allosteric regulatory mechanisms in biology, and to exploit allosteric circuitry in proteins for therapeutic intervention with perturbations such as small molecules.</p><p>One system that would benefit immensely from an improved mechanistic understanding of allostery is the archetypal protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1B (also known as PTPN1). PTP1B is highly validated as a therapeutic target for diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elchebly et al., 1999</xref>) and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krishnan et al., 2014</xref>) and has also been linked to Rett syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krishnan et al., 2015</xref>). Extensive efforts have been made to develop active-site inhibitors for PTP1B. Unfortunately, active-site inhibitors in general often bind non-specifically to homologous proteins, leading to off-target cellular effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeDecker, 2000</xref>). Moreover, the active sites of many enzymes, including phosphatases, are highly polar, and the polar inhibitors which bind to them often suffer from poor bioavailability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hardy and Wells, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang, 2001</xref>). Attempts have been made to circumvent these limitations and selectively target the active site of PTP1B -- for example, by linking non-hydrolyzable phosphotyrosine (pTyr) analogs that bind the active site with small-molecule fragments that bind in nearby, less conserved sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang, 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, no active-site inhibitors for PTP1B have reached clinical use, leading some to label PTP1B ‘undruggable’.</p><p>By contrast, an allosteric inhibitor that binds to a less-conserved and less-polar surface site could bypass the limitations of active-site inhibitors. Two classes of compounds have been identified that allosterically inhibit PTP1B, although each has limitations. The first class of compounds are based on a benzbromarone (BB) scaffold and inhibit allosterically by binding to the space normally occupied by the regulatory C-terminal α7 helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wiesmann et al., 2004</xref>). Recent work combining mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations revealed how rotations of the α3 helix and a discrete switch of the catalytic WPD loop are impacted by these BB allosteric inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>). Unfortunately, the BB molecules were not successfully translated to the clinic. The second class are natural products, including a molecule called MSI-1436, that bind to multiple sites that primarily involve the disordered C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krishnan et al., 2014</xref>). However, the binding poses were not structurally resolved, limiting our ability to understand the molecules’ allosteric mechanism and rationally improve their potency. For example, a variant of MSI-1436 had improved inhibition but a different response to mutations at the putative binding sites, suggesting an unknown change in mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krishnan et al., 2018</xref>). MSI-1436 passed Phase I clinical trials but was not advanced to Phase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghattas et al., 2016</xref>). A new approach to revealing the intrinsic allosteric circuitry of proteins would reveal different opportunities to develop allosteric inhibitors for PTP1B that could potentially overcome the limitations of these existing molecules. Such an approach would additionally set the stage for efforts to dissect allosteric regulatory strategies in other biologically important phospho-signaling proteins.</p><p>Here, we have addressed the challenge of discovering unique opportunities for allosteric inhibition of PTP1B by taking advantage of two new techniques in X-ray crystallography that reveal minor conformational states of protein and ligands. First, multitemperature crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Keedy et al., 2015b</xref>) can reveal previously hidden alternative conformations that enable biological functions. Here, we use this approach in PTP1B to reveal alternative conformations that are coupled to each other, forming an allosteric network. Our findings provide support for the previously hypothesized allosteric network in PTP1B that responds to BB inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, they reveal extensions of this network, including additional allosteric binding sites that are distinct from the BB site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Similar regions of PTP1B have been implicated as allosteric sites based on mutagenesis coupled with traditional cryogenic X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, and NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2017</xref>); here, we complement those studies by using multitemperature crystallography to reveal in atomic detail the conformational heterogeneity that allosterically links these sites to the active site. Second, high-throughput small-molecule fragment soaking and structure determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins et al., 2017</xref>) has enabled new algorithms for revealing low-occupancy ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pearce et al., 2017</xref>). We use this approach to comprehensively canvas the PTP1B surface with 1627 small-molecule fragments, 110 of which were structurally resolved in complex with PTP1B. The fragments cluster into 11 fragment-binding hotspots outside of the active site. To prioritize putative allosteric sites rather than benign binding sites, we focused on the subset of fragment-binding sites that were also conformationally coupled to the active site based on multitemperature crystallography of apo PTP1B. Strikingly, the sites chosen in this way bound more fragments than did any other sites -- suggesting that conformational heterogeneity may be important for both allostery and ligand binding. Our work builds on previous studies of these sites in PTP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2017</xref>), which did not report chemical matter that binds to them. Finally, we use covalently tethered small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erlanson et al., 2004</xref>) at one of these sites to confirm that it is functionally linked to enzyme activity, thereby supporting our predictions from multitemperature crystallography of the apo protein.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36307.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of key structural components in PTP1B.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The ‘front side’ of PTP1B features the active site covered by the dynamic catalytic WPD loop, as well as several other structural elements relevant to substrate recognition and binding.

The pocket between the α3 helix and the β sheet includes several sidechains which interact with each other, leading to the ‘197 site’ (green). Elsewhere on the back side, a sidechain in loop 16 interacts with the α6-α7 connection to form the ‘loop 16 site’ or ‘L16 site’ (blue). These two allosteric sites are distinct from the previously established ‘BB site’ (orange) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wiesmann et al., 2004</xref>), which is underneath the α7 helix that is displaced by BB allosteric inhibitor binding.

The authors of the study reporting BB2 described a series of induced conformational changes that begins with BB2 directly displacing Trp291 to disorder the entire C-terminal α7 helix, and ends with Phe191 χ2 dihedral-angle rotations clashing with the WPD loop anchor residue Trp179 to stabilize the open state. We tested the hypothesis that these allosterically inhibited conformations pre-exist in apo PTP1B by examining these regions in our multitemperature apo crystal structures. Indeed, in apo PTP1B the α7 helix is more ordered at lower temperatures but more disordered at higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Also, Trp179 and Phe191 adopt dual conformations at higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) that coincide well with the apo and allosterically inhibited conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also see alternative conformations at high temperatures for several residues within and directly flanking the WPD loop (Arg221, Pro185, Trp179, Phe269) which have been implicated as being important for a CH/π switch during WPD loop opening/closing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Multiple conformations for Leu192 were more difficult to detect at higher temperatures in apo PTP1B. This is likely because Leu192 shifts more subtly between the 100 K apo and allosterically inhibited conformations, which is also consistent with a recent report that Leu192 is a relatively static inter-helical ‘wedge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>).

To account for these peaks in the map, it is necessary to add a second alternative conformer to the model, which includes a translation at one end and dihedral-angle changes at the other end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

Our 273 K data suggest that a subsequent reordering of the α7 polypeptide occurs, which may contribute to the affinity of BB3 for PTP1B.

However, in the 100 K structure with BB1, a different derivative of the BB scaffold, α7 also reorders -- but adopts a significantly different conformation than we observe at 273 K with BB3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E,G</xref>). Together, these results suggest that in addition to being a major allosteric hub when ordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>), α7 is also quite malleable when disordered, and may interact in diverse ways with bound ligands -- behavior which is similar to the mechanism proposed for inhibitors that bind via the disordered C-terminus beyond α7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krishnan et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Multitemperature crystallography of the allosteric loop 16 site</title><p>We also observed temperature-dependent ordering in a loop (loop 16, L16; residues 237–243) that sits underneath the α6-α7 junction just beyond the BB binding site.

When the WPD loop is closed and the α7 helix is ordered, Tyr152 adopts a ‘down rotamer’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, red). By contrast, when the WPD loop is open and the α7 helix is disordered, the 278 K electron density suggests that Tyr152 adopts an ‘up rotamer’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, orange). However, difference electron density peaks remain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) that indicate the presence of the down rotamer as an alternative conformation. Consistent with this interpretation, modeling just the additional down rotamer is insufficient to explain the density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These two rotamers are accommodated in the WPD-loop-open state by a shift of the L11 backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The down rotamer is sterically incompatible with phosphorylation of Tyr152, which occurs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandyopadhyay et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rhee et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that the up rotamer may have additional regulatory roles. Tyr152 in the L11 backbone conformation with just the down rotamer (red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) is sterically incompatible with the open WPD loop conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Similarly, the Tyr152 up rotamer is sterically incompatible with the ordered α7 conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In turn, α7 is conformationally synchronized with the WPD loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and is a key hub connecting loop 11 and the WPD loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>). These results together suggest that the allosteric circuitry of PTP1B involving Tyr152 is complex and multibody. Tyr152 likely exemplifies a population shuffling mechanism whereby mixtures of microstates (rotameric state of Tyr152) exchange on a fast timescale as the protein transitions between macrostates (WPD loop state, α7 ordering, and L11 backbone shifting) on a slower timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smith et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings thus shed additional light on the mechanism by which loop 11 allosterically communicates with the active site, thus complementing other recent studies using mutagenesis, MD, and NMR to map allostery in PTP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In our datasets at temperatures above 100 K, the electron density suggests a complex interplay between alternative conformations for Asn193 on the α3 helix and Tyr152 on loop 11 (L11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Asn193 is part of the α3 helix (residues 187–202), which immediately follows the WPD loop in sequence. The N-terminal region of this helix (through Phe196) rotates by 2–20°, resulting in shifts of 0.2–0.7 Å for some Cα atoms, based on 100 K crystal structures of apo (WPD-open) vs. active-site-inhibitor-bound (WPD-closed) PTP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, the multiconformer model for our 278 K apo dataset includes alternative backbone conformations for the WPD loop and the beginning of α3, through Asn193 plus Phe196-Lys197 (this is a conservative interpretation of which residues in the helix have alternative backbone conformations). Our results suggest that α3 inherently shifts as the protein transitions betweens its global macrostates, even in the apo state.</p><p>Strikingly, several residues propagating down L11 from Tyr152, and down α3 from Asn193, also adopt multiple conformations at higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These residues colocalize in a shallow pocket nestled between loop 11, the β4 and β5 strands, and the α3 and α7 helices. We refer to this area here as the ‘197 site’ because the sidechain of Lys197 extends into the pocket. Our analysis indicates a complex, interconnected network involving multiple aromatic stacking, hydrogen-bonding, van der Waals, and electrostatic interactions. To complement this model-based assessment with a map-based approach, for several residues in the pocket we quantified electron density as a function of temperature for atom positions that are unique to the minor conformation (i.e. do not overlap with any atoms in the major conformation), reasoning that residues which respond to temperature similarly may be conformationally coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Keedy et al., 2015b</xref>). The population of each minor conformation increases non-linearly with temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) in a similar fashion as the open state of the WPD loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and the disordered state of the α7 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), in support of the idea that these various regions of the protein are mutually conformationally coupled.</p><p>We next discuss several similarities and a few differences between what we refer to as the 197 site and similar regions implicated by other recent studies of allostery in PTP1B. First, in addition to predicting the L16 site (see above), reciprocal chemical shift changes upon mutation suggested that several residues at both ends of the 197 site (Tyr152, Tyr153, Lys150, Arg105) are part of a region referred to as ‘Cluster I’ that is allosterically linked to the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2017</xref>). However, that study did not implicate additional key residues on the α3 helix, for example Asn193 and Lys197. Second, mutagenesis, NMR, and cryogenic crystallography implicated several elements of our 197 site as being part of the larger allosteric network in PTP1B: loop 11 (including Tyr152 and Tyr153), the α3 helix (especially Asn193), and the α7 helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>). Chemical-shift-restrained molecular dynamics simulations further suggested that Tyr152 on loop 11 and Asn193 on the α3 helix have mutually coupled alternative conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>). However, here we highlight additional residues (e.g. Asp148 and Glu157 on the β strands on either end of loop 11) as being conformationally coupled to each other and to the rest of the allosteric network and the active site, and which may collectively form a binding pocket. Therefore, our work accomplishes two things with regard to these existing studies. First, we add support to their findings by reaching similar conclusions using orthogonal methods. Second, we complement the other studies by revealing additional amino acid residues that may play roles in binding and allosteric communication at the 197 site.</p><p>We also emphasize that the 197 site is structurally distinct from the two allosteric sites that have previously been targeted with small molecules to achieve inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krishnan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wiesmann et al., 2004</xref>), so any small molecules that bind to the 197 site would represent a distinct strategy for inhibiting PTP1B. Surprisingly, in all of our multitemperature apo structures, ordered glycerols are present not only in the active site as mentioned above but also in the 197 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), and MPD also binds here in another published structure (PDB ID 2cm2). These observations suggest that the 197 site may be bindable by other small molecules. We therefore hypothesized that binding of a small molecule to the 197 site could propagate changes in conformational heterogeneity to the WPD loop to interfere with catalysis.</p><p>To test whether more directed perturbations to the 197 site can allosterically modulate enzyme function, we introduced ‘dynamically destructive’ mutations (Y152G, Y153A, K197A) that were predicted to preserve the protein’s general structure, yet interfere with the conformational heterogeneity along the putative allosteric pathway lining the 197 site by removing interactions between alternative conformations. For Y152 we chose a mutation to glycine instead of alanine to more fully disengage residue 152 from the WPD loop, given that the Cβ and Hβ atoms of Y152 sterically engage with the WPD loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). All three mutations indeed reduce catalytic efficiency, to varying extents: the mutation nearest to the WPD loop (Y152G) reduced k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> the most, and the mutation farthest from the WPD loop (K197A) reduced k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> the least (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Our results are generally in line with reported effects for the Y152A + Y153A (‘YAYA’) double mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>) and for the Y153A single mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2017</xref>); small discrepancies may be due in part to differences in the length of the protein construct being used. Overall, our results illustrate that local perturbations in the vicinity of the allosteric 197 site can impact catalysis.</p><p>Overall, we describe a large, collectively coupled allosteric network on one contiguous face of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This network is interconnected not only on the surface, but also within the hydrophobic core. For example, Tyr176 adopts alternative sidechain conformations at higher temperatures that differ by a small rotation of the relatively non-rotameric χ2 dihedral angle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lovell et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). The two conformations of Tyr176 are structurally compatible with different conformations of the surface-exposed Tyr152 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2017</xref>) in one direction, and of the buried Trp179 in the WPD loop and BB allosteric pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wiesmann et al., 2004</xref>) in the other direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, surface residues such as Tyr152 may be conformationally coupled to the buried underside of the WPD loop via a similar mechanism as BB binding -- remotely modulating the Trp179 anchor via coordinated hydrophobic shifts -- but from a different angle of attack, via Tyr176. Overall, such coordinated local shifts within the hydrophobic core likely ‘lubricate’ the transition between discrete global states of PTP1B.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Assessing the ligandability of the surface of PTP1B using automated crystallography</title><p>Although the results described above establish a conformationally coupled network within the structure of PTP1B, allosteric inhibition also requires binding sites for small molecules that can conformationally bias this network to modulate function. To identify potential allosteric ligand-binding sites in PTP1B, we mapped the small-molecule binding potential or ‘ligandability’ of the entire protein surface. Specifically, we used small-molecule fragments, which by virtue of their small size provide a relatively large sampling of drug-like chemical space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murray and Blundell, 2010</xref>). Astex Pharmaceuticals has previously explored fragment-based drug design for PTP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hartshorn et al., 2005</xref>); however, that screen used molecules pre-selected to enrich for binders to phosphatase active sites, which contrasts with our goal of exploring the surface outside of the active site. To determine cocrystal structures of hundreds of fragments with PTP1B, we used the high-throughput fragment-soaking and crystallographic pipeline available at Diamond Light Source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins et al., 2017</xref>) to individually soak 1918 apo PTP1B crystals with small-molecule fragments in DMSO from several curated libraries, and another 48 with just DMSO. We then used robotic sample handling to automatically collect complete X-ray datasets at 100 K (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Of the 1966 total soaks, 1774 yielded diffraction data that could be successfully processed. The data were generally high-resolution: the average resolution was 2.1 Å, 65% of resolutions were better than 2.0 Å, and 87% were better than 2.5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). The large number of datasets enabled us to use the new Pan-Dataset Density Analysis (PanDDA) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pearce et al., 2017</xref>) to reveal bound fragments. PanDDA performs weighted subtractions of the ‘background’ electron density (computed from apo and unbound datasets) from each electron density map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). The optimal subtraction, chosen by a heuristic, yields electron density corresponding to the ligand-bound fraction of unit cells in the crystal.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36307.024</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Electron-density background subtraction reveals small-molecule fragments at allosteric sites in PTP1B.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histogram of X-ray resolution for 1774 structures of PTP1B soaked with small-molecule fragments (gray) vs. the 110 structures from that set with small-molecule fragments bound to PTP1B (green).

Overall, 12 different sites in PTP1B were observed to bind fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These sites are structurally distinct from one another -- that is, they share no residues in common, and fragments bound within different sites do not overlap with each other. They are also widely distributed across the protein surface. Twenty-five fragments bind to multiple sites, but promiscuous binding is not unexpected from such small fragments, and still provides valuable information about favorable binding poses in each site.</p><p>PanDDA initially identified &gt;80 putative binding events in the active site. Many of these can be attributed to movements of the WPD loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), often induced by oxidation of the catalytic Cys215, which is a natural regulatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Montfort et al., 2003</xref>). Apart from these protein events and other false positives, we observe four fragments bound in the active site. This number is relatively low likely because our libraries were not customized to bind to the highly charged active site of PTP1B, as was the case in the Astex study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hartshorn et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>To identify allosteric binders, we examined sites outside of the active site.

This retrospective result validates the idea that fragment screening identifies binding sites, and specific fragment poses in those sites, that can be fruitfully exploited for allosteric inhibition. Interestingly, in one structure with a fragment bound in the BB site, the α7 helix adopts a reordered conformation that covers the binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), reminiscent of other examples in published structures and in our high-temperature datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Excitingly, both sites are fragment-binding hotspots: 17 fragments bind to the L16 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) and 30 fragments bind to the 197 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Thus, independent methods to assess allosteric coupling and ligandability converge on the same sites in PTP1B. Our results agree with previous studies, based on mutagenesis and NMR, which implicated several residues in the L16 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2017</xref>) and in the 197 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2017</xref>) as participating in an active-site-linked allosteric network. We also add value to those studies in another way: by reporting the binding poses of a few dozen small-molecule ligands that bind to these sites in atomic detail. Because these two sites are both conformationally coupled to the active site and capable of binding a variety of small molecules, they may be promising sites to explore for small-molecule allosteric inhibition of PTP1B activity.</p><p>The L16 site is between loop 16 (L16), the beginning of α1, and the end of α6. Most of the 17 fragments that bind here appear to ‘pry apart’ these elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) to create a cryptic binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cimermancic et al., 2016a</xref>). Because the end of α6 is coupled to the beginning of α7, which is perhaps the central allosteric hub of PTP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>), this site seems promising for allosteric inhibition. The fragments that bind here are diverse but have some common features: aromatic moieties sandwich between Pro239 (of L16) and Met282 (α6), and carboxyl groups hydrogen-bond to the backbone amide of Glu2 (α6). These fragments do not spatially overlap with any fragments in the nearby BB site, confirming that the L16 site is genuinely distinct from the previously explored allosteric site.</p><p>The 197 site is on the opposite side of the BB site, near α3 (including Lys197) and L11 (including Tyr152). Thirty fragments bind in the 197 site, with 14 in the primary subsite near Lys197, and 17 in a nearby but distinct subsite separated by a ‘ridge’ formed by the Gln157 and Glu170 sidechains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) (one fragment binds in both the primary subsite and the secondary subsite). These fragments are characterized by packing of aromatic moieties above Leu172, with additional aromatic or polar extensions in various directions. As with the L16 site, fragments in this site do not overlap with any fragments in the nearby BB site. However, several of the fragments in the 197 site do overlap with the positions of ordered glycerols from our multitemperature structures (which were absent from all fragment-soaked structures to avoid competition for binding) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, glycerol in PDB ID 3qkp and β-octylglucoside in PDB ID 2cmc (among other examples) bind to sites that are occupied by fragments in our structures. These findings emphasize that fortuitous binding of buffer components and other miscellaneous compounds can in some cases provide useful information about binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mattos and Ringe, 1996</xref>). It may be possible to link fragments in the primary subsite and secondary subsite to increase binding affinity. Although some fragments in the secondary subsite are largely stabilized by crystal-lattice contacts, they still enjoy favorable interactions with the protein that could potentially be useful for fragment extension. By contrast, the primary subsite is generally free from crystal-lattice contacts.</p><p>To assess the effect of the bound fragments on the structure of PTP1B more globally, for each dataset we built an ensemble structure consisting of both the ground state and the bound state. Each dataset was modeled with an innovative PDB format as a multiconformer structure that represents both a heterogeneous apo state and a heterogeneous holo state. Due to limitations in the PDB model format and in the ability of conventional refinement programs to interpret and create reasonable restraints for this model type, either one conformation or four alternative conformations were used to describe each residue, often when only two were necessary. Due to this forced degeneracy, refinement of coordinates, occupancy, and B-factors must be highly restrained. We interpret the resulting occupancies as a good approximation of the fraction of unit cells that have a ligand present. Refining these ensemble structures using restraints that avoid overfitting allowed for some structural differences between the two states to emerge. In principle, these structural differences could give some prediction of the functional effects one might expect upon developing a higher affinity version of the molecule. The refined ensemble structures were of high quality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). However, generally speaking, the structural differences were subtle: the global backbone RMSD (N, Cα, C atoms) between the ground state and bound state ranged from 0.7 to 1.7 Å. Cases with larger RMSD (&gt;1.25 Å) generally involved either active-site fragments that directly shift the WPD loop, or fortuitous oxidation of the active-site Cys215 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Montfort et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, fragment binding did not dramatically shift PTP1B from the open to the closed state in many of these structures. Many of these fragments are certainly benign binders that bind to non-allosteric sites. However, the strong preference for the open state even with fragments that bind to allosteric sites is likely due to the absence of glycerol, which is present in our multitemperature structures (see Materials and methods). It is likely that weak fragments do not overcome this energetic preference, and instead elicit conformational changes primarily in their immediate vicinity. Including glycerol to place the protein in a regime in which the open vs. closed states are more nearly isoenergetic during fragment soaks could potentially interfere with fragment binding to the 197 site, since ordered glycerols also fortuitously bind there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Validating a functional allosteric linkage with covalent tethering</title><p>The small-molecule fragments described above were identified by a naive screen and are not optimized for high-affinity binding to the 197 site or L16 site of PTP1B. Nevertheless, we selected 20 fragments that were deemed to bind in either site during early rounds of iterative PanDDA analysis (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>) and tested whether they have allosteric effects using enzyme activity assays. Unsurprisingly, we did not observe inhibition of enzyme activity by the fragments up to the maximum concentrations we were able to assay due to solubility of the fragments. It is important to note that this is not surprising due to the fragments’ small sizes, relatively simple chemical structures, and low affinities (soaking with fragments at 30–150 mM concentrations resulted in observed occupancies of only 10–30% in the crystal structures). However, looking ahead, the dozens of cocrystal structures with small-molecule fragments bound at these promising allosteric sites (and at the previously explored BB2 site) that we have reported here offer a foothold for future medicinal chemistry efforts to design allosteric inhibitors for PTP1B.</p><p>Instead, here we focus on an alternative strategy to validate the concept of allosteric inhibition at the 197 site: covalent binding to enhance ligand occupancy. Specifically, we used ‘Tethering’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Erlanson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erlanson et al., 2004</xref>), in which a residue near the site of interest is mutated to cysteine, then the mutant is mixed with disulfide fragments under partially reducing conditions. Affinity of the fragments for the site of interest drives the formation of a disulfide bond between the fragment and the adjacent cysteine. The extent of cysteine labeling can be measured using whole-protein mass spectrometry, and serves as a metric to rank the affinity of fragments for a given site. One major advantage of Tethering over other fragment-based approaches is that it can leverage low-affinity binding events into quantitatively labeled protein species, whose enzymatic activity can then be assayed. Here, we used Tethering to successfully identify a covalent allosteric inhibitor at the 197 site of PTP1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36307.032</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Characterization of a functional covalent allosteric inhibitor.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The chemical structure of our covalent disulfide fragment <bold>2</bold>.

First, K197 is on the α3 helix, which is a key allosteric element in PTP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>). We predicted that small-molecule tethering to our site could could perturb the helix via K197C, perhaps mimicking the effects of a free molecule binding to the WT protein and altering the K197 conformational distribution. Second, K197 and E200 are the two residues on α3 whose Cα-Cβ vectors point in roughly the correct direction toward the allosteric 197 site we describe; however, E200 engages in crystal-lattice contacts which would interfere with tethering in our P3<sub>1</sub>21 space group, so we focused on K197C instead.</p><p>To efficiently explore the chemical space of covalent small molecules for the 197 site, we used a library of 1600 disulfide-capped fragments designed for covalent tethering experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kathman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burlingame et al., 2011a</xref>). From our initial screen, we identified 50 fragments that tethered to K197C &gt; 3 standard deviations above the average percent tethering for all 1600 compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We next measured the ability of these top fragments to modulate PTP1B’s phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Formation of the tethered complex followed by a pNPP assay identified only one fragment, <bold>1</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>), that appeared to inhibit PTP1B at a percentage comparable to the percentage of tethered complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting a direct relationship between labeling and inhibition. While <bold>1</bold> thus showed the behavior we desired, the percent labeling and inhibition were relatively low. We hypothesized that altering the linker between the fragment core and the disulfide bond may lead to improved interactions between the protein and small molecule. For this reason, we designed and synthesized <bold>2</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), which has the orientation of the amide bond reversed, allowing for one less carbon in the disulfide linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>When assayed, <bold>2</bold> showed improved tethering and inhibition of K197C relative to <bold>1</bold>. <bold>2</bold> exhibited dose-dependent tethering and partial noncompetitive allosteric inhibition of K197C with a tethering EC<sub>50</sub> of 7.8 ± 1.1 µM and a K<sub>i</sub> for pNPP activity of 7.1 ± 1.1 µM (maximum inhibition of ~60%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Importantly, <bold>2</bold> appeared to show little to no tethering of WT* and minimal inhibition, supporting that <bold>2</bold>’s activity is specific to the 197 site and not due to tethering of the active-site cysteine found in both K197C and WT/WT* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In fact, the inhibition that is observed for WT* does not correlate with tethering, suggesting the inhibition may be from nonspecific factors, such as aggregation, at higher concentrations of <bold>2</bold> (≥50 µM). Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis of K197C in the presence of <bold>2</bold> (50 µM) showed a statistically significant ~50% reduction in V<sub>max</sub> relative to DMSO treatment, but no significant effect on K<sub>M</sub> for the pNPP substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C,E,F</xref>). This supports a noncompetitive allosteric mechanism of inhibition. The effect on WT* kinetics was similar to the nonspecific inhibition observed in the dose titration experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2D</xref>), once again supporting that the activity of <bold>2</bold> is specific for the K197 site on PTP1B. To further profile the inhibitory effect of tethering of <bold>2</bold> on K197C, we assayed the ability of the tethered complex to dephosphorylate the alternative substrate DiFMUP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Welte et al., 2005</xref>). As with pNPP, the tethered complex was inhibited, with kinetic analysis showing a dramatic reduction in V<sub>max</sub>, but no significant effect on K<sub>M</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results once again support a partial noncompetitive allosteric mechanism of inhibition.</p><p>To futher validate that <bold>2</bold> acts specifically through the K197 site and to explore the mechanism of inhibition by <bold>2</bold>, we solved a high-resolution (1.95 Å, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) crystal structure of K197C tethered with <bold>2</bold>. The structure confirms that <bold>2 </bold>tethers to K197C rather than to the active-site catalytic Cys215, and also that tethered <bold>2</bold> resides in the 197 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) rather than in the relatively nearby BB site, which is also theoretically within reach of the tethering linker on the other side of the α3 helix.

While coplanar biphenyl rings are typically believed to be disfavored due to steric clashes, it is possible that hydrogen bonding of D148 with the phenol combined with the electronegativity of the para-fluoro leads to delocalization of the rings’ electrons and promotes a coplanar conformation. Additionally, <bold>2</bold> packs against the hydrophobic floor, centered on Leu172, of the relatively shallow binding pocket in the 197 site.

As mentioned previously, PTP1B remains in the open state without glycerol; glycerol was absent from the tethered K197C structure (to avoid competition for binding in the 197 site) and from the K197C apo structure (for consistency), so we are unable to see any dramatic shifts in the global open-closed equilibrium that <bold>2</bold> may induce. Tyr153 shifts its position slightly and Tyr152 responds by shifting fully to its up rotamer, but this is likely due to the loss of interactions with the WT K197 upon mutation. Beyond these mutation-induced effects, we see some conformational changes associated with tethering of <bold>2</bold>. The key residue Asn193 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>) changes rotamers, the sidechain of Phe196 on α3 ‘slides’ to change its aromatic stacking arrangement with Phe280 on α6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), and Glu276 -- which contacts the wedge residue Leu192 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>) -- rotates sidechain dihedral angles. These sidechain movements appear to couple to subtle, more distributed backbone shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deis et al., 2014</xref>) of the α3 helix, several residues of which move up toward the WPD loop by ~0.5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Interestingly, these sidechain and particularly backbone movements are somewhat similar to those between the two macrostates of apo PTP1B at high temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Thus, although the mechanistic details remain unclear, allosteric inhibition by <bold>2</bold> may involve conformational changes, especially of α3, that are similar to those that occur during the global transition from the open to the closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>). This interpretation is consistent with a recent report that mutations (Y153A, M282A) in what we here recognize as the 197 site and L16 site alter the equilibrium between the WPD loop’s open and closed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2017</xref>). We note that the non-competitive allosteric mechanism observed suggests that tethering <bold>2</bold> to K197C may shift the protein’s energy landscape in such a way as to alter the kinetics of WPD loop motions. Future work to explore this issue would nicely complement the crystallographic and functional analysis we provide here.</p><p>Interestingly, several of the other noncovalent fragments bound to WT* overlay well with the aromatic rings of <bold>2</bold> tethered to K197C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This structural convergence suggests promising new avenues for future medicinal chemistry efforts.

Allostery is fundamentally tied to protein functions such as catalysis via the theme of conformational motions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goodey and Benkovic, 2008</xref>). Here, we have harnessed new approaches in X-ray crystallography to map coordinated conformational redistributions that underlie allostery in the dynamic enzyme PTP1B. Metaphorically, we were able to use this map of PTP1B’s ‘intramolecular nervous system’ to reveal allosteric ‘pressure points’ that enable long-range modulation of its function.</p><p>Proteins sample many conformations from a complex energy landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frauenfelder et al., 1991</xref>), many of which are accessible and represented among the millions to trillions of molecules in a protein crystal. However, an X-ray crystallographic dataset provides only ensemble-averaged information -- so it is difficult to decipher individual minor conformations from a single dataset. A key to our work was harnessing the power of <italic>en masse</italic> structural analysis, which let us reveal minor conformations and the shifts between them that allow a dynamic protein to function. We exploited families of structures in two different ways. First, we contrasted structures at several different temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Keedy et al., 2015b</xref>) for PTP1B to track coordinated conformational shifts which underlie allosteric communication. Second, we used hundreds of structures of PTP1B with different small-molecule fragments to calculate a statistical ‘background’ electron density map representing the unbound state, which we could subtract to reveal fragment-bound conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pearce et al., 2017</xref>) for many allosteric sites. This requires using the PDB format of alternative locations to encode both compositional and conformational heterogeneity within a single model. Our multi-structure equilibrium X-ray approaches complement other methods for breaking the degeneracy of ensemble-averaged data to resolve multiple conformations of macromolecules. For example, 3D classification algorithms in cryo-electron microscopy enable in silico purification of different compositional and conformational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Scheres, 2016</xref>). Time-resolved X-ray experiments, for example with free-electron lasers, offer great promise for mapping conformational changes with both spatial and temporal resolution, although general experimental strategies are still forthcoming for the vast majority of proteins that are non-photoactivatable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hekstra et al., 2016</xref>). More generally, integrative modeling algorithms can synthesize data from disparate sources at different resolutions, including solution NMR or small-angle X-ray scattering, to build ensembles of structures that are consistent with all the experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van den Bedem and Fraser, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Russel et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>By exploiting a new multitemperature multiconformer X-ray approach, we have identified a collective allosteric network that is contiguous on the ‘back side’ of the protein, centered around the quasi-ordered α7 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). This network includes the BB site, which was previously targeted with a small-molecule allosteric inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wiesmann et al., 2004</xref>). It also includes adjacent sites (the 197 site and the L16 site) in either direction from the BB site, which have not been targeted previously with small-molecule inhibitors. Several residues in these additional sites were implicated as being part of putative allosteric sites by recent work using mutagenesis and NMR chemical shift and dynamics information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2017</xref>). Our work agrees with those studies in identifying the 197 site and L16 site as potentially important players in PTP1B’s collective allosteric network. We additionally complement them by revealing, in atomic detail, alternative conformations that these sites natively populate. Our work suggests that allosteric perturbations do not necessarily induce conformational changes in PTP1B -- instead, the alternative conformations are already latently sampled by the apo protein and are simply stabilized by the allosteric perturbations. Portions of the allosteric network we observe here in PTP1B -- in particular the series of aromatic and hydrophobic residues linking the allosteric BB site to the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and the cluster of aromatic residues behind and beneath the WPD loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>) -- are analogous to the dynamic hydrophobic spines that play central roles in allosteric activation of protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor and Kornev, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Our analysis suggests that allostery in PTP1B is characterized by interdependent conformational changes spanning length scales: helical order-disorder transitions, hydrophobic shifts, local sidechain rotamer changes, subtle helical twists, and large discrete active-site loop motions.</p><p>Our work reveals new opportunities for long-range control of PTP1B function by impinging upon tendrils of this expanded allosteric network with small molecules. Specifically, we have used two different small-molecule techniques with complementary strengths to reveal new footholds for developing allosteric inhibitors for PTP1B in the future. First, we used a new high-throughput method with small-molecule fragments to map the ligandability of the entire surface of PTP1B with high structural resolution. Although individually these fragments have low affinity, collectively the 110 protein:fragment structures we report reveal overlapping poses with a multitude of precise binding interactions at specific sites in PTP1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B,C</xref>). Many of the 11 binding sites outside the active site are likely to be benign. Importantly, our multitemperature X-ray analysis of the apo protein provides a way to predict which binding sites are instead likely to be allosterically coupled to function. Based on the result that the same small number of sites are both (a) implicated as allosteric by multitemperature X-ray analysis of conformational changes in apo PTP1B and (b) the most ligandable sites from the fragment screen across the entire surface, we conclude that conformational changes may be important for allosteric ligand binding in this protein. Second, we used covalent tethering to probe the functional effects of a high-occupancy ligand at one promising allosteric site. Our work takes advantage of a synergy between fragments and tethering. Fragments bind weakly, but allow for the visualization of hundreds of chemical entities bound to distinct sites in a protein. By contrast, tethering does not provide high-throughput structural information, but allows for targeted perturbations to functionally probe a specific site, and additionally can provide lower-throughput structural information about chemical matter that allosterically inhibits a protein variant. Importantly, the structural and functional information from these techniques can be combined to open doors for future structure-based drug design efforts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Together, our results illuminate a promising new region of chemical space that may be fruitfully explored by future medicinal chemistry efforts to develop potent non-covalent allosteric inhibitors for WT PTP1B.</p><p>Although our work helps set the stage for such efforts, generating potent and selective ligands based on linking of fragment-screening hits is a difficult and time-consuming process that is beyond the scope of this current study. While none of the fragments identified to bind at the 197 site in our work have the potency or selectivity for proper assaying of their effect on enzyme activity, let alone for use as a cell-active ligand, their identification supports the ligandability of the 197 site, and motivates future efforts to identify potent ligands at this site. Our use of covalent tethering at the 197 site allowed us to drive occupancy of fragment <bold>2</bold> at this site and functionally validates the allosteric effect of ligand binding at this site on PTP1B phosphatase activity. The percent tethering observed for <bold>2</bold> is correlated with the percent inhibition observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), indicating that the tethered compound drives inhibition. However, the maximum inhibition is only ~60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3A</xref>), which is consistent with a partial noncompetitive allosteric mechanism of inhibition. This mechanism is supported by our kinetic analysis of <bold>2</bold>-bound K197C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3B</xref>) where the reduction in enzyme rate is driven by a reduction in V<sub>max</sub>, not a change in K<sub>M</sub>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). Partial inhibition is a common paradigm in noncompetitive allosteric inhibition, where ligand occupancy does not perfectly correlate with inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ramsay and Tipton, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Whiteley, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The ‘druggability’ of the 197 site in WT PTP1B is further supported by recent work using structure-based simulations and virtual screening, which found that the 197 site bound several diverse molecules in silico, and was the most responsive to allosteric perturbations among several potential allosteric pockets identified in PTP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>). Together with our findings, these data imply that while the development of potent non-covalent allosteric inhibitors targeting the 197 site may be arduous, a concerted effort toward this goal may ultimately be fruitful.</p><p>Future efforts to develop potent non-covalent allosteric inhibitors for PTP1B can explore an additional feature of the allosteric 197 site that may enhance its druggability. As stated above, the quasi-disordered α7 helix is capable of reordering into different conformations, some of which cover the α3-α6 region including the 197 site. We observe several reordered α7 conformations under different conditions: with BB3 at 273 K, with BB1 at 100 K, in the S295F (α7) mutant, in the L192A (α3) mutant with an active-site inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>), and with a fragment in the BB site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Similarly, the disordered C-terminus, including α7, accommodates a recently reported allosteric inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krishnan et al., 2014</xref>). For the BB site, the malleability of α7 is likely a double-edged sword. On one hand, reordered conformations of α7 may contribute binding energy to allosteric inhibitors by forming a ‘lid’ over what is partially a ‘cryptic site’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cimermancic et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, they may also accommodate different small-molecule variants equally well, such that it is difficult to improve upon inhibition -- that is, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) is flat. However, the 197 site is structurally distinct from the BB site, and is accessible to different, more C-terminal portions of α7. Future work will test the hypothesis that the 197 site can yield improved allosteric inhibitors that take advantage of these unique structural features. Notably, it is possible that the flat SAR observed at the BB site is due to an inhibition mechanism that is unrelated to the particular binding site, which is not uncommon in PTP1B drug discovery efforts -- if this is the case, targeting the 197 site may face similar hurdles.</p><p>Our work motivates specific future efforts to allosterically inhibit PTP1B activity for therapeutic purposes. However, the allosteric network illuminated here by probing PTP1B with non-biological perturbations (temperature and small molecules) in vitro may also be relevant to how the enzyme is regulated in vivo, in at least three ways. First, in addition to directing subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frangioni et al., 1992</xref>), the quasi-disordered C-terminal region of PTP1B reorders to interact with the ‘back side’ of the catalytic domain in different ways, is phosphorylated at disordered serine residues in vivo to regulate function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brautigan and Pinault, 1993</xref>), and mediates allosteric inhibition by natural product molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krishnan et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, removing α7 reduces activity in PTP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choy et al., 2017</xref>), and removing the disordered C-terminus in the related phosphatase TCPTP reduces activity even more dramatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hao et al., 1997</xref>). Second, Tyr152 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is phosphorylated in vivo, which contributes to binding to the insulin receptor kinase (IRK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandyopadhyay et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rhee et al., 2001</xref>) and is required for binding to N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandyopadhyay et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rhee et al., 2001</xref>). Tyr152 phosphorylation is sterically compatible only with the ‘up’ rotamer, which is correlated with the global open state of PTP1B; it is therefore possible that Tyr152 phosphorylation and/or subsequent IRK or cadherin binding events directly affect PTP1B activity via the allosteric network we report here. Third, in several other protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), protein-protein interactions occur on the ‘back side’ of the catalytic domain -- coinciding with where we observe three major allosteric sites in PTP1B. For example, in RPTPγ and RPTPε, the non-catalytic D2 domain binds to the catalytic D1 domain at an interface coinciding with the allosteric network we report on the back of PTP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barr et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, the N-terminus of PTPL1 wraps around the area coinciding with the L16 site in PTP1B, and docks in the area coinciding with the ɑ7 helix in PTP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Villa et al., 2005</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that the allosteric network we establish here within the catalytic domain of PTP1B may function as a ‘receiver’ for allosteric inputs from the C-terminus in cells. If so, this strategy operates in parallel with other mechanisms such as active-site oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Montfort et al., 2003</xref>) and phosphorylation of other sites in the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ravichandran et al., 2001</xref>) as part of a complex, multifaceted regulatory scheme.</p><p>Finally, it is interesting to note that different protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) share a structurally conserved catalytic domain with PTP1B -- but have different variants of the α7 helix or even entirely different N- or C-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso et al., 2004</xref>) that can be trapped in inhibitory conformations for allosteric inhibition, as recently realized for SHP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, regulatory domains or subdomains were recently targeted for allosteric inhibition of the serine/threonine phosphatases Wip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gilmartin et al., 2014</xref>) and PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carrara et al., 2017</xref>). It will be exciting to dissect the mechanisms by which different PTPs are allosterically controlled by their specific regulatory domains -- both to unravel these proteins’ unique cellular roles, and to reveal new opportunities to correct their dysregulation in disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, expression, and purification</title><p>For all ‘wild-type’ PTP1B experiments here, we used what we refer to as the WT* construct: residues 1–321, with the C32S/C92V double mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Erlanson et al., 2003</xref>) to prevent off-target tethering reactions, in a pET24b vector with a kanamycin resistance gene.

Crystallization drops were set in 96-well sitting- or hanging-drop format at 4°C with 10–15 mg/mL protein with 1 μL of protein solution + 1 μL of well solution (0.2–0.4 M magnesium acetate, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.3–7.6, 12–17% PEG 8000), then trays were incubated at 4°C. Crystals several hundred μm long grew within a few days, and often continued to grow bigger for several more days. We created seed stocks from these crystals by pipetting the entire drop into 50 μL of well solution, iterating between vortexing for 30 s and sitting on ice for 30 s several times, and performing serial 10-fold dilutions in well solution. Apo crystals were grown by introducing seed stock (0x, 10x, or 100x diluted) into freshly set drops, either by streaking with a cat whisker or pipetting a small amount (e.g. 0.1 μL into a 2 μL drop). Serial seeding using new apo crystals successively improved crystal quality. We also added ethanol to the well solution based on an additive screen (Hampton Research), and added glycerol to mimic the previously published apo structure protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pedersen et al., 2004</xref>), resulting in the following final WT* PTP1B crystallization well solution: 0.3 M magnesium acetate, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 16% PEG 8000, 2% ethanol, 10% glycerol.

PTP1B crystals were quite tolerant to DMSO, so we were able to achieve high fragment concentrations and long incubation times: we soaked overnight for &gt;8 hr at final concentrations of 30% DMSO and 30–150 mM fragment (depending on the concentration of the fragments in the source library). Additionally we collected X-ray data for 48 ‘apo’ datasets (soaked with DMSO), 42 of which gave high-resolution datasets, to better establish the unbound background electron density for PanDDA analysis. Despite the high DMSO concentrations, we did not observe difference electron density consistent with any ordered DMSO molecules bound to PTP1B. Some fragments were soaked into additional crystals if good datasets were not obtained from the initial soak; however, only 2 of the 110 fragment-bound datasets contain the same fragment.

We created a new set of R<sub>free</sub> flags for the 278 K WT* apo dataset, then transferred them to the MTZ file of every other dataset with the reflection file editor in PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) (for PDB ID 1sug, we first deleted the existing R<sub>free</sub> flags).

R<sub>free</sub> flags were created for the highest-resolution dataset by transferring and extending the flags from the 278 K WT* apo dataset using the PHENIX reflection file editor. These R<sub>free</sub> flags were then transferred from that highest-resolution dataset to every other dataset in the fragment-soaking experiment. For PanDDA to accept the MTZ files as inputs, it was necessary to modify each file so that all columns (H, K, L, structure factors, map coefficients, and R-free flags) had the same number of indices; no observations were omitted in this step. We then phased each dataset with Phaser using a reference model that was created by interpreting a high-resolution DMSO-soaked apo dataset. Next, we refined each initial model from Phaser using phenix.refine with the following flags to prevent excessive coordinate drift: ‘reference_coordinate_restraints.enabled=True ‘reference_coordinate_restraints.sigma=0.1’. Structure factors were then dropped from MTZ files, leaving map coefficients as inputs to PanDDA.

Next, we inserted preliminary open and closed alternative conformations for the WPD loop, and refined for another 10 macrocycles with automated water picking turned on. Finally, we performed several rounds of manual rebuilding, including manual addition and deletion of protein, solvent, and glycerol conformations and refinement with automated water picking turned off. Anisotropic B-factors were not used in refinement. The α7 helix was modeled as alternative conformation A only, with the unmodeled B conformation presumed to correspond to the disordered state; this allowed the occupancy of the ordered state to be refined. It was necessary to provide explicit occupancy parameter files to phenix.refine in some cases. For many residues, conformations obtained from PDB ID 1sug or 1t49 or another of our datasets (usually higher temperatures) were useful for ‘filling in’ missing density. Often the missing conformations would not have been obvious based on the map alone, but once inserted and refined they seemed to fit well. This cross-dataset conformational-sampling approach also had the effect of emphasizing differences between models from different temperatures while minimizing differences due to chance or arbitrary modeling choices. Nevertheless, we encourage future users of these datasets to compare across different temperatures based at least in part on the electron density, and not just our models. The building process was guided by all-atom structure validation with MolProbity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). The 100 K WT model (1sug) is truly WT, whereas our new WT* datasets are all C32S/C92V, as noted above; however, both cysteine-scrubbing mutations are structurally conservative, distal to the active site, and apparently uncoupled from the WPD loop and all allosteric regions.</p><p>Glycerol (~20% final) was present in WT* crystals during each multitemperature data collection to maintain consistency with the 100 K WT structure (PDB ID 1sug), in which glycerol was used as a cryoprotectant. Several ordered glycerol molecules, including those in contact with the closed WPD loop and at the allosteric 197 site, were evident from electron density at all temperatures. However, in some cases, it was difficult to differentiate between ordered waters, glycerols, or simply noise in the map. For example, the electron density was uncertain at some of the elevated temperatures for some glycerols originally modeled in PDB ID 1sug. When glycerol was omitted from crystals, the WPD loop was entirely in the open conformation regardless of temperature, from cryogenic temperature to near room temperature (data not shown). Our interpretation is that ordered glycerols in the active site, which are evident from the electron density at all temperatures, make weak contacts with the WPD loop’s closed conformation, and thus shift the protein’s energy landscape to a regime in which the open vs. closed conformations are near enough to isoenergetic that temperature can modulate their populations. This interpretation is strengthened by the fact that these glycerol molecules align well with a bound mimic of the pTyr substrate (PDB ID 1pty), which causes the loop to close during the catalytic cycle.</p><p>For K197C, we used a similar refinement procedure, including many manual tweaks of alternative conformations for protein and water atoms. For the <bold>2</bold>-tethered K197C structure, we omitted <bold>2</bold> for many rounds of refinement, allowing the electron density for the missing molecule to become extremely convincing before we finally added it to the model. The distance between the sulfur atoms in K197C and the ligand was restrained to 2.15 Å with a σ of 0.1 Å for refinement.</p><p>For fragment-soaked datasets, we used the PanDDA approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pearce et al., 2017</xref>) in a few stages. First, using PanDDA version 0.1, we ran pandda.analyse, and interpreted and modeled events. Next, using the new PanDDA version 0.2, we ran pandda.analyse again. During this second run, datasets which were events in the first run were excluded from background density calculation, and datasets that had substantial map artifacts or very noisy/low-quality maps in the first run were excluded entirely.</p><p>Some events for which we modeled bound fragments in the earlier PanDDA version 0.1 runs were not detected as events in the final PanDDA version 0.2 run. In these cases, we manually created event maps based on the 1-BDC background subtraction values from the earlier PanDDA runs. In most cases, visual inspection confirmed that these early events likely correspond to bound fragments.</p><p>Many PanDDA ‘events’ in the active site corresponded not to ligand binding, but rather to protein conformational changes of the WPD loop, P-loop, and Y46 loop that are caused by oxidation of the catalytic Cys215, a natural PTP1B regulatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Montfort et al., 2003</xref>). Some other active-site events were difficult to interpret, perhaps due to active-site dynamics or differences in the appropriate background model for the open vs. closed state of the protein; future methodological improvements may clarify modeling in such cases.</p><p>We built a generic unbound-state model by interpreting both an average map for the highest-resolution bin and one of the best individual apo datasets. The WPD loop was modeled as open, Tyr152 was modeled with two alternative sidechain conformations on the loop 11 backbone that is compatible with the open WPD loop, and the N-terminus (start of α1) and C-terminus (end of α6, since α7 was disordered) were fit as well as possible. Ordered waters were also manually positioned. This generic unbound-state model was superposed onto each PanDDA input model in the correct reference frame, then refined, to create an unbound-state model for each dataset.</p><p>For each fragment-bound state, we inspected the fragment binding site, plus the several interesting regions of the protein mentioned above, in detail interactively. Waters were copied over from the unbound-state model, then moved or deleted where they conflicted with the bound fragment and/or the PanDDA event map. For a small number of planar fragments, several copies of the fragment bind in a parallel stack bridging the 197 site and a symmetry-related copy of the WPD-loop residue Phe182 via a crystal-lattice contact. Some areas such as Tyr152 were modeled with alternative conformations in the bound state only when they were well justified in the event map; otherwise we generally adhered to the unbound-state model. The correct modeling choice for the termini was uncertain in some cases.</p><p>To refine structures for the 110 datasets with one or more modeled fragments, first we created restraints files for the ligands with eLBOW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moriarty et al., 2009</xref>). For a small number of ligands, we additionally used AceDRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Long et al., 2017</xref>) and found that AceDRG generated more realistic restraints. Next, the pandda.export method in PanDDA version 0.2 was used to create an ‘ensemble structure’ containing both the unbound state (including alternative conformations) and the bound state (including alternative conformations) in one multiconformer model. In pandda.export, the parameter ‘options.prune_duplicates_rms = 0.2’ was used to merge alternative conformations that were highly similar, and the parameter ‘duplicates.rmsd_cutoff = 0.4’ was used to restrain the coordinates of somewhat similar alternative conformations to be identical. These parameter values were chosen to effectively merge residues with very similar coordinates, while still allowing residues we evaluated as having genuine alternative conformations to remain separate and unrestrained. The resulting geometry restraint files from pandda.export are necessary to minimize overfitting or coordinate drift during refinement of this model type.</p><p>For refinement of the ensembles representing multiconformer models of the apo and bound states, we first refined each ensemble structure with phenix.refine to obtain water positions. The first stage of PHENIX refinement was 10 macrocycles with no removal or addition of waters (‘ordered_solvent = False’) to let the existing waters relax into local minima. The second stage of PHENIX refinement was another 10 macrocycles with automated removal and addition of waters (‘ordered_solvent = True’) to remove waters that were unable to reach local minima and add waters that were clearly missing. Adding and removing waters, when compared to only removing them, generally had negligible effect on MolProbity scores, but improved R<sub>work</sub> and R<sub>free</sub>. During this first PHENIX refinement stage to obtain water positions, occupancies were fixed to the original PanDDA BDC value for the ground state and 1-BDC for the bound state; occupancy was distributed evenly between substates when the ground state or the bound state had alternative conformations for some residues. We observed coordinate drift and unstable B-factors for the protein with PHENIX refinement. Therefore, we copied the water positions obtained from PHENIX into the initial ensemble models, and refined with Refmac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murshudov et al., 2011</xref>). To do so, we first set all B-factors to 40 Å<sup>2</sup>, set bound-state occupancies to 2*(1-BDC) and unbound-state occupancies to 1–2*(1-BDC) (with occupancy evenly distributed across alternative conformations within each state), and generated new restraints files that included the water molecules by running the PanDDA utility giant.make_restraints with the same RMSD parameter as with giant.merge_conformations: ‘duplicates.rmsd_cutoff = 0.4’. Then, each ensemble model was refined with Refmac using giant.quick_refine with the ligand CIF and custom giant.make_restraints restraint parameter files using the protocol herein. First, each model was refined for the default 10 cycles, with the extra arguments to Refmac ‘MAKE HOUT Yes’, to preserve hydrogens, and ‘HOLD 0.001 100 100’ to restrain XYZ coordinates but still allow for some geometry regularization and encourage B-factor and occupancy convergence. Next, the output from that refinement was fed into a loop of Refmac refinement with the default 10 cycles per run, and the ‘HOLD 0.0001 100 100’ argument, essentially fixing the XYZ coordinates, while letting occupancies and B-factors refine. Our output was the result of the 4th round (1 round + 3 rounds) of refinement in Refmac. However, the occupancies refined with these refinements did not converge to the correct occupancy (as seen by huge difference peaks describing the ligand). We then refined these structures with PHENIX, fixing the XYZ coordinates and manually scanning across possible occupancies while refining B-factors with the following settings: refinement.refine.strategy = individual_adp, hydrogens.optimize_scattering_contribution = False, main.number_of_macro_cycles = 10, optimize_mask = True, optimize_adp_weight = True. While in principle one could interpret the difference density to pick an optimal refined occupancy, no other statistics calculated provided a clear choice of occupancy. We ultimately chose to deposit occupancies of the bound state at 2.2 times the event map occupancy (1-BDC). This occupancy choice was motivated by the trend previously found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pearce et al. (2017</xref>). In cases where the total bound occupancy was 50% or higher, the models were manually inspected, and a few dropped to low occupancies that minimized difference features of the ligand. The resulting final ensemble structures of the unbound state plus the fragment-bound state were converted from PDB to mmCIF format and deposited in the PDB using the new multimodel submission procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Visualization</title><p>Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) was instrumental to visualizing and interactively modeling all structures.

Unfortunately, none of the small molecule fragments bound to the allosteric site exhibited significant inhibitory activity against PTP1B. The authors then attempted tethering compounds to Cys197 and identified compound 2 as an inhibitor using this approach. However, the potency of compound 2 in the tethering assays was still weak, IC50 ca. 50 μm (although it was described as having an IC50 of 7 uM, this is really the concentration of the half-maximal effect of compound 2, not a 50% inhibition of enzyme activity).

Secondly, the work identified several potential sites for allosteric small-molecule inhibition of PTP1B based on a large number of crystal structures from fragment soaking.

This work fell short of identifying a potent non-covalent small molecule inhibitor for wild-type PTP1B (presumably due to the incapability to synthesis non-off-shelf small molecules), which, of course, is much desired as PTP1B remains an undrugged yet therapeutically highly important target.

Furthermore, they screened a new library for the tethering screen. Then what was the purpose of the fragment crystal soak screen? Developing a real inhibitor from the hits within the fragment crystal soak screen would have proved their point (PTP1B could be inhibited by binding of a small molecule at this allosteric site) better and been a real step forward in a novel allosteric inhibitor for PTP1B.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This work advances our understanding of the subtle collective motions of a prototypical non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1b. Previous work suggested that the rate of enzymatic catalysis of PTP1b is controlled by the motions of the conserved WPD loop, which has been trapped in different crystals at either open or closed conformations. The authors show the inherent mix of open and closed WPD loop in their reanalysis of the previously deposited PDB structure 1SUG and proceed to demonstrate via multi-temperature crystallography the gradual shift of population towards open WPD as a function of increasing temperature. The collective motion of WPD loop, residues in the alpha3, disorder of alpha7, and residues of L16, match the motions observed upon binding benzbromarone, suggesting the latter stabilizes a pre-existing conformation. The multi-temperature crystallography reveals temperature dependent changes of the 197 site, which might also couple to the WPD motions via Tyr152 and rotation of helix3, thus impacting catalysis. The authors perform a systematic crystallographic fragment screen and identify fragments binding to the benzbromarone site, to L16, and the 197 site. They expand one fragment hit to build a tethered fragment binding to the K197C mutant, for which they show biochemical evidence of inhibition due to tethering and also obtain a high-resolution crystal structure. The crystallography and fragment screening work is solid, and the proposal of a new allosteric site, within reach of a previous site may prove to be important. I'd love to see follow up work with non-tethered inhibitors binding to the same site, but the current work is interesting in its own right.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An expanded allosteric network in PTP1B by multitemperature crystallography, fragment screening, and covalent tethering&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor.

An extensive allosteric network was identified in agreement with previous reports and, while the work fell short of identifying a potent allosteric PTP1B inhibitor, at least one of the binding pockets is confirmed by covalent &quot;tethering&quot;.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers identified a number of concerns in several aspects:</p><p>1) Overstatements and over-claims. The manuscript will benefit if the authors focus on the large amount of data (especially the RT crystallography data) they produced and remove and temper their claims.</p><p>a) The claim that new pockets are identified by RT crystallography needs qualification. The claim that L16 newly identified is not accurate as it was previously reported by the Loria laboratory. The K197 pocket was also previously reported by Loria lab and Peti lab with a different name. These previous works need to be adequately discussed in this context. The authors need to explain if and how these cryptic binding sites can be revealed from the RT crystallography data without the knowledge a priori.</p><p>b) The allosteric network identification is interesting, but a substantial part of the network has been reported in 4 publications (2 by the Loria laboratory and 2 by the Peti laboratory). These results need to be properly acknowledged and discussed. Again, would the network be obvious without the prior knowledge?</p><p>c) Some of the added speculative discussion can be misleading and needs to be tempered. For example, the discussion of the BB inhibitors and the corresponding site might be misleading to readers that are not well versed in mechanistic studies or drug discovery. The word &quot;validates&quot; is too strong (&quot;this approach validates many aspects of the recently characterized allosteric network that corresponds to BB inhibitors&quot;), since the referenced paper was largely based on unsubstantiated or weak claims. Even though the present work provides support for some of these speculative ideas it does not validate them.</p><p>d) The discussion of flat SAR is misleading: &quot;On the other hand, they may also accommodate different small-molecule variants equally well, such that it is difficult to improve upon inhibition - that is, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) is flat.&quot; This argument is questionable as it would be an extreme coincidence to perfectly compensate the binding energetics with corresponding structural rearrangements. The possibility cannot be excluded that the flat SAR is due to an inhibition mechanism that is unrelated to that particular binding site, which is not uncommon occurrence in PTP1b drug discovery efforts.</p><p>2) Methodology rigora) How observations are derived from the RT crystallography data in a rigorous way is not well explained throughout the text. Alternative conformations are fit in weak density in published and new crystal structures – however, would it be possible to just place waters in such incomplete density and the statistical analysis of the data improves? What is the cut off for rigor and statistics to identify biologically relevant alternative conformations etc., and, further, that it can be interpreted for the identification of allostery. This issue is crucial to the general applicability of the approach and specifically to the identification of both the allosteric network and the cryptic sites in PTP1B without using prior knowledge.</p><p>b) In the fragment screening, many fragments were seen to bind with PTP1B in many locations. How would one know which of these locations are sites for allosteric inhibition if they have not been independently identified previously. It seems in such cases one can only make educated guesses based on druggability estimation of a fragment's binding site and its relation to the structural-functional mechanism of the target's regulation. Or there might be more rigorous ways to approach this issue. This is worth an adequate clarification and discussion.</p><p>3) Presentation issuesa) The figures lack continuity and clarity. It seems that in each figure PTP1B is shown from a different orientation, without relaying the orientation to a general overview, which makes it difficult for the reader.</p><p>b) The wording in many statements in the manuscript is exaggerated or unnecessarily strong, which needs revision.</p><p>c) There are many typos throughout the manuscript.</p><p>4) One interesting observation is that the tethering of the compound leads to change in Km? What is the mechanism for this change? A change in the active site? This should be repeated with a set of substrates (e.g. difmup and TK domain substrate peptides with Malachite greenPi capture). Such data may shed new light to the mechanism of allosteric inhibition of PTP1B.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36307.045</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>All reviewers are complimentary about the technical execution of the work. From that discussion, you identified a need to make the findings about the allosteric network more compelling to appeal to the more critical reviewer. We agree, and the revised manuscript emphasizes the major goal of long-range allosteric control of protein function (by a combination of multitemperature crystallography and chemical biology) and discusses the more limited ramifications for new actionable therapeutic molecules (drug discovery) on this specific protein. Our change to a new title, “An expanded allosteric network in the dynamic enzyme PTP1B revealed by multitemperature crystallography, fragment screening, and covalent tethering”, instead of “New routes for PTP1B allosteric inhibition by multitemperature crystallography, fragment screening and covalent tethering”, summarizes this shift in focus. The revised manuscript better places the allosteric mechanism discovered by multi-temperature crystallography in the context of mutagenesis, recently published NMR work, post-translational modifications, and the partial antagonist effect of the tethered molecule. Moreover, our retrospective evaluation reveals that multi-temperature crystallography plus protein:fragment structures predict the known BB allosteric inhibitor for PTP1B, which demonstrates the potential value of our approach for other targets without any known allosteric inhibitors. By emphasizing the parts of the work that the reviewers were uniformly positive about and placing the parts they were less enthusiastic about in a more self-critical context, we hope that the revised manuscript will be suitable for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This work consists of two main results.

The second type, exemplified by MSI-1436, targets the disordered C-terminus – but nonspecifically, at multiple binding sites, and in a pose (or poses) that were not structurally resolved, all of which limit the ability to rationally improve allosteric inhibition. Our work identifies new sites capable of binding diverse small molecules, and we discuss how only some of these sites can likely be made “allosteric”. Our retrospective analysis of the BB binding site and new analysis of the tethering to the 197 site show how linking the knowledge of binding (by fragment screening) and motion (by multitemperature crystallography) could be used to generate candidates for development of new, potent allosteric inhibitors that overcome the limitations of the BB and MSI-1436 series in the future. We have rewritten the corresponding paragraph in the Introduction to better clarify these points, as follows:</p><p>“… an allosteric inhibitor that binds to a less-conserved and less-polar surface site could bypass the limitations of active-site inhibitors. Two classes of compounds have been identified that allosterically inhibit PTP1B, although each has limitations. The first class of compounds are based on a benzbromarone (BB) scaffold and inhibit allosterically by binding to the space normally occupied by the regulatory C-terminal α7 helix [10]. Recent work combining mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations revealed how rotations of the α3 helix and a discrete switch of the catalytic WPD loop are impacted by these BB allosteric inhibitors [11]. Unfortunately, the BB molecules were not successfully translated to the clinic. The second class are natural products, including a molecule called MSI-1436, that bind to multiple sites that primarily involve the disordered C-terminus [4]. However, the binding poses were not structurally resolved, limiting our ability to understand the molecules’ allosteric mechanism and rationally improve their potency. For example, a variant of MSI-1436 had improved inhibition but a distinct response to mutations at the putative binding sites, suggesting an unknown change in mechanism [12]. MSI-1436 passed Phase I clinical trials but was not advanced to Phase II [13]. A new approach to revealing the intrinsic allosteric circuitry of proteins would reveal new opportunities to develop allosteric inhibitors for PTP1B that could overcome the limitations of these existing molecules. Such an approach would additionally set the stage for efforts to dissect allosteric regulatory strategies in other biologically important phospho-signaling proteins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The hypothesis was that the newly discovered allosteric site would enable them to design better PTP1B allosteric inhibitors.</p></disp-quote><p>Our hypothesis was that the new structural biology methods we apply would reveal sites which can bind small molecules and are functionally coupled to the active site. Indeed, our multitemperature X-ray crystallography to map allosteric connectivity identifies a small subset of binding sites identified by fragment screening, which maps the relative ligandability of the entire protein surface. Remarkably, the methods do converge, in that the sites with the highest number of molecules bound are also the ones identified by multitemperature crystallography. The key result here is that orthogonal methods for mapping how well a site might influence the conformation/activity of the active site, and for mapping the capability of small molecules to bind at that site, converge to the same places. We have added the following text to the Introduction to emphasize this result and its implications:</p><p>“To prioritize putative allosteric sites rather than benign binding sites, we focused on the subset of fragment-binding sites that were also conformationally coupled to the active site based on multitemperature crystallography of apo PTP1B. Notably, the sites chosen in this way bound more fragments than did any other sites -- suggesting that conformational heterogeneity may be important for both allostery and ligand binding.”</p><p>Importantly, the approach described above is additionally (retrospectively) validated by successfully identifying fragment poses that predict the previously reported BB allosteric inhibitor scaffold (Figure 7A), discovered using independent methods. We have now more strongly emphasized this key point with a new figure, Figure 7—figure supplement 1, which not only details how fragments predict central elements of the BB scaffold, but also provides evidence for potentially fruitful new chemical extensions to that scaffold. We added the following text to the Results section to emphasize this point:</p><p>Strikingly, we observed 24 bound fragments in the BB allosteric site (Figure 7A). The poses of many of these fragments overlap portions of the BB scaffold (Figure 7A, Figure 7—figure supplement 1). However, many of them also contain chemical groups that suggestively protrude in new directions from the BB scaffold (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). This retrospective result validates the idea that fragment screening identifies binding sites, and specific fragment poses in those sites, that can be fruitfully exploited for allosteric inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unfortunately, none of the small molecule fragments bound to the allosteric site exhibit any inhibitory activity against PTP1B.</p></disp-quote><p>The small-molecule fragments have very low affinity due to their small size and lack of any optimization for binding to specific sites in PTP1B, so it was not at all surprising that we did not see any inhibition from them. Indeed, our goal in using fragments was instead to map the bindable surface of the protein. However, the tethering experiments serve a complementary purpose by ultimately confirming a functional link from the allosteric site to the active site. We have clarified these points at several points in the text, including the following in subsection “Validating a functional allosteric linkage with covalent tethering”:</p><p>“The small-molecule fragments described above were identified by a naive screen and are not optimized for high-affinity binding to the 197 site or L16 site of PTP1B. Nevertheless, we selected 20 fragments that were deemed to bind in either site during early rounds of iterative PanDDA analysis (see Materials and methods section) (Figure 7—source data 1) and tested whether they have allosteric effects using enzyme activity assays. Unsurprisingly, we did not observe inhibition of enzyme activity by the fragments up to the maximum concentrations we were able to assay due to solubility of the fragments. It is important to note that this is not surprising given the fragments’ relatively simple chemical structures and low affinities (soaking with fragments at 30-150 mM concentrations resulted in observed occupancies of only 10-30% in the crystal structures). However, looking ahead, the dozens of cocrystal structures with small-molecule fragments bound at promising new allosteric sites we have reported here offer a foothold for future medicinal chemistry efforts to design allosteric inhibitors for PTP1B.</p><p>Instead, here we focus on an alternative strategy to validate the concept of allosteric inhibition at the 197 site: covalent binding to enhance ligand occupancy. Specifically, we used “Tethering”…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors then attempted tethering which has little impact to the story. The tethering is unlikely to lead to any drug that will have effect on a WT protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that converting a covalent tethered compound for a mutant protein to a non-covalent drug for the wildtype protein remains a challenge beyond the scope of this work. However, we disagree that the tethering has little impact: the main goal of the tethering experiment here was to confirm that the allosteric 197 site is functionally coupled to the active site – i.e., to establish the concept of long-range control of protein function from this site. Indeed, our experiments confirm that a local perturbation (the tethered compound) at the 197 site, which is distal from the active site, significantly modulates the activity of the enzyme. This observation is critical for revealing that the 197 site can be thought of as a true allosteric site, rather than a benign, non-functional binding site. Thus, the tethering experiments ultimately confirm the prediction of allosteric coupling between the 197 site and active site that was made based on our multitemperature X-ray analysis of the apo enzyme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, they screened a new library for the tethering screen. Then what was the purpose of the fragment crystal soak screen?</p></disp-quote><p>The goal of the fragment screen was to identify places on the protein surface that bind molecules. The tethering screen followed up on the fragment screen on a single site – chosen because it had the highest number of molecules bound (even more than the previously established allosteric inhibitor site). The fragment and tethering libraries are different due to the requirement for a disulfide linkage in the tethering experiment. Thus, the fragments were free to contain essentially any chemical groups, whereas the tethering molecules all were required to feature a disulfide group, and were all screened against a specific mutant (K197C) of the protein. Converting fragment hits from our initial screen to disulfide-containing fragments would have been difficult and slow. It was simpler to rescreen the identified site against the existing disulfide fragment library.</p><p>Overall, the fragment screen mapped the ligandability of the entire surface (critically, confirming that the 197 site, BB site, and L16 site were binding hotspots), and the tethering screen identified a compound that tethers well (indicating it binds appreciably) to the 197 site and is functionally linked to activity. Essentially the two approaches (fragments vs. tethering) involve a tradeoff between structural resolution and affinity. By combining both approaches, we have learned that the most bindable site in PTP1B has an inherent allosteric connection to activity.</p><p>We have added the following text to the Discussion section to clarify the inherent value of both the fragment and tethering screens:</p><p>First, we used a new high-throughput method with small-molecule fragments to map the ligandability of the entire surface of PTP1B with high structural resolution. Although individually these fragments have low affinity, collectively the 110 protein:fragment structures we report reveal overlapping poses with a multitude of precise binding interactions at specific sites in PTP1B (Figure 7A,B,C). Second, we used covalent tethering to probe the functional effects of a high-occupancy ligand at one promising allosteric site. Our work takes advantage of a synergy between fragments and tethering. Fragments bind weakly but allow for the visualization of hundreds of chemical entities bound to distinct sites in a protein. By contrast, tethering does not provide high-throughput structural information, but allows for targeted perturbations to functionally probe a specific site, and additionally can provide lower-throughput structural information about chemical matter that allosterically inhibits a protein variant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Developing a real inhibitor from the hits within the fragment crystal soak screen would have proved their point (PTP1B could be inhibited by binding of a small molecule at this allosteric site) better and been a real step forward in a novel allosteric inhibitor for PTP1B.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a “real” non-covalent inhibitor for PTP1B is desirable, as it has been a highly sought-after therapeutic target for many years, but that it is also an extremely high bar for publication.</p><p>We have refocused several aspects of the manuscript around what we do think is the major step forward here: revealing an expanded allosteric network in PTP1B via multitemperature crystallography, mapping the ligandability of the entire surface to find potential allosteric sites with high-throughput small-molecule fragment screening and structure determination, and confirming a functional linkage from a new allosteric site to the active site. Although the tethered molecule we report at the allosteric 197 site achieves only modest inhibition, the partial allosteric inhibition we observe is strong evidence that the 197 site represents an important new foothold for allosteric inhibitor development for PTP1B. As described above, we have added text to the Discussion section that comments on the mechanistic basis of this partial antagonism.</p><p>Overall, our work introduces a new approach for establishing long-range control of conformation and function. This is a general approach that we have applied to PTP1B. In addition to the novel result of the 197 site, our approach successfully identifies the core scaffold and conformational hypothesis of the previously characterized BB allosteric inhibitors (as noted above, we have added a new figure to the paper to emphasize this key point). Moreover, the unprecedented number of small-molecule:PTP1B cocrystal structures we report offers invaluable opportunities for specific medicinal chemistry follow-up experiments using fragment-based drug design. While we have moved the field <underline>toward</underline> the goal of developing potent non-covalent inhibitors for PTP1B, our work takes on additional value by being highly generalizable to other systems.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This work advances our understanding of the subtle collective motions of a prototypical non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1b. Previous work suggested that the rate of enzymatic catalysis of PTP1b is controlled by the motions of the conserved WPD loop, which has been trapped in different crystals at either open or closed conformations. The authors show the inherent mix of open and closed WPD loop in their reanalysis of the previously deposited PDB structure 1SUG and proceed to demonstrate via multi-temperature crystallography the gradual shift of population towards open WPD as a function of increasing temperature. The collective motion of WPD loop, residues in the alpha3, disorder of alpha7, and residues of L16, match the motions observed upon binding benzbromarone, suggesting the latter stabilizes a pre-existing conformation. The multi-temperature crystallography reveals temperature dependent changes of the 197 site, which might also couple to the WPD motions via Tyr152 and rotation of helix3, thus impacting catalysis. The authors perform a systematic crystallographic fragment screen and identify fragments binding to the benzbromarone site, to L16, and the 197 site. They expand one fragment hit to build a tethered fragment binding to the K197C mutant, for which they show biochemical evidence of inhibition due to tethering and also obtain a high-resolution crystal structure.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a nice summary of our work from the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The crystallography and fragment screening work is solid, and the proposal of a new allosteric site, within reach of a previous site may prove to be important.

To focus on these data and avoid overstating any claims, we have made several changes to the text. For example, we changed this sentence in the Abstract:</p><p>“Our results converge on new allosteric sites that are conformationally coupled to the active-site WPD loop, hotspots for fragment binding, and distinct from other recently reported allosteric sites in PTP1B.”</p><p>… to the following:</p><p>“Our results converge on allosteric sites in PTP1B that are conformationally coupled to the active-site WPD loop and are hotspots for fragment binding.”</p><p>We also changed this paragraph in the Introduction:</p><p>“Overall, by pinpointing promising functionally linked, ligandable allosteric sites plus structurally resolving dozens of small-molecule binders at those sites, our work opens doors for future development of potent non-covalent small-molecule allosteric inhibitors for PTP1B.

More broadly, we illustrate a generalizable approach to characterizing and exploiting coupled conformational heterogeneity to enable long-range control of protein function.”</p><p>Other examples of simplifying our claims are scattered throughout the manuscript, some of which are included in responses to other comments below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) The claim that new pockets are identified by RT crystallography needs qualification. The claim that L16 newly identified is not accurate as it was previously reported by the Loria laboratory. The K197 pocket was also previously reported by Loria lab and Peti lab with a different name. These previous works need to be adequately discussed in this context. The authors need to explain if and how these cryptic binding sites can be revealed from the RT crystallography data without the knowledge a priori.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that previous work has used NMR, simulation and mutagenesis to identify sites that closely correspond to the 197 site and L16 site that we have identified here. We have therefore removed the word “new” throughout the manuscript when describing these sites. Overall, we feel that our contributions complement these excellent studies by the Peti and Loria groups in a number of ways by revealing atomic details, implicating distinct residues, and identifying small molecules that bind at these sites (as elaborated below).</p><p>First, our work using multitemperature crystallography independently identifies similar allosteric sites as did Peti and Loria et al. by other methods including NMR, MD, mutagenesis, and crystallography. We note that, although publication dates may initially suggest otherwise, our work was in fact performed over several years in parallel with (and without knowledge of) those studies; thus, it is highly gratifying to see several studies converge to some similar conclusions. Moreover, our use of multitemperature crystallography affords direct experimental resolution of relevant conformational states of PTP1B throughout the allosteric network in atomic detail. To emphasize this aspect, we have added the following text to the Introduction:</p><p>“Our findings provide support for the previously characterized allosteric network in PTP1B that responds to BB inhibitors [11]. Moreover, they reveal extensions of this network, including additional allosteric binding sites that are distinct from the BB site (Figure 1). Similar regions of PTP1B have been implicated as allosteric sites based on mutagenesis coupled with traditional cryogenic X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, and NMR spectroscopy [11][15]; here we complement those studies by using multitemperature crystallography to reveal in atomic detail the conformational heterogeneity that allosterically links these sites to the active site.”</p><p>We also added this sentence to Results section:</p><p>“Our findings thus shed additional light on the mechanism by which loop 11 allosterically communicates with the active site, thus complementing other recent studies using mutagenesis, MD, and NMR to map allostery in PTP1B [11][15].”</p><p>Second, there are some minor differences between the residues implicated in allosteric sites between these studies. In the L16 site, we identify residues that the Loria group did not (and the Peti group did not predict the L16 site, as the reviewers mentioned). In the 197 site, we implicate some residues that are not implicated by the Loria group and/or Peti group. These small differences may in part arise from our use of a different technique, multitemperature multiconformer crystallography, which enables us to directly visualize the conformational ensemble for every residue in the protein. To explain this aspect, we have added the following text for the L16 site in the Results section:</p><p>“The L16 site was not identified as part of the allosteric network in PTP1B based on a study using mutagenesis, NMR, and MD [11]. However, in a more recent study, several residues lining what we call the L16 site (including Met3, Lys237, and Ser242) were included in a region called “Cluster II”, which was suggested to be a previously unidentified allosteric site based on reciprocal NMR chemical shift perturbations upon mutation of this site or the WPD loop [15]. Our work here using multitemperature crystallography complements these findings by independently identifying this allosteric site using a new methodology, and by revealing in atomic detail how multiple conformational states at the L16 site may aid communication with the active site. Interestingly, a separate approach combining molecular dynamics and machine learning also recently pointed to this area as a potential “cryptic” binding site [31]. Therefore, the L16 site may be not only energetically coupled to the active site, but also capable of forming an under-appreciated small-molecule binding pocket via the conformational heterogeneity we observe.”</p><p>We also added the following text for the 197 site in the Results section:</p><p>“We next discuss several similarities and a few differences between what we refer to as the 197 site and similar regions implicated by other recent studies of allostery in PTP1B. First, in addition to predicting the L16 site (see above), reciprocal chemical shift changes upon mutation suggested that several residues at both ends of the 197 site (Tyr152, Tyr153, Lys150, Arg105) are part of a region referred to as “Cluster I” that is allosterically linked to the active site [15]. However, that study did not implicate additional key residues on the α3 helix, e.g. Asn193 and Lys197. Second, mutagenesis, NMR, and cryogenic crystallography implicated several elements of our 197 site as being part of the larger allosteric network in PTP1B: loop 11 (including Tyr152 and Tyr153), the α3 helix (especially Asn193), and the α7 helix [11]. Chemical-shift-restrained molecular dynamics simulations further suggested that Tyr152 on loop 11 and Asn193 on the α3 helix have mutually coupled alternative conformations [11]. However, here we highlight additional residues (e.g. Asp148 and Glu157 on the β strands on either end of loop 11) as being conformationally coupled to each other and to the rest of the allosteric network and the active site, and which may collectively form a binding pocket. Therefore, our work accomplishes two things with regards to these existing studies. First, we add support to their findings by reaching similar conclusions using orthogonal methods. Second, we complement the other studies by revealing additional amino acid residues that may play roles in binding and allosteric communication at the 197 site.”</p><p>Finally, in contrast to the Peti and Loria work, our study identifies dozens of structures with ligands bound to PTP1B, including dozens in the two key allosteric sites, and one with a molecule that was experimentally demonstrated to inhibit enzyme activity. This is an important, unique contribution relative to previous work. To emphasize this point, we have added text in several places, e.g. the following in the Introduction:</p><p>“Our work builds on previous studies of these sites in PTP1B [11][15], which did not report chemical matter that binds to them.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The allosteric network identification is interesting, but a substantial part of the network has been reported in 4 publications (2 by the Loria laboratory and 2 by the Peti laboratory). These results need to be properly acknowledged and discussed. Again, would the network be obvious without the prior knowledge?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the allosteric network is obvious from our multitemperature X-ray analysis. We feel it is a credit to all of these research groups that our results agree with each other, despite using very different methods (NMR, MD). See above for further discussion on this point. Moreover, our multitemperature X-ray experiments provide atomistic detail that complements NMR measurements (provided in some cases by simulations, but revealed here directly experimentally). Finally, we add value by providing many structures of PTP1B in complex with small-molecule fragments, which both validate that the featured putative allosteric sites are ligandable and provide starting poses for future drug discovery efforts by others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Some of the added speculative discussion can be misleading and needs to be tempered. For example, the discussion of the BB inhibitors and the corresponding site might be misleading to readers that are not well versed in mechanistic studies or drug discovery. The word &quot;validates&quot; is too strong (&quot;this approach validates many aspects of the recently characterized allosteric network that corresponds to BB inhibitors&quot;), since the referenced paper was largely based on unsubstantiated or weak claims. Even though the present work provides support for some of these speculative ideas it does not validate them.</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid misleading the reader by speculating, we have made several changes throughout the manuscript. For example, we have changed this sentence in the Introduction (<underline>underscores</underline> for emphasis):</p><p>“This approach <underline>validates</underline> many aspects of the recently <underline>characterized</underline> allosteric network that responds to BB inhibitors…”</p><p>… to the following:</p><p>“Our findings <underline>provide support for</underline> the previously <underline>hypothesized</underline> allosteric network in PTP1B that responds to BB inhibitors…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) The discussion of flat SAR is misleading: &quot;On the other hand, they may also accommodate different small-molecule variants equally well, such that it is difficult to improve upon inhibition -- i.e., the structure-activity relationship (SAR) is flat. &quot; This argument is questionable as it would be an extreme coincidence to perfectly compensate the binding energetics with corresponding structural rearrangements. The possibility cannot be excluded that the flat SAR is due to an inhibition mechanism that is unrelated to that particular binding site, which is not uncommon occurrence in PTP1b drug discovery efforts.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that other mechanisms which would also explain the flat SAR should not be excluded. To indicate this, we have added the following to the Discussion section:</p><p>“Notably, it is possible that the flat SAR observed at the BB site is due to an inhibition mechanism that is unrelated to the particular binding site, which is not uncommon in PTP1B drug discovery efforts – if this is the case, targeting the 197 site may face similar hurdles.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Methodology rigora) How observations are derived from the RT crystallography data in a rigorous way is not well explained throughout the text. Alternative conformations are fit in weak density in published and new crystal structures – however, would it be possible to just place waters in such incomplete density and the statistical analysis of the data improves? What is the cut off for rigor and statistics to identify biologically relevant alternative conformations etc., and, further, that it can be interpreted for the identification of allostery. This issue is crucial to the general applicability of the approach and specifically to the identification of both the allosteric network and the cryptic sites in PTP1B without using prior knowledge.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to ensure that our models are not fitting to noise (as described in references Pearce et al., 2017, Lang et al., 2010,van dem Bedem 2009 and Keedy et al., 2014 in particular). Moreover, significant past research has validated the concept of modeling multiple protein states as “alternative conformations”. We have added the following text to the Results section when multiconformer models across temperatures are first introduced to clarify this point:</p><p>“Such models are equally good and usually better explanations of the experimental X-ray data [24,25], and have been used to understand many biologically relevant phenomena at protein:water interfaces [26], dynamic enzyme active sites [14,27], and allosteric networks perturbed by mutations [28].”</p><p>To further ensure that our multiconformer models for room-temperature and other elevated-temperature datasets in this paper are well-justified, we have now performed an additional analysis in which we removed the alternative conformations, re-refined the new single-conformer models, and compared the resulting R-factors to the multiconformer models’ R-factors. The result is that the multiconformer models’ R-factors are better (lower) in each case. To emphasize this point, we have added this new text to Results section:</p><p>“Removing the alternative conformations and re-refining the resulting single-conformer models, either with or without automated solvent placement, yields deteriorated statistics (Table 1—source data 1), which confirms that the multiconformer models are appropriate explanations of the experimental data at each temperature.”</p><p>… and a new supplementary table containing these data:</p><p>Finally, the shift across temperatures provides an additional validation that protein conformational shifts, rather than water, is responsible for the density. We are working on joint refinement procedures that use these related datasets to increase the data:parameter ratio as a future direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In the fragment screening, many fragments were seen to bind with PTP1B in many locations. How would one know which of these locations are sites for allosteric inhibition if they have not been independently identified previously. It seems in such cases one can only make educated guesses based on druggability estimation of a fragment's binding site and its relation to the structural-functional mechanism of the target's regulation. Or there might be more rigorous ways to approach this issue. This is worth an adequate clarification and discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, it is a general challenge in biophysics to predict what sites on a protein surface are good candidates for allosteric inhibition. Even when specific binding sites are known, it is difficult to predict whether small-molecule binding at them will allosterically inhibit protein activity. This is why our multitemperature X-ray analysis coupled to multiconformer modeling for apo PTP1B was so important: it provides a mechanistic way to predict which parts of the protein are capable of transmitting signals to the active site via an allosteric network of coupled conformational motions. Binding sites that abut this allosteric network are more likely to be good sites for allosteric inhibition using small molecules. We have added the following text to the Discussion section to emphasize this key point:</p><p>“Many of the 11 binding sites outside the active site are likely to be benign. Importantly, our multitemperature X-ray analysis of the apo protein provides a way to predict which binding sites are instead likely to be allosterically coupled to function. Based on the result that the same small number of sites are both (a) implicated as allosteric by multitemperature X-ray analysis of conformational changes in apo PTP1B and (b) the most ligandable sites from the fragment screen across the entire surface, we conclude that conformational changes may be important for allosteric ligand binding in this protein.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Presentation issuesa) The figures lack continuity and clarity. It seems that in each figure PTP1B is shown from a different orientation, without relaying the orientation to a general overview, which makes it difficult for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to their allosteric nature, the sites we describe are in various areas of PTP1B, which unfortunately does require different viewing orientations in order to see them without obstruction. We apologize if this was confusing. We do note that in the first revision, we included an additional overview figure (now Figure 1) which specifies all the structural sites that are illustrated in subsequent figures, as requested by the original reviewers. We also note that movie versions of several key figures are available, which provide a better 3-dimensional sense. However, to further assist the reader in this regard, we have added text to each structure-based figure that better orients the reader with respect to Figure 1 and/or other relevant overview figures. Because almost all figures are in one of a small number of orientations (“front side” vs. “back side”), but are zoomed in to different regions from these orientations, we feel this is a helpful strategy for guiding the reader. For example, the caption for Figure 4 now includes the following text:</p><p>“The viewing orientation in A-D is as in Figure 1B (“back side” of PTP1B), except zoomed in on the loop 16 site (labeled in Figure 1B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The wording in many statements in the manuscript is exaggerated or unnecessarily strong, which needs revision.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted the tone of the manuscript to be more subdued in many instances. For example, we removed the subjective word “beautifully” from this sentence in Results:</p><p>“Remarkably, this L16 alternative conformation sampled by apo PTP1B [beautifully] matches the L16 conformation when PTP1B is allosterically inhibited by BB2…”</p><p>As another example, we removed the word “exciting” from this sentence in the Discussion:</p><p>“Our work reveals [exciting] new opportunities for long-range control of PTP1B function by impinging upon tendrils of this expanded allosteric network with small molecules.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) There are many typos throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their attention to detail. We have fixed the typos that we observed while carefully revising the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) One interesting observation is that the tethering of the compound leads to change in Km? What is the mechanism for this change? A change in the active site? This should be repeated with a set of substrates (e.g. difmup and TK domain substrate peptides with Malachite greenPi capture). Such data may shed new light to the mechanism of allosteric inhibition of PTP1B.</p></disp-quote><p>Although there is a small change in KM, it is not statistically significant and therefore our original manuscript treated it as no change. To clarify this point – and to contrast it with the significant change in Vmax – we have added this Vmax and KM data to the manuscript as panels E and F in Figure 8—figure supplement 2 along with appropriate captions:</p><p>We have also added the following text to the body of the manuscript referencing these new panels:</p><p>“Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis of K197C in the presence of <bold>2</bold> (50 µM) showed a statistically significant ~50% reduction in Vmax relative to DMSO treatment, but no significant effect on KM for the pNPP substrate (Figure 8—figure supplement 2C,E,F).”</p><p>In addition, we have now performed new experiments with DiFMUP (as suggested by the reviewer) as an alternative substrate. As with pNPP, we observe no statistically significant change in KM (Figure 8—figure supplement 3D), but a reduction in Vmax (Figure 8—figure supplement 3C). The results across both substrates are therefore consistent with a non-competitive allosteric mechanism. We have commented on this result as follows in the “Validating a functional allosteric linkage with covalent tethering” section:</p><p>To further profile the inhibitory effect of tethering of 2 on K197C, we assayed the ability of the tethered complex to dephosphorylate the alternative substrate DiFMUP [45]. As with pNPP, the tethered complex was inhibited, with kinetic analysis showing a dramatic reduction in Vmax, but no significant effect on KM (Figure 8—figure supplement 3). These results once again support a partial noncompetitive allosteric mechanism of inhibition.</p><p>We have also added a new figure (Figure 8—figure supplement 3) detailing the Vmax and KM data as well as inhibition data with DiFMUP:</p><p>In addition to these clarifications and new data, as requested by the reviewer, we have added the following summary of our finding of a non-competitive allosteric mechanism (significant effect on Vmax, and no significant effect on KM):</p><p>We note that the non-competitive allosteric mechanism observed suggests that tethering 2 to K197C may shift the protein’s energy landscape in such a way as to alter the kinetics of WPD loop motions. Future work to explore this issue would nicely complement the crystallographic and functional analysis we provide here.</p></body></sub-article></article>
