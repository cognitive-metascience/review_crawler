However, the mechanistic basis for M cell entry remains undefined. Here, we show that M cell transcytosis depends on the Mtb Type VII secretion machine and its major virulence factor EsxA. We identify scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) as an EsxA receptor on airway M cells. SR-B1 is required for Mtb binding to and translocation across M cells in mouse and human tissue.

The current paradigm of acute infection is that after an actively infected person aerosolizes infectious Mtb-containing particles, a naive individual inhales the bacteria that then traverse the respiratory tree to ultimately be phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Churchyard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>). While this model can account for pulmonary TB, it is insufficient to explain some extrapulmonary forms of TB initiated by oropharyngeal infection and lacking evidence of concurrent pulmonary disease. For example, a disease known as tuberculous cervical lymphadenopathy, or scrofula, represents 10% of all new cases of TB, and frequently manifests without lung involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fontanilla et al., 2011</xref>). Because the oropharynx and upper airway lymphatics drain to the cervical lymph nodes, while the lower airway lymphatics drain to the mediastinal lymph nodes, infection of the cervical lymph nodes by Mtb may not involve the lower airways. Indeed, in the infamous ‘Lübeck Disaster’ where hundreds of infants and children were accidentally orally administered Mtb instead of the attenuated BCG vaccine, the majority developed lymphatic and oropharyngeal TB rather than pulmonary TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fox et al., 2016</xref>), highlighting how inoculation via the oropharyngeal route can cause extrapulmonary disease.</p><p>One potential explanation for the development of lymphatic TB centers upon the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brandtzaeg et al., 2008</xref>). Specialized epithelial cells known as microfold cells (M cells) overlie the MALT and are able to translocate luminal material to basolateral antigen-presenting cells located immediately beneath the M cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kimura, 2018</xref>). In this way, M cells can initiate an immune response to pathogens or material found within the lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakamura et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Since their initial discovery overlying Peyer’s patches of the gastrointestinal tract, M cells have been identified at other mucosal sites. Within the respiratory tract, M cells have been found in the upper and lower airways of both mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fujimura, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kimura et al., 2019</xref>). M cells express a number of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mabbott et al., 2013</xref>). The majority of these M cell receptors have been identified on gastrointestinal M cells, while receptor expression by airway microfold cells is less well understood. Some PRRs on gastrointestinal M cells function in bacterial recognition and translocation. For example, the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)), a receptor for <italic>Brucella abortus</italic>, is necessary for <italic>B. abortus</italic> translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nakato et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, glycoprotein 2 (GP2) expressed on the apical surface of gastrointestinal M cells recognizes FimH, a component of the type I pili found on both commensal and pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hase et al., 2009</xref>). Loss of either the host receptor GP2 or the bacterial ligand FimH diminishes bacterial translocation through M cells, reducing the immune response to these antigens and bacteria within Peyer’s patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hase et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We previously demonstrated that Mtb uses airway M cells as a portal of entry to initiate infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nair et al., 2016</xref>). We hypothesized that Mtb may produce a bacterial effector to mediate this process, and that, similar to receptors for gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hase et al., 2009</xref>), airway M cells may also encode an Mtb receptor. Here, we show that Mtb requires the type VII secretion system for translocation in vitro and in vivo. The type VII secretion system effector EsxA (also known as ESAT-6) is sufficient to mediate this process in vitro through binding to scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-B1). SR-B1 is enriched on mouse and human M cells both in vitro and in vivo. Loss of SR-B1 reduces EsxA and Mtb binding to M cells, and prevents Mtb translocation through M cells in vitro. Using a newly developed explanted human adenoid model, we demonstrate robust expression of SR-B1 on primary human M cells. Finally, we show that Mtb infects primary human M cells on adenoids in a type VII secretion system dependent manner. Taken together, our findings indicate that the interaction of Mtb EsxA with M cell SR-B1 allows Mtb to traverse the airway mucosa to initiate infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Mtb type VII secretion system mediates Mtb binding to and translocation through M cells in vitro</title><p>Mtb encodes several protein secretion systems important for bacterial virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feltcher et al., 2010</xref>). One of the type VII secretion systems (T7SS) of Mtb, contained within the region of difference 1 (RD1) locus of Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behr et al., 1999</xref>), secretes virulence factors including EsxA and EsxB (also known as CFP-10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stanley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We hypothesized that the Mtb T7SS might facilitate M cell translocation because the T7SS machine interacts directly with eukaryotic membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augenstreich et al., 2017</xref>), EsxA can be identified on the mycobacterial cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kinhikar et al., 2010</xref>), and EsxA may directly bind several cell surface receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kinhikar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sreejit et al., 2014</xref>). To test if the Mtb T7SS was required for bacterial binding to and translocation across M cells, we used a human airway M cell transwell model that we developed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nair et al., 2016</xref>). Such transwells combine 16-HBE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cozens et al., 1994</xref>) in the apical compartment of a transwell and Raji B cells in the basolateral compartment in order to mimic the organization of MALT and to enhance M cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kernéis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nair et al., 2016</xref>). HBE cells cultured alone form a homogenous, polarized monolayer (hereafter called ‘control’) while coculture with Raji B cells induces some HBE cells to differentiate into M cells (hereafter called ‘HBE/Raji B’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nair et al., 2016</xref>). We used the Mtb <italic>eccD1::Tn5370</italic> strain (hereafter designated Mtb <italic>eccD1::Tn</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cox et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stanley et al., 2003</xref>), which lacks the inner membrane pore required for assembly of and protein secretion by the T7SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdallah et al., 2007</xref>). To test if the Mtb T7SS was necessary for M cell binding, we incubated transwells with either wild-type Mtb expressing mCherry (WT Mtb) or Mtb <italic>eccD1::Tn</italic> expressing mCherry at 4°C to prevent bacterial entry or translocation and analyzed surface binding by confocal microscopy and quantification of colony-forming units (CFU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). Consistent with our prior data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nair et al., 2016</xref>), significantly more WT Mtb bound HBE/Raji B transwells (containing M cells) than control transwells by both microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) and CFU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, binding was greatly reduced for the Mtb <italic>eccD1::Tn</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). To confirm that the Mtb <italic>eccD1::Tn</italic> strain did not harbor additional mutations other than the expected transposon insertion into <italic>eccD1</italic> to potentially explain this result, we performed whole genome sequencing on the Mtb Erdman WT lab strain from our lab, along with the Mtb <italic>eccD1::Tn</italic> strain. No significant insertions, deletions or mutations were observed in the Mtb <italic>eccD1::Tn</italic> strain relative to the wild-type strain, although several single-nucleotide polymorphisms were noted when we compared the strains to the reference strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyoshi-Akiyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mtb T7SS is necessary to mediate binding and translocation across M cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of Mtb T7SS.

As we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nair et al., 2016</xref>), WT Mtb translocated across HBE/Raji B transwells to a greater extent than control transwells, while the translocation of the Mtb <italic>eccD1::Tn</italic> strain was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

To further verify that Mtb T7SS is required for bacterial translocation across M cells in vitro, we also utilized an established model of M cell differentiation where Caco-2 cells, a human colonic epithelial cell line, are cultured with Raji B transwells to induce M cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nair et al., 2016</xref>). Similar to HBE/Raji B transwells, we observed that Mtb translocated across Caco-2/Raji B transwells in a T7SS-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>).

Although SR-B1 has not been previously identified as an EsxA receptor, prior studies have found other host proteins that interact with EsxA, including laminin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kinhikar et al., 2010</xref>), β2 microglobulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sreejit et al., 2014</xref>), and TLR-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pathak et al., 2007</xref>). We did not identify these proteins in our affinity purification assay, a discrepancy possibly related to the cell types used for binding experiments. However, it is possible that these or other receptors could partly compensate for loss of SR-B1 on M cells, explaining the low level of binding and translocation observed in the absence of SR-B1. Alternatively, Mtb may encode for factors other than EsxA that also mediate M cell binding and translocation, explaining the low level of binding and translocation observed in the absence of EsxA.</p><p>In mice, we observed that Mtb lacking the T7SS had a greatly reduced ability to disseminate from mouse NALT to the cervical lymph nodes, potentially due to a reduced ability to translocate across M cells. A possible alternate interpretation for this result centers on the observation that T7SS deficient strains of Mtb are attenuated in vivo and in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stanley et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the reduced CFU recovered from draining lymph nodes could represent a macrophage survival defect for the T7SS deficient strains. However, when we used a different attenuated Mtb strain for NALT infection, we observed normal dissemination to the draining lymph nodes. We therefore propose that the reduced CFU recovered from cervical lymph nodes of mice infected with T7SS-deficient Mtb is not simply due to an attenuation defect within macrophages. Consistent with this interpretation, the markedly reduced translocation of T7SS-deficient Mtb across M cells in vitro and into explanted human adenoids ex vivo, in the absence of an innate immune response and over a very short time course, indicates that the T7SS is required for translocation across M cells.</p><p>SR-B1 has been well characterized as a high-density lipoprotein receptor involved in cholesterol uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acton et al., 1996</xref>). It has also been shown that SR-B1 binds several bacterial molecules, including lipopolysacharide and lipoteicheic acid produced by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bocharov et al., 2004</xref>). Although direct interaction of EsxA and SR-B1 has not previously been shown, SR-B1 has been reported as a receptor for mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Philips et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schäfer et al., 2009</xref>), primarily in macrophages (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stamm et al., 2015</xref>). However, when SR-B1<sup>-/-</sup> mice were infected with Mtb via the aerosol route, there was no difference in bacterial replication, granuloma size, cytokine secretion, or survival within the first 4 months post-infection compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schäfer et al., 2009</xref>). Based on our current data and previous results showing improved mouse survival during aerosol Mtb infection when M cells are reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nair et al., 2016</xref>), we predict that loss of M cell SR-B1 should reduce bacterial dissemination from the airway and enhance mouse survival. SR-B1<sup>-/-</sup> mice experience defective intrauterine and post-natal development and as a result are not born at normal Mendellian ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santander et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, they manifest increased serum HDL, cardiovascular defects and altered adrenal hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trigatti et al., 1999</xref>), making them incompatible with such a study. Likewise, mice expressing an M-cell specific Cre have not been reported, preventing analysis of SR-B1 function exclusively in M cells.</p><p>Adenoid M cells may serve as a portal of entry for Mtb, with significant implications for Mtb pathogenesis in humans. Because respiratory MALT is more abundant in children than adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tschernig and Pabst, 2000</xref>) and M cells are a key component of MALT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corr et al., 2008</xref>), we propose that the increased incidence of extrapulmonary TB in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2004</xref>) is due to M cell mediated translocation. Interestingly, there was significant variation in M cell entry in human adenoids, which could relate to polymorphisms in SR-B1 or differences in SR-B1 expression by M cells.</p><p>Many bacterial and viral pathogens use the airway as a portal of entry, such as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bucior et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russell et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilkosz et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnett et al., 2015</xref>), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) and varicella zoster virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Messaoudi et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, a variety of pathogens that invade via the gastrointestinal tract such as <italic>B. abortus</italic> via PrP(C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nakato et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> via GP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hase et al., 2009</xref>), and murine norovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gonzalez-Hernandez et al., 2014</xref>) possibly via CD300lf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orchard et al., 2016</xref>) use unique receptors for M cell mediated translocation. Thus, we speculate that a broad array of airway pathogens exploit distinct M cell receptors to penetrate the airway mucosa and disseminate.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that M cells are a portal of entry for Mtb in vitro, in mouse NALT, and in human adenoids. Utilizing mouse models and in vitro models, we identify EsxA and SR-B1 as a molecular synapse required for Mtb translocation across M cells in vitro and in vivo in both mice and humans. A greater understanding of the role of airway M cells in the context of infection by Mtb or other respiratory pathogens will yield insight into novel pathways with potential for new vaccine candidates or therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and media</title><p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Erdman, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Erdman <italic>eccD1::Tn5370</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cox et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stanley et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Erdman Δ<italic>esxA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stanley et al., 2003</xref>)<italic>, M. tuberculosis</italic> Erdman <italic>cor:Tn7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zacharia et al., 2013</xref>) were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium or on Middlebrook 7H11 plates supplemented with 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase.

Cells were stained with a 1:100 dilution of mouse anti-EpCAM Brilliant Violet 421 (Biolegend 324219; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11124342">AB_11124342</ext-link>), mouse PE-NKM-16-2-4 (Miltenyi 130-102-150; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2660295">AB_2660295</ext-link>), or rabbit anti-SR-B1 in FACS buffer, washed, and then incubated with a 1:500 dilution of AlexaFluor 488 conjugated donkey-anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Thermo R37118; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2556546">AB_2556546</ext-link>). Cells were washed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hr followed by counting on an LSRII flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>). For in vitro transwell infections to determine bacterial binding or translocation, one-way ANOVA with corrections for multiple comparisons was performed. For in vitro determination of antibody staining, one-way ANOVA with corrections for multiple comparisons was performed. For in vivo adenoid infections or receptor expression, the paired non-parametric Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test was performed. For in vivo mouse infections and determination of CFU, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was performed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Beth Levine and members of the Shiloh Lab for constructive feedback on the manuscript.

interesting manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic>! We are excited about the findings you present showing that Mtb EsxA is involved in Mtb invasion of M cells through its engagement with the SR-B1 airway M cell receptor. These findings are an important advance in our understanding of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> invasion at different host sites, where the role and mechanisms of M cell invasion is understudied and poorly understood.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Identification of scavenger receptor B1 as the airway microfold cell receptor for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Patricia Champion (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor. Everyone is very positive about the manuscript and have drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this well-presented and interesting manuscript, the authors demonstrate a role for Mtb EsxA in the invasion of M cells through it's engagement with the SR-B1 airway M cell receptor for Mtb. The study is a nice extension of their previous work and an important advance in our understanding of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection. The reviewers request the following revisions to support the data interpretations made by the authors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please add the following controls to the data shown:</p><p>A) Genetic complementation of any of the Mtb strains lacking the T7SS genes.</p><p>B) Add EsxB as a control protein for Figure 2 D-H.</p><p>C) Add the uninfected control transwell data to Figure 1G.</p><p>D) Add a loading control and the EsxA protein pulled down for the western blot in Figure 3B. In addition, are the molecular weight markers correctly indicated for this figure and are there more marker sizes? Unglycosylated SR-BI is indeed ~55-57 kDa, however, this does not seem to be the case in this blot based on the markers. Furthermore, a fully glycosylated SR-BI should be no more than 82 kDa. As such, glycosylation should be verified by EndoH treatment. It is also possible that the band at 130 kDa may represent an SR-BI oligomer, but this should be verified as the estimated molecular weight does not match that of an SR-BI dimer. Have the authors checked to see if that 130 kDa band is actually SR-BI potentially bound to another protein?</p><p>2) Please add the following missing information/data:</p><p>A) Coomassie gels of the purification of EsxA and EsxB and a discussion of any quality control performed on the proteins, for example MS analysis, to confirm identity/ purity.</p><p>B) Methods regarding the LC-MS analysis.</p><p>C) For all microscopic images, please indicate how many overall images the presented ones in the manuscript represent. (i.e. How many fields of view were imaged per independent experiment?).</p><p>D) Quantification of colocalization of EsxA and SRB-1 in Figure 4.</p><p>E) Figure 1B shows approximately 10 bacteria in the field, but the graph in C shows 100-150 area of bacteria per field. Is bacteria area different from the number of bacteria? How were the numbers that are graphed acquired?</p><p>F) Figure 2E and 3D state a similar number of nuclei per field was observed, but Figure 2D shows at least two fold higher nuclei than 3C. How are these numbers determined/calculated?</p><p>G) For Figure 1B and others, the authors should present the brightfield image to determine where the cell boundaries are to try and distinguish bacteria adherent or inside host cells.</p><p>H) In Figure 3, the enrichment of APOE and SRB1 peptides by EsxA IP are significantly less than the enrichment of the transferrin receptor and transferrin. How much or each &quot;receptor&quot; did you pull down relative to the amount of EsxA and transferrin? Is the volcano plot the result of one, two or three independent replicates from the IP?</p><p>I) Is it possible to include a schematic of the transwell assay in Figure 1?</p><p>J) For Figure 4: The molecular weight of the SR-BI band should be indicated. Is a lower exposure of this immunoblot available?</p><p>3) Data files and statistics revisions:</p><p>A) The complete proteomics data file supporting the volcano plot in Figure 3A should be submitted.</p><p>B) The statistical methods that led to the p-values used to generate the volcano plot in Figure 3A should be added.</p><p>C) It is unclear that the Student's t-test is appropriate throughout. For example, I think the t-test is appropriate for comparing treated vs untreated (as RajiB vs Control for a single strain), but inappropriate to go between two strains, or proteins (like 1C-E and 2A, C).</p><p>D) Please either designate whether it should be assumed that conditions not called out in the figures are not significantly different from each other, or add a supplemental table of the outcome of all statistical comparisons. For example, would be interesting to know if the deccD +/- RajiB is significantly different from each other in 1C and 1E.</p><p>4) Please add the following reference related revisions:</p><p>A) The correct reference for SR-BI glycosylation (subsection “Scavenger receptor class B type 1 binds EsxA and is expressed on M cells in vitro”) should be used (older Krieger papers).</p><p>B) &quot;Two of the most abundant T7SS secreted proteins are EsxA and EsxB&quot; - Please add reference.</p><p>C) Discussion paragraph four – please indicate that Shen et al. is a review. Otherwise, provide the original reference for the identification of SR-BI as an HDL receptor.</p><p>Some other points to consider that would strengthen the conclusions made:</p><p>1) Something to consider - is performing a direct IP between EsxA and soluble domains of SRB-1 possible? This would sure up the conclusion that SRB1 is an EsxA &quot;receptor&quot; and that the interaction between the two is direct. Alternatively, if the crosslinking assay you are using demonstrates a direct interaction between EsxA and SRB1, despite the fact that the pull down is from lysates, this needs to be clearly stated and discussed.</p><p>2) The authors' findings raise the question of whether chemical inhibition of SR-B1 could inhibit binding of EsxA and translocation of Mtb. Using a chemical inhibitor of SR-B1 would alleviate any concerns that genetic knockdown of SR-B1 affects M cell biology more generally. A chemical inhibitor could also be used in vivo.</p><p>3) Is it possible to isolate primary M cells from SR-BI<sup>-/-</sup> mice to definitively identify SR-BI as an EsxA receptor? This would increase the significance of these studies.</p><p>4) There are several pieces of data in the manuscript that indicate that EsxA may not be the only factor, or that there may be additional receptors for EsxA on M cells. For example, Figure 4: There are still EsxA+ cells in the absence of SRB1. Also, is translocation into M cells higher for beads with EsxA than Mtb? Does this imply that Mtb surface might include additional factors that modulate this process? Do M. tb without esxA still translocate at a low% , again indicating additional factors? This possibility should be clearly addressed in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52551.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please add the following controls to the data shown:</p><p>A) Genetic complementation of any of the Mtb strains lacking the T7SS genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the need for complementation which has historically been used to control for polar effects or off-target mutations. In our manuscript we chose to use two independent mutants that each have a non-functional T7SS, as it is highly unlikely that both strains would share similar off-target effects of the introduced genetic modifications beyond the known broad impact on the T7SS encoded in the RD1 locus, or that both would have spontaneous mutations in other genomic regions. In addition, both of the strains we used in this study, the MtbΔ<italic>esxA</italic> (Stanley et al., 2007) and Mtb <italic>eccD1::Tn5370</italic> (Stanley et al., 2007; Stanley et al., 2003) have been studied previously, including with complementation for T7SS activity (i.e. EsxA secretion), thus excluding polar effects and major genomic changes in the original mutants. To confirm that there were no additional mutations that might have developed during laboratory passage, we sequenced the genomes of all three strains, Mtb Erdman, Mtb ErdmanΔ<italic>esxA</italic> and Mtb Erdman <italic>eccD1::Tn5370</italic> and compared them to the published Mtb Erdman reference genome (GenBank: AP012340). The whole genome sequencing identified the expected deletion in <italic>esxA</italic> along with the presence of the residual transposon sequences and hygromycin cassette used in the generation of the mutant(Mtb <italic>esxA</italic> in the reference genome is ERDMAN_RS20430 and the deletion is located at NC_020559.1:4333535-4333786) and the transposon insertion in <italic>eccD1</italic> (Mtb <italic>eccD1</italic> in the reference genome is ERDMAN_RS20440 and the insertion is at NC_020559.1:4337340). As expected, all three strains shared minor differences with the reference genome, and importantly, the Mtb Erdman WT and Mtb <italic>eccD1::Tn5370</italic> were identical to each other. When we compared the Mtb Erdman WT to the Mtb ErdmanΔ<italic>esxA,</italic> there was only a single coding variant encoding a missense mutation in Mtb ErdmanΔ<italic>esxA</italic> compared to the Mtb Erdman WT in a putative oxidoreductase. We have uploaded the sequencing data to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA submission # PRJNA605439), and include a variant table in the supplemental material (Supplementary File 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Add EsxB as a control protein for Figure 2 D-H.</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment is now reflected in revised Figure 2D-H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) Add the uninfected control transwell data to Figure 1G.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not have uninfected data to add, but we did include the translocation data for the control transwells not co-cultured with Raji-B cells in new Figure 1H and Figure 1I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D) Add a loading control and the EsxA protein pulled down for the western blot in Figure 3B.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a loading control as suggested. For the EsxA pulldown, we attempted to detect EsxA after the biotin switch assay but were unable to detect the protein with either the monoclonal EsxA antibody or the anti-His antibody. It is possible that the reaction impacted the epitopes detected by the antibodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, are the molecular weight markers correctly indicated for this figure and are there more marker sizes? Unglycosylated SR-BI is indeed ~55-57 kDa, however, this does not seem to be the case in this blot based on the markers. Furthermore, a fully glycosylated SR-BI should be no more than 82 kDa. As such, glycosylation should be verified by EndoH treatment. It is also possible that the band at 130 kDa may represent an SR-BI oligomer, but this should be verified as the estimated molecular weight does not match that of an SR-BI dimer. Have the authors checked to see if that 130 kDa band is actually SR-BI potentially bound to another protein?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for identifying the issue regarding the molecular weight of SR-B1. Regarding the molecular weight discrepancy of SR-B1 (130 kDa vs 82 kDa), we returned to our Western blot/IP data and discovered that the reason for the discrepancy was the primary antibody we used to detect SR-B1. In the experiment performed, we used a polyclonal anti-rabbit antibody against SR-B1 (Novus Biologicals NB400-104), which for unclear reasons demonstrated SR-B1 at ~130 kDa both in our hands and on the product website. When we used the mouse monoclonal antibody against SR-B1 that is more commonly used in the field (abcam; ab52629), we demonstrated SR-B1 at the expected molecular weight of 82 kDa (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We have now redone the biotin switch assay using the ab52629 monoclonal antibody, obtained the appropriate size for SR-B1 and have revised the figure accordingly (New Figure 3B).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52551-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please add the following missing information/data:</p><p>A) Coomassie gels of the purification of EsxA and EsxB and a discussion of any quality control performed on the proteins, for example MS analysis, to confirm identity/ purity.</p></disp-quote><p>A Coomassie gel is now provided in the supplemental materials (New Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Methods regarding the LC-MS analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Detailed methods for LC-MS are now included in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) For all microscopic images, please indicate how many overall images the presented ones in the manuscript represent.

The image in Figure 1B is a high-power representative image, but not of an entire field. We initially chose to quantify bacteria by using ImageJ to determine the pixel intensity per field as an unbiased surrogate for manually counting bacteria. For clarity, we have changed the analysis so that number of bacteria per 100 cells is quantified in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>F) Figure 2E and 3D state a similar number of nuclei per field was observed, but Figure 2D shows at least two fold higher nuclei than 3C.

To accomplish this would require confocal microscopy with Z-stacks, and such experiments are quite challenging for transwells. As we were interested in binding to the cells, which could include surface binding and subsequently internalized bacteria, we did not pursue additional experimentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>H) In Figure 3, the enrichment of APOE and SRB1 peptides by EsxA IP are significantly less than the enrichment of the transferrin receptor and transferrin. How much or each &quot;receptor&quot; did you pull down relative to the amount of EsxA and transferrin? Is the volcano plot the result of one, two or three independent replicates from the IP?</p></disp-quote><p>The transferrin receptor is a ubiquitously expressed and abundant cell surface protein, which is why the company we contracted, Dualsystems Biotech, provides transferrin as the positive (experimental) control. We only present the transferrin/transferrin receptor data to demonstrate the success of the TriCEPS assay, not for comparative purposes. In addition, it is not possible to quantify the amount of each receptor pulled down using this method. The volcano plot is the result of one experiment with three independent biologic replicates.

For example, I think the t-test is appropriate for comparing treated vs untreated (as RajiB vs Control for a single strain), but inappropriate to go between two strains, or proteins (like 1C-E and 2A, C).</p></disp-quote><p>For the entire manuscript, we replaced Student’s t-test by one-way ANOVA with corrections for multiple comparisons as it is a more rigorous statistical analysis tool.

For example, would be interesting to know if the deccD +/- RajiB is significantly different from each other in 1C and 1E.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a comment to the legend for each figure where appropriate indicating that if comparisons are not directly highlighted, that they are not statistically significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please add the following reference related revisions:</p><p>A) The correct reference for SR-BI glycosylation (subsection “Scavenger receptor class B type 1 binds EsxA and is expressed on M cells in vitro”) should be used (older Krieger papers).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We revised this section to reflect the new data (see comment 1D above) and include the original paper by Acton et al. to indicate the correct MW.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) &quot;Two of the most abundant T7SS secreted proteins are EsxA and EsxB&quot; - Please add reference.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have included references detailing the abundance of these two proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) Discussion paragraph four - please indicate that Shen et al. is a review. Otherwise, provide the original reference for the identification of SR-BI as an HDL receptor.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the reference to indicate the original identification of SR-B1 as an HDL receptor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some other points to consider that would strengthen the conclusions made:</p><p>1) Something to consider - is performing a direct IP between EsxA and soluble domains of SRB-1 possible? This would sure up the conclusion that SRB1 is an EsxA &quot;receptor&quot; and that the interaction between the two is direct. Alternatively, if the crosslinking assay you are using demonstrates a direct interaction between EsxA and SRB1, despite the fact that the pull down is from lysates, this needs to be clearly stated and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. Performing an IP of EsxA with a soluble SR-B1 domain would be a challenge as it is not known if the three-dimensional structures of soluble (i.e. recombinant) and transmembrane SR-B1 are the same, and thus soluble SR-B1 may not bind EsxA for technical rather than biologic reasons. We performed two independent assays using EsxA to probe for cell surface binding. While both included a cross-linking step (TriCEPs and biotin switch), they were also both performed on whole cells, not lysates, and both demonstrated an interaction between EsxA and SR-B1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors' findings raise the question of whether chemical inhibition of SR-B1 could inhibit binding of EsxA and translocation of Mtb. Using a chemical inhibitor of SR-B1 would alleviate any concerns that genetic knockdown of SR-B1 affects M cell biology more generally. A chemical inhibitor could also be used in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. While we recognize this is an important experiment, we are concerned that an inhibitor of SR-B1 activity that blocks HDL internalization (such as the established HDL internalization inhibitor BLT-1) might not share the same inhibitory activity for Mtb binding/internalization. As such, only a positive result (i.e. an inhibitor successfully prevents Mtb internalization) would be interpretable. In addition, administration of such an inhibitor in vivo could yield confounding results because it could not only impact M cell internalization but also macrophage SR-B1 mediated internalization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is it possible to isolate primary M cells from SR-BI<sup>-/-</sup> mice to definitively identify SR-BI as an EsxA receptor? This would increase the significance of these studies.</p></disp-quote><p>SR-B1<sup>-/-</sup> mice are nearly impossible to breed and have multiple developmental and physiologic abnormalities. Ongoing work in the lab is focused on developing a M cell specific Cre mouse that will allow for cell type specific conditional deletion of SR-B1 from M cells by crossing to an SR-B1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mouse. However, validating and testing Cre expression, crossing these mice and then testing them for M cell activity is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are several pieces of data in the manuscript that indicate that EsxA may not be the only factor, or that there may be additional receptors for EsxA on M cells. For example, Figure 4: There are still EsxA+ cells in the absence of SRB1. Also, is translocation into M cells higher for beads with EsxA than Mtb? Does this imply that Mtb surface might include additional factors that modulate this process? Do M. tb without esxA still translocate at a low% , again indicating additional factors? This possibility should be clearly addressed in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising these important points. We have expanded the Discussion to incorporate the idea that there may be additional EsxA receptors on M cells, and that other Mtb factors may also mediate M cell entry.</p><p>References:</p><p>Stanley, SA, Johndrow, JE, Manzanillo, P, Cox, JS.2007.
