However, due to their high energy demands, cardiac cells are disproportionately targeted by mitochondrial toxins resulting in a loss of cardiac function. An analysis of the effects of mubritinib on cardiac cells showed that this drug did not inhibit HER2 as reported, but directly inhibits mitochondrial respiratory complex I, reducing cardiac-cell beat rate, with prolonged exposure resulting in cell death. We used a library of chemical variants of mubritinib and showed that modifying the 1<italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazole altered complex I inhibition, identifying the heterocyclic 1,3-nitrogen motif as the toxicophore. The same toxicophore is present in a second anti-cancer therapeutic carboxyamidotriazole (CAI) and we demonstrate that CAI also functions through complex I inhibition, mediated by the toxicophore. Complex I inhibition is directly linked to anti-cancer cell activity, with toxicophore modification ablating the desired effects of these compounds on cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The pharmaceutical industry needs to make safe and effective drugs. At the same time this industry is under pressure to keep the costs of developing these drugs at an acceptable level. Drugs work by interacting with and typically blocking a specific target, such as a protein in a particular type of cell. Sometimes, however, drugs also bind other unexpected targets. These “off-target” effects can be the reason for a drug’s toxicity, and it is important – both for the benefit of patients and the money that can be saved when developing drugs – to identify how drugs cause toxic side effects. The earlier researchers detect off-target effects, the better.</p><p>Recent data has suggested that an anti-cancer drug called mubritinib has off-target effects on the compartments within cells that provide the cell with most of their energy, the mitochondria. This drug’s intended target is a protein called HER2, which is found in large amounts on the surfaces of some breast cancer cells. Yet if mubritinib has this off-target effect on mitochondria, it may be harmful to other cells including heart cells because the heart is an organ that needs a large amount of energy from its mitochondria.</p><p>Stephenson et al. have now performed experiments to show that mubritinib does not actually interact with HER2 at all, but only targets mitochondria. The effect of mubritinib as an anti-cancer drug is therefore only due to its activity against mitochondria. Digging deeper into the chemistry revealed the small parts of its chemical structure that was responsible for mubritinib’s toxicity against heart cells, the so-called toxic substructure. Another anti-cancer drug called carboxyamidotriazole also has the same toxic substructure. Carboxyamidotriazole is supposed to stop cells from taking up calcium ions, but a final set of experiments demonstrated that this drug also only acts by inhibiting mitochondria.</p><p>Often there is not enough information about many drugs’ substructures, meaning off-target effects and toxicities cannot be predicted. The pharmaceutical industry will now be able to benefit from this new knowledge about the toxic substructures within some drugs. This research may also help patients who take mubritinib or carboxyamidotriazole, because their doctors will have to check for side effects on the heart more carefully.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>toxicophore</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>cardiac liability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UU_000 /RG94521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stephenson</surname><given-names>Zoe A</given-names></name><name><surname>Harvey</surname><given-names>Robert F</given-names></name><name><surname>Pryde</surname><given-names>Kenneth</given-names></name><name><surname>Willis</surname><given-names>Anne E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PUAG015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Willis</surname><given-names>Anne E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U105663141</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirst</surname><given-names>Judy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UU_00015/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirst</surname><given-names>Judy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel toxicophore, a 1H-1,2,3-triazole, has been identified in a wide-number of therapeutically-relevant compounds, including two anti-cancer chemotherapeutics, which inhibits mitochondria function and is mechanistically linked to adverse cardiac-cell events.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The pharmaceutical industry must deliver safe and effective medicines while simultaneously limiting the costs associated with drug development, and a central part of this process is de-risking potential safety liabilities at an early stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morgan et al., 2018</xref>). In many cases, lack of mechanistic understanding about how compounds cause toxicity hampers predictions of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and more information about the specific substructures of drug molecules that cause ADRs is required. Such information can then be used to populate machine learning algorithms to generate adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) that predict likely outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dey et al., 2018</xref>) from off-target toxicities and that can be used in early phase drug design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>It is widely accepted that disruption of mitochondrial function is a common cause of ADRs and it has been proposed that mitochondrial toxicity, which has a major role in idiosyncratic drug toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uetrecht and Naisbitt, 2013</xref>), is responsible for up to 50% of post-market drug withdrawals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Will and Dykens, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dykens and Will, 2007</xref>). Mitochondrial toxins often have a differential effect on tissue function due to organ-specific variations in the mitochondrial proteome and its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson et al., 2007a</xref>); primarily biosynthetic and metabolic in liver, and energy production in muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnson et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calvo and Mootha, 2010</xref>). For example, cardiomyocytes, which have high energy requirements and are rich in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">El-Hattab and Scaglia, 2016</xref>), are particularly sensitive to mitochondrial toxins that alter ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kolwicz et al., 2013</xref>). Mitochondria are central to many cell-wide processes so mitochondrial toxicity affects bioenergetics, metabolism, signalling and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meyer et al., 2018</xref>) in addition to impacting stemness, differentiation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guerra et al., 2017</xref>). Due to these pleiotropic roles, ‘off-target’ drug toxicity resulting in impairment of mitochondrial function can easily be misattributed to other targets and cellular processes.</p><p>Given the relative paucity of mechanistic knowledge relating specific drug substructures to ADRs we carried out a detailed chemical dissection of mubritinib, which was reported to act as a tyrosine kinase (HER2) inhibitor and which has been trialled as a treatment for a range of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nagasawa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ouchida et al., 2018</xref>). However, mubritinib has also been shown to affect energy status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baccelli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sridhar et al., 2003</xref>), and it was recently demonstrated to have an ‘off-target’ effect on mitochondrial function through inhibition of respiratory complex I in cells derived from patients with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML), leading to a new therapeutic option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baccelli et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that mubritinib does not bind directly to HER2 and that its inhibitory effect on complex I negatively impacts on cardiomyocyte function, an important clinical consideration. Through the use of a focussed chemical library, we show that modifying the 1<italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl moiety present in mubritinib substantially alters both the inhibition of complex I and the toxicity to cardiomyocytes; identifying a heterocyclic 1,3-nitrogen motif as being key to its complex I inhibitory action. A search of chemical space was then undertaken for the same substructure, and led to the drug carboxyamidotriazole (CAI), which has also been trialled as an anti-cancer agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sridhar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Omuro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>). We show that, like mubritinib, CAI does not directly inhibit its reported target (calcium channels) and is also a potent complex I inhibitor. Furthermore, like mubritinib, chemically altering the triazole ring moiety ablated toxicity. In both cases we show that mitochondrial toxicity is directly linked to anti-cancer activity, as chemical manipulation of the toxicophoric heterocycle ablates the desired effects of both compounds on cancer-cell proliferation and apoptosis. Thus, we have identified a novel toxicophoric motif that is mechanistically linked to an adverse cardiac cell event. Our data demonstrate that caution must be taken when attributing a drug mechanism of action without detailed structure activity relationship (SAR) analysis, since inhibition of mitochondrial function has such cell-wide effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mubritinib is not a direct HER2 inhibitor, but instead inhibits ATP production in H9c2 cells and reduces beat rate in cardiomyocytes</title><p>Previous data have reported that mubritinib inhibits phosphorylation of HER2 in breast cancer cell lines that express high levels of this receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nagasawa et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the HER2-overexpressing cell line, BT474, was treated with increasing doses of mubritinib and the effect on HER2 phosphorylation was analysed by western blotting, with the specific HER2 inhibitor lapatinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brandão et al., 2018</xref>) as a positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Surprisingly, there was only a small decrease in HER2 phosphorylation in the presence of mubritinib, in contrast to lapatinib. Furthermore, recent data have further shown that mubritinib, in common with known inhibitors of mitochondrial respiratory complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sica et al., 2020</xref>), alters the phosphorylation status of proteins that sense changes in energy status and stimulate cellular proliferation, such as mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leibovitch and Topisirovic, 2018</xref>). In agreement with these data, we show that treatment of cells with mubritinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) alters the phosphorylation status of proteins downstream of the energy sensor AMPK (e.g. acetyl-CoA carboxylase) and impacts on mTOR signalling (e.g. phosphorylation of RPS6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, similar effects were also observed with treatment by the known mitochondrial inhibitors, rotenone and antimycin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ci and ii</xref>). In contrast, lapatinib, which is a specific HER2 inhibitor, blocks signalling downstream from mTOR with minimal effect on ACC phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ci and ii</xref>), but a large effect on RPS6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ci and ii</xref>). An inactive mubritinib analogue (compound <bold>5</bold>, see below) was used as a negative control. An in vitro tyrosine kinase activity assay was then carried out with increasing concentrations of mubritinib, in which recombinant human HER2 was incubated with radioactively labelled <sup>32</sup>P-ATP. Mubritinib did not decrease <sup>32</sup>P incorporation, even at 10 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), demonstrating that it does not inhibit HER2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, consistent with our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), mubritinib has been reported to display no activity against almost 300 other kinases screened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anastassiadis et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mubritinib does not inhibit HER2, but inhibits ATP production and beat rate of cardiomyocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis of the HER2-overexpressing cell line, BT474, treated with increasing doses of mubritinib.

The same pattern of inhibition was observed for ATP production in cells grown in media containing galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

Data from a number of studies have suggested that the anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic properties of CAI (<bold>9</bold>) are mediated through the inhibition of non-voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in non-excitable cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hupe et al., 1990</xref>), which in turn modulates downstream phosphorylation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2000</xref>), however this has not been demonstrated directly. Calcium binding assays performed here show clearly that there is no significant binding of CAI (<bold>9</bold>) to non-voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). It has also been shown that CAI (<bold>9</bold>) affects mitochondrial calcium import and local calcium clearance, which is essential for the maintenance of capacitative calcium entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mignen et al., 2005</xref>) and it was proposed that this then inhibited oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ju et al., 2016</xref>). These data suggest that the toxicophore, in the context of CAI (<bold>9</bold>), might act in a similar way to mubritinib, and that the effects on mitochondrial calcium release could be the secondary effects of complex I inhibition. To explore the effect of the heterocycle in CAI (<bold>9</bold>) on mitochondrial function we generated three variants. Two compounds, which we predicted by analogy with our mubritinib variants that would be inactive, contained isomeric pyrazoles (<bold>10</bold> and <bold>11</bold>). One further compound was synthesised where the triazole ring in CAI was replaced with an imidazole ring (<bold>12</bold>), which we predicted would retain mitochondrial toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

The toxicophore in the context of mubritinib and CAI is the embedded 1,3-nitrogen motif of the 1<italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl heterocycle and we have shown that this nitrogen atom disposition appears critical for both mitochondrial toxicities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). In a preliminary screen of compounds that inhibited complex I, we identified two antifungal agents, ketoconazole and terconazole, which also contained the heterocyclic 1,3-nitrogen motif embedded within a 1<italic>H</italic>-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl or 1<italic>H</italic>-imidazol-1-yl substituent respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Interestingly, we also found that rufinamide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), which contains a chemically similar core scaffold to CAI, displayed no complex I inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Serreli, 2018</xref>). However, there are key structural differences between these two drugs and in particular, rufinamide lacks an anilino nitrogen in the 5-position of the 1,2,3-triazole, the <italic>para</italic>-chlorobenzoyl moiety and there is a chloro to fluoro switch with regards the halogen substituents on the <italic>N-</italic>benzyl group (alongside the switch in position from 3,5 to 2,6). These observations are therefore coupled with a difference in the logP of rufinamide (1.3) when compared to CAI (3.1) which indicates a significant decrease in its overall lipophilicity and may therefore reflect a compromised pharmacokinetic-driven target engagement. Which of these differences drive the observed loss in complex I inhibition by rufinamide is a focus of ongoing work.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram to show the cell-wide effect of ETC complex I inhibition by the toxicophore.</title><p>Chemical inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complex I with mubritinib and CAI leads to a decrease in cellular ATP and the subsequent activation of the energy sensor AMPK. Importantly, AMPK has been shown to phosphorylate and inhibit HER2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jhaveri et al., 2015</xref>) suggesting how mubritinib has been misattributed as a HER2 inhibitor, as well to negatively regulate protein synthesis via the mTOR axis to inhibit tumour cell growth. Moreover, cancer cells that are dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production, such as in AML, will be more sensitive to compounds that inhibit complex I. However, the decrease in ATP levels following treatment with these compounds will also have a particularly toxic effect on tissues with a high energy demand, such as cardiac tissue, and thus impact on heart function.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55845-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>It is of serious concern that while both mubritinib and CAI are trialled as part of anti-cancer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baccelli et al., 2019</xref>), neither directly bind their reported targets, HER2 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Mitochondria play a central role in cell-wide processes in addition to bioenergetics and metabolism by providing a signalling hub that controls stemness, differentiation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guerra et al., 2017</xref>), therefore disruption of mitochondrial function can easily be misattributed to other targets, such as receptors involved in cell signalling. Cardiac cells are especially sensitive to mitochondrial toxicants that alter ATP production and our data suggest that both mubritinib and CAI have the potential to affect these cell types in situations when glucose is limiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). It would therefore be important to monitor patients treated with such agents for changes in cardiac function during future clinical trials of CAI or mubritinib.</p><p>In terms of cancer treatment, mubritinib has been used to chemo-sensitise tumour cells to other cytotoxic agents. For example, in combination with AC220 (quizartinb), mubritinib reduces the viability of ovarian derived cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ouchida et al., 2018</xref>). However, sole inhibition of complex I is also a viable treatment option for some cancer types. Thus while drugs that target the coordinated upregulation of glycolysis that is often associated with tumorigenesis are being developed, several studies have shown that many cancer cell subpopulations are particularly dependent upon OXPHOS for bioenergetic and biosynthetic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vazquez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Viale et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birsoy et al., 2015</xref>).

solvents of analytical and HPLC grade were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. All reactions were carried out at ambient temperature unless otherwise stated. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography on commercially available silica pre-coated aluminium-backed plates (Merck Kieselgel 60 F254). Visualisation was under UV light (254 nm and 366 nm), followed by staining with ninhydrin or KMnO4 dips. Flash column chromatography was performed using silica gel 60, 230–400 mesh particle size (Sigma Aldrich). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker-AV 400. <sup>1</sup>H spectra were recorded at 400.13 Hz and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra at 101.62 Hz. All 13C NMR are 1H broadband decoupled. Solvents used for NMR analysis (reference peaks listed) were CDCl<sub>3</sub> supplied by Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc, (δH = 7.26 ppm, δC = 77.16) and CD<sub>3</sub>OD supplied by VWR (δH = 3.31 ppm and δC = 49.00). Chemical shifts (δ) are recorded in parts per million (ppm) and coupling constants are recorded in Hz. The following abbreviations are used to described signal shapes and multiplicities; singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), broad (br), dd (doublet of doublets), ddd (double doublet of doublets), dtd (double triplet of doublets) and multiplet (m). Spectra were assigned using appropriate COSY and HSQC experiments. Processing of the NMR data was carried out using the NMR software Topspin 3.0. LC-MS spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UFLCXR system coupled to an Applied Biosystems API2000 and visualised at 254 nm (channel 1) and 220 nm (channel 2). LC-MS was carried out using a Phenomenex Gemini-NX C18 110A, column (50 mm ×2 mm x 3 μm) at a flow rate 0.5 mL/min over a 5 min period (Method A). All high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on a Bruker microTOF mass spectrometer using MS electrospray ionization operating in positive ion mode. RP-HPLC was performed on a Waters 515 LC system and monitored using a Waters 996 photodiode array detector at wavelengths between 190 and 800 nm. Spectra were analysed using Millenium 32 software. Analytical RP-HPLC was performed using a YMC-Pack C8 column (150 mm ×4.6 mm × 5 μm) and a Phenomenex Gemini NX-C18 column (250 mm ×4.6 mm × 5 μm) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Final products were one single peak and &gt;95% pure. The retention time of the final product is reported using a gradient method of 5–95% solvent B in solvent A over 25 min. (Solvent A = 0.01% formic acid in H<sub>2</sub>O, solvent B = 0.01% formic acid in CH<sub>3</sub>CN).</p><p>Abbreviations; DCM, dichloromethane; DIAD, diisopropylazodicarboxylate; DMF, N,N-dimethylformamide; THF, tetrahydrofuran.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title>Mubritinib Analogues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>)</title><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mubritinib analogues.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55845-app1-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Scheme 1.

So please take your time and stay safe.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors provide evidence that anti-neoplastic agent mubritinib (thought to act as specific HER2 inhibitor) exerts its effects in large part by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I. Based on their structure-activity relationship studies, which also included a number of mubritinib derivatives, it was concluded that the effects on mitochondrial complex I are mediated by 1<italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazole ring. Same putative toxicophore was also identified in unrelated ant i-cancer drug carboxyamidotriazole. Based on this, it was suggested that 1<italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazole may represent a toxicophore which interferes with mitochondrial complex I function. These findings therefore may potentially have broad implication on therapeutic effects and toxicity of mubritinib, carboxyamidotriazole and potentially other drugs. Notwithstanding that these findings were found to be both important and exciting, several issues and concerns are brought to the authors' attention, whereby it was thought that they should be addressed to merit acceptance for publication of this work:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It was found that insufficient evidence was provided to support the tenet that 1<italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazole ring is responsible for the effects of the drugs on complex I. For instance, it was observed that compound 7, in which 1<italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazole is replaced with imidazole ring also potently represses complex I (e.g. Figures 2G and H). Similarly, the imidazole derivative (compound 12) appear to exhibit comparable or even more potent effects than carboxyamidotriazole (e.g. Figures 3B, C, and G). To this end, it was suggested that 1<italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazole ring binding to complex I may be influenced by other substructures of tested drugs and that on its own, 1<italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazole ring may not be critical for complex I inhibition. Doesn't imidazole finding somewhat undermine the central idea of the manuscript about the distinctive role of triazoles since many drugs also have imidazole groups?</p><p>2) The concentration of glucose in the media in the experiments where cardiomyocytes were supplemented with glucose or galactose should be indicated. Considering that data in Figure 1F-I and Figure 4A-F were normalised to vehicle it is not clear what is the effect of maintaining cells in galactose for 72h. These data should thus be included.</p><p>3) The interpretation of Seahorse experiments was found to be problematic since ECAR is not uniquely reflective of glycolysis and also depends on non-glycolytic extracellular acidification related to respiration (PMID: 26709455). Moreover, the authors should convert ECAR and OCR to the same units, compare the fraction of ATP produced by OXPHOS vs. glycolysis and assess bioenergetic capacity (PMID: 28270511). Seahorse data should also be normalised over DNA /protein content or cell number.</p><p>4) Several other issues were observed with the Seahorse data. Results in Figure 2B are incomplete as basal respiration in absence of FCCP is not presented. In Figure 2D, cells treated with rotenone have higher OCR than all other conditions, which is highly unexpected. What was the concentration of rotenone used? In Figure 3E, basal and maximal OCR should be presented on the same graph.</p><p>5) Experimental conditions were found to be inconsistent. For instance, analogous to the experiment in Figure 1 wherein mubritinib was compared tolapatinib, established Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inhibitor should be compared with carboxyamidotriazole. In Figure 3F, piericidin A was used as a complex I inhibitor, whereas rotenone was used in Figure 2D. In addition, PMP injection was included in Figure 2D but not in Figure 3F. In Figure 4A-F, mubritinib variant 5 was used as an inactive control, yet variant 6 was used for the cell index data (Figure 4G and Figure 1B). The authors should consolidate these experimental conditions to facilitate comparison of results from different experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55845.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It was found that insufficient evidence was provided to support the tenet that 1H-1,2,3-triazole ring is responsible for the effects of the drugs on complex I.

Therefore, the central point in the paper is that the 1,2,3 triazole, is the toxicophore within the context of these two anti-cancer drugs. This is stated in the Discussion “The toxicophore in the context of mubritinib and CAI is a 1<italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazole…”.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers about the importance of the imidazole group and our data clearly show that the 1,3 nitrogen linkage within imidazole is key since these compounds are active whereas the 1,2, nitrogen containing pyrizoles are inactive.</p><p>The importance of the 1,3 imidazole linkage was discussed throughout the manuscript</p><p>e.g.:</p><p>Results: “these data provide strong evidence that the 1,2,3-triazol-1-yl substituent or a 1,3-amidine like nitrogen atom relationship in the five-membered heterocycle, is required for complex I inhibition”;</p><p>Discussion: “and we have shown that the nitrogen at position 3 appears critical for both mitochondrial toxicity and efficacy”;</p><p>“the efficacy of both mubritinib and CAI (Figure 4) is dependent upon an amidine-like nitrogen substructure”.</p><p>Similarly, we have also discussed that IACS-010759 which is a 1,2,4 containing triazole also contains the same 1,3, nitrogen relationship (see the third paragraph of the Discussion). However, the role of the imidazole in terms of toxicity, does not undermine our central message, and data strongly suggest that the 1,3 imidazole within the 1<italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazole ring in CAI and mubritinib is critical for complex I inhibition.</p><p>To make it clearer we have modified the text as follows:</p><p>Abstract: “alters complex I inhibition, identifying the heterocyclic 1,3-nitrogen motif as the toxicophore”;</p><p>Introduction: “modifying the 1<italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl moiety present in mubritinib substantially alters both the inhibition of complex I and the toxicity to cardiomyocytes; identifying a heterocyclic 1,3-nitrogen motif as being key to….”;</p><p>Results: “These data provide strong evidence that a 1,3-amidine-like motif, housed within the 1<italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl substituent”;</p><p>“compounds which lacked the heterocyclic 1,3-nitrogen motif had no effect”;</p><p>“Taken together these data establish that the presence of the triazole and its embedded heterocyclic 1,3-nitrogen toxicophore is essential for the parent drug effects on tumour cell…”.</p><p>Additionally, and in support of our data, we have added a supplementary table which shows that Ketoconazole and Terconazole that only inhibit complex I contain 1,3 nitrogen linkage the same as CAI and mubritinib (see new Supplementary file 3) and text, see Discussion section “In a preliminary screen of compounds that only inhibited complex I…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The concentration of glucose in the media in the experiments where cardiomyocytes were supplemented with glucose or galactose should be indicated.</p></disp-quote><p>hESC-CM cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media containing either glucose (11 mM) or galactose (10 mM).

Figure 1G and Figures 4A-F show the total number of live cells in the population and thus these values have not be normalised to a vehicle control sample.

The Seahorse assay was used to validate and support the GLU/GAL phenotypic assays and screen compounds (mubritinib, carboxyamidotriazole, synthesised compounds variants) for prospective ETC inhibition. Although it would be interesting to dissect the fraction of ATP produced by OXPHOS and glycolysis in response to these treatments in the future, we feel that these questions are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>The same number of cells were seeded in each well with a multi-channel pipette and any well-to-well variation in seeding density in a single experiment (that was not been accounted for by three technical repeats) is mitigated by n=3/4 biological replicates that were performed on different days using separately passaged cells, and integrated into the statistical quantification. Crucially, we subsequently validate all cellular Seahorse assay data using the in vitro cell-free ETC biochemical assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Several other issues were observed with the Seahorse data.

Similar to mubritinib, CAI activates signalling pathways that are responsive to changes in energy status such as AMPK/ACC. Conversely, treatment with bepridil hydrochloride or the inactive CAI variant 11 did not enhance ACC phosphorylation, further suggesting that CAI is a complex I inhibitor and not a calcium channel inhibitor.</p><p>We have added additional text to describe this experiment to the last paragraph of the subsection “The 1,2,3-triazol-1-yl toxicophore in carboxyamidotriazole (CAI) inhibits ATP production, mitochondrial function and cell proliferation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3F, piericidin A was used as a complex I inhibitor, whereas rotenone was used in Figure 2D.</p></disp-quote><p>Both Rotenone and Piericidin A, used in Figure 2D (now Figure 2C) and Figure 3F as control compounds are well established canonical complex I Q-site inhibitors and therefore they can be used interchangeably. What is central in terms of experimental output is that either compound specifically precludes complex I-driven oxygen consumption in the PMP assay, thus allowing the dissection of complex I activity from OCR that is driven by the remainder of the respiratory complexes (i.e. succinate/complex II). Assays with the different complex I inhibitors are configured to unequivocally validate these data; in Figure 2C (rotenone treatment) the collapsed OCR in permeabilised cells is resistant to Pyr/Mal injection whereas subsequent succinate injection increases OCR to untreated levels, and succinate-driven OCR is fully antimycinA-sensitive. The exact same assay control configuration is used to validate the complex I-specificity ofpiercidin A in the PMP assay (Figure 3F). Crucially, the data derived from the PMP assay is validated in the in vitro/biochemical assay; CAI and Mubritinib are specific complex I Q-site inhibitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, PMP injection was included in Figure 2D but not in Figure 3F.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2D (now Figure 2C), PMP was injected by the seahorse bioanalyser, as indicated within the figure, whereas PMP was added directly to the cells in Figure 3F immediately prior to starting the assay (i.e. at 0 hr). Although there was a difference in how PMP was used in terms of injection this is inconsequential in terms of the integrity of data and conclusions supported by this data; both approaches permeabilise cells, collapsing OCR and clearly confer cytosolic access to succinate and Pyr/Mal (they both potently stimulate respiration). The data derived from these different approaches/assays is appropriately controlled to show, and dissect, complex I-dependent OCR versus complex II-dependent OCR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4A-F, mubritinib variant 5 was used as an inactive control, yet variant 6 was used for the cell index data (Figure 4G and Figure 1B). The authors should consolidate these experimental conditions to facilitate comparison of results from different experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>To consolidate experimental conditions across the different experimental techniques we have made a number of modifications to these figures. We now show the effects of mubritinib variant 5 instead of variant 6 on AMPK/mTOR signalling in BT474 cells (Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Additionally, we have now included the proliferation of BT474 cells following treatment with mubritinib and compound variant 5 (Figure 4G).</p></body></sub-article></article>
