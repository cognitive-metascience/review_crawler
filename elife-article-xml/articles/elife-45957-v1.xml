Macrophages are critical innate immune cells involved in tissue development, repair, and homeostasis as well as many microbial infections, but they are difficult to genetically manipulate via transfection or transduction, most likely due to sensitive circuits that sense foreign nucleic acid. Although it is possible to manipulate primary bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) using CRISPR/Cas9 technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chu et al., 2016</xref>), the low transduction and transfection efficiencies observed in these cells results in low editing efficiency or, if transductants can be selected, low cell numbers. These limited cell numbers preclude many biochemical and screening approaches that require many millions of cells. In addition, the short life-span of these cells does not allow for selection of individual mutant clones or subsequent genetic manipulations such as knockout of a second gene or protein overexpression. Because of these limitations many studies rely on either immortalized macrophage-like cell lines, which do not recapitulate important metabolic and inflammatory pathways of primary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreu et al., 2017</xref>), or the time-consuming process of generating transgenic or knockout mice from which to obtain BMMs.</p><p>To create an efficient and scalable system for effective genome editing in murine macrophages, we sought to build upon previous studies demonstrating that ectopic expression of an estrogen-regulated version of the homeobox transcription factor Hoxb8 (ER-Hoxb8) can immortalize macrophage progenitors that are self-renewing in the presence of β-estradiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Knoepfler et al., 2001</xref>). Subsequent removal of the hormone activates normal differentiation of these cells into macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wang et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We envisioned that deriving conditionally immortalized macrophage progenitors from Cas9-expressing mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Platt et al., 2014</xref>) would allow us to perform gene editing in conditionally immortalized cells prior to differentiation, providing the opportunity to cryopreserve either bulk populations or individually-cloned mutant cells. Subsequent differentiation of edited progenitors into macrophages would then generate a theoretically unlimited supply of mutant macrophages for functional studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). While others have recently taken a similar but limited approach using other lineages of Hoxb8 conditionally immortalized immune cells, we sought to fully establish the efficacy of Cas9<sup>+</sup> CIMs for robust gene editing and infection of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Di Ceglie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">MacDuff et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45957.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cas9<sup>+</sup> CIMs as a tractable system for genome-editing in macrophages.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Graphic overview of gene editing in Cas9<sup>+</sup> CIMs. (<bold>b</bold>) BMMs (left panel), CIMs (middle), or RAW 264.7 cells (right) were visualized with Diff-Quick stain.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). These Cas9<sup>+</sup> macrophage progenitors grew robustly in suspension and, upon removal of β-estradiol and addition of MCSF, differentiated into adherent cells that expressed F4/80, a marker of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b and c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rosas et al., 2011</xref>). However, in our initial studies we noted an unusual morphology of this initial population when compared to primary BMMs derived from wild-type C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>); in addition, the cells expressed high levels of CD11c, a cell surface marker more closely associated with dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). By re-selecting progenitors with high concentrations of the antibiotic G418, the resulting cell population more closely resembled BMMs morphologically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>) and expressed lower levels of CD11c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We speculate that high concentrations of G418 selected for progenitors with greater expression of the Hoxb8 fusion protein, skewing these cells towards a more uniform macrophage-committed progenitor population. Comparison of gross cellular morphology indicates that these Cas9<sup>+</sup> CIMs are much more similar to BMMs than transformed macrophage-like lines such as the frequently used RAW 264.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). To more globally compare BMMs and CIMs, we used Nanostring technology to measure mRNA levels of over 700 genes associated with myeloid innate immunity and compared the gene expression pattern between the two cell types. While the level of some of these mRNAs were different between BMMs and CIMs, the majority of transcripts were present at remarkably similar levels in both cell populations, consistent with the initial studies of similarly differentiated ER-HoxB8 cells, which demonstrated that these cells express many macrophage-specific genes but did not compare them directly to BMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>To determine if Cas9<sup>+</sup>, gRNA-expressing CIMs possess functional macrophage phenotypes, we infected progenitors with one of three lentiviruses expressing non-targeting scramble gRNAs, selected transductants using puromycin, differentiated the resulting cells, and probed three macrophage characteristics to compare them with BMMs. First, flow cytometric analysis using key myeloid/lymphoid lineage markers revealed that CIMs were indistinguishable from BMMs, with high expression of the myeloid marker CD11b and macrophage marker F4/80, and low expression of CD11c, the monocyte marker Ly6C, and the neutrophil marker Ly6G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Second, treatment with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (which engages TLR4) or CpG DNA (TLR9 agonist) induced the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-12p40 from both CIMs and BMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Although the levels were slightly different between the two cell types at these time points, it is clear that CIMs responded vigorously to innate immune stimulation upon engagement of pattern recognition receptors. Finally, CIMs and BMMs upregulated iNOS and generated similar levels of nitric oxide in response to stimulation with LPS plus interferon-γ (IFNγ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h and i</xref>). Based on these results, we conclude that transduced Cas9<sup>+</sup> CIMs share many of the characteristics of BMMs.</p><p>To broadly assess genome editing efficacy in Cas9<sup>+</sup> CIMs, we introduced 40 individual gRNAs targeting a total of 17 genes into these cells, selected for puromycin resistant cells, and assessed genome editing in the resulting populations by PCR amplification of the target sites and sequence analysis using Tracking Indels by Decomposition (TIDE) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brinkman et al., 2014</xref>). We found that over 80% of these gRNA transductions resulted in at least 70% editing of the target gene after differentiation, with the majority achieving 80–100% editing efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). For all 11 genes independently targeted with three distinct gRNAs, we obtained &gt;80% editing from at least one guide RNA. To test whether genome editing in these polyclonal populations resulted in significant differences in protein levels, we examined surface expression of CD11b and IFNγ receptor after transduction with gRNAs targeting CD11b or <italic>Ifngr1</italic> and found that over 90% of CIMs had substantially reduced expression of the targeted protein as assessed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Likewise, transduction with lentiviruses encoding one of three separate guides targeting <italic>Nos2</italic>, the gene encoding the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), effectively blocked iNOS expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>) and production of NO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>) in response to LPS + IFNγ in all three CIM populations. Although gene-to-gene variability in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeting efficiency will certainly exist, taken together our data indicate that independent transduction with three distinct gRNAs per gene in Cas9<sup>+</sup> CIMs will disrupt the majority of genes efficiently enough to produce phenotypically relevant changes in gene expression using bulk populations of transduced cells.</p><p>Another major advantage of the Cas9<sup>+</sup> CIM system is its potential for studying genetic interactions by generating double gene knockouts in the immortalized progenitor state prior to differentiation. To this end, we transduced Cas9<sup>+</sup> macrophage progenitors with a lentivirus containing puromycin resistance and targeting <italic>Ifngr1</italic> and subsequently transduced the resulting population with lentiviruses containing hygromycin resistance and expressing one of three CD11b or scramble guides. After differentiation of these doubly-resistant populations, over 90% of CIMs lacked both IFNγR1 and CD11b protein expression as assessed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). This iterative approach provides a robust way to generate double knockouts, enabling a simple methodology to elucidate synthetic interactions. Overall, our results establish Cas9<sup>+</sup> CIMs as an efficient and robust model for genome editing in macrophages with distinct advantages to standard transformed macrophage-like cell lines.</p><p>To more specifically test whether CIMs are effective for studying the antimicrobial functions of macrophages, we assessed the host and microbe requirements of two well-established bacterial pathogens that naturally infect macrophages, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. First, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> incubated with either BMMs or CIMs were effectively phagocytosed, replicated robustly, and spread to neighboring macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and c</xref>). After phagocytosis, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> ruptures phagosomal membranes using its secreted pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O (LLO, encoded by the <italic>hly</italic> gene) in order to grow in the cytosol, and expresses ActA to hijack the host actin polymerization machinery in order to propel itself through the cytosol and mediate spread to neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Portnoy et al., 2002</xref>). Importantly, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> lacking LLO (Δ<italic>hly</italic>) were unable to grow in BMMs or CIMs, and bacteria lacking ActA (Δ<italic>actA</italic>) failed to recruit actin and spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Thus, the major bacterial virulence determinants required for <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection are the same for BMMs and CIMs.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45957.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cas9<sup>+</sup> CIMs as an in vitro model for <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> infection.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) BMMs (left panel) or CIMs (right) were infected with WT <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> at MOI = 0.25 and monolayers were visualized with Diff-Quick stain at 8 hr post-infection.

To determine whether CIMs are capable of restricting <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> through autophagy targeting, we used a previously characterized bacterial mutant strain lacking three key virulence factors (ActA, PlcA, PlcB) required for microbial evasion of autophagy in BMMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>).

Bacterial burden associated with all three strains of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was somewhat reduced in CIMs compared to BMMs, which we speculate is due to enhanced early killing by the phagolysosomal pathway.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cas9<sup>+</sup> Conditionally-Immortalized Macrophages: a tool for bacterial pathogenesis and beyond&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors set out to create an approach that will yield a cell type that is close to primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), and that can be (i) produced in abundance ex vivo and (ii) be genetically manipulated through CRISPR-CAS9 to modulate specific pathways. The cell type produced are referred to as Conditionally-Immortalized Macrophages (CIM).</p><p>Approach: They use a regulated version of the homeobox transcription factor Hoxb8 (ER-Hoxb8) in conditionally immortalized macrophage progenitors from Cas9-expressing mice, with the idea that differentiation of these can lead to unlimited supply of macrophages. By comparing the gross morphology of the resulting cells, the authors demonstrate similarity to BMMs, an observation further confirmed using NanoString technology to measure mRNA of</p><p>700 genes associated with myeloid innate immunity. The functionality (determined by measuring induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-12p40 and measuring iNOS activity) and similarity of CIMs is maintained when these cells are transfected with the lentivirus system used to deliver short guide RNAs for gene knockdown. Next, to determine the capacity of these CIMs for gene editing the authors introduced 40 individual short guide RNAs that target 17 genes and assessed knockdown using Tracking Indels by Decomposition (TIDE) analysis. In this set of experiments, they obtained &gt;80% gene knockdown from at least one guide RNA. Following this, they also develop a system to make double gene knockdowns in the CIM model.</p><p>Validation: To validate the utility of the CIMs produced by the authors, they use two bacterial systems, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (with BMMs the comparator).</p><p><italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>: Here they monitored phagocytosis and replication, which were comparable between the two cell types (CIMs and BMMs). They also monitored secretion of the listeriolysin O toxin and the ability of the bacterium to make actin comet tails, these bugs move around the cytoplasm by recruiting actin, through a protein called ActA. In addition, using mutants of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and CIM gene knockdowns they confirmed the role for autophagy in controlling infection. All these processes were similar in CIMs and BMMs.</p><p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>: Here, they infected BMMs and CIMs with auto-luminescent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains and looked at bacterial replication and report robust growth in CIMs with kinetics comparable to that of BMMs. To determine if CIMs could be used to explore the biology of tubercle bacteria, they assessed whether the specialized Esx secretion apparatus was important for replication in CIMS. For this, they use a <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strain lacking the core ATPase, required for this system, and report that the mutant bacteria were unable to replicate in BMMs or CIMs. Next, they explore the role of IFNγ and report similar outcomes between the two cell types. They also compared gene expression of BMMs and CIMs infected with wild type <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> or a <italic>ΔeccC</italic> muant using the 700 gene panel described above. They find a strong correlation between genes expressed in CIMs and BMMs, thus confirming the utility of the CIM model for TB studies.</p><p>Key finding: The development of the Cas9+CIM system is a significant technological advance. It provides an invaluable tool for the study of macrophage biology and macrophage/pathogen interaction. Availability of this technology to the broader scientific community would help in the advancement of science.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One of the major concerns is choosing technical duplicates from one experiment for NanoString experiment.
