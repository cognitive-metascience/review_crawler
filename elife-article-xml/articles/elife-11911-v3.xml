The nucleosome, the basic repeating unit of chromatin, typically assembles 146–147 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer consisting of two copies each of H3, H4, H2A and H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Luger et al., 1997a</xref>). Nucleosomes connected by linker DNA form a 10-nm array resembling “beads-on-a-string”. The binding of linker histone further compacts the linear array into a more condensed 30-nm chromatin fiber. The interaction between the N-terminal tail of histone H4 and a specific surface region on the neighboring nucleosome termed the“acidic patch” plays crucial roles for the formation of 30-nm chromatin fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dorigo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Luger et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Song et al., 2014</xref>). The acidic patch is formed by a number of negatively charged residues of H2A and H2B, including Glu56, Glu61, Glu64, Asp90, Glu91 and Glu92 of H2A, and Glu102 and Glu110 of H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Luger et al., 1997a</xref>). Several nucleosome-binding proteins have been shown to specifically interact with the acidic patch. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that these proteins may play a role in regulating the higher-order chromatin structure by competing with the H4 N-terminal tails for binding to the acidic patch of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kalashnikova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McGinty and Tan, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The 72-kDa immediately early 1 (IE1) protein of human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) plays critical roles in the viral early gene expression and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gawn and Greaves, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mocarski et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, IE1 has been long known to associate with condensed host chromatin during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dimitropoulou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krauss et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lafemina et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nevels et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reinhardt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wilkinson et al., 1998</xref>). The chromatin-tethering domain (CTD) located at the very C-terminal end of IE1 (a.a 476–491) is responsible for the association with the mitotic chromosome, specifically through the acidic patch of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mucke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reinhardt et al., 2005</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the association and the impact on the structure and function of host chromatin by IE1 remain to be determined. Here we provide an analysis of the structural basis for the interaction between the CTD of IE1 (IE1-CTD) and the nucleosome core particle (NCP) and explore the impact of their binding on the higher-order structure of chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The complex of NCP with an IE1-CTD peptide (a.a. 476–491) was obtained by soaking the peptide into preformed NCP crystals, and a 2.8 Å structure was solved by molecular replacement. The structure shows one molecule of IE1-CTD bound to the NCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The presence of only one IE1-CTD peptide in the complex structure is due to the availability of only one side of the NCP surface in the preformed crystal lattice, as in the case of NCP in complex with the latency-associated antigen (LANA) of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbera et al., 2006</xref>). The IE1-CTD peptide adopts an extended, v-shaped conformation with a short α-helix at its C-terminus. In the complex structure, IE1-CTD is well positioned into the acidic patch of the nucleosome formed by H2A and H2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). IE1-CTD contacts histone H2B at two distinct sites, the C-terminal portion of α1 and the N-terminal half of αC, through van der Waals interaction and intermolecular hydrogen bonds via its mainchain groups. Specifically, the amide and carbonyl groups of Thr480 make hydrogen bonds with the mainchain carbonyl and the sidechain amide groups of Gln44 of H2B (amino acid residue numbering following that in the reference of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Luger et al., 1997a</xref>); the amide and carbonyl groups of Val484 bond the carboxylate group of Glu110 and the nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring of His106, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). IE1-CTD contacts histone H2A via a number of sidechain contacts. His481 makes one hydrogen bond with Glu56 of H2A; Thr485 and Ser487 each makes one hydrogen bond with Glu64 of H2A; and Arg486 makes hydrogen bonds with Glu61 on α2, as well as with Asp90 and Glu92 located on αC of histone H2A. In addition, Met483 of IE1-CTD is placed in a hydrophobic pocket consisting of Leu23, and the aliphatic portion of Glu56 and Tyr57.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11911.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of the IE1-CTD–NCP complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Location of the IE1-CTD binding site on the acidic patch of the nucleosomal surface.

Most closely related to hCMV IE1 is LANA of KSHV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbera et al., 2006</xref>). The N-terminal CTD of LANA forms a hairpin-like structure that pokes into the acidic patch of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The distinctly folded IE1-CTD and LANA-CTD share certain common features of nucleosome binding. Structural comparison reveals that three IE1-CTD residues, Met483, Arg486 and Ser487, occupy the same regions of the acidic patch and engage the same sets of histone residues as the corresponding LANA residues in binding the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A and B</xref>). In particular, Arg486 interacts with the acidic patch in a manner commonly found in the structures of protein-nucleosome complexes known to date (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–F</xref>). A careful examination of the acidic patch reveals that it can be divided into three adjoining ligand-binding zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Zone I is formed by Glu61, Leu65, Asp90 and Glu92 of histone H2A, and Glu102 and Leu103 of histone H2B; Zone II is formed by histone H2A residues Tyr57, Ala60, Glu61 and Glu64, and the latter serves as a ridge separating zone I and II; and zone III is formed by Glu56 and Ala60 of H2A, and Val41, Gln44 and Glu110 of histone H2B. The binding of an arginine in zone I is conserved among all protein-NCP complexes known thus far. Thr485 of IE1 and Leu8 of LANA are bound in zone II, which is unoccupied in other NCP complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Main differences accounting for the specific interaction between IE1-CTD and NCP appear to reside in His481, which is bound in zone III and makes a hydrogen bond with Glu56 of H2A, and Thr485, which is bound to zone II and forms a hydrogen bond with Glu64 of H2A. And finally, the binding of the N-terminal segment of IE1-CTD spanning residues 476–480 to α1 of H2B is unique to IE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11911.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of protein binding modes to the acidic patch of NCP.</title><p>All NCP-binding peptides or protein segments, shown in a stick model superimposed onto a cartoon representation of the backbone, were superimposed onto the structure of NCP, shown in a surface representation colored according to electrostatic potential, of the IE1-CTD complex based on alignment of NCP structures.

Wild-type IE1-CTD bound to recombinant human NCP with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 0.4 μM, while its mutant lacking the N-terminal segment interacting with α1 of H2B (Δ476–480) reduced the nucleosome-binding affinity to a K<sub>D</sub> of 12 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). To put the binding affinities in perspective, an approximately five-fold weaker binding of full-length IE1 than IE1-CTD alone to NCP was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), possibly caused by self-inhibitory effects of other domains in the full-length protein. In comparison, IE1 lacking the CTD showed no detectable binding to NCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). With IE1-CTD, the most severe reduction of binding affinity was seen in the H481A mutant, which has a K<sub>D</sub> of 43.4 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), while loss of one hydrogen bond by substituting Thr485 with a valine brought the K<sub>D</sub> to 11.3 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To gain further insights into the ~hundred-fold reduction of binding affinity introduced by the H481A mutation, we measured the effect of histone H2A mutation on Glu56, which interacts with His481 via hydrogen bonding and Met483 by hydrophobic/van der Waals interaction. ITC measurement shows that the NCP reconstituted with the E56R mutant of H2A, a charge-swap mutant, lowered the binding to IE1-CTD to a level beyond detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This change of histone H2A also brought about a conspicuous reduction of the binding of LANA to NCP from a K<sub>D</sub> of 0.25 to 23.4 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). LANA and IE1 share the methionine-mediated interaction with Glu56 in zone III of the acidic patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), and the greater compromise of the binding of IE1-CTD to the H2A-E56R NCP reflects the importance of the His481-Glu56 hydrogen bond in the IE1-NCP complex, as compared to the van der Waals interaction between Thr14 of LANA and Glu56 of histone H2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11911.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ITC measurements of peptide-NCP binding affinities.</title><p>(<bold>A–G</bold>) Raw data and fitting curves of the integrated data for the indicated peptides and NCPs are shown together with the derived K<sub>D</sub> values and fitting errors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11911.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11911.006</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-11911-fig3-v3"/></fig><fig id="fig3s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11911.007</object-id><label>Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Binding of full-length IE1 to NCP.</title><p>Bindings of full-length IE1 (<bold>A</bold>), IE1-CTD (<bold>B</bold>), and IE1 lacking CTD (<bold>C</bold>) are measured by ITC at 150 mM NaCl concentration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11911.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11911.007</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-11911-fig3-figsupp1-v3"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>The acidic patch of the nucleosome has been implicated in mediating higher-order chromatin folding via interaction with the N-terminal tail of histone H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Luger et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schalch et al., 2005</xref>). Our previous cryo-EM structure of 30-nm chromatin fiber reveals that N-terminal tails of histone H4 are involved in inter-nucleosomal contacts between the tetranucleosomal structural units through the acidic patches of adjacent nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Song et al., 2014</xref>). Since IE1-CTD is bound at the acidic patch, it is conceivable that IE1 binding may interfere with proper folding of the 30-nm chromatin fiber. To determine the extent by which the folding of chromatin fiber is affected by IE1 binding, we incubated IE1-CTD with the in vitro reconstituted 30-nm chromatin fiber assembled with an array of 12 tandem nucleosomes carrying repeats of 177 bp 601 DNA in the presence of linker histone H1, and analyzed the sample by analytical ultracentrifugation in sedimentation velocity (AUC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Song et al., 2014</xref>). The nucleosomal arrays used for reconstituting 30-nm chromatin fiber were highly saturated and homogeneous, as examined by micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). For comparison, the same batch of nucleosomal array (without H1) and 30-nm chromatin fiber (with H1) were used in AUC analysis. AUC experiments showed that, in the absence of IE1-CTD, the nucleosomal array sedimented with a median sedimentation coefficient S<sub>ave</sub> (sedimentation coefficient at 50% boundary fraction) of 36 ± 1 S, and the 30-nm chromatin fiber sedimented at 51.5 ± 0.6 S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In the presence of IE1-CTD, the 10-nm nucleosomal array was unaffected while S<sub>ave</sub> of the 30-nm chromatin fiber shifted from 51.5 to 48 S, indicating that the binding of IE1-CTD made the chromatin fiber more loosely folded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). It should be emphasized that the IE1-CTD-containing chromatin fiber represents an altered chromatin state different from both the extended 10-nm nucleosomal array and the folded 30-nm chromatin fiber. This chromatin-alteration property of IE1-CTD is shared by the full-length IE1 and fully depends on the presence of CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Further AUC analyses with IE1-CTD mutants showed that they essentially retained the ability to decondense the 30-nm chromatin fiber, possibly due to their incomplete loss of NCP-binding abilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E and F</xref>). By contrast, chromatin fibers reconstituted with the E56R mutant of histone H2A, previously shown to be unable to interact with IE1-CTD, displayed no alteration of chromatin folding by IE1-CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). These observations indicate that the binding of IE1-CTD at the acidic patch of the nucleosome modulates the higher-order structure of chromatin. It should be pointed out that not all acidic patch-binding proteins affect chromatin folding, as LANA does not alter the folding of 30-nm chromatin fiber in our AUC analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11911.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Influence of IE1-CTD on higher-order chromatin structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) AUC analyses showing that IE1-CTD has little effect on the folding of the 10-nm nucleosomal array.

A careful analysis of the landscape of the acidic patch reveals that it can be divided into distinct binding zones that host specific amino acid residues. The conserved binding mode of an arginine in zone I of NCP is important for the association of all NCP-binding partners known to date, while other zones of the acidic patch are involved in differential binding of individual partners. For example, zone III of the acidic patch hosts the binding of His481 of IE1-CTD and Thr14 of LANA, respectively. These two residues interact with Glu56 of histone H2A differently in the structure: while the τ nitrogen of the imidazole ring of His481 makes a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of Glu56 of histone H2A at a distance of approximately 2.9 Å, Thr14 of LANA contacts Glu56 of H2A approximately 5 Å away via van der Waals interaction. This difference in peptide-NCP interactions perhaps account for our observations that an E56R mutant affected the binding of IE1-CTD more severely than that with LANA.</p><p>For the purpose of dissecting the functions of individual NCP binding partners, one would ideally like to be able to isolate histone mutants that affect the binding of one protein but not others. The most promising such sites appear to lie in zone II and III, as they are less frequently occupied among known NCP binding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, the task is more challenging to distinguish IE1 and LANA bindings, as they both interact with all binding zones of the acidic patches. Nevertheless, the identification of the E56R variant of histone H2A as an IE1-noninteracting mutant has already served as a useful tool for assessing IE1’s ability to modulate the higher-order structure of chromatin. Interestingly, this chromatin-modulating activity is not shared by LANA. It was shown previously that the LANA peptide promotes the compaction of nucleosomal arrays, judged by an assay in which the folding of nucleosomal arrays was induced by magnesium ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chodaparambil et al., 2007</xref>). In qualitative agreement with the previous observation, we saw that the addition of LANA made the nucleosomal arrays sedimented slower. Nevertheless, unlike IE1-CTD, LANA has no effect on the preformed H1-containing 30-nm chromatin fiber. There are two possible reasons for the different behavior of LANA, one possibility is that LANA is bound to the chromatin fiber but did not cause any changes to the folding, and the other possibility is that LANA failed to bind 30-nm chromatin fiber. In either case, IE1 and LANA differ in their ability to affect the folding of 30-nm chromatin fiber. The contrasting properties of IE1 and LANA suggest that distinct modes of protein binding to the acidic patch of the nucleosome could exert differential influences to chromatin folding. The discovery of the chromatin modulating activity of IE1 should facilitate further mechanistic understanding of its functions in viral pathogenesis, particularly its impact on the chromatin structure of the host genome, such as transcriptional regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>NCP preparation</title><p>To express histones, cDNA fragments encoding <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> histones H3.3C and H4, H2A type-1 and H2B 1.1, human H3.1 and H4, human H2A type 1-B/E and H2B type 1-J were cloned into pCDFDuet-1 vectors (Novagen) to generate four bicistronic plasmids for co-expression of <italic>Xenopus</italic> and human H3-H4 and H2A-H2B pairs, respectively, in the BL21(DE3)-RIL strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> at 37°C.

the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Human cytomegalovirus IE1 alters the higher-order chromatin structure by targeting the acidic patch of the nucleosome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The evaluation has been overseen by the Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Fang et al. present a crystal structure of human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) immediate early 1 (IE1) protein chromatin-tethering domain (CTD) bound to the &quot;acidic patch&quot; of the <italic>X. laevis</italic> nucleosome core particle (NCP). The authors report sub-micromolar affinity of the IE1-CTD peptide to the <italic>H. sapiens</italic> nucleosome core particle and identify mutations that disrupt binding of the peptide to the NCP. Fang et al. discover that full-length IE1 as well as IE1-CTD can modulate the structure of a reconstituted 30-nm chromatin fiber. The authors present a structure of a hCMV IE1-CTD-NCP complex at 2.8 Å resolution. The crystallography is well done, with good refinement parameters; the peptide is well defined.</p><p>Through structural and biochemical comparison of the N-terminal CTD of LANA to IE1-CTD they expand our understanding of chromatin fiber modulation by acidic patch binders; in contrast to LANA-CTD, IE1 shows chromatin-modulating activity. This indicates that different acidic patch binding proteins could exert effects on the chromatin structure in distinct ways. Fang et al. provide structural and biochemical data for the role of IE1 in 30-nm chromatin fiber modulation and present their findings in a concise and comprehensible manner.</p><p>This is only the second structure of a viral protein bound to the nucleosome. Previously reported structure (Barbera et al., 2006) characterized latency-associated antigen (LANA) of Kaposi sarcoma-associated virus binding to the same region on the nucleosome. Fang et al., show that three residues that are identical between IE1 and LANA use the same mode of interaction with the acidic patch. Additionally IE1 makes several specific interactions. Because there is only a very limited number of NCP complex structures, and because the presented structure reveals new insights, publication in <italic>ELife</italic> will be considered after the following concerns have been addressed and some additional experimental observations are included that should strengthen the conclusions. The manuscript would also greatly benefit from extended Discussion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) IE1-CTD binds to the NCP at the acidic patch like all other crystallized chromatin factor-NCP complexes, but its conformation in the acidic patch shows little similarity to the already published structures. However, the authors should analyze their structural data beyond a comparison with the LANA peptide. The data interpretation should be expanded to other chromatin-binding factors that have been crystallized at the acidic patch (RCC1, PRC1, Sir3, HGMN2, CENP-C), in terms of structure and sequence conservation. The authors recognize that different acidic patch-binding proteins modulate the chromatin structure differently but do not provide an explanation for this. Please expand the Discussion significantly and be accurate in referring to published literature.</p><p>2) To further elucidate the specific interaction of IE1-CTD and NCP, the authors introduced the mutation H2A E56R to disrupt binding of IE1-CTD to the acidic patch. The ITC measurements showed no binding of the IE1 CTD to NCPs with this mutation. Nevertheless, binding of LANA to the acidic patch was also significantly disrupted. It would be better if the authors would use/identify a mutation in the NCP that exclusively disrupts the binding of IE1-CTD. Disrupting interaction with ɑ1 of H2B seems to be an obvious mutation target. Did the authors try this? If not we recommend this to be done as the results may strengthen the conclusion that the mode of binding is unique.</p><p>3) Fang et al. report the purification of the full-length hCMV IE1 protein and use the full-length protein in their analytical ultracentrifugation experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Unfortunately, they do not include the full-length IE1 in their ITC measurements. Inclusion of full-length IE1 in the ITC measurements would facilitate comparison of affinities with their respective effects in 30-nm chromatin fiber modulation. This should be done.</p><p>4) Several issues about the analytical ultracentrifugation experiments have to be addressed. The authors do not provide an explanation of what the observed difference (between 51.5 S and 48 S) means. Isn't 48 S representative of a condensed chromatin as well? 12_177_601 array in presence of H1 sedimented at 46.6 S in their 2014 Science paper. Where does the discrepancy come from? The statement in paragraph four, Results and Discussion, is not accurate. The mutants only have some moderate 'effect'. At what concentration was this experiment done? Above or below the Kd? As it stands, the effects of the peptide on higher order structure may be over-interpreted, or not significant at all. Further, the authors have to include careful quality control for their 12mer array to check for saturation – e.g., by EcoRV digestion. This is especially important for arrays with H1. These issues with the AUC experiments must be clarified before publication can be considered.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11911.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) IE1-CTD binds to the NCP at the acidic patch like all other crystallized chromatin factor-NCP complexes, but its conformation in the acidic patch shows little similarity to the already published structures.

Please expand the Discussion significantly and be accurate in referring to published literature.</italic> </p><p>We have revised the manuscript according to the reviewer’s advice. Specifically, we have carefully compared the structures of proteins bound to the acidic patch of NCP. The result is shown in a new figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, in the revised manuscript. We have compared the binding modes of all the proteins mentioned except HGMN2, as there is no co-crystal structure available and the model of its binding to NCP is not publically available. From this comparison, we distinguished different ligand binding zones of the acidic patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and this identification helped the grouping of different sites of contact.</p><p>We refrained from an extensive Discussion in the original manuscript due to the consideration of strictly following the journal’s length limitation. Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we have expanded the Discussion and included 7 more references in the revised manuscript (please see the marked-up version of the manuscript for comparison).</p><p><italic>2) To further elucidate the specific interaction of IE1-CTD and NCP, the authors introduced the mutation H2A E56R to disrupt binding of IE1-CTD to the acidic patch. The ITC measurements showed no binding of the IE1 CTD to NCPs with this mutation. Nevertheless, binding of LANA to the acidic patch was also significantly disrupted.

Disrupting interaction with ɑ1 of H2B seems to be an obvious mutation target. Did the authors try this? If not we recommend this to be done as the results may strengthen the conclusion that the mode of binding is unique.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers’ comment is well taken. We have tried extensively to search for such a mutation but without success. In fact, the initial idea of generating the △476-480 deletion mutant of IE1-CTD was to see the effect of its interaction with α1 of H2B. As it’s shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the deletion mutant displayed a weakened but still robust interaction with NCP. The next obvious mutation was with Gln44 of H2B, which makes a hydrogen bond with a mainchain carbonyl Thr480. However, Gln44 forms the left bank of zone III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) that hosts the binding of both His481 of IE1 and Thr14 of LANA, both of with interact with Gln44 via van der Waals contacts. Hence, mutating this residue is unlikely to affect the interaction of one but not the other with NCP. So far, the H2A E56R mutation is the best we can do, although we haven't completely given up the hope to find such a mutation, possibly also by searching for mutations that affect the interaction between LANA and NCP but not that between IE1 and NCP. Nevertheless, this will be a separate, future work.</p><p><italic>3) Fang et al. report the purification of the full-length hCMV IE1 protein and use the full-length protein in their analytical ultracentrifugation experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Unfortunately, they do not include the full-length IE1 in their ITC measurements. Inclusion of full-length IE1 in the ITC measurements would facilitate comparison of affinities with their respective effects in 30-nm chromatin fiber modulation. This should be done.</italic> </p><p>We have now measured the NCP binding affinity of full-length IE1 by ITC, and result is included as a supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) in the revised manuscript. The full-length protein alone appeared to misbehave at a low salt concentration (50 mM NaCl) at which ITC measurements for IE1-CTD peptide were performed. To overcome this problem, we performed a new set of ITC experiments with samples including the full-length IE1, IE1-CTD and IE1 lacking CTD at 150 mM salt concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). At this salt concentration, the Kd for IE1-CTD is 2.25 mM, compared to 0.42 mM at 50 mM NaCl, and the Kd for full-length IE1 is 11.33 mM, approximately 5-fold lower than that of IE1-CTD measured at the same salt concentration. IE1 lacking CTD showed no detectable bindings. The lowed NCP binding affinity of full-length could be due to the interference of the extra domains of the full-length protein, and its value relative to that of IE1-CTD is on a par with its behavior in AUC with chromatin fiber.</p><p><italic>4) Several issues about the analytical ultracentrifugation experiments have to be addressed. The authors do not provide an explanation of what the observed difference (between 51.5 S and 48 S) means. Isn't 48 S representative of a condensed chromatin as well? 12_177_601 array in presence of H1 sedimented at 46.6 S in their 2014 Science paper. Where does the discrepancy come from? The statement in paragraph four, Results and Discussion, is not accurate. The mutants only have some moderate 'effect'. At what concentration was this experiment done? Above or below the Kd? As it stands, the effects of the peptide on higher order structure may be over-interpreted, or not significant at all. Further, the authors have to include careful quality control for their 12mer array to check for saturation</italic> – <italic>e.g., by EcoRV digestion. This is especially important for arrays with H1. These issues with the AUC experiments must be clarified before publication can be considered.</italic> </p><p>For the issues concerning the sedimentation coefficient, a change of the S-value from 51.5 to 48 by the addition of IE1-CTD indicates that either the molecular weight or the transverse dimension of the sample becomes smaller. It cannot be the first scenario because the binding of IE1-CTD, no matter how small the molecular weight of this peptide, will increase the molecular weight of the sample. And the concentration of IE1-CTD used was 1.2 μM, at a peptide/protein to NCP molar ratio of 5, and approximately 3 times above the Kd value (0.4 μM measured at 50 mM NaCl concentration), and AUC experiments were performed using a buffer without salt, which should make the binding of IE1-CTD to chromatin even stronger. A simple and natural interpretation of the data is the second scenario, in which case the transverse dimension of the chromatin fiber becomes smaller, which is inevitably accompanied by the extension of the longitudinal dimension of the chromatin fiber. Hence, the decrease of the S-value is indicative of a “decondensed” chromatin fiber. Obviously, an S-value of 48 does not correspond to the fully stretched 10-nm nucleosomal array, nevertheless, it is a significant deviation from the fully compacted 30-nm fiber, possibly representing an intermediate state between the two. At present, the molecular details of the intermediate state remain unknown, and we are pursuing single-molecular studies to find out more clues. However, this will be a separate body of work, and we hope to be able to report progress in the near future.</p><p>For AUC measurements of 30-nm chromatin fiber, the S values may vary to some extent in different sets of experiments, depending on factors such as the length of DNA repeats, saturation level of the nucleosomal array, batches of purified H1 and batches of nucleosomal array reconstituted. It is our belief that the difference of S-values in the same set of experiments using same batch of reagents is more meaningful than the specific values. Our reconstituted nucleosomal arrays and chromatin fibers are all carefully quality-controlled by both MNase digestion and EM analysis. As shown in the newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, the nucleosomal arrays used for reconstituting the 30-nm fiber have nearly identical nucleosome density with &gt; 90% saturation, and they exhibit an extended beads-on-a-string conformation prior to the addition of H1.</p><p>In summary, we have added more details about the AUC experiments in the Materials &amp; methods section, included an explanation of the S-value changes in the main text, and provided the results of MNase digestion and EM analysis of the reconstituted nucleosomal arrays according to the reviewers’ suggestions in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
