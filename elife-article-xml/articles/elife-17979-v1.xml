While dendritic cells (DCs) are important for T follicular helper (Tfh) cell priming, how this process is regulated in vivo is unclear. We show here that the depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs specifically enhanced the development of Tfh cells, germinal center B cells and antibody responses against protein antigens. Exaggerated antibody responses in mice depleted of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs occurred in the absence of any adjuvants, and resulting antibodies had broader specificity and higher affinity to the immunogen. CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs express high levels of PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Blocking PD-1 or PD-L1 during priming in wild-type mice partially mimicked the phenotype of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC-depleted animals, suggesting their role in Tfh suppression. Transient depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC results in the generation of autoreactive IgG responses.

Molecules called antibodies are a key component of most immune responses because they can bind to invading microbes and either neutralize them or mark them for destruction by immune cells. In autoimmune diseases, antibodies may also target the body’s own cells, with the result that the immune system mistakenly attacks tissues and organs.</p><p>Immune cells called T follicular helper cells activate the cells that produce antibodies, the B cells. The T follicular helper cells are themselves activated by other cells called dendritic cells, but there are many types of dendritic cells that activate a range of different immune cells. It was not clear whether there are types of dendritic cell that specifically activate – or suppress – the responses of T follicular helper cells.</p><p>To investigate this issue, Kumamoto et al. studied both normal mice and mice in which the particular types of dendritic cell can be depleted. The investigation revealed that dendritic cells that produce a protein called CD301b suppress the activity of T follicular helper cells. In mice with few CD301b-producing dendritic cells, the activity of the T follicular helper cells was higher than in normal mice, resulting in the hyperactivation of the B cells. This also led to the antibodies behaving in exaggerated ways, as can occur in autoimmune diseases. Other experiments that depleted some other types of dendritic cell – but not those that produce CD301b – completely abolished the antibody response of the mice.</p><p>Future experiments are now needed to investigate exactly how the CD301b-producing dendritic cells block the activity of T follicular helper cells. Exploiting this mechanism could help to design treatments for autoimmune diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17979.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17979.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>antibody</kwd><kwd>dendritic cells</kwd><kwd>immunoregulation</kwd><kwd>Tfh</kwd><kwd>germinal center</kwd><kwd>autoimmunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI054359</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iwasaki</surname><given-names>Akiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI062428</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iwasaki</surname><given-names>Akiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AR067187</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>Daniel H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 AR053495</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iwasaki</surname><given-names>Akiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007263</institution-id><institution>Astellas Foundation for Research on Metabolic Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Metabolic Disorders fellow</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumamoto</surname><given-names>Yosuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006483</institution-id><institution>AbbVie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AbbVie-Yale Collaboration</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iwasaki</surname><given-names>Akiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CD301b dendritic cells potently suppress antibody responses by limiting the activity of follicular helper T cells and germinal center B cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protective adaptive immunity relies on cellular and humoral immune responses. Through presenting processed antigens on their MHC molecules, dendritic cells (DCs) are primarily responsible for initiating T cell-mediated cellular immunity, which is also required for T cell-dependent antibody responses. Germinal centers (GCs) are specialized microarchitecture within the follicles in the secondary lymphoid organs, where B cells undergo affinity maturation, selection and proliferation. Follicular helper T cells (Tfh) are a subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells marked by their expression of inhibitory receptor PD-1 and chemokine receptor CXCR5 and play important roles in the development of GC B cells by providing differentiation, survival and proliferation signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crotty, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). While co-maturation between GC B cells and Tfh is required to stably maintain both subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumjohann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deenick et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qi et al., 2008</xref>), it has been shown that early instructive signals from antigen-bearing DCs are both necessary and sufficient to prime Tfh differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baumjohann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deenick et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goenka et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>For the development of antibody responses, DCs not only promote Tfh differentiation but also directly support B cell survival and class-switching through their expression of B cell stimulatory ligands such as BAFF and APRIL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">MacLennan and Vinuesa, 2002</xref>). Moreover, DCs are also important as antigen carriers that provide the initial antigen-specific receptor signaling to the cognate B cells in the lymph nodes (LNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qi et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, in vivo antigen delivery to receptors specifically expressed by DCs can trigger robust class-switched antibody production even without an adjuvant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chappell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu and Banchereau, 2014</xref>). Importantly, antigen delivery strategies targeting distinct DC subsets seem to result in increased antigen-specific antibody titers regardless of the DC subset targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lahoud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that multiple DC subsets are capable of inducing antibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chappell et al., 2014</xref>). However, the regulatory mechanism that counteracts the ability of DCs to induce humoral responses is less well understood.</p><p>In mouse skin, there are at least three distinct skin-resident DC subsets at the steady-state including epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs), Langerin<sup>+</sup> CD103<sup>+</sup> dermal DCs (DDCs) and Langerin<sup>-</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> DDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaplan et al., 2012</xref>). CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs are a major subset of migratory CD11b<sup>+</sup> DDCs that express the highest levels of PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, among DC subsets in the skin-draining LNs (dLNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumamoto et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murakami et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to the dermis, CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs are found in the submucosa of gastrointestinal, respiratory and reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denda-Nagai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumamoto et al., 2013</xref>). By using Mgl2-DTR mice in which one of the endogenous <italic>Mgl2</italic> alleles (encoding CD301b protein) are replaced with a diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR)-GFP cassette, we have shown previously that inducible depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs by injecting diphtheria toxin (DT) results in impaired Th2 differentiation of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells following footpad immunization of protein antigen with Th2 adjuvants as well as after subcutaneous infection with <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic>. Notably, despite the impaired Th2 differentiation, mice that lack CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs developed intact antibody responses against <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumamoto et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, recent studies have expanded the role of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs beyond the Th2 differentiation program, by demonstrating that they are required for IL-17 production from dermal γδT cells following epidermal infection with <italic>Candida albicans,</italic> or from Th17 cells with intranasal infection with <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kashem et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Linehan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe the role of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC in the regulation of humoral immunity. We show that CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC depletion results in a marked increase in Tfh, GC B cell and antibody responses to protein antigens even in the absence of adjuvants. Acute antibody blockade of PD-L1, but not PD-L2, at the time of vaccination enhanced Tfh, GC B and antibody responses in CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC-dependent manner. In addition, transient depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs resulted in the generation of autoreactive antibody responses. Our study reveals a role for CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs in negative control of humoral responses, and has important implications in vaccine design and autoimmunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup>DCs enhances antigen-specific class-switched antibody production in response to type 2 immunogens</title><p>To understand the role of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC on the antibody response, we utilized a model of a single immunization with OVA and papain in the footpad, which by itself induces a minimal antibody response in wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

However, the antibody titers were not elevated when CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs were depleted five days post-immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>).

A possible explanation of these results is that the CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs killed by DT release endogenous materials capable of serving as an adjuvant to stimulate antibody responses to OVA. To test this possibility, we next immunized lethally-irradiated WT mice reconstituted with a 1:1 mixture of WT and Mgl2-DTR bone marrow (BM) cells. In order to avoid any DT-induced adjuvanticity masked by the presence of exogenous adjuvant, we took advantage of the adjuvant-free immunization approach. Although antibody levels in BM chimeric mice were generally lower than in non-irradiated mice, prime (day 0) and 2 boosts (days 14 and 21) with adjuvant-free OVA resulted in significantly increased OVA-specific antibody titers in mice reconstituted only with Mgl2-DTR BM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). In contrast, mice reconstituted with a mixture of WT and Mgl2-DTR yielded minimal antibody production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), indicating that the remaining WT CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs were sufficient to suppress humoral immunity in such BM chimeric mice even if the dying CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs released endogenous adjuvants.

Similarly, depletion of all Langerin<sup>+</sup> DCs (LCs and Langerin<sup>+</sup> CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs) in msLangerin-DTR mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kissenpfennig et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poulin et al., 2007</xref>) had no impact on antibody responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9d</xref>). Nevertheless, DCs in general were required for B cell priming, as class-switched antibodies were completely abolished in CD11c-DTR;Mgl2-DTR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9e</xref>), in which LN-resident DCs were further depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>).

In contrast, the increases in IgG2b responses by the PD-L2 blockade in the absence of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs suggest a role for PD-L2 expressed on CD301b<sup>-</sup> cells in additionally suppressing humoral immunity. It should be noted, however, that the depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs might have maximized the GCB and antibody responses to the point that further treatment with anti-PD-L1 or PD-L2 mAbs was unable to reveal additional enhancement.

Depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC during the first few days of priming leads to an exaggerated Tfh and GC B cell expansion in the dLNs, and a robust increase in systemic isotype switched antigen-specific antibody responses. The enhanced antibody responses did not require any adjuvants, and were observed irrespective of the dose of antigen used. Depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs led to antibodies with high affinity and broader specificity to the immunogen. Depletion of other migrant DC subsets had no impact on antibody responses. Among non-lymphocytes in the LNs, CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs expressed the highest levels of PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Transient blockade of PD-L1 led to increases in Tfh and GC B cell differentiation in the dLN and enhanced antibody responses, only in the presence of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs. Remarkably, transient depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs led to the generation of autoreactive antibodies. Therefore, our data reveal a novel function of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs in negatively regulating antibody responses and preventing autoantibody formation.</p><p>Our results suggest that CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs play a central role in regulating humoral immunity by suppressing Tfh ad GC B cell development. With the exact same immunization protocol, previous studies have shown that CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs are required for differentiation of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into Th2 cells but not for their differentiation into Th1 or Th17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kashem et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumamoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murakami et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that, Tfh and Th2 responses can be uncoupled, with the CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs as the pivotal cell type carrying out suppressive vs. supportive roles, respectively.</p><p>Tfh responses are also regulated by the Tfr cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sage et al., 2013</xref>). We describe a separate mechanism dedicated to suppressing Tfh responses mediated by the CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs. These non-redundant Tfh regulatory mechanisms likely control Tfh responses at distinct stages. CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC-mediated suppression occurs within the first few days of primary immune response, while the Tfr entry into the reactive LN occurs after 7 days of immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sage et al., 2013</xref>). These two phases of Tfh regulation likely provide complementary mechanisms of Tfh control. For instance, Tfr cells are important in producing high affinity antibody responses that are devoid of self-reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pratama and Vinuesa, 2014</xref>). Regulation of Tfh responses at early phases by CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs may be critical in preventing excess antibody responses to foreign and self-antigens, which can lead to host pathology through complement fixation, and deposition of antibody-immune complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rouse and Sehrawat, 2010</xref>). In fact, we detected antinuclear autoantibodies following transient depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs. Future studies are needed to determine the consequence of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC depletion on the development of autoimmune disease.</p><p>CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs are the major subset of CD11b<sup>+</sup> migratory DCs that most efficiently take up the antigen and bring to the dLNs within one day after immunization with papain. In addition, CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs are required for optimal screening and activation of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells within the dLNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumamoto et al., 2013</xref>). Our current study showed that, despite the reduction in the amount of antigen available within the dLNs and the impaired recruitment of naïve lymphocytes to the dLN in the first three days of immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumamoto et al., 2013</xref>), development of Tfh and GC B cells was amplified in the absence of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs. Furthermore, depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs led to antibody production to a soluble antigen even in the absence of adjuvants. Specifically, depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs lifted the suppression on Tfh such that their numbers and percentages increased within the LNs, leading to preferential activation of isotype switched antibody-secreting cells. It is interesting, however, that antibody responses against <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic> in CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC-depleted animals are comparable to WT animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumamoto et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs did not suppress IgG2b antibody generated by strong type 1 immunity induced by high doses of CpG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). These results suggest that pathogens can overcome CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC-dependent suppression of antibody responses, likely through continuous antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumjohann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deenick et al., 2010</xref>) and through engagement of strong inductive signals through pattern recognition receptors including TLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pasare and Medzhitov, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Our study pointed to the role of LN-resident DCs in supporting Tfh-inductive functions, as evidenced by the diminished antibody responses in CD11c-DTR;Mgl2DTR mice but not those depleted of migrant DCs. The DC subset specifically responsible for inducing Tfh remains to be identified. Alternatively, our results suggest the possibility that any DC subset is sufficient to induce Tfh cells in the absence of the negative regulation exerted by CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lahoud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have indicated that the therapeutic effect of PD-L1 blockade in chronic infection by HIV and malaria is mediated in part by inducing more Tfh cells that help B cells to produce pathogen-specific neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cubas et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, continuous blockade as well as genetic deletion of PD-L1 was shown to enhance Tfh and GC B cell expansion upon type 2 immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hams et al., 2011</xref>). In these studies, due to the timing of the PD-L1 blockade (past Tfh priming), activated B cells were the major source for the PD-L1 relevant to the memory Tfh population. In contrast, our results clearly demonstrated that the transient depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs during the priming phase had a significant positive impact on humoral immunity that persisted even after the secondary immunization. Our study shows that the PD-L1 blockade cannot further enhance Tfh and GC B responses when CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs are depleted. Consistently, a recent report demonstrated that neonatal blockade of PD-L1 that is preferentially expressed by CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs in the lung results in exaggerated antibody production later in life during adulthood, suggesting the contribution of a similar DC subset that suppresses humoral immunity through PD-L1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gollwitzer et al., 2014</xref>). As many other cell types express PD-L1 in vivo, dissection of the relative and temporal contributions of PD-L1 in Tfh blockade by specific cell types will require generation of new tools.</p><p>Our results are consistent with an inhibitory role for PD-L1 and/or PD-L2 for antibody responses described in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ishiwata et al., 2010</xref>), but not in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Good-Jacobson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sage et al., 2013</xref>). For instance, GC B cell and IgG1 induction in response to NP-CGG immunization in PD-1 knockout mice are comparable or even slightly better than WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Good-Jacobson et al., 2010</xref>), consistent with our data. In contrast, the PD-1 deficient mice contain higher percentages of Tfr but not Tfh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sage et al., 2013</xref>), and Tfh cells isolated from PD-1 deficient mice had impaired cytokine responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Good-Jacobson et al., 2010</xref>). Differences observed in our study versus others using genetically deficient mice might be explained by the fact that we used transient blockade of PD-1 ligands with mAbs. However, since PD-1-independent mechanism is also possible, the precise mechanism by which CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs regulate GC B needs to be elucidated in future studies.</p><p>Autoreactive antibody responses are controlled at the level of the bone marrow in developing B cells (central tolerance) as well as at the level of the peripheral tissues (peripheral tolerance). Autoreactive early immature B cells recognizing self-antigens are eliminated in the BM in a cell-intrinsic manner. Once in the periphery, mature B cells that react against autoantigens are suppressed by regulatory T cells (Tregs) in a cell-extrinsic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meffre and Wardemann, 2008</xref>). In the current study, we show an additional mechanism for keeping autoreactive antibodies under control that is mediated by the CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs. Based on our analysis of protein antigen immunization in the absence of adjuvants, we believe that the loss of B cell tolerance may be due to the emergence of self-reactive Tfh cells in CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC-depleted mice. Future studies are needed to determine whether such self-reactive Tfh cells are normally suppressed by CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs through direct interaction via PD-1:PD-L1, or through an indirect pathway involving Tregs, and whether depletion of other DC subsets results in the development of autoreactive antibodies.</p><p>The results of our current study have important implications on vaccine designs and on the treatment of autoimmune diseases. For example, autoimmune diseases driven by hyperstimulation of B cells, such as SLE, might benefit from enhancing the function of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs and its suppressive mechanisms. For such therapy to be efficacious, CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs must be able to reverse a preexisting state of B cell stimulation. On the other hand, inhibiting the functions of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs and/or PD-1 ligands at the time of vaccination may improve the efficacy of a suboptimal vaccine to generate robust isotype-switched immunoglobulin responses. Our data showed that PD-L1 blockade could be delivered transiently at the time of vaccination, alleviating concerns of untoward consequences of long term inhibition of PD-1 engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brahmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Topalian et al., 2012</xref>). While PD-L1 blockade with an antibody is not a practical solution to boost prophylactic vaccine approaches due to the inhibitory costs associated with the antibody, future development of an affordable PD-L1 antagonist might enable implementation of this concept into vaccine design. An optimal combination of the adjuvant to activate B cell affinity maturation and a blocker of inhibition imposed by the CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC may provide an ideal setting for generating robust protective humoral responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>WT C57BL/6N (B6) and CD45.1 (B6.SJL-<italic>Ptprc<sup>a</sup>Pepc<sup>b</sup></italic>/BoyJ) OT-II mice were maintained in our specific pathogen-free facility. <italic>Mgl2<sup>DTReGFP/DTReGFP</sup></italic> mice (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5510785">MGI:5510785</ext-link>) were developed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumamoto et al., 2013</xref>) and bred with B6 mice to gain heterozygotic Mgl2-DTR mice (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5510786">MGI:5510786</ext-link>). huLangerin-DTR mice were bred with B6 or <italic>Mgl2<sup>DTReGFP/DTReGFP</sup></italic>homozygotes.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three referees found the data showing substantial increases in Tfh cellularity, GC B cell generation and antibody production following depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC and after immunization with a diverse set of antigens and adjuvants to be very intriguing and potentially of high significance. The existence of a cellular mechanism that actively suppresses the production of a high-titer/high-affinity antibody response is clearly an interesting finding. However, several important concerns were raised that need to be addressed in a revised paper before the work can be accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential issues that must be addressed:</p><p>1) A key issue is connecting and reconciling the current data with an earlier study by the same authors (Kumamoto, Immunity 2013). In this earlier manuscript the authors described a nearly complete abolishment of IL-4 production by CD4 T cells in LN and spleens after CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC depletion and OVA+papain immunization. Given that IgE and IgG1 antibody class-switching is generally accepted to be IL-4 dependent, the current description of substantial increases in such antibody isotypes is difficult to reconcile with the previously published data. A more substantial effort is thus required to consolidate the two findings and explain how one generates type-2 antibody responses in absence of type-2 cellular immunity. For example, is there a substantial increase in IL-4 production from non-T cell sources (i.e. basophils, mast cells) after DC depletion? Is there an increase in IL-21 production that is capable of substituting for lack of IL-4? Are other non type-2 antibodies, such as IgG2a, IgG3 also increased? The 2013 manuscript demonstrated substantial increases in frequency of IFNγ producing cells, which would in principle skew the humoral response towards these antibody subclasses. In this regard, it would be helpful to demonstrate intracellular IL-4 and IFNγ cytokine levels after ex vivo restimulation on the non-Tfh, Tfh and GC-Tfh phenotype CD4 T cells following immunization in this depletion model.</p><p>2) The authors go through considerable effort to show that this phenomenon is specific to depletion of the CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC population, and is not a simple artifact of cell death due to DT treatment. However, a possibility remains that modulation of Ab production in these mice is due to an off target effect of DT injection through the depletion of a DC-independent Mgl2+ population. Can the authors provide a detailed description of the composition of macrophages and DC in the skin DLN and non-DLN and peritoneal cavity of Mgl2+-DTR mice treated with DT or PBS? These data should be added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. It would also be instructive to compare directly ex-vivo the capacity of OVA-pulsed Mgl2+ and Mgl2- cutaneous DC to promote Tfh differentiation and expansion.</p><p>3) Technically, the least convincing section of the manuscript is the attribution of DC inhibition of antibody responses to the PD-1 pathway. This is based primarily on the proposed absence of an additive effect between CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC depletion and anti-PDL1/2 treatment. This is somewhat problematic, for the following reasons:</p><p>First, although anti-PDL-1 does not appear to have an additive effect over DC depletion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9C and F</xref> show increases in GC/antibody responses with anti-PDL2 treatment (although the comparison in 9C does not reach statistical significance with the small N provided, but this does not mean that there's no difference).</p><p>Second, how sure are the authors that anti-PDL1 antibody treatment does not lead to depletion of CD301+DCs? Is this population still there after treatment? Also, do the authors obtain the same effects by blocking with an anti-PD-1 antibody? Anti PD-1 treatment is mentioned in the methods but does not seem to be discussed in the main text.</p><p>Third, even if PD-L1/2 antibodies do not deplete CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs, the absence of an additive effect for blocking PD-1 ligands does not necessarily mean this is their mechanism of action – it could well be that DC depletion alone already increases the response to a level that is too high for any effects of PD-1 ligand blocking to be noticeable.</p><p>Here again assessing the contribution of PDL-1 and PDL1 to Mgl2+ DC modulation of Tfh expansion ex vivo should be informative.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;CCD301b<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells suppress T follicular helper cells and antibody responses to protein antigens&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The new dataset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> demonstrating increased frequency of IL-4/IL-21-producing TfH should show how the placement of the gates for cytokine-positive cells were determined (isotype or naive control plots would help).</p><p>2) The new dataset on autoantibody production presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is very interesting. It would be helpful to know whether such effects are specifically due to the CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC depletion or to DC death in general, and would be observed in a DT-treated Langerin-DTR system, as an example.</p><p>3) Please indicate whether the OVA used for these studies was endotoxin-free. Although not significantly altering the major findings of the manuscript, this would be important for the conclusions reached for the adjuvant-free studies.</p><p>4) The finding that DT injection leads to substantial accumulation of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells in the peritoneum suggests that DT leads to inflammatory events that could have triggered increased myelopoiesis or promoted the release of myeloid cells which in turn could have contributed to the dysregulated immune response. This should be mentioned by the authors in the Discussion.</p><p>5) The authors have not addressed concerns regarding the contribution of PDL1 in CD103b<sup>+</sup> DC-mediated control of Tfh and B cell response. Please remove strong claims regarding the potential role of PDL-1 from the Abstract and modulate their claim in this regard in the Results and Discussion sections.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17979.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential issues that must be addressed:</italic></p><p><italic>1) A key issue is connecting and reconciling the current data with an earlier study by the same authors (Kumamoto, Immunity 2013).

Instead, to our excitement, even though the Th2 responses was reduced (consistent with our study in 2013), we found that the Tfh cells generated in the absence of CD301b DCs produce intact levels of IL-4 and IL-21 (comparable to the undepleted mice). In addition, there were a lot more Tfh cells in the CD301b-depleted mice. We believe that the combination of the increase in the number of Tfh, as well as their robust secretion of IL-4 and IL-21, explains why the CD301b-depleted mice are capable of generating the type 2 antibody responses including IgE and IgG1.

We believe this explains why the humoral responses are skewed towards the “type 2” antibody classes.</p><p><italic>2) The authors go through considerable effort to show that this phenomenon is specific to depletion of the CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC population, and is not a simple artifact of cell death due to DT treatment. However, a possibility remains that modulation of Ab production in these mice is due to an off target effect of DT injection through the depletion of a DC-independent Mgl2+ population. Can the authors provide a detailed description of the composition of macrophages and DC in the skin DLN and non-DLN and peritoneal cavity of Mgl2+-DTR mice treated with DT or PBS? These data should be added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</italic></p><p>We have examined the macrophage and DC composition in the skin dLN and ndLN and peritoneal cavity of the Mgl2-DTR mice treated with DT or PBS. These results showed a clear depletion of the CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs in DT treated mice, and an increase in the Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells in the peritoneum. We also added new data on the phenotype of CD301b<sup>+</sup> cells in the LNs and the peritoneal cavity, showing that they express a conventional DC-specific transcription factor Zbtb46. We have now added these results to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>It would also be instructive to compare directly ex-vivo the capacity of OVA-pulsed Mgl2+ and Mgl2- cutaneous DC to promote Tfh differentiation and expansion.</italic></p><p>We have attempted, several times, to establish an in vitro co-culture system to promote Tfh differentiation and expansion. There is one paper published Shin et al. (Cell Rep, 11:1929), which shows that Tfh can be generated in vitro. We have tried to reproduce their data and to adopt this system to study Tfh in vitro but were unable to do so. Ours is not an isolated failure, as there have never been a reported successful in vitro Tfh culture or DC-Tfh differentiation system using mice. For us to develop a de novo DC-Tfh culture system would require a lot of resource and time, and we consider such endeavor to be a separate project from this current study.</p><p><italic>3) Technically, the least convincing section of the manuscript is the attribution of DC inhibition of antibody responses to the PD-1 pathway. This is based primarily on the proposed absence of an additive effect between CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC depletion and anti-PDL1/2 treatment. This is somewhat problematic, for the following reasons:</italic></p><p><italic>First, although anti-PDL-1 does not appear to have an additive effect over DC depletion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9C and F</xref> show increases in GC/antibody responses with anti-PDL2 treatment (although the comparison in 9C does not reach statistical significance with the small N provided, but this does not mean that there's no difference).</italic></p><p>We agree that the GC B cell frequency is slightly elevated in couple of mice in the group that were CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC-depleted and treated with anti-PDL2 antibody. However, the differences were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). As the referees point out, there is a slightly elevated IgG2b, but not IgG1, in anti-PDL2 treated CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC-depleted animals shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>. Since PDL2 expression on the remainingDCs was not affected by the depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref>), these data suggest that the residual PDL2+ cells play suppressive role on IgG2b production and possibly on GC B cell expansion in a PDL2-dependent manner. We now discuss these possibilities in the second paragraph of the subsection “PD-L1 blockade enhances expansion of Tfh and GC B cells only in the presence of CD301b<sup>+</sup> 328 DCs”.</p><p><italic>Second, how sure are the authors that anti-PDL1 antibody treatment does not lead to depletion of CD301+DCs? Is this population still there after treatment? Also, do the authors obtain the same effects by blocking with an anti-PD-1 antibody? Anti PD-1 treatment is mentioned in the methods but does not seem to be discussed in the main text.</italic></p><p>We have examined whether anti-PDL1 or anti-PDL2 treatment depletes CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs. Our data clearly show that neither of these antibodies led to the depletion of the CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs. We have included these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1B</xref>. We also have examined whether blocking PD-1 in WT mice mimics the enhanced antibody production observed in Mgl2-DTR mice. Although previous reports show controversial results on the role of PD-1 in humoral immunity (discussed in the second paragraph of the subsection “PD-L1 blockade enhances expansion of Tfh and GC B cells only in the presence of CD301b<sup>+</sup> 328 DCs”), the PD-1 blockade during the priming in our immunization protocol indeed showed enhanced antibody production similar to that observed in Mgl2-DTR mice. The data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2D</xref>.</p><p><italic>Third, even if PD-L1/2 antibodies do not deplete CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs, the absence of an additive effect for blocking PD-1 ligands does not necessarily mean this is their mechanism of action – it could well be that DC depletion alone already increases the response to a level that is too high for any effects of PD-1 ligand blocking to be noticeable.</italic></p><p>Since there are many PD-L1-expressing cells left intact in CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref>), our data indicate that blocking those residual PD-L1 epitopes does not further increase GC B cell responses In addition, we observed a further increase in IgG2b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>) in CD301b<sup>+</sup>DC-depleted animals treated with anti-PD-L2, the data argue against the idea that GC responses were simply maxed out by the depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs alone. As the referees suggest, however, that the depletion of CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs might have elevated the GCB and antibody responses to the point that further treatment with anti-PD-L1 or PD-L2 was unable to reveal additional enhancement, even if they existed. Future studies are needed to selectively knockout PD-L1 or PD-L2 from CD301b<sup>+</sup> DCs in order to clearly address the role of these ligands in suppression of Tfh, GCB and antibody responses. We now included this discussion in the second paragraph of the subsection “PD-L1 blockade enhances expansion of Tfh and GC B cells only in the presence of CD301b<sup>+</sup> 328 DCs”.</p><p><italic>Here again assessing the contribution of PDL-1 and PDL1 to Mgl2+ DC modulation of Tfh expansion</italic> ex vivo <italic>should be informative.</italic></p><p>Please see our discussion about ex vivo Tfh induction above.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as <italic>described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>1) The new dataset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> demonstrating increased frequency of IL-4/IL-21-producing TfH should show how the placement of the gates for cytokine-positive cells were determined (isotype or naive control plots would help).</italic></p><p>We have now added isotype staining control panels for IL-4 and IL-21 staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The new dataset on autoantibody production presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is very interesting. It would be helpful to know whether such effects are specifically due to the CD301b<sup>+</sup> DC depletion or to DC death in general, and would be observed in a DT-treated Langerin-DTR system, as an example.</italic></p><p>While we understand reviewer's concern regarding the potentially non-specific impacts from DC death on autoantibody production, repeating the experiment in Langerin-DTR mice alone will take several more months. Since we show subset specificity of the increased antibodies in the immunization-induced model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), we hope that the referees and the editors would agree to let us proceed without having to include the autoantibody experiment in Langerin-DTR mice. Instead, we now inserted a sentence regarding this issue in the Discussion. However, if the editors deem this point to be absolutely critical to our study, we are open to conducting such experiments.</p><p><italic>3) Please indicate whether the OVA used for these studies was endotoxin-free. Although not significantly altering the major findings of the manuscript, this would be important for the conclusions reached for the adjuvant-free studies.</italic></p><p>We use low-endotoxin OVA (≤1EU/mg) from Worthington. It is now mentioned in the Immunization section in the Methods.</p><p><italic>4) The finding that DT injection leads to substantial accumulation of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells in the peritoneum suggests that DT leads to inflammatory events that could have triggered increased myelopoiesis or promoted the release of myeloid cells which in turn could have contributed to the dysregulated immune response. This should be mentioned by the authors in the Discussion.</italic></p><p>Although we cannot eliminate possibilities of potential side effects that might affect the immune response, we have experimentally excluded the contribution of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1D</xref>. We have also added a statement to emphasize this fact in the subsection “LN-resident, but not migratory, DCs promote Tfh, GC B and antibody responses”.</p><p><italic>5) The authors have not addressed concerns regarding the contribution of PDL1 in CD103b+ DC-mediated control of Tfh and B cell response. Please remove strong claims regarding the potential role of PDL-1 from the Abstract and modulate their claim in this regard in the Results and Discussion sections.</italic></p><p>We modified the Abstract and deleted &quot;possibly through PD-L1&quot; from the Results. We also modified our statement in the Discussion (sixth paragraph) and also mentioned the possibility of PD-1-independent mechanism (seventh paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
