One challenge in testing the numerous hypotheses about serotonin's function has been observing the activity of identified serotonergic neurons in animals engaged in behavioral tasks. We recorded the activity of dorsal raphe neurons while mice experienced a task in which rewards and punishments varied across blocks of trials. We ‘tagged’ serotonergic neurons with the light-sensitive protein channelrhodopsin-2 and identified them based on their responses to light. We found three main features of serotonergic neuron activity: (1) a large fraction of serotonergic neurons modulated their tonic firing rates over the course of minutes during reward vs punishment blocks; (2) most were phasically excited by punishments; and (3) a subset was phasically excited by reward-predicting cues. By contrast, dopaminergic neurons did not show firing rate changes across blocks of trials. These results suggest that serotonergic neurons signal information about reward and punishment on multiple timescales.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06346.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06346.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06346.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Rewards and punishments can both encourage animals to change their immediate behavior and influence their mood over a longer term, particularly when given repeatedly. A region of the brain that increases its activity in response to rewards and punishments also contains many neurons that communicate with each other by releasing a chemical called serotonin. This chemical is commonly thought to produce feelings of happiness; however, it remains unclear exactly how these particular ‘serotonergic’ neurons help to process rewards and punishments.</p><p>The ideal way to work out the role that a type of neuron plays in a behavior is to measure its electrical activity as the behavior is being performed. However, it is difficult to distinguish the activity of serotonergic neurons from the activity of the non-serotonergic neurons around them. To overcome this problem, Cohen et al. used viruses to force serotonergic neurons to make a type of ion channel that produces electrical currents in response to light. Shining light on these neurons via optical fibers and then measuring the neurons' responses helped to develop criteria that can identify which responses are generated by the serotonergic neurons.</p><p>Cohen et al. then recorded the activity of serotonergic neurons in thirsty mice as they experienced a series of rewards (for example, a drop of water) or punishments (such as a puff of air to the eye). Each reward or punishment was preceded by a distinct odor, so that the mice learned to anticipate what was coming.</p><p>These experiments revealed that serotonergic neurons respond to rewards and punishments by changing two aspects of their electrical activity: by producing short bursts of high activity, and by altering their baseline activity. Some of the serotonergic neurons fired rapidly in response to punishments, but not rewards; others fired rapidly when the mice detected a scent that meant that a reward was about to be given. The average level of reward or punishment the mice received also affected the baseline activity of many of the serotonergic neurons; this effect lasted for several minutes.</p><p>Overall, Cohen et al. suggest that serotonergic neurons can affect how mice respond to rewards or punishments in both the short and long term. Future experiments should aim to understand the diversity of the signals that Cohen et al. observed, and to determine how these signals are used to drive behavior. Ultimately, understanding how neural circuits made up of different types of cells work may aid in understanding the neural basis of behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06346.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06346.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neurophysiology</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>punishment</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>serotonin</kwd><kwd>dorsal raphe</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation (HHWF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HHMI Fellowship from the HHWF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Jeremiah Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HHMI Fellowship from the HHWF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Jeremiah Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amoroso</surname><given-names>Mackenzie W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH095953</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uchida</surname><given-names>Naoshige</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH101207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uchida</surname><given-names>Naoshige</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Serotonin-releasing neurons show tonic firing-rate changes correlating with global reward value in addition to phasic firing-rate changes correlating with local task events.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reward and punishment play critical roles in shaping animal behavior over short and long timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Rolls, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Somerville et al., 2013</xref>). On short timescales, moment-to-moment expectations of reward or punishment increase or decrease motivation to perform a specific action associated with the reward or punishment. On long timescales, repeated exposure to reward or punishment can elicit long-lasting positive or negative emotional states (often called ‘mood’), that can increase or decrease the frequency of performing reward-seeking actions more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Niv et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cools et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Somerville et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The midbrain raphe nuclei contain the majority of forebrain-projecting serotonergic neurons in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jacobs and Azmitia, 1992</xref>). This small population of neurons (approximately 9000 in the mouse dorsal raphe; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ishimura et al., 1988</xref>) projects to almost the entire forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azmitia and Segal, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Moore et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Steinbusch, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">O'Hearn and Molliver, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Vertes, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gagnon and Parent, 2014</xref>). The diffuse projection targets of the serotonergic system have led to many theories about its function.</p><p>Serotonin has been proposed to be involved in processing reward and punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Maswood et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Daw et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Maier and Watkins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nakamura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Tops et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cools et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amo et al., 2014</xref>). One theory proposes that serotonin regulates aversive learning and negative motivation in response to punishments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Soubrié, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Deakin and Graeff, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Daw et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dayan and Huys, 2009</xref>). According to this theory, serotonin opposes the positive reinforcement and behavioral activation regulated by dopamine. Whereas dopaminergic neurons signal appetitive prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>), serotonergic neurons could signal punishments, thereby adjusting future behavior to avoid those punishments or inhibiting specific actions that are associated with punishments. This theory has support from lesion, stimulation, tryptophan depletion, and pharmacological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Tye et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Graeff and Silveira Filho, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Liu and Ikemoto, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Crockett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Shin and Ikemoto, 2010</xref>), but there is little evidence that serotonergic neurons signal punishments in awake animals (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aghajanian et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Montagne-Clavel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Schweimer and Ungless, 2010</xref>).</p><p>A second theory proposes that serotonin signals global reward states, such as tracking average reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Daw et al., 2002</xref>) and modulating mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Savitz et al., 2009</xref>). Here, serotonin is thought to provide its diffuse targets with long-term signals about the value of the environment, which, at the extreme, is correlated with changes in mood. These long-term signals inhibit behavior or increase the vigor of taking actions in a relatively action-general manner. This theory has support from clinical observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fava and Kendler, 2000</xref>) and genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Donaldson et al., 2013</xref>). However, there is little neurophysiological evidence for such a function.</p><p>A third theory proposes that serotonin is involved in waiting for reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miyazaki et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>). In this theory, activation of serotonergic neurons promotes patience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Miyazaki et al., 2014</xref>) or slows movements that allow an animal to wait for a delayed reward. This theory could explain how waiting for reward could be linked to behavioral inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Soubrié, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Clarifying whether and how serotonin exerts these functions requires understanding how serotonergic neuron firing correlates with both global features of the environment, such as changes in average reward value, and with punishments. These data have been challenging to collect because of the heterogeneity of neurons in and around the raphe nuclei. About two-thirds of dorsal raphe neurons are serotonergic, but others contain GABA, glutamate, dopamine, acetylcholine, or various peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hökfelt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Commons, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hioki et al., 2010</xref>). Many previous studies have relied on spike waveform characteristics to identify serotonergic neurons in extracellular recordings. This approach may lead to false positives and misses, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allers and Sharp, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kirby et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Marinelli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Urbain et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hajós et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schweimer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Given this chemical diversity and the difficulty of identifying neuron types in extracellular recordings, it would be unsurprising to find corresponding physiological diversity. Indeed, previous studies found significant heterogeneity in the activity of dorsal raphe neurons in relation to behavioral tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Fornal et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nakamura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miyazaki et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Inaba et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Li et al., 2013</xref>). One set of experiments demonstrated that dorsal raphe neurons fired in a reward-value-dependent manner during trials of a saccade-to-target task, but that the modulation disappeared before the next trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nakamura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>). Another set of experiments showed tonic firing rate modulations correlating with waiting for reward from putative dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miyazaki et al., 2011a</xref>). These studies suggested that serotonergic neurons signal reward expectation or waiting time (or patience) on the scale of hundreds of milliseconds, but does not determine whether serotonin could be involved in longer-term changes in value.</p><p>In the present study, we sought to test whether dorsal raphe serotonergic neuron firing correlated with rewards and punishments on different timescales. To address this question, we used a task in which reward value changed on slow and fast timescales. Importantly, we recorded from optogenetically-identified serotonergic neurons. Our results show that serotonergic neurons signal information about reward and punishment across multiple timescales.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral task</title><p>We classically conditioned head-fixed, thirsty mice with different odor cues that predicted a reward (water), neutral outcome (nothing), or punishment (a puff of air delivered to the animal's face; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). Each behavioral trial began with a conditioned stimulus (CS; an odor, 1 s), followed by a 1-s delay and an unconditioned stimulus (US; the outcome; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Mice licked toward the water-delivery tube in the delay period before rewards arrived, but not during neutral or punishment trials, indicating that they had learned the CS-US associations (analysis of variance (ANOVA), t-tests, p &lt; 0.001 for each session; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We varied the structure of the task so that animals received blocks of 10 reward trials, alternating with 10 punishment trials, with a tone indicating transitions between blocks (or, in 35% of sessions, block order was random; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; block duration mean ± S.D., 1.36 ± 0.30 min). Mice licked significantly more during the tone preceding reward vs punishment blocks.

In each block of some sessions, the reward or punishment trial was replaced by a neutral trial with probability 0.1. To ensure that the time of onset of each trial could not be predicted following the end of the previous one, we used an exponentially-distributed (flat hazard rate) inter-trial interval (ITI). The ITIs lasted, on average, longer than twice the duration of trials (ITI, 6.41 ± 1.88 s, mean ± S.D.). Using this task, we could study neuronal responses on fast (CS and US) and slow (across blocks) timescales.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06346.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral task.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of individual trials.

We expressed channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a light-gated cation channel, in serotonergic neurons by injecting an adeno-associated virus containing FLEX-ChR2 (AAV5-EF1α-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP-WPRE-pA) into the dorsal raphe of transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the promoter of the serotonin transporter gene (<italic>Slc6a4</italic>; <italic>Sert</italic>-Cre mice).

Second, to ensure that the neuron under observation, rather than a population of nearby ChR2-expressing serotonergic neurons, responded to light stimulation, we verified that the response to light stimulation matched the shape of spontaneous spikes. We calculated the distance between the spontaneous spike waveform and light-evoked voltage response and plotted it against the energy of light-evoked response for each recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Using an expectation-maximization clustering method, we observed two distinct clusters: one that showed significant responses to light pulses and one that did not. 29 neurons fell into the former cluster (filled cyan points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Three points in that cluster were not considered identified serotonergic neurons because they did not reliably respond to light stimulation. Consistent with direct light activation rather than indirect synaptic activation, all 29 neurons showed fast light-evoked spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and followed high-frequency stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>).

We observed three main features of the firing patterns of serotonergic neurons. First, a large fraction (41%) of serotonergic neurons fired at a higher or lower rate during the ITIs of reward blocks vs punishment blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). That is, even before a particular trial began, these neurons fired at a rate that correlated with the value (reward vs punishment) of the block. Remarkably, this response persisted across minutes. To quantify this observation, we calculated the firing rate in the 2 s before the start of each trial during reward and punishment blocks. 12 of 29 serotonergic neurons showed significantly different pre-trial firing rates between reward and punishment blocks: 7 were more excited during reward blocks, 5 were more excited during punishment blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>; Wilcoxon rank sum tests, p &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, this tonic signal appeared to build up or down slowly within blocks, rather than sharply increasing or decreasing in response to block transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This tonic signal did not depend on the duration of ITIs (Wilcoxon rank sum tests, all p &gt; 0.3).

We asked whether responses across blocks were truly value-related, or, rather, due to differences in responses to the different sensory modalities for reward and punishment (gustatory vs somatosensory). We performed two experiments to address this. We recorded from 13 additional identified serotonergic neurons in which blocks contained trials with one of three reward sizes: zero, small (1 µl), or big (4 µl; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). If pre-trial, tonic responses are value-related, they should vary monotonically with reward size. Indeed, for each of the 13 neurons, firing rates were either strictly increasing (5 neurons) or strictly decreasing (8 neurons) with reward size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; Tukey's Honest Significant Difference tests, p &gt; 0.05). Next, we recorded from 21 additional identified serotonergic neurons (4 mice, 5.3 ± 1.0 neurons per mouse, mean ± S.E.M.) in a similar task with four types of blocks: water or chocolate milk reward, neutral, air-puff punishment, and quinine punishment. Quinine, a bitter-tasting solution, is a punishment of the same sensory modality as a water reward. We found that 8 of these 21 neurons were tonically more (6 neurons) or less (2 neurons) active in water vs quinine blocks, during ITIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). These neurons also showed a positive correlation in their response to the two different punishments, albeit with a weaker response to quinine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This could be due to the longer timecourse or smaller magnitude of the aversiveness of quinine compared to air puffs. Across both experiments, 20 of 50 identified serotonergic neurons showed tonic differences in firing for reward vs punishment blocks of trials. Thus, background firing rate in serotonergic neurons signal value across different magnitudes of reward and different types of punishment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Serotonergic neuron CS responses signal value</title><p>Next, we asked whether serotonergic neurons were value-coding within trials. We compared the firing rates during the CS, rather than US, for two reasons. First, there was no US during neutral trials. Second, outcomes were predicted by the CS, therefore neuronal responses to the US could be confounded by expectation. For each of the 23 serotonergic neurons with sufficient data for this analysis, the CS-induced firing rate as a function of value was monotonic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). As a population, the CS firing rate was larger for reward than punishment (paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>t</italic><sub>22</sub> = 2.6, p &lt; 0.05), larger for reward than neutral (<italic>t</italic><sub>22</sub> = 2.9, p &lt; 0.05), and larger for neutral than punishment (<italic>t</italic><sub>22</sub> = 2.2, p &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>).

These observations showed that serotonergic neurons signal reward and punishment on multiple timescales.</p><p>The dorsal raphe nucleus contains diverse types of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Marinelli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Commons, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hioki et al., 2010</xref>). Although previous recording studies have used indirect methods based on spike shape or firing rate measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Fornal et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miyazaki et al., 2011a</xref>), it has been difficult to separate the responses of serotonergic from non-serotonergic raphe neurons during behavioral tasks. Indeed, our data set of identified serotonergic neurons contained diverse waveforms and firing properties, making it critical to use a more direct method to identify serotonergic neurons. We observed some diversity in the responses of identified serotonergic neurons (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</xref>) but, to describe the full diversity of serotonergic neurons, a larger sample size is required. We thus focused on salient features that were shared by a large fraction of identified serotonergic neurons, which we observed in our sample size of 50 identified serotonergic neurons. In the following, we discuss potential implications of our findings in the context of theories of behavioral regulation and serotonin signaling.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Tonic firing of serotonergic neurons tracks state values</title><p>Reward and punishment can exert their effects on behavior on multiple timescales. It has been proposed that the average reward rate on relatively long timescales (or state value) regulates the vigor of behavioral responding in a manner relatively non-specific to actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Niv et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). However, the neural mechanisms that regulate this process remain unclear. Much attention has been paid to a potential involvement of tonic dopaminergic firing in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Niv et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cools et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to this proposal, we did not find that dopaminergic neurons changed their baseline firing according to state values. Our data showed, instead, that 40% of serotonergic neurons changed their baseline firing depending on the state value of the environment. We observed this effect using rewards and punishments of the same sensory modality, and using brief punishments (air puffs), in which the acute aversiveness likely did not persist into the ITI. These firing rate changes were relatively small in magnitude (around 1–2 spikes s<sup>−1</sup>), but given the low baseline firing rates of serotonergic neurons, these changes corresponded to around 20–100% increases in firing rates, which could have led to substantially higher serotonin release.</p><p>Our data also showed that serotonergic neurons exhibited transient activations associated with various task events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nakamura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</xref>). Serotonergic neuron responses to reward- or punishment-predictive cues as well as reward or punishment were transient, typically lasting less than 500 ms, and relatively small in magnitude (5–10 spikes s<sup>−1</sup>), in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nakamura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miyazaki et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Inaba et al., 2013</xref>), though substantially smaller than a recent one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies observed that dorsal raphe neurons exhibited sustained activities that appeared to track moment-to-moment changes in value triggered by sensory cues and outcomes, within a trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nakamura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>). Although these activities lasted for several hundreds of milliseconds to seconds, our identified serotonergic neurons showed relatively transient activities within trials. In contrast, our data showed that many unidentified neurons showed sustained activities within trials, suggesting that sustained activities may be more common in non-serotonergic neurons. Another recent set of studies found that putative serotonergic neurons showed firing modulations lasting up to several seconds, during a task in which rats waited for a reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miyazaki et al., 2011a</xref>), and that manipulations of serotonergic signaling altered waiting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Miyazaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>). This raises the interesting possibility that both time and reward value modulate the firing of serotonergic neurons, increasing the flexibility of the serotonergic signal. Indeed, the tonic signal we observed could be the subjective value of waiting (i.e., waiting for punishments elicits a low-value state, whereas waiting for rewards elicits a high-value state). A third study found that dorsal raphe neurons, on average, fired at a higher rate before cues that predicted rewards relative to cues that predicted no reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Li et al., 2013</xref>). In this work, trials were also delivered in a block-wise fashion, though it was not possible to identify serotonergic neurons, nor was there an analysis of the slow modulations in firing rate in individual neurons.</p><p>The sign of value-dependent changes in tonic firing varied across serotonergic neurons: some increased and others decreased during periods of high state values although, on average, high-value blocks were associated with higher tonic firing rates. Nevertheless, the topography of projections from the raphe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Imai et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Vertes, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lowry et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chandler et al., 2013</xref>) and the physiological topography within the raphe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lowry et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Crawford et al., 2010</xref>) suggest the potential for a specific mapping between subsets of serotonergic neurons and their functions. Our results cannot distinguish these subpopulations of serotonergic neurons. It remains to be examined whether different firing patterns of serotonergic neurons correspond to specific subpopulations.</p><p>Together, these results suggest that background serotonin could serve as an explicit signal of state values. It is important to note that our data demonstrate a relative value code during the task (blocks of trials of different values), but do not speak to the possibility that serotonergic neurons signal an absolute state value (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). As discussed above, reward and punishment affect behavior on multiple timescales. Our finding that tonic serotonergic firing tracks values over long timescales raises the possibility that tonic serotonin regulates long-lasting affective states.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Dopamine and serotonin do not signal opposite information</title><p>In addition to the changes in tonic firing, our data showed that a large fraction of serotonergic neurons were excited by reward-predictive cues and unpredicted reward on shorter timescales (i.e., within trials). Although there was substantial diversity in serotonergic neuron firing patterns, during reward trials, on average, their response to reward-predicting cues resembled those of dopaminergic neurons signaling reward prediction error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). It is important to note, however, that the magnitude of increases was smaller, and did not appear to signal prediction errors for most neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3D,H, 4I</xref>). In addition, we found that many serotonergic neurons were excited by punishments. It is important to disentangle whether the phasic responses to air puffs we observed are due to aversiveness or other factors such as saliency or relief from punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Heym et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Waterhouse et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dayan and Huys, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cools et al., 2011</xref>). The short response latency suggests that it is unlikely to be relief from punishment, but the nature of phasic air puff responses remains to be clarified. Of course, all of these signals could be expressed by the population of serotonergic neurons. In addition, it will be important to understand why the phasic response to air puffs was stronger than the phasic response to air-puff-predicting cues.</p><p>It has been proposed that serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons work largely in an opponent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Daw et al., 2002</xref>). This idea was supported by pharmacology and intracranial self-stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Redgrave, 1978</xref>), as well as a few recording studies that suggested phasic activations of serotonergic neurons by aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aghajanian et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Montagne-Clavel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Schweimer and Ungless, 2010</xref>). However, in these studies, responses were measured in anesthetized animals or the effect of reward was not examined, leaving unanswered whether phasic serotonin signals purely aversive information. Our data showed that many single serotonin neurons were activated by both reward-predictive cues and punishment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Although it remains unclear whether these phasic firing patterns can be unified to encode a particular variable, or whether the response to punishment was due to its sensory nature or the relief arriving at the end of the punishment, these firing patterns appear to be inconsistent with the idea that serotonergic neurons send an opponent signal compared to dopaminergic neurons, though median raphe serotonergic neurons could provide such a signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Daw et al., 2002</xref>). This lack of pure opponency is consistent with recent studies measuring putative serotonergic firing and serotonin concentration in a waiting task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miyazaki et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">2011b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Multiplexing of signals on multiple timescales</title><p>Our results suggest that serotonergic neurons multiplex information about reward and punishment on multiple timescales. We propose that slow, value-related firing could represent state value, whereas phasic responses to CS or US could encode a different variable. This slow signal appears to require some time to change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Future studies should clarify how downstream neurons read out tonic vs phasic serotonin signals. It is possible that tonic serotonin has very different effects at target neurons and on behavior than phasic serotonin due to receptors with different affinities or other mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Daw et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, serotonergic neurons are known to contain other transmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Varga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that the slow and fast timescales could correspond to the action of different transmitters on target neurons, or to downstream circuit effects with differing durations. The function of serotonin could be target-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Deakin and Graeff, 1991</xref>), timing-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Daw et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dayan and Huys, 2009</xref>), or dependent on co-release of other transmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dayan and Huys, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Varga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">McDevitt et al., 2014</xref>). Another possibility is that serotonin combines with other circuits to form logical combinations postsynaptically (for example, serotonin AND dopamine codes for reward, whereas serotonin AND NOT dopamine codes for punishment).</p><p>How do serotonergic neurons compute the signals over short (hundreds of milliseconds) and long (minutes) timescales? Serotonin release is controlled by many types of afferents. The densest include frontal cortex, basal forebrain areas (bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, substantia innominata, ventral pallidum), hypothalamic nuclei (preoptic nucleus, lateral and posterior nuclei), lateral habenula, and several midbrain and brainstem structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Peyron et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Pollak Dorocic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ogawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Weissbourd et al., 2014</xref>). Neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), some dopaminergic, provide input to raphe serotonergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beckstead et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Pollak Dorocic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ogawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Weissbourd et al., 2014</xref>). These neurons are phasically excited by rewards or reward-predicting cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>), but their activity appears not to correlate with longer-term changes in value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> above; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>). They may excite serotonergic neurons via D2 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Haj-Dahmane, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aman et al., 2007</xref>; but see; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Martín-Ruiz et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, dopaminergic stimulation of putative serotonergic neurons in vitro caused excitation that persisted beyond the application of dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Haj-Dahmane, 2001</xref>). It is possible that serotonergic neurons could accumulate information about rewards via short pulses of input from dopaminergic neurons, although our observation of shorter reward-predicting CS response latencies in serotonergic vs dopaminergic neurons suggests the opposite.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Spike waveform properties of serotonergic neurons</title><p>There are several possible explanations for why we could not use spike width to clearly identify serotonergic neurons.

Second, the shape of extracellulary-recorded spikes depends on the position of the electrode tip to the soma and dendrites of the recorded neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schultz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Harris et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Henze et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buzsáki et al., 2012</xref>). Given that the geometry of dendritic and axonal processes in the dorsal raphe is diverse, with fusiform, multipolar, and ovoid somata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Diaz-Cintra et al., 1981</xref>), it is potentially difficult to optimize the location of electrode tip relative to cell bodies across the population (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schultz, 1986</xref>). Indeed, we did not attempt to optimize this position, once we found an identified serotonergic neuron. Third, our nichrome wires could have introduced recording bias away from small cells or certain cell shapes, potentially less of an issue for glass pipette recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Towe and Harding, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Shoham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">O'Connor et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, in our previous study in the ventral tegmental area, using the same type of electrode, we did not find the oft-reported difference between spike width for dopaminergic vs non-dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). Careful simultaneous intra- and extracellular measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Harris et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Henze et al., 2000</xref>) in the dorsal raphe are needed to resolve this.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Summary</title><p>The present study revealed that serotonergic neurons can use tonic as well as phasic firing to convey reward information. This raises questions as to whether these different modes of firing convey distinct information, whether they have different impacts on target neurons (notably, on dopaminergic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fibiger and Miller, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ogawa et al., 2014</xref>]), and how they are calculated. Although our data likely do not reveal the full diversity of serotonergic neuron firing dynamics, our results suggest distinguishing these distinct modes is crucial to teasing apart the seemingly complex functions of serotonin in various brain functions and disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>For dorsal raphe recordings, we used nine adult male mice, backcrossed with C57BL/6J mice, heterozygous for Cre recombinase under the control of the serotonin transporter gene (Slc6a4<sup>tm1(cre)Xz</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhuang et al., 2005</xref>).

We did not observe any differences between the different genotypes during the behavioral task. For cell counting, we used three additional adult male <italic>Sert</italic>-Cre mice. Animals were housed on a 12 hr dark/12 hr light cycle (dark from 06:00–18:00) and each performed the conditioning task at the same time of day, between 07:00 and 19:00.

During a prior surgery, we injected 200–500 nl adeno-associated virus (AAV), serotype 2/5, using the EF1α promoter, carrying an inverted ChR2 (H134R)-EYFP flanked by double loxP sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nagel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boyden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atasoy et al., 2008</xref>) into the dorsal raphe stereotactically (from bregma: 4.4–4.7 mm posterior, 0.1–0.2 mm lateral, 1.9–2.3 mm ventral), or into VTA as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>All surgery was performed under aseptic conditions with animals under ketamine/medetomidine (60 and 0.5 mg/kg, I.P., respectively) or isoflurane (1–2% at 0.5–1.0 l/min) anesthesia.

Weight was maintained within 90% of their full body weight. Animals were head-restrained using a custom-made metal plate and habituated for 1–2 day while head-restrained before training on the task. Odors were delivered with a custom-made olfactometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Uchida and Mainen, 2003</xref>). Each odor was dissolved in paraffin oil at 1/10 dilution. 30 µl of diluted odor was placed inside a filter-paper housing. Odors were isoamyl acetate, 1-butanol, N-citral, eugenol, (+) limonene, (−) carvone, (+) carvone, allyl tiglate, eucalyptol, acetophenone, hydroxymethylpentylcyclohexenecarboxaldehyde, 3-hexanone, pentyl acetate, 1-hexanol, p-cymene, and ethyl butyrate, and differed for different animals. Odorized air was further diluted with filtered air by 1:10 to produce a 500 ml/min total flow rate. Licks were detected by breaks of an infrared beam placed in front of the water tube.</p><p>We delivered one of three odors, selected pseudorandomly, for 1 s, followed by a delay of 1 s and an outcome. Each odor predicted a different outcome: a drop of water (4 µl), no outcome, or an air puff delivered to the animal's face. ITIs were drawn from an exponential distribution with a rate parameter of 10 (i.e., P(ITI) = 1/10 exp(−<italic>x</italic>/10)). This resulted in a flat ITI hazard function, ensuring that expectation about the start time of the next trial did not change over time. A 15 kHz tone lasting 1 s signaled block changes, ending 1 s before the start of the next trial. Data were obtained from 141 sessions (19–28 sessions per animal). For 17 identified serotonergic neurons, we omitted rewards during 10% of big-reward trials. Animals performed between 400 and 700 trials per day (533 ± 120 trials, mean ± SD). Free rewards were delivered before the start of the conditioning task. We did not observe differences in lick rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) or sniff rate (counted manually during 1-s intervals of 20 reward trials and 20 punishment trials for two mice; t-tests, t<sub>38</sub> = 1.28, p &gt; 0.20, t<sub>38</sub> = 1.05, p &gt; 0.29 for each mouse) during ITIs of different block types.</p><p>For 16 of 29 serotonergic neurons, block type varied randomly, whereas for 13 of 29 serotonergic neurons, and all dopaminergic neurons, block type alternated between reward and punishment. For 16 of 29 serotonergic neurons, neutral blocks were included, in which case an additional odor was used as a CS. For 2 of 29 serotonergic neurons, block size was 20 trials. We trained each animal on the task with randomly-interleaved trials for 5 days before beginning the blocked structure.</p><p>For the task including quinine as a US, we used water (4 µl) or chocolate milk (1%, Hood, Lynnfield, Massachusetts, 4 µl) as a reward US and quinine HCl (0.5–1.0 mM, 4 µl) as a punishment US. To ensure that animals ingested the quinine, which is known to be aversive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Schoenbaum et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berridge, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Peciña and Berridge, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Roitman et al., 2005</xref>), we placed the delivery tube at the entry to their mouths. Other task parameters were the same as above.</p><p>For the freely-moving behavioral task, we trained five adult male C57BL/6J mice to perform a two-alternative forced choice task as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). An odor cue (1-hexanol) delivered at a central port was a start cue that signaled the mouse to choose between one peripheral port that contained water (4 µl) and a second that contained water (4 µl) and an air puff. After an ITI (same distribution as for the tasks described above), the next trial began. Mice performed 300 trials of this task for 5 days, after 6 days of shaping and training.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>We recorded extracellularly from multiple neurons simultaneously using custom-built 200-µm-fiber-optic-coupled screw-driven microdrives with eight implanted tetrodes (four nichrome wires wound together, Sandvik, Palm Coast, Florida). Tetrodes were glued to fiber optics with epoxy or cyanoacrylate. The ends of tetrodes were 400–600 µm from the ends of fiber optics. Neural signals and time stamps for behavior were recorded using DigiLynx recording systems (Neuralynx, Bozeman, Montana). Broadband signals from each wire were filtered between 0.1 and 9000 Hz and recorded at 32 kHz. To extract the timing of spikes, signals were bandpass-filtered between 300 and 6000 Hz and sorted online and offline.</p><p>To verify that our recordings targeted serotonergic or dopaminergic neurons, we used ChR2 to observe stimulation-locked spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lima et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). The optical fiber was coupled to a diode-pumped solid-state laser with analog amplitude modulation (Laserglow Technologies, Toronto, Canada). For each neuron, we delivered trains of 10 light pulses, each 5 ms long, at 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 Hz at 473 nm at 5–20 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, before and after the experimental session. Higher intensities typically resulted in light-evoked spike waveforms that did not match spontaneous ones. Therefore, we adjusted the light intensity after observing the responses at the beginning of experiments. The increasing latency of light-evoked spiking as a function of stimulation frequency indicates that the response was not due to photochemical artifact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Spike shape was measured using a broadband signal (0.1–9000 Hz) sampled at 32 kHz.</p><p>We used two criteria to include a neuron in our data set. First, the neuron must have been recorded within 500 µm of an identified serotonergic neuron, to ensure that all neurons came from the dorsal raphe (except for dopaminergic neurons, which all came from VTA). Second, the neuron must have been well isolated. To measure isolation quality, we calculated the L-ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schmitzer-Torbert and Redish, 2004</xref>), which approximates the fraction of ‘contaminated’ spikes. Smaller L-ratios indicate better isolation. All neurons in the data set had L-ratios &lt; 0.05 and signal-to-noise ratios of &gt; 5 dB. Identified serotonergic neurons, of which there were 50 across experiments, came from all nine mice (a range of 1–10 per mouse).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>To measure firing rates, peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) were constructed using 10-ms bins. To calculate spike density functions, PSTHs were convolved with a function resembling a postsynaptic potential, (1 − exp(−<italic>t</italic>)) exp(−<italic>t</italic>/200), for time <italic>t</italic>. For display (but not analysis), we smoothed spike density functions with a smoothing spline with 30 degrees of freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kass et al., 2005</xref>). To determine whether a neuron showed a significant task-related response, we calculated an ANOVA on the trial-by-trial firing rates during the baseline period (1 s before odor onset), CS period (from odor onset to odor offset), delay (from odor offset to outcome onset), and US period (from outcome onset to 500 ms after outcome onset). The factors were task epoch (baseline, CS, delay, or US) and outcome type. Normality was tested by Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests and quantile–quantile plots. All two-group comparisons were two-sided. Effect sizes for each experiment were determined post-hoc using Cohen's U<sub>3</sub> (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hentschke and Stüttgen, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Light-evoked spikes were detected during the 10 ms after light onset. If less than 20% of light pulses evoked a spike (defined as a waveform that matched that of the isolated unit) during the 10 ms after light onset (upper left points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the maximum absolute voltage during that interval was used as the light-evoked ‘response’. Euclidean distances between spontaneous and light-evoked spike waveforms were calculated by aligning the larger of the positive or negative peak of each waveform, averaging separately, and aligning the peaks of the averages. The distance was calculated using the full duration of the spontaneous spike (spike duration was measured as the first time until the last time at which the voltage was significantly different from baseline using Wilcoxon rank sum tests). The energy of the light-evoked waveform is defined as the integral of the squared voltage values (∫<italic>v</italic><sup>2</sup>d<italic>t</italic>).</p><p>ROC curves were calculated by comparing the distribution of firing rates (spike density functions) across trials in 100-ms bins to the distribution of baseline firing rates (1 s before odor onset, using 100-ms bins). The duration of significant responses were calculated using Wilcoxon rank sum tests comparing the baseline firing rate to the firing rate in the response window of interest, bin by bin. The number of bins in which p &lt; 0.05 was taken as the duration of the significant response (after Bonferroni corrections).</p><p>Expectation-maximization clustering was performed using hierarchical clustering for parameterized Gaussian mixture models, setting the number of clusters to 2 (one cluster of ‘identified serotonergic neurons’ and one of ‘unidentified neurons’), with model selection by Bayesian Information Criterion.</p><p>All statistical tests were done with Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior editor and Reviewing editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Geoffrey Schoenbaum (Reviewer #1), has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and we would like to invite a revised submission in line with the review comments below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>Here the authors record from optogenetically-identified SERT+ neurons in mice performing a simple odor-based discrimination task in which different odors predicted reward, punishment, or very low probability of reward (termed neutral). Trials were arranged in blocks in order to modulate the motivation, state value or mood of the mouse. Mice were shown to discriminate in their licking behavior on the different trial types. Subsequent analyses of SERT+ neurons (29 in the main task and smaller subpopulations in various follow up studies for a grand total of ∼50) showed that they exhibited correlates based on value (not salience or sensory features) both within trials during CS and US periods and between trials based on block. Activity was compared to that of TH+ neurons recorded I think in a previously published study. Activity was superficially similar in some regards during trials, but differed in details and also during the periods between trials such that the authors concluded that the two populations were doing different things in both periods. Overall the authors conclude that the SERT+ neuron activity correlates with predicted value or state value on both long time scales (trial blocks) and short time scales (within trials) and that this is the most salient feature of their activity.</p><p>Overall the paper is excellent. The study is simple and the analyses are generally clearly and carefully presented, logical, and easy to follow. The underlying question is important and the task design and analysis is appropriate to answer it. Indeed the results are extremely interesting to me and I think will be to the field at large. Of particular value is the comparison to TH+ neurons and also the comparison across time scales. I do not think this has been done clearly before. It is quite clever and has yielded interesting and informative data. I also enjoyed and found valuable the discussion, which did a very nice job relating the current findings both to several influential but largely theoretical proposals for serotonergic function and to the relatively sparse existing single unit data. The authors nicely link their results to those from Doya and colleagues on firing during delays.</p><p>Of course I do have a few suggestions and questions for the authors. My only serious concern probably is that as far as I can tell the authors have little or no evidence that the block design resulted in changes in motivation or mood. While the licking data obviously shows the mice understood the meaning of the odor cues, it does not show that they were attending to the blocks. While I think it is highly likely they were, especially if they were well-trained (data?), it would strengthen the claims to provide some behavioral data on this. Differences in trial initiation speed, proportions of trials completed would be sufficient I think. If this is not possible, I guess it does not negate the significance of the neural correlates, but I think it is a significant gap that should be filled in if possible. Likewise it would be useful to have behavior from the various follow up tasks shown. These data are an important part of the report, especially in showing that the activity is not salience or simply sensory.</p><p>I also have various other questions, which I will list in no particular order:</p><p>1) The first paragraph of the Discussion seems to be about performance, but much of the data/ideas about dopamine and even serotonin's influences on behavior is due to learning. I found this a bit confusing, especially as learning is then lumped in with this function in the second paragraph.</p><p>2) Please clarify where the dopamine neuron data came from? Is this from the prior published study? Is the task identical to that used here? I was a bit confused.</p><p>3) It would be helpful if the authors would link the individual figure panels a bit more closely to their text. At times I felt like I was reading two papers in parallel, especially as the figure panels are not well enough labeled as to not require reading the captions.</p><p>4) In the sliding window ROC analysis, the authors find that 28/29 SERT+ neurons are phasically activated. What does this mean? Meaning that they had 1 bin above chance across the analysis? How many bins and what p level is this?</p><p>5) In the Results, there is a paragraph describing the response of the neurons to unexpected reward and punishment. It comes a bit out of the blue. I was not clear even where these data came from in the context of the task. I think this should be more clearly explained. I'd also like to see the activity directly compared to the expected. This will make more clear whether there is an implication of error signaling here or if it is just that the neurons are firing to the US the same way they are during the trials.</p><p>6) Related to point #5, I think that unless you find clear evidence that the neurons fire to unexpected reward or punishment differently from how they fire to expected, then you should not emphasize this point in the subsection headed “Dopamine and serotonin do not signal opposite information” in the Discussion. There you start by emphasizing the response. To me this carries the connotation of error signals. This has not been shown and Doya et al. have provided strong data against this. And I think the results here are largely in agreement. Assuming this is not the intent here, this might be modified. (If it is the intent, then I think much more must be done to show that these are error signals.)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>In this very interesting study, Cohen et al. provide what is the most comprehensive characterization to date of the activity of optogenetically-identified dorsal raphe serotonergic cells in a Pavlovian paradigm involving predictions of rewards and punishments. The results are quite complex, with differential modulations over multiple timescales, and not complete. However, they represent an important step forward.</p><p>Critical questions:</p><p>1) We need to know a bit more about the behaviour of the animals: do they orient in any way to all three types of cues, is this response related to the 5-HT activity? Can they avoid sampling the odour in the aversive blocks? Do they show other changed behavior? Does the licking response show anything like the topography seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>? This is important given evidence from the likes of Barry Jacobs about activity-related influences on 5-HT firing.</p><p>2) I was confused by the status of the neutral trials. In the Methods, it sounds as if neutral stimuli were interspersed with probability 0.1 in each block (also by reading of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), in which case I'd like to see what happens on those trials. But later in the paper, it sounds as if there were whole blocks with neutral trials too. In the latter case, if these blocks were relatively unusual, then I think it hard to make any argument from them about salience versus value coding, since they could be salient by virtue of being rare.</p><p>3) I was disappointed at how little analysis there was of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> when there was an additional level of reward. It is important to report what happens to other aspects of the activity of the 5-HT neurons, for instance, how are the prominent value-related CS responses affected? How does the monotonic relationship in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> relate to baseline activation by reward/punishment? The logic of these analyses is the same as the logic of the authors having changed reward values in the first place.</p><p>4) Schwiemer et al. reported different classes of physiological activity for their 5-HT neurons, and that the response to punishment was related (e.g. 'clock-like'). Was there any evidence of that here, or could that have arisen from the anaesthetic?</p><p>5) Was there any modulation of the baseline or CS activity as a function of the length of the ITI (it would be good to show an interquartile split)? This directly bears on the nature of prediction revealed by these neurons.</p><p>6) The Introduction is a bit woeful compared with the care in the rest of the paper. Tops et al. isn't correctly represented, the stimulation work on patience and preference and optogenetic activation of 5-HT neurons should be better recognized; likewise the heterogeneity revealed by cFOS imaging of the raphe (from Lowry, Maier and others). Also, there is not really a competition between tonic and phasic aspects of dopamine or serotonin signaling. These are different facets of the signal that could even be read by different downstream mechanisms. This comes across more reasonably in the Discussion.</p><p>7) The structure of the methods in the Results was a bit puzzling, not only the issue of neutral trials/blocks mentioned above, but also not thoroughly discussing the methods for the DA part of the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study from Cohen et al. investigates the phasic and tonic responses of optogenetically identified serotonergic neurons in the raphe nucleus to rewarding and aversive stimuli. They find that, unlike dopaminergic neurons, serotonergic neurons exhibit long-lasting tonic signals that track the value of the entire block. Serotonergic neurons also respond phasically to rewarding and punishing stimuli, with stronger phasic responses to the CS on rewarded blocks and to the US on punished blocks. Overall the experiments are well designed and executed, and the analyses are sound. However, several points require further explanation or clarification as detailed below: 1) The authors should clarify the methodology used to identify serotonergic neurons; namely the “light-evoked energy” analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> should be explained more thoroughly, as it is not a standard method.</p><p>2) The authors should include more discussion about why the neural responses to punishment occur consistently later than those to reward.

We analyzed the behavioral data during the tone that signaled the start of a new block. During the 35 sessions in which block type predictably alternated between reward and punishment, mice licked significantly more during the tone (as analyzed in the subsection “Behavioral Task”) that indicated the start of a reward block versus the start of a punishment block (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p &lt;0.01). Because this tone was the same for both reward-to-punishment and punishment-to-reward block transitions, this indicates that mice attended to the current block type.

We agree that the more appropriate statement is that we could not find evidence for salience coding with tonic firing rates (panel (a)). Thus, we modified the text. In panel (b), we show tonic activity for both positive-coding and negative-coding serotonergic neurons (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>), and found, remarkably, that both types showed monotonic firing rates as a function of reward size (albeit some with positive slope, some with negative slope).</p><p><italic>4) Are there differences in the anatomical location within the raphe of cells that respond preferentially to reward vs. punishment</italic>?</p><p>This is an important question, but one that, unfortunately, we cannot address with our recording technique.
