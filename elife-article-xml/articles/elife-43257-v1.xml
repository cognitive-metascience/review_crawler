property that defines the blood-brain and blood-retina barriers. Exceptions to this pattern are found in circumventricular organs (CVOs), small midline brain structures that are supplied by high permeability capillaries. In the eye and brain, high permeability capillaries are also present in the choriocapillaris, which supplies the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors, and the ciliary body and choroid plexus, the sources of aqueous humor and cerebrospinal fluid, respectively. We show here that (1) endothelial cells in these high permeability vascular systems have very low beta-catenin signaling compared to barrier-competent endothelial cells, and (2) elevating beta-catenin signaling leads to a partial conversion of permeable endothelial cells to a barrier-type state. In one CVO, the area postrema, high permeability is maintained, in part, by local production of Wnt inhibitory factor-1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endothelial</kwd><kwd>beta-catenin</kwd><kwd>blood-brain barrier</kwd><kwd>circumventricular organ</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>vascular</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yanshu</given-names></name><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Xiaowu</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name><name><surname>Nathans</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY018637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rattner</surname><given-names>Amir</given-names></name><name><surname>Nathans</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sabbagh</surname><given-names>Mark F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000997</institution-id><institution>Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yanshu</given-names></name><name><surname>Rattner</surname><given-names>Amir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Elevating beta-catenin signaling converts endothelial cells in typically fenestrated central nervous system vasculature to a blood-brain barrier (BBB) phenotype and promotes a BBB gene expression program and chromatin landscape.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Throughout the body, capillaries exhibit tissue- and organ-specific specializations of structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aird, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aird, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Potente and MÃ¤kinen, 2017</xref>). In the CNS, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-retina barrier (BRB) are characterized by numerous specializations in vascular endothelial cell (EC) structure and function, including elaboration of tight junctions, suppression of transcytotic pathways, and production of small molecule transporters and extrusion pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daneman and Prat, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). [See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for a list of abbreviations used in this paper.] The BBB/BRB program of EC differentiation is controlled, at least in part, by beta-catenin signaling (canonical Wnt signaling) that is activated by ligands Wnt7a, Wnt7b, and Norrin. These ligands are produced by glia and neurons, and they activate receptors and co-receptors on the surface of ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liebner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stenman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daneman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou and Nathans, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Posokhova et al., 2015</xref>).

In the mature CNS vasculature, acute loss of Frizzled4 (Fz4), one of the EC receptors for beta-catenin signaling, leads to a cell-autonomous loss of barrier integrity in the retina, cerebellum, and olfactory bulb. Conversely, acute induction of Norrin production in the CNS of an adult <italic>Ndp</italic> null mouse [<italic>Norrie disease protein</italic> (<italic>Ndp</italic>) is the gene coding for Norrin] restores BBB integrity in the cerebellum. Intriguingly, constitutive activation of beta-catenin signaling in ECs in the choroid plexus, the site of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production, leads to the cell autonomous expression of a BBB marker [the tight junction protein Claudin5 (CLDN5)] and repression of a marker of non-BBB vasculature [plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP), a structural component of fenestrae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>)]. These experiments indicate that the BBB state remains plastic throughout life and that beta-catenin signaling in CNS ECs is required on a continuous basis for maintenance of the BBB state.</p><p>The mammalian brain contains a set of small midline structures, the circumventricular organs (CVOs), that are unusual in having a dense capillary plexus composed of ECs with high permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gross, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duvernoy and Risold, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaur and Ling, 2017</xref>). CVOs can be divided into two categories, sensory and secretory. The vascular organ of the lamina terminalis (VOLT), the subfornical organ (SFO), and the area postrema comprise the sensory CVOs. The VOLT and SFO monitor serum osmolarity and together regulate blood volume, blood pressure, and electrolyte balance by controlling vasopressin release, which, in turn, controls thirst and renal salt and water retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Toney et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hiyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hiyama and Noda, 2016</xref>). The SFO additionally monitors glucose and other small molecule nutrients and regulates energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fry and Ferguson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Medeiros et al., 2012</xref>). The area postrema monitors serum composition and controls an emetic response to toxic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borison, 1989</xref>). The posterior pituitary, the median eminence (ME), and the pineal comprise the secretory CVOs and are part of the neuroendocrine system. The posterior pituitary releases oxytocin and vasopressin into the systemic circulation, and the ME is the site of secretion of hypothalamic hormones into the hypophyseal-portal system to control release of the corresponding target hormones from the anterior pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guillemin, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schally, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amar and Weiss, 2003</xref>).

Although contained within the CNS, the choroid plexus is not generally considered a CVO because the choroid plexus capillaries are not in direct contact with neurons or glia but are instead surrounded by a specialized epithelium, all of which is surrounded by CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johanson et al., 2011</xref>). Two regions of the ocular vasculature also contain ECs with high permeability: the choriocapillaris and the ciliary body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alm, 1992</xref>). The choriocapillaris is a flattened monolayer of capillaries adjacent to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and it serves as the vascular supply for both the RPE and the photoreceptors, with the RPE monolayer providing the outer blood-retina barrier (BRB). The ciliary body, at the anterior edge of the retina, is the source of aqueous humor, and is therefore analogous in its function to the choroid plexus. The extent to which these specialized vascular beds in the brain and eye (the CVOs, choroid plexus, ciliary body, and choriocapillaris) share molecular properties is largely unexplored.</p><p>The foregoing summary suggests the possibility that the distinction between the barrier-type vasculature that serves most of the CNS and the specialized non-barrier vasculatures in the eye and brain could be due, at least in part, to differences in beta-catenin signaling in their respective ECs. The experiments described here support this idea. In particular, we observe that ECs in the CVO vasculature convert to a BBB-like state upon induction of beta-catenin signaling, as judged by changes in (1) ultrastructure and protein composition, (2) expression of BBB vs. non-BBB genes, and (3) chromatin accessibility near BBB genes. We also find that loss of Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF1), a secreted Wnt binding protein that reduces beta-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hsieh et al., 1999</xref>) and is expressed specifically in the area postrema, leads to a partial conversion of area postrema ECs to a BBB-like state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reduced beta-catenin signaling in CVO ECs</title><p>The CVO and choroid plexus vasculatures are readily visualized in the wild type (WT) mouse brain by immunostaining for PLVAP, which is abundant in the VOLT, ME, SFO, area postrema, pineal, anterior pituitary, posterior pituitary, and choroid plexus vasculatures but absent from the adjacent BBB-type CNS vasculature (left panels in each panel set in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3AâDâ</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

In all of these vasculatures, mature ECs retain substantial plasticity with respect to this gene expression program, so that an acute increase in beta-catenin signaling can suppress one set of markers (e.g. PLVAP) and induce another set (e.g. CLDN5). There are also differences among capillary beds in the responses of individual BBB/BRB markers to beta-catenin stabilization.

When the level of beta-catenin signaling is artificially elevated in ECs, high permeability brain and ocular vessels are converted to a low permeability BBB-like state. However, the data also indicate that beta-catenin signaling constitutes only part of the difference between BBB and non-BBB ECs, since the phenotypic conversion induced by beta-catenin signaling is incomplete. Presumably, other signals are also required to fully convert ECs to the BBB state.</p><p>The data presented here imply that highly permeable brain and ocular ECs retain substantial developmental plasticity. The ATAC-seq analyses represent one step in defining this plasticity at the level of the chromatin state, and â like the transcriptome changes that accompany beta-catenin stabilization â they show that changes in accessible chromatin do not fully recapitulate the BBB pattern, implying a requirement for additional signals or an irreversibility to some chromatin features of the high permeability EC gene expression program. The earlier observation that ectopic expression of Wnt7a in the mouse embryo â which presumably activates beta-catenin signaling in ECs â leads to GLUT1 accumulation in ECs in the peripheral vasculature (i.e. conversion to a BBB-like state; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stenman et al., 2008</xref>) suggested that plasticity in barrier gene expression may be a feature of immature ECs throughout the embryo. Our observation that posterior pituitary ECs show a greater response than anterior pituitary ECs to beta-catenin stabilization suggests that embryo-like plasticity is retained to a greater extent in highly permeable CNS ECs compared to non-CNS ECs.</p><p>For CNS ECs that reside within the neural retina and the non-CVO regions of the brain, the ligands Wnt7a, Wnt7b, and Norrin promote the BBB/BRB state. The observation that WIF1 is involved in maintaining the high permeability state of area postrema ECs implies that local inhibition of ligands that stimulate beta-catenin signaling is one mechanism by which the micro-environment can direct the development and maintenance of a highly permeable CNS vascular bed. It seems likely that the high permeability state depends on additional signals from CVO parenchymal cells, or, in the case of the choroid plexus, choriocapillaris, and ciliary body, from adjacent epithelial cells. For the choriocapillaris, current evidence suggests that VEGF may be one of the pro-permeability signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">TÃ¼bingen Bevacizumab Study Group et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shimomura et al., 2009</xref>).

While capillary density in many parts of the body is regulated by oxygen demand (via VEGF signaling), this would seem to be an unlikely explanation for the high capillary density in CVOs, where high density is more likely a reflection of the requirement for efficient sampling of serum contents (in the sensory CVOs) or efficient secretion of neuropeptides into the circulation (in the secretory CVOs). In contrast to the situation in the CVOs, the high density of the choriocapillaris, the extensive area of contact between the choriocapillaris and the adjacent RPE, and the high blood flow within the choroidal circulation are required to support the high glucose and oxygen consumption of rod and cone photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yu and Cringle, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Country, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The functional and anatomic diversity within the CNS vasculature suggests that beta-catenin signaling is just one of multiple signaling pathways that play a role in locally shaping vascular structure and function. It will of interest to look for additional signaling molecules that vary locally and that could be candidates for mediating communication between parenchymal and vascular cells. It will also be of interest to identify additional examples of vascular diversity in different brain regions by comparing regional and single cell transcriptomes. Indeed, recent single cell RNA analyses have already provided evidence for previously unsuspected diversity among CNS ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sabbagh et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Comparisons between brain and ocular vasculatures</title><p>The functional and structural similarities between the choroid plexus and ciliary body have long been noted. Both structures produce a plasma transudate â CSF and aqueous humor, respectively â and both consist of a fenestrated capillary plexus surrounded by epithelial cells that are connected by tight junctions, the latter creating the blood-CSF and blood-aqueous barriers. Similarly, the RPE, which is characterized by tight junctions and an absence of passive diffusion, is responsible for the blood-ocular barrier at the choriocapillaris-RPE interface. Similarities in the genetic programs in choroid plexus and ciliary body epithelial cells is suggested by the production of both choroid plexus and ciliary body tumors in mice with transgenic expression of the MYC oncoprotein in neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shannon et al., 2018</xref>). The experiments reported here show that the ciliary body, choriocapillaris, and choroid plexus ECs all share the property that they can be reprogrammed to a BBB-like state by activating beta-catenin signaling.</p><p>The epithelial-based blood-tissue barriers of the ciliary body, choriocapillaris/RPE, and choroid plexus contrast with the architecture of the BBB and BRB, where the blood-tissue barrier is at the level of the ECs. Barriers with an epithelial architecture are also found in reproductive organs. In the testis, developing germ cells are sequestered from permeable capillaries by a monolayer of Sertoli cells that are connected by tight junctions, thereby creating the blood-testis barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wen et al., 2018</xref>); and in the placenta, fetal trophoblasts fuse to form a syncytium that separates the maternal and fetal circulatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huppertz, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>Increases in CNS vascular permeability accompany a wide variety of neurologic conditions, including head trauma, multiple sclerosis, degenerative diseases (including Alzheimer disease), CNS infections, and a subset of brain tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Obermeier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Among brain tumors, a dramatic example of increased vascular permeability is found in a subtype of medulloblastoma, referred to as WNT-medulloblastoma, which is characterized by a high level of beta-catenin signaling in the tumor cells. In mouse models of WNT-medulloblastoma, the intra-tumor capillaries resemble CVO capillaries in their high density, tortuosity, and GLUT1-/PLVAP+Â phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Phoenix et al., 2016</xref>). In these models, the high level of tumor cell-specific beta-catenin signaling is accompanied by high-level production of Wnt inhibitors DKK1 and WIF1, which reprogram the intra-tumor vascular phenotype by inhibiting beta-catenin signaling in ECs. In contrast, the intra-tumor capillaries in other medulloblastoma subtypes resemble conventional BBB-type CNS capillaries. High vascular permeability enhances sensitivity to chemotherapy and likely accounts for the better prognosis of WNT-medulloblastomas compared to other medulloblastoma subtypes. These observations suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting beta-catenin signaling within tumor vasculature could enhance responsiveness to chemotherapy in a wide variety of CNS tumors. In the context of the work presented here, the similarities between capillaries in WNT-medulloblastomas and in CVOs imply that a detailed understanding of the mechanisms responsible for generating and maintaining high permeability CVO capillaries could inform strategies for enhancing vascular permeability to improve CNS drug delivery.</p><p>The study of CVO capillary permeability â and, in particular, the observation that it is reduced in response to activated beta-catenin signaling â could also inform strategies aimed at reducing CNS vascular permeability in other pathologic contexts. A common attribute of many neurologic disorders that feature loss of BBB integrity is an increase in CNS inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liebner et al., 2018</xref>). One hypothesis to explain disease-associated vascular permeability is that CNS inflammation recapitulates the permeability-promoting mechanisms that are active in the CVOs. As previous work has shown that the BBB state remains plastic throughout life and that its maintenance requires continuous beta-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liebner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), a change in the local tissue environment that directly or indirectly antagonizes beta-catenin signaling â for example, by activating an antagonistic signaling pathway in ECs or inhibiting/degrading Wnt ligands or receptors â could lead to a loss of BBB competence. This line of reasoning suggests that enhancing beta-catenin signaling in CNS ECs could be a treatment strategy for pathological BBB breakdown.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The role of beta-catenin signaling in CNS vascular biology</title><p>As noted in the preceding paragraph, the BBB/BRB state remains plastic throughout life. The present work extends this observation by showing that the high permeability ECs in the CVO, choroid plexus, choriocapillaris, or ciliary body are similarly plastic. Interestingly, the transcriptome comparisons between cerebellar and pituitary ECs show that, with elevated beta-catenin signaling, cerebellar ECs reduce the levels of pituitary EC-specific transcripts even further than their normally low levels. This suggests that the gene expression set point of the standard BBB state is not at the extreme end of the BBB/non-BBB continuum.</p><p>A striking aspect of adult CNS EC plasticity, is the quantized phenotypic conversion of individual ECs in response to changes in beta-catenin signaling. This behavior suggests the existence of positive feedback. While some proteins that accumulate in response to beta-catenin signaling are likely involved in negative feedback regulation â including, for example, the induction of Axin2, which is part of the beta-catenin destruction complex â the accumulation of LEF1, which cooperates with beta-catenin as a heteromeric transcriptional regulator of target genes, is likely involved in positive feedback. Positive feedback in beta-catenin signaling could facilitate the development and maintenance of spatially precise and temporally stable vascular territories that differ in their barrier properties, as seen, for example, in the sharp junctions between CVO and non-CVO vascular territories.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Ctnnb1<sup>flex3</sup></italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harada et al., 1999</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Ndp<sup>-</sup></italic></td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Stock No: 012287;

For immunoprecipitation, tissues were homogenized in 500 Î¼l (choroid plexus) or 700 Î¼l (cerebral cortex) polysome buffer [50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mM sucrose, 100 mM KCl, 12 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT, 200 U/ml RNasin Plus (Promega), 1 mg/ml heparin, 100 g/ml cycloheximide, 0.5 mM spermidine, and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)]. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000xg for 10 min at 4Â°C to create a postmitochondrial supernatant. 25 Î¼l and 40 Î¼l aliquots of choroid plexus homogenate and cortex homogenate, respectively, were saved as input samples. Four Î¼l of mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (HA.11, ascites fluid; Covance) were added to the supernatants and rotated for 4 hr at 4Â°C. 100 Î¼l protein G magnetic beads (Dynabeads; Invitrogen) were washed twice with polysome buffer and added directly to the antibody-coupled polysomes and rotated overnight at 4Â°C. The following day, samples were placed in a magnet on ice and supernatants recovered before washing the pellets 4 Ã 5 min in high salt buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl, 12 mM MgCl 2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT, 20 Î¼g/ml cycloheximide). To prepare total RNA, 350 Î¼l of Qiagen RLT buffer was added to the beads or to the input samples. Total RNA was prepared according to manufacturerâs instructions using the RNeasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen), and the quantity and quality of the RNA were assessed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Tissue dissection, EC purification, and RNA and DNA sample preparation</title><p>To control for the possibility of sex-dependent differences, male mice were used for RNA-seq and ATAC-seq.

For pituitaries, 20â30 mice between P30 and P90 were used for each independent replicate. The mice consisted of control WT mice (<italic>Tie2-GFP</italic>) and EC-specific beta-catenin stabilized (<italic>Ctnnbl1<sup>flex3/+</sup>;Pdgfb-CreER;Tie2-GFP</italic> that had received 100 ug 4HT at P10). Pituitaries were dissected from the base of the skull and place in Dulbeccoâs PBS (DPBS). Posterior pituitaries (a small whitish tissue with a clear border occupying the dorso-medial pituitary) was gently separated from the anterior pituitary and the 20â30 anterior and posterior pituitaries were collected in separate tubes for subsequent papain dissociation. RNA was extracted from GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells that were FACS sorted directly into QIAGEN Buffer RLT Plus and then processed using the RNeasy Micro Plus kit (74034, QIAGEN, Venlo, Netherlands). For ATAC-seq,~50,000 GFP-positive FACS-sorted cells were gently centrifuged and then resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM Tricine-KOH, 0.1% Igepal CA-630) and immediately centrifuged at 500 x g for 10 min at 4Â°C to prepare nuclei. The resulting nuclear pellet was resuspended in a 50 ul reaction volume in Tn5 transposase and transposase reaction buffer (FC-121â1030, Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA), and the tagmentation reaction was incubated at 37Â°C for 30 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Library preparation and sequencing</title><p>Each RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis was conducted on two biological replicates.

To filter out background transcripts from surrounding parenchymal cells, a set of EC-enriched transcripts was determined for each tissue by comparing RNA data from GFP-positive and GFP-negative sorted cells. A transcript was considered EC-enriched if it met the following three criteria: (1) a minimum two-fold enrichment in GFP-positive compared to GFP-negative samples; (2) a posterior probability of differential expression (PPDE) greater than or equal to 0.95 [PPDE = (1 - false discovery rate)], thatÂ is an FDRÂ &lt;Â 0.05; (3) relative expression greater than or equal to 10 transcripts per million (TPM) in both biological replicates. A gene was considered to be differentially expressed between EC subtypes if it met the following criteria: (1) EC-enriched with minimum of two-fold enrichment between one subtype and both other subtypes; (2) a PPDE greater than or equal to 0.95; (3) a TPM value greater than or equal to 10 in both biological replicates.

These observations are novel and of interest. However, overall, the paper looks essentially descriptive. It would improve its impact by, at least, discussing the physiological and pathological meaning of these profound differences in barrier functions in the different regions of the brain.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Wang et al., address a critical question regarding the mechanisms that prevent blood vessels in circumventricular organs (CVO) to acquire blood-brain barrier (BBB) properties compared to the rest of the central nervous system (CNS) blood vessels. The authors attribute the high permeability in CVO blood vessels to the low levels of beta-catenin signaling in these endothelial cells compared to the rest of the CNS. For example, endothelial cells in area postrema is permeable due to high expression of Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF1) in this region. Moreover, overexpression of a stabilized form of beta-catenin in CVO endothelial cells led to a partial induction of BBB properties both structurally and based on the molecular signatures from the RNA seq and ATAC seq data.</p><p>Overall, the study is well conceived and executed, and strengthens our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate barrier properties in the CNS endothelial cells versus blood vessels in CVOs as well as the diversity among endothelial cells in distinct CNS regions. However, there are some concerns about the manuscript as follows:</p><p>1) A major functional feature of the BBB is to exclude various circulating molecules from entering the CNS. However, a functional assessment of barrier properties in CVO blood vessels after beta-catenin stabilization is missing throughout the paper. The authors need to inject intravenously small or large MW tracers and assess their permeability into the CVOs under conditions of Wnt/beta-catenin activation in endothelial cells.</p><p>2) The transcriptional analysis shown in Figures 6, 7, Figure 7âfigure supplement 1, Figure 7âfigure supplement 2 and Supplementary files 1, 2 clearly demonstrates a partial induction of BBB-gene expression profile in CVO blood vessels. In my opinion, I do not think that this is only due to an incomplete recombinations which is obvious in the variability of the induction of Wnt downstream target genes (<italic>Axin2, Apcdd1</italic> etc.) (Figure 6). Several key transcriptional regulators of the BBB (Foxf2, Foxq1, <italic>Foxl2</italic>, Ppard, Zic3, Sox17 (Hupe et al., 2016) are completely missing in CVO blood vessels after beta-catenin overexpression after examining carefully Supplementary file 1. There seems to be a complete absence of induction of these genes which likely reflects permanent changes in chromatin accessibility. This has not been discussed or addressed in detail in the paper. The data are there, but they are buried in supplementary files. This is a critical point that needs to be highlighted in greater detail.</p><p>3) In Figure 5, it would be important to show TEM images of the structural changes in ciliary body blood vessels following beta-catenin stabilization in this organ.</p><p>4) Do the blood vessels in CVO acquire Occludin protein expression at cell junctions with beta-catenin overexpression? The transcriptional analysis suggests that they do, but the authors need to show some staining with Occludin antibodies.</p><p>5) Figures 7 and 8 need to be better structured to illustrate more clearly the partial shift in gene expression in AP and PP blood vessels after beta-catenin activation. Perhaps some of the key BBB genes that are induced or nor induced in CVO blood vessels can be annotated in the numerous scatter plots. The salient points of these figures are difficult to follow without some proper annotation of key BBB genes or pituitary genes. Additionally, the authors may consider replacing some of the scatter plots with Venn Diagrams illustrating changes in gene expression.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The paper by Wang et al. shows, in a nutshell, that inhibition of Wnt-signaling is an important determinant in the maintenance of the fenestrated and permeable features of specific regional vascular beds within or in close contact with the CNS, i.e. the CVOs, choroid plexus, choriocapillaris and the ciliary body vasculature, which are characterized by a non-barrier phenotype, in marked contrast to the blood-brain/retina barrier (BBB) phenotype of the other CNS vasculature. The authors use a floxed <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>-exon3 allele to induce stabilization of beta-catenin in endothelial cells and knockouts for the Wnt inhibitors <italic>Wif1</italic> and <italic>Sostdc1</italic> to show loss of permeability and gain of a BBB-like phenotype in the non-barrier vasculature.</p><p>All in all this is a beautiful study that deserves publication without additional experimental work. While the mechanistic insights are valuable, they don't come as a surprise given prior literature, in part from the Nathan's lab, demonstrating the importance of Wnt signaling for induction and maintenance of the BBB. What is equally valuable to the field, and what impressed me a lot during the reading was the beautiful morphological analyses and the comprehensive and scholarly overview of the field and its history. The manuscript is clearly written and partly a wonderful read. Perhaps the RNA seq and ATAC Seq section in the Results could be condensed and somewhat simplified to enhance the reading. The conclusions of this part are straightforward and simple and the data description would therefore benefit from some shortening.</p><p>I have a few suggestions for additional citations:</p><p>The paper from Phoenix et al. (Gilbertson lab) deserves mentioning, as it beautifully illustrates the power of Wnt-inhibition to reprogram the BBB into a fenestrated non-barrier vasculature: DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2016.03.002</p><p>In conjunction with the discussion of MFSD2A, I think David Silver's ground-breaking work on the lipid-transporting capacity of this molecule should be mentioned along with the reference to Ben-Zvi et al. (Gu lab): doi: 10.1038/nature13241</p><p>The similarity between the choroid plexus and ciliary body is striking and could be additionally cited by e.g. the work from Maria Lehtinen's lab on tumor development in these structures: doi: 10.1016/j.ajpath.2018.02.009.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43257.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary and essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewers agreed that the study is interesting and the major conclusions of the paper, once substantiated by additional data as outlined in the reviews, would in principle be sufficient to warrant publication in eLife.

Several key transcriptional regulators of the BBB (Foxf2, Foxq1, Foxl2, Ppard, Zic3, Sox17 (Hupe et al., 2016) are completely missing in CVO blood vessels after beta-catenin overexpression after examining carefully Supplementary file 1. There seems to be a complete absence of induction of these genes which likely reflects permanent changes in chromatin accessibility. This has not been discussed or addressed in detail in the paper. The data are there, but they are buried in supplementary files. This is a critical point that needs to be highlighted in greater detail.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We agree. We have expanded the Results text to discuss more fully the fact that the gene expression changes induced by beta-catenin stabilization represent only a partial recapitulation of the full BBB gene expression program and we have added two supplementary figures (Figure 6âfigure supplements 2 and 3). In the Results, we have added the following sentence: âAs seen in Figure 6A, Figure 6Aâfigure supplement 1, and in the figures that follow, a consistent feature of BBB transcript levels and ATAC peak areas in beta-catenin stabilized pituitary ECs is that, even when induced, the majority are substantially lower than their counterparts in cerebellar ECs.â In the Discussion, we have added the following sentence: âThe ATAC analyses represents one step in defining this plasticity at the level of the chromatin state, and â like the transcriptome changes that accompany beta-catenin stabilization â they show that changes in accessible chromatin do not fully recapitulate the BBB pattern, implying a requirement for additional signals or an irreversibility to some chromatin features of the high permeability EC gene expression program.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 5, it would be important to show TEM images of the structural changes in ciliary body blood vessels following beta-catenin stabilization in this organ.</p></disp-quote><p>We have these TEM images, but they are not as aesthetically pleasing as the ones from the pituitary, choroid plexus, and choriocapillaris because, in our hands, cardiac perfusion does not efficiently flush out the contents of the ciliary body capillaries. The result is a background haze of serum proteins in the vessel lumen. This does not affect our ability to see and quantify the fenestrae, but it makes for an image that is not aesthetically pleasing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Do the blood vessels in CVO acquire Occludin protein expression at cell junctions with beta-catenin overexpression? The transcriptional analysis suggests that they do, but the authors need to show some staining with Occludin antibodies.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, Occludin and ZO1 are both induced in CVO endothelial cells in response to beta-catenin stabilization and they both cluster at cell junctions, as does Claudin5. These data have been added in a set of new panels and new supplementary figures (Figure 2âfigure supplement 4, Figure 3F, and Figure 3âfigure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figures 7 and 8 need to be better structured to illustrate more clearly the partial shift in gene expression in AP and PP blood vessels after beta-catenin activation. Perhaps some of the key BBB genes that are induced or nor induced in CVO blood vessels can be annotated in the numerous scatter plots. The salient points of these figures are difficult to follow without some proper annotation of key BBB genes or pituitary genes. Additionally, the authors may consider replacing some of the scatter plots with Venn Diagrams illustrating changes in gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for that comment. We have annotated the same set of 7 key BBB genes in each of the scatterplots in Figure 7 so that the reader can follow the abundances of those transcripts across the different comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[â¦] All in all this is a beautiful study that deserves publication without additional experimental work. While the mechanistic insights are valuable, they don't come as a surprise given prior literature, in part from the Nathan's lab, demonstrating the importance of Wnt signaling for induction and maintenance of the BBB. What is equally valuable to the field, and what impressed me a lot during the reading was the beautiful morphological analyses and the comprehensive and scholarly overview of the field and its history. The manuscript is clearly written and partly a wonderful read. Perhaps the RNA seq and ATAC Seq section in the Results could be condensed and somewhat simplified to enhance the reading. The conclusions of this part are straightforward and simple and the data description would therefore benefit from some shortening.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the positive assessment. In considering the description of the RNAseq and ATAC-seq data, we donât think that we can shorten it without making it difficult for the reader to follow the logic of the analyses and the conclusions. Also, not all readers will be fully familiar with the âomicsâ literature in the context of vascular endothelial cells. Some extra explanatory text will help make the work accessible to a broader audience. We have broken this up into an additional section with a new heading, to improve the organization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have a few suggestions for additional citations:</p><p>The paper from Phoenix et al. (Gilbertson lab) deserves mentioning, as it beautifully illustrates the power of Wnt-inhibition to reprogram the BBB into a fenestrated non-barrier vasculature: DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2016.03.002</p><p>In conjunction with the discussion of MFSD2A, I think David Silver's ground-breaking work on the lipid-transporting capacity of this molecule should be mentioned along with the reference to Ben-Zvi et al. (Gu lab): doi: 10.1038/nature13241</p><p>The similarity between the choroid plexus and ciliary body is striking and could be additionally cited by e.g. the work from Maria Lehtinen's lab on tumor development in these structures: doi: 10.1016/j.ajpath.2018.02.009.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these excellent suggestions. We have incorporated all three references into the text and we have expanded the Discussion (a new section titled âClinical Implicationsâ) to discuss, among other things, the Phoenix et al. study of vascular permeability in medulloblastoma.</p></body></sub-article></article>
