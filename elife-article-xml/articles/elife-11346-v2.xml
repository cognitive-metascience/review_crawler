understood. A large-scale screen for aggression-promoting neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> identified several independent hits that enhanced both inter-male aggression and courtship. Genetic intersections revealed that 8-10 P1 interneurons, previously thought to exclusively control male courtship, were sufficient to promote fighting. Optogenetic experiments indicated that P1 activation could promote aggression at a threshold below that required for wing extension. P1 activation in the absence of wing extension triggered persistent aggression via an internal state that could endure for minutes. High-frequency P1 activation promoted wing extension and suppressed aggression during photostimulation, whereas aggression resumed and wing extension was inhibited following photostimulation offset. Thus, P1 neuron activation promotes a latent, internal state that facilitates aggression and courtship, and controls the overt expression of these social behaviors in a threshold-dependent, inverse manner.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11346.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11346.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11346.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For most animals, mating and fighting are critical for survival and reproduction. These behaviors are also closely related and share similar actions. How are such complex behaviors hard-wired into the brain? A fruit fly called <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is an excellent system to investigate this problem, because flies mate and fight, and powerful genetic tools are available to probe the circuits of neurons that control these behaviors.</p><p>A great deal has been learned recently about the neural circuits that control mating, but much less was known about how the circuits for aggression are organized. Hoopfer et al. systematically activated different sets of neurons in thousands of male flies to try to find the circuits that trigger aggression. While this identified some neurons that specifically promoted aggression, it also uncovered a cluster – called P1 neurons – that promoted both aggression and courtship. This was unexpected, because P1 neurons were previously thought to only control courtship behavior.</p><p>The P1 neurons produced different behaviors at different stimulation thresholds, with the neurons requiring a stronger level of activation to promote courtship instead of aggression. Moreover, the P1 neurons triggered a lasting change in the internal state of the male that increased his tendency to engage in aggression or courtship. These results are reminiscent of observations made in mice, suggesting small groups of neurons that control mating and fighting may represent an evolutionarily conserved neural circuit &quot;motif&quot; for the control of social behavior.</p><p>The next step is to figure out how P1 neurons trigger a persistent internal state of arousal or motivation, and to determine whether and how this circuitry participates in the &quot;decision&quot; to engage in mating or fighting.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11346.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11346.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>aggression</kwd><kwd>courtship</kwd><kwd>internal state</kwd><kwd>persistence</kwd><kwd>fruitless</kwd><kwd>social behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ruth L.

It serves to establish dominance, or to defend or obtain resources, territory or mating partners. While it is part of most animals' normal behavioral repertoire, maladaptive aggression in humans takes an enormous toll on society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Filley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miczek et al., 2007</xref>). Yet, we know remarkably little about how the evolutionarily ancient capacity to fight is hardwired into the brain. How are aggression circuits functionally organized? Does the apparent conservation of this behavior across phylogeny reflect a conservation of the underlying neural circuitry? And how is the organization of this circuitry related to that of mating, a closely related social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Newman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Veening et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yang and Shah, 2014</xref>)?</p><p>Classical experiments in cats and rodents revealed the existence of localized 'centers' in the medial hypothalamus, whose artificial electrical stimulation was sufficient to trigger attack behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hess, 1928</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hess and Brügger, 1943</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Siegel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kruk, 2014</xref>).

However, in comparison to male courtship, where rapid progress has been made in identifying multiple Fru<sup>M</sup>-expressing cell types that control this behavior (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dickson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yamamoto et al., 2014</xref>), aggression circuitry is more poorly understood. Recently, through a small-scale screen of neuropeptide-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hergarden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tayler et al., 2012</xref>), we identified a population of ~3–5 sexually dimorphic Fru<sup>M</sup> neurons that control male aggression, via release of <italic>Drosophila</italic> tachykinin (DTK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, manipulation of that cell population had no influence on courtship behavior. Thus, DTK<sup>FruM</sup> neurons represent the first subclass of Fru<sup>M</sup>-expressing neurons that appears specific to the control of aggression.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> affords the ability to perform large-scale screens to identify neurons that control a behavior of interest (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rodan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Branson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simpson, 2009</xref>). However, this approach requires high-throughput behavioral assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wolf et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Branson et al., 2009</xref>), and aggression is typically scored manually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). Recently, however, automated computer algorithms for quantifying aggression in pairs of male flies have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hoyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dankert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kabra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>), overcoming this obstacle.</p><p>Here, we describe the first large-scale neuronal activation screen for aggression neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

Our results indicate, surprisingly, that at least a subset of P1 neurons, previously thought to control exclusively courtship, can promote male aggression as well. Moreover, we show that they exert this influence by inducing a persistent fly-intrinsic state, lasting for minutes, that enhances these behaviors. These data define a sexually dimorphic neural circuit node that may link internal states to the control of mating and fighting, and identify a potentially conserved circuit 'motif' for the control of social behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A large-scale neuronal activation screen yields multiple independent hits promoting both male wing-extension and aggressive behavior</title><p>To find neurons that promote aggressive behaviors we conducted an anatomically unbiased thermogenetic behavioral screen for increased aggression between non-aggressive group-housed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2008</xref>) males.

We generated spGAL4 AD and DBD 'hemi-driver' transgenic flies using the enhancers from each of the three parental lines and tested the different combinations for expression by crossing to UAS-myr::GFP. Indeed, the spGAL4 intersection of R15A01-AD and R71G01-DBD (henceforth referred to as P1<sup>a</sup> spGAL4) labeled approximately 8–10 Fru<sup>M</sup>-expressing P1 neurons per hemibrain (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Inagaki et al., 2013</xref>); no labeling was observed in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This number of labeled P1 neurons was similar to that in the parental R15A01-GAL4 line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In addition to P1 neurons, the P1<sup>a</sup> spGAL4 driver labeled a minor and variable population of neurons (&lt;4 per hemibrain) with cell bodies in the lateral horn (LH) that were neither Fru<sup>M</sup>-positive nor male-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Other hemi-driver intersectional combinations with R22G11-DBD showed a similar labeling pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). Thus, three independent hits from our screen of ~3,000 GAL4 lines labeled a common subset of P1 neurons.</p><p>Strikingly, dTrpA1 activation of P1<sup>a</sup> spGAL4 males resulted in a robust, temperature-dependent increase in both aggression and wing extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), compared to a control intersection of R15A01-AD and a driverless-DBD line (BDP-DBD).

To distinguish between these alternatives, we asked whether activation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons could promote unilateral attack towards a non-aggressive target fly. To do this, we paired group-housed P1<sup>a</sup>&gt;dTrpA1 males with group-housed wild-type (WT) Canton S males, which show little or no aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2008</xref>).

The lunging frequency per P1<sup>a</sup>&gt;dTrpA1 male was not significantly different between same genotype (P1<sup>a</sup> vs P1<sup>a</sup>) and mixed-genotype pairs (P1<sup>a</sup> vs WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

Finally, activation of other GAL4 lines that promoted increased unilateral wing extension behavior did not cause a concomitant increase in aggression (data not shown). These data indicate that increased male wing extension behavior is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the increased aggression phenotype.

To minimize interference with visual cues, which are important for aggression, we used the red-shifted opsin CsChrimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) at 685 nm, a wavelength to which flies are relatively insensitive, and low light-power density (0.02 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>). In order to compare the effects of photo-activation on lunging vs. wing extension in the same cohort of flies, we used the P1<sup>a</sup> spGAL4 driver, whose activation using dTrpA1 evoked both social behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Optogenetic stimulation of <italic>P1<sup>a</sup>&gt;CsChrimson</italic> male pairs was performed over a range of photostimulation (PS) frequencies between 1–50 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

This decline contrasted with the persistent wing extension observed following transient P1 activation in solitary flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Inagaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bath et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>, single males, t<sub>1/2</sub> = 56 ± 7 s). Therefore, we wondered whether it was caused by aggression per se, or rather reflected some independent parallel influence to suppress wing extension following stimulus offset. To address this possibility, we performed an epistasis experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) in which optogenetic P1 activation was performed while simultaneously inhibiting a population of <italic>Drosophila</italic> tachykinin-expressing, Fru<sup>M</sup> neurons (TK<sup>FruM</sup> neurons; a subset of so-called aSP6 Fru<sup>M</sup> neurons; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kohl et al., 2013</xref>) previously shown to be necessary and sufficient for aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, silencing of TK<sup>FruM</sup> neurons using Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baines et al., 2001</xref>) strongly suppressed the enhancement of lunging that occurred following termination of P1 photoactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, lunging, blue box and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>, bottom raster). This result indicates that TK<sup>FruM</sup> neurons are either functionally downstream of P1 neurons, or act in a parallel pathway required for aggression. Strikingly, although silencing TK<sup>FruM</sup> neurons had no effect to diminish or enhance wing extension during PS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>), it caused a strong and statistically significant increase in wing extension during the light OFF period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, right, red box; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>, bottom raster). In other words, silencing of TK<sup>FruM</sup> neurons in male pairs allowed P1<sup>a</sup> activation-induced wing extension to persist into the post-stimulation period, similar to the response of solitary flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Inagaki et al., 2013</xref>). These data indicate that the rapid decrease in wing extension observed following the offset of photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>) is indeed caused by the resumption of aggression.</p><p>To investigate further why the effect of P1 activation switches from promoting wing extension to aggression following photostimulation offset, we asked whether this switch was dependent on male-specific chemosensory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fernandez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang and Anderson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). To investigate this possibility, P1<sup>a</sup>&gt;ReaChR males were paired with target males lacking oenocytes (oe-), the cells which produce cuticular hydrocarbon pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Billeter et al., 2009</xref>).

To investigate whether this persistent fighting required repeated cycles of photostimulation, or rather could occur following a single high-intensity PS trial, we exposed P1<sup>a</sup>&gt;ReaChR male pairs to one 1-min episode of photoactivation. Under these conditions, wing extension was robustly induced during PS, but switched to aggression following PS offset; this lunging persisted for at least 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A−C</xref>). Such robust, persistent aggression could also be triggered by weaker photosimulation conditions that promoted only occasional wing extension bouts in a subset of flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D−F</xref>). Under these latter conditions, persistent post-PS aggression was triggered even in the cohort of fly pairs (8/22) that showed no wing extension at all during the PS period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, persistent aggression could be promoted by a single episode of P1<sup>a</sup> neuronal activation, and did not depend on male-male wing extension behavior during PS.</p><p>To determine whether the persistent aggression initiated by transient photoactivation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons reflected an enduring fly-intrinsic property, or rather a triggering event perpetuated by social feedback—i.e., iterative cycles of reciprocal attack—we paired P1<sup>a</sup>&gt;ReaChR flies with a group-housed, non-aggressive WT target fly (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Under these conditions, persistent attack towards the WT target lasting at least 10 min was triggered by a single episode of photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). These results suggested that persistent aggression was not simply perpetuated by self-sustaining cycles of attack and counter-attack, but likely reflected a long-lived internal state in the tester fly. However, it remained formally possible that the act of attacking and defeating the target fly was behaviorally self-reinforcing, as demonstrated in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fish et al., 2002</xref>). We therefore investigated whether such a persistent state required any social interactions at all, or could endure in a latent form in solitary flies.</p><p>To address this question, we modified our behavior arena so that the two flies were physically separated from each other during the PS period. We did this by adding a removable opaque barrier across the middle of the arena, thereby isolating the two flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, left; see Materials and methods). We optogenetically activated P1 neurons in such separated males for 1 min, and waited various lengths of time before removing the barrier and allowing the males to interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right). As expected, separated P1<sup>a</sup>&gt;ReaChR males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), but not BDPG4U&gt;ReaChR males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), showed a robust increase in wing extension during PS, which persisted after light offset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Inagaki et al., 2013</xref>). Upon removal of the barrier 1 min after PS offset (a time when the flies were still performing wing extensions), these P1<sup>a</sup> &gt;ReaChR males switched to aggression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref>, blue rasters). Strikingly, enhanced aggression was observed even when removal of the barrier was delayed for 10 min after the offset of PS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D and E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>), by which time persistent wing extension behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), as well as locomotor activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), had decayed to baseline levels for at least 5 min. The level of lunging after barrier removal for both the 1 min and 10 min conditions was significantly elevated compared to BDPG4U&gt;ReaChR controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), as well as control P1<sup>a</sup>&gt;ReaChR males that received no PS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Although the latency to lunging was not significantly different between barrier removal at 1 min vs. 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), the flies took longer to achieve maximal levels of aggression in the latter case, suggestive of a decay in the internal state promoted by P1<sup>a</sup> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Together, these experiments suggest that P1 neuron activation triggers a persistent internal state facilitating future social behaviors, which can endure for minutes in behaviorally quiescent solitary flies.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11346.019</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>P1 activation induces a persistent state that is fly intrinsic.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Assay and experimental design used to separate optogenetic activation from social interaction.

Here, we report the results of the first large-scale systematic screen, in any species, for neurons that promote inter-male aggression when artificially activated. Thermogenetic activation of ~3,000 <italic>Drosophila</italic> GAL4 lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>) using the temperature-sensitive cation channel dTrpA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>) yielded ~20 hits exhibiting elevated aggression, indicating a high level of specificity. While the majority of these hits displayed an aggression-specific phenotype (lunging, wing threat, tussling), three of them exhibited a mixture of increased aggression and increased inter-male courtship (measured as unilateral wing extension). Although each of these three hits expressed GAL4 under the control of a different DNA cis-regulatory element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</xref>), and labeled different groups of neurons numbering in the hundreds, the expression pattern of all three lines included P1 interneurons. Remarkably, intersectional experiments using the split-GAL4 technique revealed that the P1 neurons were virtually the only cells in common between these three hits, and, moreover, that these neurons were responsible for both the aggression and wing extension phenotypes. The fact that P1 neurons were independently recovered in three independent hits, constituting only 0.1% of the lines initially screened, and could be isolated from 'contaminating' cell types by carrying out pair-wise intersectional combinations of these hits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Luan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>), testifies to the reproducibility of the phenotype and the power of the screen to reveal rare populations of neurons that control social behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>P1 neurons can promote aggression as well as wing extension</title><p>The identification of P1 neurons in a screen for aggression-promoting neurons was surprising, as the prevailing view is that these cells specifically promote male courtship behavior, in response to female-specific pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kohatsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clowney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kallman et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, we were initially concerned that the elevated aggression phenotype might simply be an indirect, social response to elevated inter-male wing extensions promoted by P1 activation. However, in mixed-genotype pairs, activation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons produced aggression towards group-housed wild-type flies that did not exhibit any wing extension. Furthermore, activation with dTrpA1 of a small subset of Fru<sup>M</sup>+ P1 neurons (~2–5 of 20 per hemibrain) yielded flies that exhibited increased aggression without a concomitant increase in wing extension behavior. These data suggest that activation of P1 neurons promotes aggression in a fly-intrinsic manner, and is not an indirect social response provoked by elevated wing extension behavior.</p><p>Our evidence that P1 neurons play a role in aggression is, however, based on gain-of-function experiments. Unfortunately, attempts to demonstrate a requirement for P1 neurons during spontaneous aggression using various methods of cell inactivation or ablation have so far been unsuccessful. These negative results may reflect incomplete penetrance of effector function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Thum et al., 2006</xref>), expression of the effectors in only a subset of P1 neurons, redundant aggression circuits that act in parallel with P1, or they may indicate that P1 neurons promote aggression under some but not all conditions. Technical limitations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> currently preclude the ability to record neuronal activity from freely behaving flies engaged in social behavior, unlike the case in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lin et al., 2011</xref>), leaving open the question of whether P1 neurons are normally activated during aggressive encounters. Thus, while artificial activation of P1 neurons can promote aggression, it remains unclear whether they are normally required for this behavior, and if so under what circumstances.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>P1 neurons promote aggression and wing extension in a threshold-dependent, inverse manner</title><p>We found that the effect of P1 neurons to promote aggression vs. wing extension could be uncoupled, by systematically manipulating the level of activation using red-shifted optogenetic effectors. At low frequencies of photostimulation (≤20 Hz), a modest but significant increase in aggression was evoked, without any accompanying increase in unilateral wing extension behavior. Wing extension was evoked at photostimulation frequencies above 30 Hz. We note, however, that the ability to separate these two behaviors depended upon a number of experimental parameters, including light intensity, the type of effector used and the chromosomal insertion site of the effector. In general, however, weaker optogenetic stimulation tended to favor aggression, while higher levels favored wing extension. These data suggest that output from the P1 population can control different behaviors at different thresholds. However, we caution that the stimulation frequency-dependence of evoked aggression vs. wing extension behavior observed here may reflect our gain-of-function assay conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pan et al., 2012</xref>), and may not necessarily apply during naturally occurring male-male or male-female social behavior. Nevertheless, it is of interest that studies of hypothalamic circuits in mice have also revealed a threshold-dependent influence of optogenetic activation on mating and aggression (although opposite to the direction observed here) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). How and where these behavioral thresholds are set, and whether they involve common or distinct subsets of P1 neurons, will be an interesting topic for future investigation.</p><p>The temporal resolution afforded by optogenetic activation of P1 neurons also revealed an inverse relationship between the promotion of these two behaviors: at high stimulation frequencies (≥30 Hz), wing extension was promoted during the light ON phase, while aggression was suppressed; conversely, during the light OFF phase, aggression resumed and wing extension was suppressed. Our cellular epistasis experiment revealed that when aggression is inhibited, by silencing TK-GAL4<sup>1</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>), wing extension triggered by optogenetic activation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons persists into the light OFF phase, as described previously for single male flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Inagaki et al., 2013</xref>). This result indicates that aggressive behavior causally suppresses wing extension following the offset of photostimulation, suggestive of an inhibitory influence at the neural circuit or behavioral level. By extension, the suppression of lunging during the light ON phase may reflect a reciprocal inhibitory influence of courtship circuitry on aggression (however, the acute suppression of locomotor activity produced by strong optogenetic activation of P1 neurons may contribute to the inhibition of aggression as well). Rebound from such inhibition could then explain the rapid resumption of attack following the offset of high-intensity P1<sup>a</sup> photostimulation. The existence of reciprocal inhibitory influences between circuits controlling 'opponent' behaviors is well established (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kristan, 2008</xref>). Our observations raise the possibility that such mutual antagonism may control the choice between courtship and aggression as well.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>P1 activation promotes a persistent internal state that facilitates future social behavior</title><p>Previously, it was shown that transient activation of P1 neurons triggers persistent wing extension in solitary males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Inagaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bath et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clowney et al., 2015</xref>). However, because that persistent effect was detected as ongoing singing, it was not possible to distinguish whether it reflected a persistent <italic>internal</italic> state, or rather reflected singing-dependent sensori-motor positive-feedback. Since aggression requires a physical interaction between two flies, we were able to distinguish these alternatives by isolating the flies from each other during and after optogenetic P1 activation. This experiment revealed that transient activation of P1 neurons could result in enhanced aggression, even when physical contact between the flies was delayed for 10 min, long after persistent singing had decayed to baseline. Thus, activation of P1 neurons can induce a persistent, fly-intrinsic internal state (e.g., of arousal or motivation) that facilitates future social behavior. This state can endure without any increase in locomotor activity, suggesting that it does not simply reflect a state of generalized arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">van Swinderen and Andretic, 2003</xref>); however, it is difficult to prove that it exclusively influences social behavior.</p><p>The circuit-level mechanisms underlying the P1-induced persistent internal state remain to be elucidated. Potential mechanisms include the release of a long-lasting neuromodulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>), a recurrent excitatory circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">2008</xref>), or a cell-autonomous mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Major and Tank, 2004</xref>). Activation of P1 neurons themselves did not appear to trigger long-lasting persistent activity within this population, as measured by calcium imaging (Inagaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Identification of P1 'follower cells' that display persistent activity will be an important step towards solving this problem.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Interaction between P1 neurons and aggression circuits</title><p>Our results leave open the question of how P1 neurons promote aggression at the circuit level. In principle this influence could be direct or indirect. In a direct model, P1 neurons (or a specific subset thereof) could activate persistent aggression-specific circuits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In an indirect model, P1 neurons would trigger a persistent internal state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which is neutral with respect to aggression or courtship, and the influence of that state to promote aggression would be determined at a downstream site in the circuit. We observed that optogenetic activation of P1 neurons never triggered aggression in a stimulus-locked manner during the light ON phase, even during low frequency stimulation where no wing extension behavior was evoked; rather an increase in aggression was typically observed following PS offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, 10 Hz and 20 Hz). Such observations would seem to support an indirect model. However in preliminary studies, we have identified another small group of neurons from our screen, whose optogenetic activation promotes aggression but not courtship; these aggression-specific neurons can be activated by stimulation of P1 cells (Y. J., H. Chiu, E.D.H. and D.J.A., unpublished observations). Thus, it is possible that P1 neurons directly activate or prime persistent aggression-promoting circuitry, but that other effects of phasic photostimulation (e.g., locomotor arrest) interfere with overt fighting behavior.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11346.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Models for how P1 neurons may regulate courtship and aggression.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Alternative models for how P1 neurons influence aggression ('ag') vs. courtship ('ct')-promoting circuitry.

P1 neurons exert parallel and independent influences on downstream circuits that promote persistent internal states specific to aggression ('<italic>ps<sub>ag</sub></italic>') or courtship ('<italic>ps<sub>ct</sub></italic>'), at low and high thresholds, respectively. These influences may be exerted by common or distinct subpopulations of P1 neurons (not illustrated). Following the offset of phasic P1 activation, the persistent aggression state drives overt fighting behavior in the presence of a male conspecific. In the absence of a male (or presence of a female), persistent courtship behavior is expressed. Reciprocal inhibition between aggression and courtship circuitry is posited to occur at some point downstream of P1 neurons (blunt arrows), although if the P1 population is heterogeneous it could occur within that population as well (not shown). (<bold>B</bold>) 'Indirect' model. Activation of P1 neurons at a relatively low level triggers a persistent internal state ('<italic>ps</italic>') that is neutral with respect to aggression vs. courtship. This state can facilitate either social behavior, depending upon the sex of the conspecific encountered. A parallel, high-threshold pathway that directly activates command modules for courtship song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>) is included to account for the effect of acute optogenetic activation of P1 neurons to trigger stimulus-locked wing extension behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Inagaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bath et al., 2014</xref>).

Male flies fight only in the presence of an appetitive resource, such as food and/or mating partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jacobs, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hoffmann, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, aggression may occur when a male's brain detects both the presence of such a resource, and of a competitor male who threatens access to that resource. Since P1 neurons are activated by even brief contact with a female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kohatsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clowney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kohatsu and Yamamoto, 2015</xref>), the persistent internal state they engender by this low-level activation could provide an enduring representation of this resource—i.e., a memory of a mating partner. We speculate that this representation could be combined at a later time and place with the detection of a competing male, thereby triggering aggression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). At the same time, the inhibitory influence of acute P1 activation on fighting may serve to suppress aggression towards a female when a male fly is directly engaged in courtship or mating behavior. In this way, P1 neurons could exert both inhibitory and facilitatory influences on aggression, albeit on different time scales.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Implications for behavioral decision-making</title><p>The decision of whether to mate or fight is an important one for most animals, with implications for reproduction and survival at both the individual and species level. Our understanding of how this decision is made at the neural circuit level is limited. In principle, such a decision should reflect the combined influences of sensory cues (such as pheromones), past experience and internal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Certel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Certel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Palmer and Kristan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>). Tinbergen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tinbergen, 1951</xref>) proposed that such decisions are made in a hierarchical manner. According to his view, this decision hierarchy is implemented in the nervous system as a series of feed-forward connections between circuit nodes that control progressively more specific aspects of behavior. Thus, for example, the decision to engage in predator defense vs. reproductive behavior is made before the decision to engage in a particular reproductive activity, such as mating vs. fighting; this decision is in turn made before the decision between different aggressive actions is taken (e.g., threat display vs. physical attack) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tinbergen, 1950</xref>).</p><p>Although this model has relatively limited experimental support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pirger et al., 2014</xref>), a clear prediction is the existence of a 'higher-level' circuit node (or module) that controls multiple reproductive behaviors, including aggression and courtship. Our discovery of a small cluster of neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that collectively can control both fighting and mating behavior appears consistent with this prediction. Tinbergen also proposed that such common modules would be the site at which internal state influences exerted their effects to promote behavioral arousal or motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tinbergen, 1951</xref>). Our finding that P1 neurons promote a persistent internal state that facilitates both courtship and aggression would seem consistent with this proposal as well. The independent discovery of a relatively small population of neurons that controls mating and fighting in the mouse hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2014</xref>), moreover, suggests that such common nodes may represent an evolutionarily conserved circuit 'motif' for the organization and control of innate social behaviors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>A list of the full genotypes for the flies used in each figure can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

(2014)</xref>. Each arena contained 12 cylindrical chambers in a 4x3 array that measured 12 mm high x 16 mm diameter. The walls of the chamber were coated with Insect-a-Slip (Bioquip Products, Rancho Dominguez, CA) and the clear acrylic top plate was coated with SurfaSil Siliconizing Fluid (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) to discourage flies from walking on these surfaces. The floor of the arenas was composed of clear acrylic covered with a uniform layer (~1 mm thick) of apple juice-agarose food (2.5% (w/v) sucrose and 2.25% (w/v) agarose in apple juice). The arenas were illuminated from beneath with visible light by Cold Cathode fluorescent backlights (Edmund Optics, Barringtion, NJ) and ambient overhead room lighting. Flies were introduced into the chambers by gentle aspiration through a hole in the top plate and allowed to acclimate to the chamber for 2–5 min prior to the start of the recording. In all experiments, males from separate vials were paired in the same chamber during the assay, so the males were naïve to each other.</p><p>Males were reared at 21°C, collected 1–2 days after eclosion and group-housed at a density of 16–18 males per vial at 21°C on standard fly medium for 6–7 days. Rearing and housing were done in a light cycling incubator set for a 16/12 hr light/dark cycle. dTrpA1 activation experiments were run at 29°C, with the exception of experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, which were run at 32°C to increase efficacy of dTrpA1 activation.

This identifying feature was used to manually correct the fly identities after automated tracking (see below). Wing clipping was done two days prior to the behavior assay by cold-anesthetizing the males on ice. A similar surgical procedure was used for wingless male experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Optogenetic activation</title><p>A detailed description of the setup used for optogenetic activation experiments can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Inagaki et al.

Experiments were performed in 8-well arenas (2x4 array) with IR backlighting (855 nm, SOBL-200x150-850, SmartVision Lights, Muskegon, MI). A high-powered LED was mounted 11 cm above the top of each chamber at a 24° angle to maximize light exposure. Photostimulation (PS) with different wavelengths of light was performed with the following LEDs: Rebel 10 mm square CoolBase LEDs (Luxeon Star LEDs, luxeonstar.com) at 530 nm (125 lm at 700 mA, SR-05-M0070) and 627 nm (102 lm at 700 mA, SR-05-D2050), and 680-690 nm 1w Red LED with star PCB (FD-14R-Y1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ledfedy.com">www.ledfedy.com</ext-link>). Light intensity was measured with a photodiode power sensor (S130VC, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) placed at the location of the behavior chambers with the arena absent. Measurements were taken at different voltage inputs and averaged across four readings.</p><p>For both ReaChR and CsChrimson experiments, males were raised at 25°C on standard fly media, collected 1−2 days after eclosion and housed in the dark for 6−7 days on food containing 0.4 mM all <italic>trans</italic>-Retinal (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).

Males were loaded on separate sides of the barrier and allowed to acclimate for 2 min before recording. The barriers were manually removed after the end of the PS and the time period from 1 s prior to 10 s after barrier removal was not tracked (see below), because the movement of the barrier interfered with tracking.</p><p>Ablation of oenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>) was carried out as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al.

For the GAL4 neuronal activation screen, pairs of males were tracked and automated scores of lunging and unilateral wing extension behaviors were derived using CADABRA software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dankert et al., 2009</xref>). For all other experiments shown in the paper, flies were tracked using Caltech FlyTracker software (Eyrún Eyjólfsdóttir &amp; Pietro Perona, Caltech), which is available for download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Tools/FlyTracker/">http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Tools/FlyTracker/</ext-link>.

For a description of the video datasets that were used to train the classifiers see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3A</xref>. Performance of the classifiers against an independent set of manually scored videos is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3B</xref>. To validate classifiers we manually scored a set of ground-truth videos for lunging and wing extension using the 'ground-truthing' mode in JAABA. A randomly selected set of frames from the ground-truth videos was manually labeled as positive or negative for the behavior of interest on a frame-by-frame basis. Frames where there was no uncertainty as to behavior label were labeled as 'important' to distinguish them from frames where we could not unambiguously decide the label. The error rates, precision and recall between the ground-truth and predicted labels were calculated for all frames labeled, as well as for the ‘important’ frames only (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). For experiments where a small difference in wing extensions between experimental and control genotypes was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D−F</xref>), the wing extension scores were manually curated to eliminate possible false-positives.

All behavioral data were analyzed with nonparametric tests. The cutoff for significance was set as an alpha α&lt;0.05. The number of pairs tested in each experiment is specified in the figure legends. Sample size was determined based on an initial power analysis performed on our parental GAL4 screen. Each experiment was repeated at least twice on independent groups of flies. Outliers were defined as data points falling outside 1.5-times the interquartile range of the data, and were not excluded from statistical analyses. For pairwise <italic>between</italic> group comparisons we performed Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-tests, and for pairwise <italic>within</italic> group comparisons we used Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Comparisons of three or more groups that did not involve repeated measures were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis (ANOVA) test. In the case of a significant main effect, post-hoc pairwise Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-tests were performed. For within genotype comparisons over multiple treatments we performed a Friedman’s test. In the case of a significant main effect, post-hoc pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed. In both cases, post-hoc test were corrected for multiple comparisons using Dunn’s or Bonferroni correction, as noted in the figure legends. A sign test was used to determine whether the proportion of lunging to wing extensions at different light frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) was different from a hypothetical median value of zero.</p><p>Identification of behavioral hits in neuronal activation screen was done by testing for GAL4 lines that showed a statistical increase in lunging, tussling, wing threat or wing extension with dTrpA1 at 29°C compared to pBDPGAL4U controls, which were pooled from the entire screen (n=226 pairs). A Kruskal-Wallis test was used, followed by Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-tests between the pBDPGAL4U control and individual lines, which were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. These hits were then verified by manual inspection of behavior scores to eliminate false-positives from the CADABRA behavior classifiers.</p><p>Linear regressions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and non-linear regressions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>) were done in Prism6. The fraction of pairs performing lunging or wing extension was binned in 10 s time intervals. A linear model was fit to the data and the best-fit value of the slope was calculated. For non-linear regressions, a sigmoidal function was fit to the data and the best-fit value for the half-maximal response (t<sub>1/2</sub>) was calculated. Goodness of fit was tested by two-way ANOVA between the predicted function (line or sigmoid) and the actual fraction of flies performing the behavior, which indicated a good fit in all cases.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fly histology</title><p>Dissections, fixation and staining of adult brains and ventral nerve cords were carried out at 4°C unless otherwise specified.

Brains were washed between each incubation step with six 15 min washes in PBT. After staining, brains were incubated overnight in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) before mounting. Confocal serial optical sections were collected either with a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with a Plan-Apochromat 20x/0.8 M27objective and a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 oil immersion objective, or a FluoView FV1000 Confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Waltham, MA) with a 30×/1.05-NA silicone oil objective (Olympus).

Brains were imaged in an intact male using a head fixed preparation as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Inagaki et al., (2012)</xref>.

A small window in the cuticle was made and the fat bodies and air sacs were gently removed to give a clear view of the brain. The saline was changed prior to imaging to remove any debris.</p><p>Two-photon imaging was performed essentially as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Inagaki et al. (2013)</xref>. Imaging was performed on an Ultima two-photon laser-scanning microscope (Bruker) with an imaging wavelength of 940 nm. We used a 525/50 nm (center wavelength/bandwidth) band-pass filter (ET525/50m, Chroma Technology, Bellow Falls, VT) in the emission pathway to detect the GCaMP6s fluorescence. The scanning resolution was 128×128 pixels with an 8 μsec dwell time per pixel, 4x optical zoom and 1 Hz scanning speed. A 40×/0.80-NA water-immersion objective (Olympus) was used for imaging.</p><p>To activate Chrimson we used a high-power deep-red LED (660 nm) collimated with an optic fiber (M660F1, Thorlabs). The optic fiber was connected to a fiber optic holder (Product #56200, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) equipped with a 660 nm band-pass filter (Product #67836, Edmund Optics) to narrow the bandwidth of the LED output, and a neutral density filter (OD2.0; NE20B-A, Thorlabs) to reduce the light intensity. We used a 200 μm core multimode optic fiber (NA, 0.39; FT200EMT, Thorlabs) to deliver light from the fiber optic holder to the brain. A bare tip was custom-made on one side of the fiber and this tip was immersed in the saline bath and placed 250 μm away from the brain.</p><p>We set the light intensity to be 0.93 μW at the tip of the optic fiber. At a distance of 250 μm from the tip of a 0.39-NA optic fiber the light power at the surface of the brain was calculated to be approximately 27.5 μW/mm<sup>2</sup>. This light intensity was determined empirically by optimizing the neutral density filter and input voltage to the LED to find a condition that gave robust GCaMP responses in P1 neurons at the maximum PS frequency (50 Hz) and no responses at minimum PS frequency (1 Hz). A 10 ms pulse-width was used at each frequency.</p><p>Images were collected from multiple focal planes to ensure that the majority of P1 cells were captured. The PS protocol (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) was delivered at each focal plane before imaging the next. An ROI was manually drawn around each cell body and the fluorescence signal from the ROI was smoothed with a moving average (window = 5 frames). The average signal before stimulation was used as F<sub>0</sub> to calculate the ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> (ΔF/F). For each cell, a single focal plane in which we observed the highest ΔF/F was used for analysis. Normalized ΔF/F values for each cell were calculated by dividing ΔF/F by the maximum ΔF/F of the cell. The peak ΔF/F at each stimulation frequency was selected by finding the maximum normalized ΔF/F during the 30 s stimulation window. For the pre-stimulation peak value, we determined the maximum during the 30 s window 5 s prior to the first PS.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Barret Pfeiffer for design, construction, and gift of the Chrimson and OpGcamp lines, construction of the GAL4 collection and LexAop-Flp lines and for advice and discussions; Hui Chiu for contributions, discussions and for sharing her unpublished data; Heather Dionne and Christine Murphy for construction of split-GAL4 and LexA lines; Kenta Asahina, Stefanie Hampel, Andrew Seeds, Moriel Zelikowsky, Weizhe Hong and Allan Wong for advice and discussions; Richard Axel for critical comments on the manuscript; Pietro Perona and Eyrún Eyjólfsdótir for FlyTracker software; Kristin Branson and Mayank Kabra for help with JAABA classifiers; Frank Midgley and Jinyang Liu for help modifying the CADABRA software for a computer cluster; Guss Lott for gVision software; Barry Dickson, Bruce Baker and Yufeng Pan for GAL4 lines; Sharon Low and Mary Phillips for technical assistance with behavioral assays; Karen Hibbard, Monti Mercer, James McMahon and Marcela Arenas-Sanchez for fly husbandry; Celine Chiu for laboratory management; Gina Mancuso, Crystal Sullivan, Sarah Moorehead and Emily Willis for administrative assistance; Kevin Moses, the Janelia Visiting Scientist Program and the Fly Olympiad Program for support.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>EDH, Conducted all experiments except for the functional imaging, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>YJ, Conducted the functional imaging experiment, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>HKI, Generated the ReaChR transgenic flies and established the optogenetic behavior system, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>GMR, Contributed to the design of genetic intersection strategies, Conception and design, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>DJA, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="SD1-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11346.022</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Genetic intersections used to target P1 neurons.</title> <p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11346.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11346.022</ext-link></p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-11346-supp1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD2-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11346.023</object-id><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Full genotypes of flies in each experiment.</title> <p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11346.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11346.023</ext-link></p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-11346-supp2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD3-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11346.024</object-id><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Training datasets and performance of JAABA classifiers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The videos and genotypes of flies used to train the lunging and wing extension classifiers.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Mani Ramaswami as Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have extensively discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript provides compelling evidence that P1 interneurons can promote inter-male aggression and thus are not solely involved in courtship behavior, as generally assumed. The core claim(s) presented by these authors is that P1 neurons (at least a subset of them) mediate aggression as well as courtship. This is based on findings of an innovative and impressive screen for neurons whose activation triggers aggressive behaviors, as well as careful genetic follow up experiments, that identify a role for P1 neurons in aggression as well as the already established role in courtship. The claim is extended to the idea that P1 neurons are multiplex units as illustrated by differential functional outcomes associated with differential levels of stimulation. Deploying optogenetic stimulation in different ways, the authors show that weak activation of P1 neurons promotes aggression and no courtship, while stronger activation evokes wing extension, i.e. courtship behavior, and suppressed aggression. Hence both social behaviors are reciprocally controlled by activation of P1 neurons representing an antagonistic interaction between the aggression and courtship circuitry. In addition the authors show that aggression behavior can persist more than 10 min. and requires chemosensory cues on a conspecific target to be induced.</p><p>The manuscript stands out for the excellence of the experiments, the quality of the data, and for showing for the first time that central P1 neurons have potential functions in behaviors outside courtship, and thus enabling new experiments to dissect the diversity of P1 neurons as well as their potentially diverse upstream and downstream circuitry.</p><p>Overall criticisms to be addressed in a rewritten manuscript:</p><p>A major issue with the paper is that many of the most interesting issues raised by the authors are actually inferences consistent with the experiments but not proven or even tested by the experiments performed. There is disappointment when problems and questions raised in the Introduction are not actually resolved. Therefore, the authors should rewrite the Introduction, and where appropriate the lead-in to experimental sections with a clear focus on what is actually shown by the data, and consider potential wider implications of the observations to a revised Discussion. A revised manuscript should explicitly acknowledge (or address through decisive new experiments) questions that remain to be addressed at the end of this work.</p><p>Below are examples of issues that are not resolved.</p><p>A) We do not know that P1 neurons actually respond (in situ) to differentially to ambient stimuli (pheromones, behavioral displays, attacks, sexual encounters). Thus, we see how a decision might be made but there is nothing that directly speaks to how decisions are actually made, let alone whether they are made as shared hierarchically organized modules or labeled lines.</p><p>B) We do not know whether different subpopulations of P1 neurons are involved. We do not even know which P1 neurons are in play here (recent estimates in Pan and Baker state that there are ~40 of these and most experiments in study is work with ~10).</p><p>C) Does low vs high stimulation lead to different levels of activity for each neuron or recruitment of multiple neurons? Does it refer to different stimulus threshold for different neuronal subpopulations?</p><p>D) Are P1 neurons involved as determinants of male-male courtship and male-male aggression as well as male-female courtship? If they are, is the decision to do one or the other of these things a consequence of levels of stimulation or is it downstream? It seems plausible that specific subpopulations of P1 neurons determine the level and perhaps quality of arousal and do not specifically determine specific outcomes. On the other hand to the extent that circuitry down stream of P1 neurons is known, it is usually discussed with regard to effectors. With this in mind is the downstream neural circuitry that drives male-male courtship very different from aggression?</p><p>E) What does the decision look like at a neural or biochemical level?</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The question re labeled lines or overlapping circuit nodes (Introduction, second paragraph) that places the work in a context established by Anderson and Tinbergen does not belong in the Introduction. Presenting these questions and issues here leads to the expectation that the authors have resolved these issues in the paper. However, as implicitly acknowledged in the Discussion, these are not resolved or addressed by the experiments presented. Anderson and Tinbergen could be more appropriately considered in a revised Discussion. Which should also consider a parsimonious explanation consistent with the authors' observations, that P1 interneurons promote state or arousal that may not be restricted to aggression and mating. For all we know P1 neurons may feed into additional behavioral options that are context dependent.</p><p>2) In the last paragraph of the Introduction the authors state a broad hypothesis clearly that is not resolved by the data. The data show that when the neurons are manipulated these responses can be observed. There is no evidence (as the authors later acknowledge in the Discussion) that P1 neurons are active for aggression under normal conditions.</p><p>3) The absence of evidence that this aggression is via social feedback does not prove that the signals are &quot;fly-autonomous.&quot;</p><p>4) The second paragraph of the subsection “A large-scale neuronal activation screen yields multiple independent hits promoting both male courtship and aggressive behavior” claims that these findings are interesting because of the relationship between aggression circuitry and courtship circuitry in mammals. This relationship has been linked to gene pathways in flies by the Kravitz lab in de la Paz Fernandez et al. (2010) and by other work from David's lab – both cited later.</p><p>In the second paragraph of the subsection “P1 neuron activation promotes inter-male aggression” of the Discussion, the authors summarize aspects of the thorny issue being raised in this critique. They also point to some specific missing lines of proof that would be required to justify the claims that appear to be made in this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11346.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Overall criticisms to be addressed in a rewritten manuscript:</italic></p><p><italic>A major issue with the paper is that many of the most interesting issues raised by the authors are actually inferences consistent with the experiments but not proven or even tested by the experiments performed.

A revised manuscript should explicitly acknowledge (or address through decisive new experiments) questions that remain to be addressed at the end of this work.</italic> We agree with the reviewers’ comment. To address this point, we have completely rewritten the Introduction and Discussion, as well as certain key transition sections in the Results. As requested, all mention of behavioral decision-making, Tinbergen, etc. has now been removed from the Introduction and shifted to the final section of the Discussion. We now frame the study in a way that emphasizes its central objective and novel findings, and separates them clearly from the important but unresolved issues raised by the reviewers. These latter are now addressed in the new Discussion, in different subsections.</p><p><italic>Below are examples of issues that are not resolved.</italic> </p><p><italic>A) We do not know that P1 neurons actually respond (in situ) to differentially to ambient stimuli (pheromones, behavioral displays, attacks, sexual encounters). Thus, we see how a decision might be made but there is nothing that directly speaks to how decisions are actually made, let alone whether they are made as shared hierarchically organized modules or labeled lines.</italic> </p><p>Studies from other laboratories, cited in the original and current versions, show that P1 neurons respond to pheromonal as well as to visual cues. We agree that our paper does not show how the decision to mate vs. fight is actually made, and apologize if we gave the impression that we intended to solve and had solved this problem; it was presented as the broader context to which this work is relevant. We have now de-emphasized this point until the end of the Discussion, in the revised version.</p><p><italic>B) We do not know whether different subpopulations of P1 neurons are involved. We do not even know which P1 neurons are in play here (recent estimates in Pan and Baker state that there are ~40 of these and most experiments in study is work with ~10).</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is an important and unresolved issue. The neurons manipulated in our P1<sup>a</sup> split GAL4 line are a deterministic subset of the ~40 neurons identified by Pan and Baker. Our results from the <italic>fru<sup>FLP</sup></italic> intersection experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) show that activation of as few as 2-5 P1 neurons/hemibrain can produce aggression but not courtship. However it is not possible to conclude whether this is a deterministic (aggression-specific) or stochastic subset of the cells. The frequency titration experiments using CsChrimson (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and the new imaging data supporting these experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> (see point (C), below) are consistent with the idea that the average level of activity among the P1<sup>a</sup> subset of P1 neurons determines the behavioral outcome. However, they do not preclude the possibility of functional heterogeneity within this subpopulation, as we acknowledged in the original submission. Our ability to resolve this issue at the level of single, identified neurons is currently limited by available technology. We have acknowledged this as an open question in the revised Discussion: “How and where these behavioral thresholds are set, and whether they involve common or distinct subsets of P1 neurons, will be an interesting topic for future investigation”.</p><p><italic>C) Does low vs high stimulation lead to different levels of activity for each neuron or recruitment of multiple neurons? Does it refer to different stimulus threshold for different neuronal subpopulations?</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent question. To address this issue we have added a new supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> that shows the neuronal responses of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons to increasing frequencies of Chrimson stimulation. Briefly, we co-expressed GCaMP6s and Chrimson with P1<sup>a</sup> spGAL4 and stimulated at the same frequencies used in the behavioral experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We find that the 6 P1<sup>a</sup> neurons sampled (in each of n=3 flies) show a roughly linear increase in activity across the photostimulation range of ~10-50Hz, and that the normalized response is similar across the sampled neurons. This suggests that increasing the stimulation frequency increases the activity of each P1<sup>a</sup> neuron to a similar extent, and provides no evidence of differential recruitment of different subsets at different stimulation thresholds.</p><p><italic>D) Are P1 neurons involved as determinants of male-male courtship and male-male aggression as well as male-female courtship? If they are, is the decision to do one or the other of these things a consequence of levels of stimulation or is it downstream? It seems plausible that specific subpopulations of P1 neurons determine the level and perhaps quality of arousal and do not specifically determine specific outcomes. On the other hand to the extent that circuitry down stream of P1 neurons is known, it is usually discussed with regard to effectors. With this in mind is the downstream neural circuitry that drives male-male courtship very different from aggression?</italic> </p><p>All of the reviewers’ questions are on point and are considered in the revised Discussion (subsection “Interaction between P1 neurons and aggression circuits”). We have now included two new schematics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A-B</xref> to illustrate two possible models to explain the results. To answer the reviewers’ last question, the immediate downstream neural circuitry that drives male-male courtship involves a descending interneuron called pIP10. Activation of pIP10 neurons promoted wing extension (as reported by von Philipsborn et al. (2011), but in our hands did not promote aggression. In preliminary experiments, we have identified a small group (2-3/hemibrain) of cells that are activated by P1 neurons; optogenetic activation of these neurons in freely behaving flies promotes aggression but not courtship. These unpublished data are now mentioned in the aforementioned subsection. Together these results suggest that courtship and aggression circuits likely diverge downstream of P1 neurons.</p><p><italic>E) What does the decision look like at a neural or biochemical level?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer appears to be asking about the molecular and circuit-level mechanisms that control the decision between aggression vs. courtship. We share the reviewers’ curiosity. Our results identify an important cellular point-of-entry to this problem, by revealing an unexpected connection between P1 neurons and aggression. However, elucidating the biochemical or circuit mechanisms that underlie this decision will take years of further work, and is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The question re labeled lines or overlapping circuit nodes (Introduction, second paragraph) that places the work in a context established by Anderson and Tinbergen does not belong in the Introduction. Presenting these questions and issues here leads to the expectation that the authors have resolved these issues in the paper. However, as implicitly acknowledged in the Discussion, these are not resolved or addressed by the experiments presented. Anderson and Tinbergen could be more appropriately considered in a revised Discussion. Which should also consider a parsimonious explanation consistent with the authors' observations, that P1 interneurons promote state or arousal that may not be restricted to aggression and mating. For all we know P1 neurons may feed into additional behavioral options that are context dependent.</italic> We take the reviewers' point. As mentioned above, we have now moved the discussion of the potential relevance of our observations to Tinbergen’s model from the Introduction to the Discussion section (subsection “Implications for behavioral decision-making”). This discussion is now clearly presented as a speculative inference at the end of the paper, rather than as a central question raised and answered by the study.</p><p>The review also raised the question of whether the state or arousal promoted by P1 neurons is specific to aggression and mating, or whether it might be more general and affect other behaviors. Since it is not practical to explore the entire space of fly behaviors that might be affected by manipulating P1 cells, this is a difficult question to answer conclusively, as we now acknowledge in the Discussion (subsection “P1 activation promotes a persistent internal state that facilitates future social behavior”). However, our data do show that transient P1 activation does not cause any persistent increase in locomotor activity in solitary flies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As increased locomotion is considered a sine qua non of enhanced behavioral arousal in flies, this provides some evidence against the &quot;parsimonious explanation&quot; advanced by the reviewers. To what extent P1 neurons influence other non-social behaviors remains an interesting question for future investigation.</p><p><italic>2) In the last paragraph of the Introduction the authors state a broad hypothesis clearly that is not resolved by the data. The data show that when the neurons are manipulated these responses can be observed. There is no evidence (as the authors later acknowledge in the Discussion) that P1 neurons are active for aggression under normal conditions.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is an important caveat of our work. Unfortunately it is currently not technically possible to monitor the activity of neurons during aggression under normal conditions in freely behaving flies. We now point this out and make explicit this caveat, in the subsection “P1 neurons can promote aggression as well as courtship” of the revised Discussion. We have also revised the wording of the Introduction to emphasize that our results indicate what P1 cells <italic>can</italic> do (lines 96-99).</p><p><italic>3) The absence of evidence that this aggression is via social feedback does not prove that the signals are &quot;fly-autonomous.&quot;</italic> </p><p>We have changed the wording to &quot;fly-intrinsic&quot; in the sense that it does not require social behavioral signals extrinsic to the fly. We have also clarified that the motivation for the mixed-pair experiment is to address the distinction between an increase in aggression that depends on a reciprocal exchange of social behavioral signals between the two males, vs. an increase that is intrinsic to one male and does not depend on counter-attack or courtship from the other male (subsection “P1-enhanced aggressiveness is fly-intrinsic and not a social response to increased courtship”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) The second paragraph of the subsection “A large-scale neuronal activation screen yields multiple independent hits promoting both male courtship and aggressive behavior” claims that these findings are interesting because of the relationship between aggression circuitry and courtship circuitry in mammals. This relationship has been linked to gene pathways in flies by the Kravitz lab in de la Paz Fernandez et al. (2010) and by other work from David's lab – both cited later.</italic> </p><p>The context of this transition was the link between courtship and aggression circuits. De la Paz Fernandez et al. (2010) focused on chemosensory signals, not circuits. We have now referred in this context to other work from the Kravitz lab that links the control of aggression and courtship behavior to octopaminergic neurons (subsection “A large-scale neuronal activation screen yields multiple independent hits promoting both male courtship and aggressive behavior“, second paragraph). We have also deleted the statement that these findings are &quot;interesting,&quot; and stated simply that they &quot;drew our attention&quot;.</p><p><italic>In the second paragraph of the subsection “P1 neuron activation promotes inter-male aggression” of the Discussion, the authors summarize aspects of the thorny issue being raised in this critique. They also point to some specific missing lines of proof that would be required to justify the claims that appear to be made in this manuscript.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers note that we pointed out the caveats of interpretation in our original submission. Since the comment above is a statement of fact and not a question, it is not clear what additional revision is being requested. We have revised this section in the Discussion, and have now explicitly stated that &quot;Thus, while activation of P1 neurons can enhance aggression, it remains unclear whether they are normally required for this behavior, and if so under what circumstances.&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
