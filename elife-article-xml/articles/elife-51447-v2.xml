during development and is implicated in cancer and type-2 diabetes. The mechanisms by which Tcf7l2 and Wnt/β-Catenin signalling elicit such a diversity of biological outcomes are poorly understood. Here, we study the function of zebrafish <italic>tcf7l2</italic> alternative splice variants and show that only variants that include exon five or an analogous human <italic>tcf7l2</italic> variant can effectively provide compensatory repressor function to restore eye formation in embryos lacking <italic>tcf7l1a/tcf7l1b</italic> function. Knockdown of exon five specific <italic>tcf7l2</italic> variants in <italic>tcf7l1a</italic> mutants also compromises eye formation, and these variants can effectively repress Wnt pathway activity in reporter assays using Wnt target gene promoters. We show that the repressive activities of exon5-coded variants are likely explained by their interaction with Tle co-repressors. Furthermore, phosphorylated residues in Tcf7l2 coded exon5 facilitate repressor activity. Our studies suggest that developmentally regulated splicing of <italic>tcf7l2</italic> can influence the transcriptional output of the Wnt pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>tcf7l2</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>eye development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>088175</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Rodrigo M</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Stephen W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Joint Project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allende</surname><given-names>Miguel L</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Stephen W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/L003775/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Stephen W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104682/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Stephen W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Curie Incoming International Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Rodrigo M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002850</institution-id><institution>National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1180606</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allende</surname><given-names>Miguel L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fund for Research Centres in Priority Areas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allende</surname><given-names>Miguel L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C1295/A15937H</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ewan</surname><given-names>Kenneth B</given-names></name><name><surname>Dale</surname><given-names>Trevor C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The inclusion of a new alternatively spliced exon in <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> can switch its function to repress transcription of Wnt target genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wnt signalling has a broad array of biological functions, from regional patterning and fate specification during embryonic development to tissue homeostasis and stem cell niche maintenance in adult organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Amerongen and Nusse, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>). Because of its relevance to such a diversity of processes, Wnt pathway misregulation is linked to a range of diseases such as cancer and diabetes, and neurological/behavioural conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>). Wnts can activate several intracellular pathways, and the branch that controls gene expression works specifically through β-catenin and the small family of T-Cell transcription factors (Tcfs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cadigan and Waterman, 2012b</xref>).</p><p>In absence of Wnt ligand, intracellular β-catenin levels are kept low by a mechanism that involves its phosphorylation by GSK-3β and CK1α, which is mediated by the scaffolding of β-catenin by Axin1 and APC, in what is termed the destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MacDonald and He, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Niehrs, 2012</xref>). Phosphorylated β-catenin is ubiquitilated and degraded in the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">MacDonald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Niehrs, 2012</xref>). In this context, Tcf transcription factors actively repress the transcription of downstream genes by interacting with Groucho(Gro)/TLE co-repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cadigan and Waterman, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoppler and Waterman, 2014</xref>). When cells are exposed to Wnt ligand, the destruction complex is disassembled and β-catenin is no longer phosphorylated and committed to degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">MacDonald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Niehrs, 2012</xref>). This promotes the translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus where it displaces Gro/TLE co-repressors from interacting with Tcfs and activating the transcription of Wnt target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cadigan and Waterman, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoppler and Waterman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schuijers et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, Tcf proteins are thought to work as transcriptional switches that can activate transcription in the presence of Wnt ligands or repress transcription in their absence.</p><p>During development, ensuring appropriate levels of Wnt/β-catenin signalling is essential for many processes. For instance, during gastrulation, specification of the eyes and telencephalon can only occur when Wnt/β-catenin signalling is low or absent, and overactivation of the pathway in the anterior neuroectoderm mispatterns the neural plate leading to embryos with no eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heisenberg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kiecker and Niehrs, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">van de Water et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Houart et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dorsky et al., 2003</xref>). Illustrating this, fish embryos mutant for <italic>axin1</italic>, a member of the β-catenin destruction complex, are eyeless because cells fail to phosphorylate β-catenin, leading to abnormally high levels of the protein, mimicking a Wnt active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heisenberg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">van de Water et al., 2001</xref>). Similarly, it has been shown that <italic>tcf7l1a/headless</italic> mutants also mimic Wnt/β-catenin overactivation suggesting that it is necessary to actively repress Wnt/β-catenin target genes for regional patterning to occur normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Young et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates, Lef/Tcf transcription factors constitute a family of four genes: <italic>lef1</italic>, <italic>tcf7 (tcf1)</italic>, <italic>tcf7l1 (tcf3)</italic> and <italic>tcf7l2 (tcf4)</italic>. All contain a highly conserved β-catenin binding domain (β-catenin-BD) at the amino-terminal (N-terminal) end and a high mobility group box (HMG-box) DNA binding domain in the middle of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cadigan and Waterman, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoppler and Waterman, 2014</xref>). All Lef/Tcf proteins bind the 5’-CCTTTGATS-3’ (S = G/C) DNA motif, but can also bind to sequences that diverge from this consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van de Wetering et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Beest et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hallikas and Taipale, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atcha et al., 2007</xref>). The fact that all Lef/Tcfs bind to the same motif has led to the notion that the functional specificity of Lef/Tcf proteins may be imparted by inclusion or exclusion of functional motifs by alternative transcription start sites or alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoppler and Waterman, 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Description and expression of a new alternatively spliced exon in zebrafish <italic>tcf7l2</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of variants of Tcf7l2 arising from different splice forms (not to scale).

All the variations in Lef/Tcf proteins described above may contribute to their functional diversity, an idea that is supported by the fact that Lef/Tcfs control many different subsets of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cadigan and Waterman, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hrckulak et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Tcf7l2 has various known roles including a requirement during establishment of left-right asymmetry in the habenulae and for the maintenance of the stem cell compartment in colon and skin epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Korinek et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hüsken et al., 2014</xref>).

Overall, this suggests that many regulatory inputs could influence the transcriptional output of Tcf7l2.</p><p>In this study, we address the role of alternative splicing in mediating the functional properties of Tcf7l2 during early nervous system development. Our results show that alternative splicing of <italic>tcf7l2</italic> significantly impacts the transcriptional repressor activity of the encoded protein. <italic>tcf7l2</italic> splice variants have been characterised in humans and, to a lesser extent, in mice and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duval et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Young et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weise et al., 2010</xref>), but little information is available on different roles for the splice variants. In zebrafish, <italic>tcf7l2</italic> is first expressed in the anterior neuroectoderm by the end of gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Young et al., 2002</xref>) and in this study, we show that at this stage, <italic>tcf7l2</italic> is only expressed as long C-terminal variants that can include a newly identified alternative exon 5. We show that only zebrafish Tcf7l2 variants that include the coded exon five and comparable human Tcf7l2 variants effectively provide the repressive function required to promote eye specification. Moreover, only these variants are effective in repressing Wnt target gene promoters in luciferase assays, probably due to interaction with Gro/Tle co-repressors. We further show that two phosphorylated amino acids coded by exon 5 of Tcf7l2 are required for this interaction, and overall repressive function. Hence, our results suggest that alternative exon five in zebrafish <italic>tcf7l2</italic> could play a critical role in mediating transcriptional repression of Wnt pathway target genes. Our data also suggest that through inclusion of the region coded by exon 5, Tcf7l2 could be part of a phosphorylation regulatory module that keeps the Wnt pathway in an ‘off’ state by phosphorylating β-catenin in the cytoplasm and Tcf7l2 in the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterisation of a novel <italic>tcf7l2</italic> alternative splice variant</title><p>With the aim of addressing the functional roles of different <italic>tcf7l2</italic> splice variants, we cloned the zebrafish splice forms in the CDRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

As only the 45L-Tcf7l2 variant, which includes exon5, can efficiently restore eye formation in <italic>Ztcf7l1a<sup>-/-</sup>/tcf7l1b</italic> morphant embryos, our results suggest that the exon five coding region can assign transcriptional repressor activity to Tcf7l2 and, as for Tcf7l1 proteins, this transcriptional repressive function contributes to forebrain patterning and eye formation. This conclusion is supported by 45L-Tcf7l2 variants having less transactivation capacity and greater repressor activity compared to 4L-Tcf7l2 and 45L-Tcf7l2-AA variants in luciferase reporter experiments; additionally, 45L-Tcf7l2 variants show greater association for Tle3b transcriptional co-repressor in co-IP experiments. Hence, the inclusion of exon5 in <italic>tcf7l2</italic> variants could potentially influence the balance between activation <italic>versus</italic> repression transcription activity of Tcf7l2.</p><p>The lack of severe forebrain and eye phenotypes in single <italic>tcf7l1</italic> mutants is at least in part due to the overlapping functional activities of different <italic>tcf</italic> genes and we assume the same is likely for the <italic>tcf7l2</italic> mutant. However, we find no evidence that mutant mRNA triggered genetic compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">El-Brolosy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">El-Brolosy and Stainier, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rossi et al., 2015</xref>) is the reason that <italic>tcf7l2</italic> mutants lack severe phenotypes. For instance, morpholino knockdown of <italic>tcf7l2</italic> translation, which circumvents this mechanism, does not result in a severe eye phenotype. Given that, as for other Tcf genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cadigan, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ramakrishnan et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>tcf7l2</italic> specific splice variants seem to encode proteins with either repressor or activator roles, mutations that disrupt the balance between these functions may lead to phenotypes differing from complete gene abrogation. Potentially, misregulation of repressor function while maintaining the ability of the protein to activate transcription (as suggested by our experiments that specifically knockdown <italic>45L-tcf7l2</italic> variants with a splicing morpholino) might lead to forebrain respecification and small or no eye phenotypes that differ from complete loss of protein expression. Hence, the balance between the levels of Tcf transcriptional repressing <italic>versus</italic> activating variants may facilitate the correct subdivision of the telencephalic, eye and diencephalic territories of the neural plate.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Phosphorylation contributes to the balance of transcriptional activation-repression by mediating the function of Tcf7l2 as a transcriptional repressor</title><p>The context-dependent regulatory domain of Tcfs, which includes the region coded by <italic>tcf7l2</italic> exon 5, can be acetylated, phosphorylated or sumoylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamamoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shetty et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mahmoudi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hikasa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ota et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elfert et al., 2013</xref>). The importance of phosphorylation to the repressor activity of 45L-Tcf7l2 is suggested by the finding that the phosphorylation resistant 45-L-Tcf7l2-AA mutant form, in which both Thr<sup>172</sup> and Ser<sup>175</sup> amino acids are replaced by alanines, behaves as if lacking the region coded by exon five in all the functional assays we tested. Conversely, the phospho-mimicking EE-Tcf7l2 variant was able to restore eye development in <italic>Ztcf7l1a<sup>-/-</sup>/tcf7l1b</italic> morphant embryos suggesting that phosphorylation of either Thr<sup>172</sup> or Ser<sup>175</sup> is required for the repressive function of 45L-Tcf7l2 variants. Although our mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the peptide encoded by zebrafish <italic>tcf7l2</italic> exon five is phosphorylated, the resolution was not sufficient to discriminate whether the phosphorylation was on Thr<sup>172</sup>, Ser<sup>175</sup> or both. However, mRNA overexpression of 45L-Tcf7l2-AS or 45L-Tcf7l2-TA mutant variants can restore eye formation in <italic>Ztcf7l1a<sup>-/-</sup>/tcf7l1b</italic> morphant embryos, suggesting that the phosphorylation of either amino acid is sufficient to enable the repressor activity of 45L-Tcf7l2.</p><p>Gro/TLE transcription co-repressors are displaced by β-catenin to allow Tcf-mediated transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daniels and Weis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arce et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chodaparambil et al., 2014</xref>), and although we find 45L-Tcf7l2 still interacts with β-catenin, the 45L-Tcf7l2-AA mutant variants show greater binding capacity. This raises the possibility that 45L-Tcf7l2 variants may co-exist as phosphorylated and un-phosphorylated pools with different repressor/activator activity. This may also help explain why overexpression of moderate levels of 45L-Tcf7l2 shows no overt effect in wildtype embryos, possibly because Tcf7l2 phosphorylation and not its protein levels alone may control the activation-repression balance of these variants and suggesting that the phosphorylation of 45L-Tcf7l2 is a permissive event.</p><p>It is widely accepted that Tcfs work as transcriptional switches, repressing transcription of downstream genes in absence of Wnt ligand, and activating gene transcription when Wnt signalling is active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cadigan, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ramakrishnan et al., 2018</xref>). In this context, the repressive function of Tcf7l2 may be part of an integrated pathway response when the Wnt pathway is not active. The ‘off’ state of Wnt signalling involves active phosphorylation of β-catenin by CK1α and GSK-3β kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MacDonald and He, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Niehrs, 2012</xref>). Our findings support a model in which Tcf transcription factors could also be part of a kinase regulatory module that maintains the pathway in an ‘off’ state, not only in the cytoplasm by phosphorylating β-catenin, but also by promoting transcriptional repression through phosphorylation of Tcf7l2. Direct assessment of an in vivo functional role for phosphorylation of Tcf7l2, and potentially other Tcfs, will be required to address such a model.</p><p>The salience of resolving a role for phosphorylation in the regulation of transcriptional activation/repression is heightened given the relevance of Tcf7l2 in mediating colorectal cancer outcome due to imbalanced Wnt signalling. Indeed, one future avenue for investigation will be to identify proteins that interact with the phosphorylated and un-phosphorylated forms of Tcf7l2.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional modulation of Tcf7l2 through spatial and temporal regulation of splicing of alternative exons</title><p>The occurrence of widespread tissue-specific and developmentally regulated <italic>tcf7l2</italic> splicing suggests that certain variants of Tcf7l2 are required for proper cell and tissue type specification during development, and for its various roles in organ physiology during adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>). For instance, we have previously shown that Tcf7l2 is required for the development of left-right asymmetry of habenular neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hüsken et al., 2014</xref>) and at the stages during which habenular neurons are becoming lateralised, <italic>tcf7l2</italic> splice variants transition from expressing long to only medium and short carboxy-terminal end variants. This is potentially significant as only long variants include a complete C-clamp DNA binding-helper domain and the C-terminal binding protein domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Young et al., 2002</xref>). The C-clamp domain can direct Tcf7l2 to specific promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoverter et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, absence of a whole C-clamp may bias the promoter occupancy of Tcf7l2 and shift the expression profile of Wnt target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atcha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atcha et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hecht and Stemmler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoverter et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Tcf7l2 is linked to type-2 diabetes outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grant et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lyssenko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Savic et al., 2011</xref>) and the strongest risk factor SNPs are located in introns near human <italic>tcf7l2</italic> exon 3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grant et al., 2006</xref>).

Furthermore, a recent study in rats has shown that Tcf7l2 in habenular neurons regulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptor function, concomitantly impacting pancreatic function and glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duncan et al., 2019</xref>). At least in zebrafish, the brain appears to express predominantly medium and short C-terminal <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> splice variants in combination with all kinds of splice variants in the region of alternative exons 4 and 5. It will be interesting to resolve the specific expression of <italic>tcf7l2</italic> splice variants in the habenula and assess whether these have function in the regulation of nicotinic receptor function.</p><p>Although homologies between fish and human exons in the region of Tcf7l2 alternative exons 4/5 are uncertain and despite lack of overall sequence conservation, human <italic>tcf7l2</italic> exon 3a and fish exon five have a similar size and share amino acids that are likely phosphorylated in zebrafish Tcf7l2 encoded exon five region. Moreover, human <italic>tcf7l2</italic> variants including alternative exon 3a, and to a lesser extent exon 4, can restore eye formation in <italic>Ztcf7l1a<sup>-/-</sup>/tcf7l1b</italic> knockdown embryos. This suggests that the region encoded by human Tcf7l2 exon 3a, and possibly exon 4a, may have similar functions as zebrafish exon five and that alternative exons in this region may play an evolutionarily conserved role in the transcriptionally repressive capacity of Tcf7l2. Consequently, it will be interesting to assess if the expression levels of these human <italic>TCF7L2</italic> exons are altered in type-2 diabetes patients carrying risk factor SNPs.</p><p>Given the importance of maintaining balanced Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity throughout development and tissue homeostasis, elucidating all mechanisms that impact Wnt signalling modulation is critical if we are to understand and develop ways to manipulate pathway activity when misregulated in pathological conditions.

White-sided, clear-bottomed 96 well plates (Corning) were seeded at 8,000 cells/well in 100 µl/well medium without antibiotics. All transfections were carried out with Transfectin (Bio-Rad) at a ratio of 3/1 (0.3 µl Transfectin/100 ng DNA). Competition assays were carried out using VP16-TCF4 as the constitutive TCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ewan et al., 2010</xref>). The following plasmid amounts were used: VP16-TCF4: 43.5 ng/well; 25 ng/well reporter plasmids; 25 ng/well TCF isoform +pcDNA; 6.5 ng/well pcDNA-lacZ totalling 100 ng/well DNA. Transfectin was pipetted into 12.5 µl/well OptiMEM (Gibco/Thermo-Fisher) and the appropriate amount of DNA (above) into another 12.5 µl/well OptiMEM. The two were mixed and complexes were allowed to form over 20 min. The complexes were applied to the cells for 4 hr after which the medium was removed and replaced with a fresh 100 µl/well medium. After 2 days incubation, the medium was removed the cells were lysed in 50 µl/well GLO Lysis buffer (Promega) over 20 min on slow shake. The lysate was then split into two 25 µl/well fractions. The luciferase assay was carried out with 25 µl/well Bright-GLO (Promega) and the lacZ transfection control assay with 25 µl/well Beta-GLO (Promega).

They show that these variants are expressed in the developing forebrain, and are necessary and sufficient to promote eye formation along with <italic>tcf7l1a/b</italic>. The authors conclude that Tcf7l2 function in vivo can thus be modified by inclusion of this exon, affecting the balance between activation and repression of Wnt targets.</p><p>While the general concept of alternative transcripts affecting Tcf7l2 activation vs. repression has already been explored (Vacik, Stubbs and Lemke, 2011), the work presented here is novel, convincing, and carefully executed. I believe the current findings will be of interest to the field, considering the important roles of Tcf7l2 in development and disease. However the study has several weaker areas that should be addressed to provide a more complete story:</p><p>1) Most importantly, the function of protein products including exon 5 need to be more fully characterized. While a compelling case is made for their increased repressor activity, these experiments were carried out in the presumed absence of high Wnt or ß-catenin activity. It is not clear whether exon 5-containing products can also activate targets efficiently in the presence of ß-catenin, a function important for understanding the role of Tcf7l2 isoforms in vivo. For example, Tcf7l1 proteins can function as activators in vitro, but no obvious in vivo role for this activity has been revealed by genetic loss-of-function experiments.</p><p>2) Related to the first point, it would be helpful to know whether repressor-specific splice variants are primarily expressed in regions or tissues with low Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. This would support their potential role in target gene repression, and provide a direction for future studies exploring regulation of alternative splicing.</p><p>3) The role of Tcf7l2 co-repressor binding domain phosphorylation is incompletely explored. To establish the relevance of their binding and functional assays, the authors should provide evidence that these phosphorylation events take place in vivo, ideally in some regulated manner.</p><p>4) It would be helpful if the authors could provide a more comprehensive model for how they think Tcf7l2 contributes to A/P neural patterning. In addition to the partially redundant functions of zygotically expressed Tcf7l1a and Tcf7l1b in zebrafish, maternally deposited <italic>tcf7l1a</italic> mRNA plays an important role. It appears that the most significant factor in A/P patterning is therefore the gross amount of repressor Tcf isoforms relative to Wnt activity. Do the authors believe that exon 5-containing Tcf7l2 isoforms further contribute to this balance, or are other models possible?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Young and colleagues addresses the question of how the function of Tcf protein Tcf7l2 is altered as a result of alternative splicing.</p><p>To understand the contribution of different <italic>tcf7l2</italic> splice variants to protein function the authors focused on the CDRD region of the protein, which is known to be alternatively spliced and likely to influence the transcriptional function of the protein. They found that in zebrafish, this region is encoded in part by a previously un-described exon 5. During early somitogenesis stages (12 hpf), two splice variants are expressed, one that includes exon 4 but not 5 (<italic>4L-tcf7l2</italic>) and one that includes both exons 4 and 5 (<italic>45L-tcf7l2</italic>). By in situ hybridization the authors show that <italic>tcf7l2</italic> is expressed throughout most of the forebrain, including the eye field, from late gastrula stage, and by analyzing an available mutant they find that <italic>tcf7l2</italic> homozygous mutant embryos have smaller eyes than normal. By misexpression experiments the authors show that only the protein encoded by <italic>45L-tcf7l2</italic> can rescue the eyeless phenotype of <italic>tcf7l1a<sup>-/-</sup>/tcf7l1b</italic> morphant embryos and that in vitro this protein represses transcription of Wnt target genes and appears to have a higher affinity to TLE. Finally the authors propose that two amino acid encoded by exon 5 are likely phosphorylated and this phosphorylation could be critical to the repressor activity of the 45L-Tcf7l2 variant.</p><p>Overall the manuscript addresses an important question in the context of a protein that is implicated in developmental processes as well as in cancer and type-2 diabetes. The manuscript is clearly written and the data are generally of high quality. However, there are several major concerns that weaken the overall strength of the work:</p><p>1) The authors propose that 45L-Tcf7l2 is the relevant form for repression of Wnt target genes during eye development. If so, then specific loss of function of this form (using the splice MO) should lead to at least the same eye phenotype as seen in <italic>tcf7l2</italic> mutants. This is not the case, and the authors discuss the effects of the splicing MO only in the context of <italic>tcf7l1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos.</p><p>2) The conclusion that 45L-Tcf7l2 functions as a repressor relies on its ability to interfere with the strong activation of luciferase by a Tcf7l2-VP16 chimeric protein. This does not prove that 45L-Tcf7l2 acts as a transcriptional repressor, and given that the transcriptional activity of Tcf7l2 variants is a key issue in this work, a more direct proof of repressor activity should be provided.</p><p>3) The co-immunoprecipitation experiments are aimed at addressing the differences in binding affinity of Tcf7l2 variants to TLE or β-Catenin. This is problematic given that co-IP is not a quantitative assay, hence it cannot fully support the conclusion of different affinities.</p><p>4) The authors propose that the differences between repressor activities of 4L-Tcf7l2 and 45L-Tcf7l2 are caused by phosphorylation of two amino acids in the region encoded by exon 5, and address this by mutating the two residues to Alanine. However, this is very circumstantial and no direct proof of phosphorylation is provided.</p><p>In summary, although the work proposes an important mechanism for regulating transcriptional activity of a TCF factor, I feel that the conclusions are not as strongly supported as they need to be for publication in a high-profile journal such as <italic>eLife</italic> and the contribution of the work is currently incremental.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Developmentally regulated <italic>tcf7l2</italic> splice variants mediate transcriptional repressor functions during eye formation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In this manuscript by Young, et al., the authors identify and characterize the function of <italic>tcf7l2</italic> splice variants in zebrafish. They find that inclusion of a previously unidentified exon, which they call exon 5, is necessary and sufficient to confer transcriptional repression activity during neurectoderm patterning. Their data further show that the polypeptide encoded by exon 5 interacts with Tle corepressors in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, and suggest that this interaction mediates a general repressor function for Tcf7l2 that can be regulated in vivo. The authors propose that alternative splicing of <italic>tcf7l2</italic> exon 5 in zebrafish, and partially homologous exons in other species including humans, can influence the balance between activation and inhibition of Wnt pathway activity.</p><p>This is an extremely comprehensive study, including diverse genetic and biochemical approaches, that makes a clear and convincing case for the mechanistic regulation of a gene important for development and disease. The data are novel and are likely to be of interest to a wide audience. While similar mechanisms have been described for other Lef/Tcf family members, they have not been tested as rigorously.</p><p>In the revised version the authors have addressed several weak points that were present in the initial submission and improved the manuscript. The additional reporter assay for repressor function is more convincing and the identification of phosphorylated residues by mass spectrometry and their mutational analysis provides strong evidence to support the proposed mechanism that regulates the repressor function of Tcf7l2. The authors have also added data supporting relevance of their findings to human TCF proteins. There are only a few areas where the manuscript could be strengthened:</p><p>1) Inclusion of exon 5 is necessary to rescue the eyeless phenotype following loss of <italic>tcf7l1a/b</italic>, and the authors hypothesize that this is due to the increased affinity for Tle3 from phosphorylated residues in this isoform. However, the 4L and AA isoforms still retain some Tle3 binding affinity, and as pointed out in the Discussion the balance between activation and repression could depend on many factors. To more fully support their model, it seems like a relatively simple experiment would be to overexpress <italic>tle3</italic> mRNA with the non-rescuing isoforms and test whether this changes their activity.</p><p>Whereas the above experiments are not considered as essential for the manuscript's acceptance, it would strengthen the model. Minimally, a fuller discussion of the concept that &quot;the balance between the levels of Tcf transcriptional repressing versus activating variants&quot; is required. In this discussion, it would be important to mention the observation from data not shown that expression of the 45L form in wild-type background did not cause an overt phenotype (subsection “Zebrafish <italic>tcf7l2</italic> exon 5 and human <italic>tcf7l2</italic> exon 3a containing variants are able to restore eye formation upon loss of <italic>tcf7l1a/b</italic> function”, first paragraph). Clearly, this balance might become critical only in certain genotypic scenarios.</p><p>2) The authors repeatedly describe <italic>tcf7l2</italic> expression as being in the anterior neural ectoderm or in the forebrain. However, they do not distinguish between presumptive telencephalon and diencephalon. Both Figure 1F/G and images from Young et al., 2002, suggest that expression is primarily diencephalic, and while it may partially overlap with <italic>tcf7l1a/b</italic> it is not identical to these genes. These subtle differences in expression may help explain non-redundant functions of individual Lef/Tcf family members, in addition to their ability to act as transcriptional activators or repressors.</p><p>3) The reviewers think that Supplementary Figure 3 should be a main figure rather than supplemental.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51447.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There was a consensus among the reviewers that the manuscript addresses an important question of the mechanism of Tcf7l2 regulation of gene expression and provide an interesting data and model on the role of exon5 in conferring repressor activities to Tcf7l2, and its regulation by phosphorylation of residues encoded by exon5.

In this experimental setup, exon 5 coding Tcf7l2 variants show less transactivation capacity compared to the variants that do not include exon5 on all the gene promotors we tested.
