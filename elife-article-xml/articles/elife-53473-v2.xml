Consequently, bacterial pathogens have evolved a myriad of protein secretion mechanisms specifically tailored for the virulence factors they secrete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christie, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galán and Waksman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa et al., 2015</xref>). Typhoid toxin is an important virulence factor for the human pathogen <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galán, 2016</xref>), the cause of typhoid fever in humans and a major public health concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parry et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crump and Mintz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raffatellu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dougan and Baker, 2014</xref>). This toxin is unique in that is only produced by intracellular bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haghjoo and Galán, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fowler and Galán, 2018</xref>). After its synthesis, the toxin is secreted into the lumen of the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole, packaged into vesicle carriers, and subsequently transported to the extracellular environment from where it can reach its target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spanò et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2019</xref>). Typhoid toxin secretion from the bacterial cell is mediated by a unique transport mechanism that requires the activity of TtsA, a specialized muramidase that facilitates the translocation of typhoid toxin from the <italic>cis</italic> to the <italic>trans</italic> side of the peptidoglycan (PG) layer of the bacterial envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hodak and Galán, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geiger et al., 2018</xref>). The bacterial PG is composed of glycan strands made up of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNac) linked by β-(1, 4) glycosidic bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Turner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Egan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>). These strands are connected by short peptides composed of L- and D-amino acids, which are cross-linked to one another by specific transpeptidases. Most of these cross-links are between the carboxyl group of D-Ala at position 4 of one peptide to the ε-amino group of the m-Dap residue at position 3 of another (D-D cross-links) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glauner et al., 1988</xref>). However, although less abundant, crosslinks can also occur between two m-Dap residues of adjacent stem peptides (L-D cross-links) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glauner et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Höltje, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Quintela et al., 1997</xref>). In previous studies we have shown that TtsA is unique in that it exerts its function at the bacterial poles, and it requires the activity of YcbB, a bacterial transpeptidase that is responsible for introducing L-D crosslinks to the peptides that link the glycan strands of the peptidoglycan layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geiger et al., 2018</xref>). As the L-D-cross-links are most likely limited to specific sub-domains of the PG layer, the substrate specificity exhibited by TtsA is thought to topologically restrict its activity. Consistent with this hypothesis, TtsA-mediated PG remodeling and typhoid toxin secretion occurs exclusively at the bacterial poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geiger et al., 2018</xref>). Although essential for the understanding of its function, there is no information about the mechanisms by which TtsA recognizes its substrate and localizes to the bacterial poles. In this study we have defined the specific domain of TtsA that targets its activity to the L-D-cross-linked PG at the bacterial poles. We have also solved the atomic structure of TtsA bound to its substrate and that of a close homolog with different specificity, which has allowed us to define the structural bases for its substrate specificity. Overall, these studies provide an unprecedented view of the mechanisms by which a bacterial muramidase involved in protein secretion engages its substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The carboxy-terminal but not the catalytic domain of TtsA confers substrate specificity and typhoid toxin secretion functions</title><p>We have previously shown that Sen1395, a close TtsA homolog encoded by <italic>Salmonella</italic> Enteritidis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), was unable to complement a <italic>S.</italic> Typhi <italic>∆ttsA</italic> mutant strain for its ability to form typhoid-toxin vesicle carriers in infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hodak and Galán, 2013</xref>), an indirect measure of typhoid toxin in vivo secretion from the bacterial cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spanò et al., 2008</xref>).

To obtain insight into the potential mechanisms by which TtsA recognizes its substrate we constructed a series of chimeric proteins between TtsA and Sen1395, all expressed at equivalent levels to those of wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Consistent with the hypothesis that the carboxy-terminus of TtsA confers its substrate specificity, over expression of a chimeric construct consisting of the amino-terminal catalytic domain (1-92) of Sen1395 and the carboxy-terminal substrate binding domain (93-180) of TtsA was able to halt the growth of wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhi but not the growth of the <italic>∆ycbB</italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) despite equivalent levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of full-length Sen1395 was able to halt the growth of both wild type and the <italic>∆ycbB</italic> mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We have previously shown that the proportion of LD crosslinks increases significantly when bacteria are grown in TTIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geiger et al., 2018</xref>), a culture medium that mimics conditions found by intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Consequently, while purified TtsA is not able to hydrolyze PG isolated from LB grown bacteria, it is able to effectively hydrolyze PG obtained after S.

However, purified Sen1395 was unable to hydrolyze PG isolated from a strain overproducing YcbB and thus containing an increased proportion of LD cross-links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that Sen1395 and TtsA exhibit different PG specificity and that the substrate specificity determinants of both TtsA and Sen1395 are contained within their carboxy-terminal half.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TtsA polar localization and substrate recognition determinants are distinct</title><p>We have previously shown that TtsA localizes to and exerts its activity at the bacterial poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geiger et al., 2018</xref>). To gain insight into the mechanisms that target TtsA to the bacterial poles, we first investigated the subcellular localization of Sen1395, which, as shown above, has different substrate specificity and is unable to complement a <italic>S.</italic> Typhi <italic>∆ttsA</italic> mutant for typhoid toxin secretion. We found that, unlike TtsA, when expressed in <italic>S</italic>. Typhi Sen1395 was not enriched at the poles and showed a uniformed distribution around the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then tested the subcellular localization of different TtsA-Sen1395 chimeric constructs. We found that the TtsA carboxy-terminus is essential for polar localization since a chimera consisting of the first 92 amino acids of Sen1395 and amino acids 93 to 180 of TtsA localized to the pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Furthermore, we found a strict correlation between the ability of these constructs to complement a <italic>S.</italic> Typhi <italic>∆ttsA</italic> mutant for typhoid toxin PG translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) and their polar localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and c</xref>), supporting the notion that polar localization is essential for TtsA protein secretion function. We also examined the ability of the different chimeras to mediate PG remodeling at the bacterial poles. We labeled the <italic>S.</italic> Typhi PG using an alkyne-modified D-alanine and an azide-containing fluorophore that can be linked by click chemistry. The short peptides that link the PG glycan strands contain D-alanine residues. Therefore, the metabolic incorporation of alkyne-modified D-alanine and its subsequent linking to an azide-containing fluorophore can be used to label remodeling PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Siegrist et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cameron et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuru et al., 2015</xref>). We found that expression of the chimeric constructs containing the carboxy-terminus of TtsA and therefore targeted to the bacterial poles, strictly correlated with the presence of PG remodeling at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since this domain is also associated with TtsA’s ability to hydrolyze L-D-cross-linked PG, we specifically tested the possibility that this localized PG modification at the bacterial poles introduced by the polarly-localized YcbB transpeptidase may serve as polar-localization signal.

Taken together, these observations indicate that TtsA N166 plays an important role in conferring on this muramidase the ability to translocate typhoid toxin across the PG layer. Since the typhoid toxin translocating activity of TtsA strictly correlates with its ability to localize to the bacterial poles, we tested the subcellular localization of TtsA<sup>N166D</sup>. We found that this mutant localized to the bacterial poles in a manner indistinguishable from wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and c</xref>) suggesting that N166 is not essential for polar localization but rather, it may be involved in the recognition of L-D-cross-linked PG. Consistent with this hypothesis, expression of TtsA<sup>N166D</sup> did not lead to PG remodeling at the bacterial poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d and e</xref>). However, introduction of this critical asparagine at an equivalent position in Sen1395 (Sen1395<sup>D167N</sup>) resulted in its partially relocalization to the bacterial poles suggesting a complex role for this residue in both substrate recognition and polar localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these results implicate a role for the carboxy-terminal domain of TtsA in its polar localization and suggest that polar localization and substrate recognition are functionally separable activities that are mediated by different TtsA determinants.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Polar localization and substrate recognition are mediated by different TtsA determinants.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Typhoid toxin translocation across the PG layer.

The structure was refined to 2.1 Å resolution with an Rwork of 0.19 and an Rfree of 0.22 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The crystals belonged to the C 2 2 2<sub>1</sub> space group and contained four monomers per asymmetric unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This organization does not correspond to a physiological multimer since in solution TtsA behaves as a monomer as determined by size exclusion chromatography. The TtsA structure shows two defined globular α-helical domains separated by a ‘hinge’ that is formed by a bent α-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). The amino terminal domain (amino acids 1 to 64) contains the lysozyme-like catalytic triad (Glu14, Asp19, Thr28) situated under a ‘flap’ formed by a loop that is anchored to the domain by interactions with three short helixes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). The carboxy-terminal substrate-binding domain (amino acids 68 to 180) is composed of 6 anti parallel α-helices that organize into a helix bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). The helix bundle serves as a support for a platform with a central groove, which together with the catalytic triad-containing flap forms a ring-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). As will be elaborated below, this ring-like structure is proposed to be the site of engagement of the peptidoglycan substrate. A Dali search with the TtsA structure yielded several structures with significant similarity in the Protein Data Bank, including several amidases and chitosinases. However, two of the structures, NMB1012 from <italic>Neisseria meningitides</italic> (PDB 2is5) and PG_0293 from <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> (PDB 2nr7)) shared stronger structural similarity than the others (z scores of 13 and 9.5, respectively). These are proteins of unknown functions whose structures were determined through structural genomics efforts. Although these proteins shared limited primary amino acid sequence similarity with TtsA, their structures aligned well, particularly in some regions of the substrate-binding domain. TtsA has 27% sequence identity with NMB1012 and a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 1.3 Å over 70 aligned Cα pairs, and has 15% sequence identity with PG_0293 and rmsd of 1.0 Å over 34 aligned Cα pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The catalytic domain of <italic>Neisseria meningitides</italic> NMB1012 also aligns well with that of TtsA. In particular, the predicted catalytic residues overlap well in the two structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, in the case of PG_0293, the flap containing the catalytic residues is translocated 90 degrees to the side, placing it away from the proposed substrate-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To gain insight into the mechanisms of TtsA substrate specificity, we solved the atomic structure of Sen1395 to 1.9 Å resolution with an Rwork of 0.20 and an Rfree of 0.24 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The crystals belonged to the P1 space group and contained two monomers per asymmetric unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The structure aligns very well to TtsA with an rmsd of ~0.7 Å over 161 aligned Cα pairs (with 64% sequence identity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The positions of the conserved catalytic residues in both enzymes overlap reasonably well, which is consistent with the observation that the catalytic domain of TtsA can be replaced with the catalytic domain of Sen1395 and retain full function. Despite the very high structural similarity of the two enzymes, notable differences on amino acids located on the surface of the putative substrate-biding groove could be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, while the surface of the substrate-binding groove in TtsA is lined by largely uncharged amino acids (Ile116, Gln120, Gln164, Asn166), the equivalent surface in Sen1395 is occupied by several charged amino acids (Asp117, Arg121, Glu165, Asp167). We propose that the charge differences in the substrate-binding domain between TtsA and Sen1395 confer upon these enzymes their different substrate specificity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Structural bases for TtsA substrate specificity.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Two opposite views of the comparison of the crystal structures of TtsA (in red) and Sen1395 (in blue) in ribbon representation.

We also placed a TAG codon at the position encoding the catalytic residue E14, which is located away from the substrate-binding groove. A plasmid encoding orthogonal suppressor aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair, which can recognize amber codons and insert pBpa at these positions, was introduced in all the mutant strains. Bacteria were then grown for 24 hr in TTIM under conditions that are permissive for TtsA expression and typhoid toxin secretion, exposed to UV light, and cross-linked species were analyzed by western blotting. Without UV light exposure all constructs showed similar protein expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). However, after exposure to UV light, TtsA<sup>D118pBpA</sup>, TtsA<sup>N166pBpA</sup> and TtsA<sup>F169pBpA</sup> were no longer detectable by western blot, although TtsA<sup>E14pBpA</sup> was detectable at equal levels than those prior to UV exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). We hypothesized that the inability to detect these TtsA constructs was due to their crosslinking to the peptide stem of the PG polymer, which because of its high molecular weight prevented their migration into SDS-PAGE gels. To test this hypothesis, we treated the crosslinked samples with lysozyme, which digests PG into its muropeptide subunits and analyzed the digested samples in SDS-PAGE probing for TtsA. We found that after treatment with lysozyme we were able to readily detect TtsA<sup>D118pBpA</sup>, TtsA<sup>N166pBpA</sup> and TtsA<sup>F169pBpA</sup> at equal levels than TtsA<sup>E14pBpA</sup> Indicating that these mutant constructs were crosslinked to PG after UV treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Interestingly, in the case of TtsA<sup>D118pBpA</sup>, TtsA<sup>N166pBpA</sup> and TtsA<sup>F169pBpA</sup> we detected two bands after lysozyme treatment: one migrating as ~25 kDa polypeptide, the predicted size of a TtsA monomer, and another migrating as a 50 kDa polypeptide, consistent with the size of a TtsA dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Since TtsA behaves as a monomer in solution, the dimer is unlikely to be the result of TtsA/TtsA crosslinks. Furthermore, the location of the labeled amino acids in the predicted substrate-binding groove within the TtsA structure dictates that it is unlikely that this region could engage into putative TtsA-TtsA interactions. Rather, these results suggest that TtsA must bind two adjacent cross-linked muropeptides. Consistent with this hypothesis, only monomers (with or without lysozyme treatment) were detected when the experiment was conducted in a <italic>S</italic>. Typhi <italic>∆ycbB</italic> strain, which lacks LD-crosslinked PG and therefore it is not permissive for TtsA activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). To further explore this hypothesis we performed in vitro chemical crosslinking experiments using bis(sulfosusinimidyl)suberate (BS3), an amine-to-amine crosslinker with an 8-carbon spacer arm. Purified TtsA, and PG obtained from <italic>S</italic>. Typhi grown in TTIM were incubated with the crosslinker and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Consistent with our observation that purified TtsA behaves as a monomer in solution, addition of the crosslinker to purified TtsA did not result in the formation of a dimer. In contrast, addition of the crosslinker to purified TtsA in the presence of purified peptidoglycan resulted in the formation of a TtsA species that migrated at ~50 kDa. Since the efficiency of both the in vitro and in vivo crosslinking reactions is expected to be much less than 100%, the finding of a substantial proportion of crosslinked dimeric TtsA is consistent with the notion that two TtsA molecules preferably bind two adjacent, cross-linked muropeptides.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The secretion of typhoid toxin is dependent on a unique protein secretion mechanism specifically adapted for the biology of the intracellular pathogen <italic>S.</italic> Typhi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geiger et al., 2018</xref>). In this secretion mechanism, the typhoid toxin subunits, PltA, PltB, and CdtB, are first secreted to the periplasmic space by the <italic>sec</italic> translocation machinery through the engagement of canonical secretion signals in each one of these polypeptides. Once in the periplasm, the protein subunits are assembled into the holotoxin complex, which is subsequently translocated to the <italic>trans</italic> side of the PG layer. From this location, the holotoxin is finally released to the outside after exposure to membrane-active compounds such as antimicrobial peptides or bile salts, which are encountered by the bacteria during infection and can introduce minor disruptions to the outer membrane. The critical step of toxin translocation through the PG layer occurs at the bacterial poles and is mediated by TtsA, which belongs to a unique family of muramidases most often associated with bacteriophage release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hodak and Galán, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stojković and Rothman-Denes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pei and Grishin, 2005</xref>). Unlike its bacteriophage homologs, however, TtsA exhibits exquisite sensitivity for L-D-crosslinked PG, which in most Gram-negative bacteria are less abundant than the most commonly found D-D crosslinked species. Here we have investigated the mechanisms by which TtsA is recruited to the bacterial poles and specifically targets L-D crosslinked PG. By constructing chimeras with the <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis Sen1395 protein, a close homolog of TtsA with different specificity and subcellular localization, we were able to map the substrate specificity and subcellular localization determinants to its carboxy terminal domain. This finding raised the possibility that the presence of L-D crosslinked PG itself may serve as a signal to target TtsA to the poles, since we have found that YcbB, which in <italic>S.</italic> Typhi is the only enzyme capable of introducing this modification, is also enriched at the poles. However, we found that TtsA also localized to the poles of a <italic>S</italic>. Typhi <italic>∆ycbB</italic> mutant, which lacks L-D crosslinked PG, although with reduced efficiency. These observations suggest that polar localization can occur without this PG modification and that other determinants must contribute to the targeting of TtsA to this subcellular location. These results also indicate that the mechanisms of polar localization and L-D PG targeting are functionally distinct.</p><p>To gain insight into the structural bases for substrate specificity, we solved the crystal structures of TtsA and its close homolog Sen1395, which exhibits different specificity. Entirely consistent with the chimera studies, we found that TtsA is organized in two independent domains: an amino-terminal catalytic domain and a carboxy-terminal substrate-binding domain, separated by a bent helix that forms a hinge between these two domains. The conserved, lysozyme-like catalytic triad is located within a loop that is supported by three short helixes. This loop reaches out to the substrate-binding groove and in doing so forms a ring-like structure that presumably envelopes the PG and positions the catalytic residues for the cleavage of the PG backbone. The carboxy-terminal domain contains a helix bundle that forms a platform with a central groove that we postulate serves as a binding site for the muropeptide stem. In support of this conclusion, we observed electron density corresponding to diaminopimelic acid bound to a crevice on one of the ends of the substrate-binding groove. Mutations in the residue that coordinates the binding to diaminopimelic acid resulted in complete loss of function, consistent with the notion that this residue plays an essential role in substrate recognition. Comparison of the TtsA and Sen1395 atomic structures revealed specific differences in critical amino acids lining the substrate-binding groove, which result in defined charge differences lining the substrate-binding groove. We postulate that these charge differences are responsible for the differences in substrate specificity.</p><p>To further evaluate the functional importance of residues lining the predicted substrate-binding groove of TtsA, we introduced the genetically-encoded photo-crosslinkable amino acid pBpa. We then examined the mobility of these mutant proteins after <italic>S.</italic> Typhi growth under conditions permissive for typhoid toxin secretion and exposure to UV light. We found that mutants containing pBpa at positions D118, N166, and F169 cross-linked to PG after exposure to UV light. Interestingly, a significant proportion of the TtsA cross-linked species migrated in SDS-PAGE as dimers. TtsA does not form dimers in solution therefore we interpret these observations to mean that the two monomers must be held together by cross-linked PG species rather than by direct TtsA-TtsA crosslinks. Consistent with this hypothesis, TtsA exposure to a chemical crosslinker in solution yielded dimers only in the presence of PG. As the TtsA dimers resisted lysozyme treatment, we hypothesize that the TtsA monomers must be cross-linked to adjacent peptide stems of the PG polymer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). These peptide stems must be the subject of complex crosslinking patterns since lysozyme-treated PG with canonical LD-crosslinks should yield unlinked monomers, which in turn would be incompatible with the observed TtsA dimers after UV exposure. LD transpeptidation does not require de novo incorporation of new peptidoglycan precursors, therefore it has been observed that the proportion of LD-crosslinked peptide increases in stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Turner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Pedro and Cava, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Typas et al., 2012</xref>). We have shown that the only LD-transpeptidase in <italic>S</italic>. Typhi, YcbB, localizes to the bacterial poles so it is possible that the presence of this enzyme at that location may result in the accumulation of cross-linked trimers and tetramers that may be selectively targeted by TtsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). This in turn may provide a mechanism to restrict the enzymatic activity of TtsA to the bacterial poles.</p><p>Comparison of the structures of the four independent molecules in the TtsA crystal revealed the presence of two conformations: an open conformation in which the loop containing the catalytic residues is moved away from the substrate, and a close conformation with the loop in much closer proximity to the substrate-binding groove. Similarly, comparison of the TtsA structure with those available in the PDB data-base revealed close similarity to structures from <italic>Neisseria meningitides</italic> (NMB1012) and <italic>Porphiromonas gingivalis</italic> (PG_0293). There is no functional information available about these proteins as their structures were obtained through structural genomics efforts, therefore their PG specificity is unknown and it is unclear whether they exert their function in the context of phage biology or protein secretion. Intriguingly, however, the catalytic loop of PG_0293 is rotated ~180° to the side so that it is positioned away from the substrate-binding domain and presumably unable to make contact with its substrate. Although the significance of the observed alternative conformations is unclear, it is tempting to hypothesize that they may represent functionally relevant conformational states serendipitously captured in the crystal that are perhaps associated with substrate release after catalysis.</p><p>In summary, using a multidisciplinary approach we have provided major insight into the mechanisms of substrate specificity exhibited by a unique bacterial muramidase associated with the secretion of typhoid toxin, a major virulence factor of the human pathogen <italic>S</italic>. Typhi. These studies may therefore provide the bases for the potential development of anti-toxin strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhi)</td><td><italic>ttsA</italic></td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23174673">23174673</ext-link>; MicrobesOnline Database</td><td>sty1889</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (S.

Briefly, random fluorescence microscopy images were obtained and bacterial cells were defined as regions of interest (ROI) by using LPS (red) counterstaining. The center within each ROI was identified and 26 measuring points along the median longitudinal axes of the bacteria from the center (0) to each of the poles (1.0) were automatically selected on the peptidoglycan or labeled antibody fluorescence channels (green) for protein detection. For the peptidoglycan-associated fluorescence distribution analysis, the fluorescence signal associated with non-TtsA-dependent PG labeling was substracted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>TtsA and Sen1395 protein purification</title><p>The coding sequence for <italic>ttsA</italic> and <italic>sen1395</italic> was amplified from <italic>S.</italic> Typhi or <italic>S. enteritidis</italic> strains, respectively, and cloned by Gibson cloning strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>) into the expression vector pET28b (Novagen) resulting in N-terminal histidine-epitope tagged TtsA or Sen1395. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain BL21 carrying the different plasmids were grown in LB containing kanamycin (50 µg/ml) to an O<italic>D</italic><sub>600 nm</sub> of 0.6–0.7 at 37°C. Expression of TtsA and Sen1395 was subsequently induced by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG, and induced cultures were incubated overnight at 25°C. Bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl; pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, lysozyme (100 µg/ml), DNAse (100 µg/ml), saturated PMSF] and lysed with a high pressure cell disruptor (Constant Systems Ltd.). For Sen1395 a protein denaturation/renaturation protocol was used to obtain soluble protein from inclusion bodies. More specifically, the cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation (20,000 x g for 1 hr at 4°C) to recover the pellet containing the cellular debris and inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies were solubilized by resuspension in solubilization buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM Tris; pH 8) and the suspension was stirred at room temperature for 3 hr. After incubation, the solubilized material was clarified by centrifugation (20,000 x g for 1 hr at 4°C) and the supernatant containing the solubilized His-tagged Sen1395 protein, was affinity-purified using a Nickel-NTA agarose (Qiagen) column. The column was washed five times with wash solution (8 M urea, 100 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM Tris; pH 6.5), protein eluted with elution buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris; pH 4.5), and refolded by dialysis against a renaturalization buffer (25 mM Tris; pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT) overnight at 4°C. Precipitated debris/misfolded proteins were removed by centrifugation (20,000 x g, 30 min at 4°C) and the clear supernatant was used in further purification steps. For TtsA, the cells lysate was pelleted (20,000 x g 1 hr at 4°C) and affinity-purified using a Nickel-NTA agarose (Qiagen) column. Renatured Sen1395 and TtsA were diluted (1:6) in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 buffer and loaded onto a Hi Trap Q ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare). Fractions from the ion-exchange chromatography were monitored on SDS–PAGE, concentrated, and further purified over a Superdex 200 10/300 GL gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). Final fractions were examined for purity on 12% SDS–PAGEs, aliquoted and frozen at −80°C in storage buffer (20 mM Tris; pH 8, 150 mM NaCl).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Selenomethionine-labeling</title><p>The methionine auxotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strain B834 (DE3) (Novagen Cat.

Selenomethionine (50 µg/ml) and IPTG (0.5 mM) were then added and the bacterial culture was further incubated at 25°C for 18 hr. Bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl; pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, lysozyme (100 µg/ml)], DNAse I (100 µg/ml), saturated PMSF) and further processed as indicated above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Peptidoglycan hydrolysis assays</title><p>Wild-type <italic>S.</italic> Typhi, its isogenic <italic>∆ycbB</italic> mutant, or <italic>S</italic>.

Purified peptidoglycan preparations were resuspended in MilliQ water containing 0.01% NaN<sub>3</sub> and stored at 4°C until their use in different assays. Muramidase activity of purified TtsA or Sen1395 was detected by a turbidimetry assay or by dye-release assay on Remazol Brilliant Blue (RBB)-labeled peptidoglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heidrich et al., 2001</xref>). For the turbidimetric assay isolated peptidoglycan was diluted in enzyme activity buffer (20 mM Tris; pH6.8, 50 mM NaCl) to an OD<sub>540</sub> of ~0.175. Purified TtsA (5 µg) and Sen1395 (5 µg) were added and optical density measurements at 540 nm were conducted at the indicated time points. In this assay, insoluble peptidoglycan is cleaved into small soluble PG fragments (i.e. muropeptides) leading to a decline in the optical density. For the Remazol Brilliant Blue (RBB)-dye release assay isolated PG was labeled by incubating it in 20 mM RBB (Sigma) in 0.25 M NaOH at 37°C overnight. The sample was neutralized with HCl, centrifuged (20,000 g, 15 min at room temperature), and the resulting pellet was thoroughly washed with MilliQ water until no soluble RBB could be detected after centrifugation. For PG hydrolysis activity tests, 20 µl of indicated RBB-PG was incubated with purified TtsA (5 µg) or Sen1395 (5 µg) in enzyme activity buffer (20 mM Tris; pH6.8, 50 mM NaCl) for 4 hr in a total volume of 100 µl. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 g and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 595 nm (Tecan Infinite 200 PRO microplate reader, Tecan Austria GmbH, Austria). Lysozyme (5 µg) and bovine serum albumin (BSA, 5 µg) were used in the assay as positive and negative controls, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Bacterial growth arrest assay</title><p><italic>S</italic>.

and rigorous set of experiments that help to elucidate how the typhoid toxin produced by <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi is secreted. The authors find that the muramidase TtsA is required for secretion and that TtsA is localized specifically to the cell poles by recognizing a specific form of the cell wall (peptidoglycan) found at the poles. The work not only sheds new light on how this particular toxin is secreted, but has implications for understanding how a variety of secreted products in bacteria are translocated across the bacterial cell envelope.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mechanisms of substrate recognition by a typhoid toxin secretion-associated muramidase&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kelly Hughes (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes the structure and PG-binding and polar localization determinants of the toxin-secretion muramidase, TtsA. The authors identify a region of TtsA that is required for binding to L-D crosslinks in PG. This site is near the muramidase site, in the PG binding domain. They show that this site, N166, is required for binding to L-D crosslinked peptidoglycan. Their work shows that recognition of L-D crosslinked peptidoglycan and polar localization are mediated by different sites within the protein. They convincingly show that N166 is required for L-D crosslink recognition, and that the C-terminal domain more generally is required for polar localization. The work is rigorous, clever and nicely done, and the conclusions are exciting. This work sheds light on the function of TtsA, but also more broadly on how various protein domains interact with peptidoglycan. Most of the conclusions are supported by the data. However, there are a couple of places where the reviewers felt the wording should be adjusted to fit the data better. Additionally, the model proposed at the end was somewhat confusing and needs to be clarified.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Discussion, third paragraph – last few sentences. The conclusion that localization of TtsA to the poles is mediated by the activity of <italic>ycbB</italic> is not supported by the data, since TtsA still localizes to the poles in the ∆<italic>ycbB</italic> strain (Figure 2A). One possibility, that should be discussed, is that the L-D crosslinking is half of what localizes TtsA to the poles. It's not mentioned, but it seems that TtsA localization to the poles is reduced in the ∆<italic>ycbB</italic> strain.</p><p>2) The model shown in Figure 5E is confusing in light of the data in Figure 5C. From the right panel in C, it seems that N166, near the active site, is required for binding to the L-D crosslinks, but in the image in E, the L-D crosslinks are not near the N166 site. It is important to clarify the cartoon model more. N166 could be required for some conformational change in the protein that makes binding L-D crosslinks possible: there are ways that one can speculate that an amino acid is required for binding a region of the substrate that it doesn't touch it directly, but this isn't currently spelled out. The authors should clarify and better discuss this apparent contradiction in their model.</p><p>3) Related to the above statement – the role of the DAP binding site in the localization and function is not really explored. Perhaps tripeptides are also enriched at the poles? And the DAP binding helps localize TtsA to the poles? The data in Figure 5C very nicely show that N166 is involved in recognizing L-D crosslinks, but from the discussion it sounds like the authors are proposing that the rest of the C-terminal domain, including the DAP binding site, are also involved in recognizing L-D crosslinks. It's not clear the data back this up. It would be really nice to see how the D118TAG mutant binds to PG (i.e., assay of Figure 5C, right) in the ∆<italic>ycbB</italic> strain. If it still binds to PG in the ∆<italic>ycbB</italic>, then I think a more likely model would be that TtsA simultaneously binds to both L-D crosslinks at the N166 region, and to DAP residues in free tripeptides in the D118/ I116 region. However, perhaps this isn't the model, in which case, please make it more clear, and explain why N166 is not near the L-D crosslink site in the picture.</p><p>4) Throughout the manuscript, it is not entirely clear which experiments mainly confirm findings of two earlier manuscripts – Hodak et al., 2013 and Geiger et al., 2018 – and which ones represent new findings. For example are the authors replacing the earlier vesicle formation experiments with largely equivalent toxin secretion assays? This applies both to the actual results and their discussion, in particular with respect to Hodak 2103, which already showed the crucial role of the C-terminus of TtsA/Sen1395 and particularly amino acids 166/167 in function.</p><p>5) There are numerous inconsistencies and errors in the statistical analysis of the data.</p><p>6) In some cases, it is not obvious whether results were obtained for chromosomally encoded mutants, complemented deletion mutants, or mutant proteins co-expressed with the wild-type protein (some of these cases are listed below).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53473.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Discussion, third paragraph – last few sentences.

Indeed, we concluded that TtsA <underline>localization</underline> to the poles is NOT, at least exclusively, mediated by the activity of YcbB precisely because we observed polar localization of TtsA in the <italic>∆ycbB</italic> mutant, although as the reviewer points out, at a reduced level. However, in the sentence in question we did suggest that the activity of YcbB may result in the presence of PG cross-linked trimers and tetramers at the poles, which in turn may contribute to restrict TtsA’s <underline>enzymatic activity</underline> at this location since our crosslinking data suggest that TtsA must require complex PG crosslinking for its recognition. We do not believe that this statement is contradictory to the observation that TtsA localization does not require YcbB because protein localization and the restriction of the enzymatic activity may well be mediated by different mechanisms as our data suggest. We have edited the sentences in the Discussion to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The model shown in Figure 5E is confusing in light of the data in Figure 5C.

Rather, our intention was to capture in the cartoon the notion that TtsA requires a complex PG crosslinking pattern to recognize its substrates as suggested by our crosslinking experiments. Indeed, we observed that after in vivo and in vitro crosslinking, a large proportion of TtsA migrates as a dimer in SDS-PAGE, although TtsA cross-linked in the absence of PG migrates as a monomer. The chemistry of the chemical crosslinking reaction, both in vitro and in vivo, predicts that TtsA must be crosslinked to the free primary amino group of the two amino groups available in mDAP. Consequently, the appearance of a dimer in the crosslinking experiments indicates that the TtsA monomers must be crosslinked to adjacent peptide stems crosslinked to one another through complex crosslinking patterns such as trimers and tetramers since lysozyme-treated PG with canonical LD-crosslinks should yield unlinked TtsA monomers. As stated, in the cartoon our objective is to capture this complex issue but not to depict the location of any residue of TtsA, which is of course better depicted in the structure itself. We have clarified this issue in the figure legend.</p><p> <italic>3) Related to the above statement</italic> – <italic>the role of the DAP binding site in the localization and function is not really explored.

How each one of the amino acids involve in the binding participate in the interaction with a complex PG structure is difficult to ascertain and unfortunately would not be settled with additional crosslinking experiments. As discussed above, we have attempted to clarify this issue in the figure legend and in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Throughout the manuscript, it is not entirely clear which experiments mainly confirm findings of two earlier manuscripts – Hodak et al., 2013 and Geiger et al., 2018 – and which ones represent new findings.
