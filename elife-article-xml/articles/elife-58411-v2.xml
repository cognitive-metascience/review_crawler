The process of viral fusion appears to be fast compared with viral egress and has not been visualized by EM. To capture fusion events, the process must be curtailed by trapping Env-receptor binding at an intermediate stage. We have used fusion inhibitors to trap HIV-1 virions attached to target cells by Envs in an extended pre-hairpin intermediate state.

HIV-1 Env is a trimeric glycoprotein comprising three gp120 subunits that contain host receptorbinding sites and three gp41 subunits that include the fusion peptide and membrane-spanning regions. Binding of the primary receptor CD4 to gp120 triggers conformational changes that expose a binding site for co-receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4). Coreceptor binding results in further conformational changes within gp41 that promote release of the hydrophobic fusion peptide, its insertion into the host cell membrane, and subsequent fusion of the host cell and viral membrane bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrison, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Structural studies relevant to understanding Env-mediated membrane fusion include X-ray and single-particle cryo-EM structures of soluble native-like Env trimers in the closed (pre-fusion) conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ward and Wilson, 2017</xref>), CD4-bound open trimers in which the co-receptor binding site on the third hypervariable loop (V3) of gp120 is exposed by V1V2 loop rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ozorowski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), a gp120 monomeric core-CD4-CCR5 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shaik et al., 2019</xref>), and a post-fusion gp41 six-helical bundle formed by an α-helical trimeric coiled coil from the gp41 N-trimer region surrounded by three helices from the C-peptide region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Weissenhorn et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Prior to membrane fusion and formation of the post-fusion gp41 helical bundle, the viral and host cell membranes are hypothesized to be linked by an extended pre-hairpin intermediate in which insertion of the gp41 fusion peptide into the host cell membrane exposes the N-trimer (HR1) region of gp41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan and Kim, 1998</xref>). Formation of the six-helical bundle and subsequent fusion can be inhibited by targeting the N-trimer region with C-peptide-based inhibitors; for example the fusion inhibitor T20 (enfuvirtide [Fuzeon]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kilgore et al., 2003</xref>), T1249, a more potent derivative of T20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eron et al., 2004</xref>), and a highly potent trimeric D-peptide (CPT31) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Redman et al., 2018</xref>), or with anti-gp41 antibodies such as D5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion between viral and host cell membranes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Top: Schematics of host receptors, HIV-1 Env trimer, pre-hairpin intermediate, and fusion inhibitors.

Thus, there were ~2×10<sup>6</sup> infectious viruses, ~10<sup>15</sup> molecules of T1249-Fc, and ~50,000 TZM-bl cells that were available for formation of spoke structures that could be captured by HPF and visualized by ET after the 48 hr incubation at 37°C.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58411-fig1-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Visualizing the pre-hairpin intermediate that joins the host and viral membranes has not been straightforward. Despite 3-D imaging by electron tomography (ET) of HIV-1 infection of cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carlson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Do et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Earl et al., 2013</xref>) and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kieffer et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kieffer et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ladinsky et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>), viruses caught in the act of fusion have not been unambiguously found. In our ET imaging of HIV-1–infected humanized mouse tissues, we have identified hundreds of budding virions at various stages of egress and thousands of free mature and immature virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kieffer et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kieffer et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ladinsky et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>), but not a single example of a virus attached to a host cell via a pre-hairpin intermediate or in the process of fusing its membrane with the target cell membrane. The absence of observed viral fusion events might be explained if fusion is a fast process compared with viral budding; thus when cells or tissues are immobilized for EM or ET, the relatively slow process of viral budding would be more easily captured compared with the faster process of fusion. We assume that fusion could theoretically be observed if a virus were caught at exactly the right time, but this might require examining thousands or millions of images.</p><p>Here, we report visualizing the pre-hairpin intermediate by ET after treatment of HIV-1–exposed target cells with inhibitors of six-helix bundle formation that bind the N-trimer region of gp41 that is exposed during the fusion process. Using optimally preserved samples for ET with a nominal resolution ~7 nm, we found &gt;100 examples of HIV-1 virions linked to TZM-bl target cells by 2–4 narrow rods of density (spokes) in inhibitor-treated samples, but none in untreated or control-treated samples. The approximate dimensions of the majority of the spokes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ausubel et al., 1989</xref>) matched models of gp41-only pre-hairpin intermediates in which the Env gp120 subunit had been shed. The average number of observed spokes connecting a virion to a target cell increased slightly when using a virus containing an Env with a cytoplasmic tail deletion, suggesting that the increased lateral mobility of cytoplasmic tail-deleted Envs in the viral membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crooks et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pezeshkian et al., 2019</xref>) allowed more Envs to join the interaction with the target cell. We discuss the implications of these studies for understanding HIV-1 Env-mediated membrane fusion and how these results differ from a previous ET study of the ‘entry claw’ that is formed upon HIV-1 or SIV interactions with target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sougrat et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>A previous study used ET to visualize HIV-1 and SIV virions in contact with target cells after promoting a temperature-arrested state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mkrtchyan et al., 2005</xref>) in which viruses can remain attached to cells prior to fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sougrat et al., 2007</xref>). For that study, target cells were incubated with virus at 4°C to allow binding but not fusion, warmed to 37°C, and then fixed after incubations ranging from 15 min to 3 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sougrat et al., 2007</xref>). At all time points after warming, viruses were found attached to target cells by a cluster of 5–7 ‘rods,’ each ~100 Å long and ~100 Å wide. The fact that the attachment structure was not found when the viruses and target cells were incubated in the presence of C34, a gp41 N-trimer–targeting C-peptide inhibitor related to T20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sougrat et al., 2007</xref>), suggests that the rod structure that was trapped during the temperature-arrested state did not involve the pre-hairpin intermediate.</p><p>We hypothesized that addition of an HIV-1 fusion inhibitor that binds to the exposed gp41 N-trimer after host cell receptor and coreceptor binding would slow or stop virus-host cell membrane fusion such that we could visualize pre-hairpin intermediate structures by ET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We characterized three fusion inhibitors of different sizes and potencies that target the exposed gp41 N-trimer region of the pre-hairpin intermediate for attempts to visualize the pre-hairpin intermediate: T1249-Fc, a C-peptide–based inhibitor that we linked to human Fc (MW = 65 kDa), D5 IgG (MW = 150 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller et al., 2005</xref>), and CPT31, a high-affinity D-peptide inhibitor linked to cholesterol (MW = 9 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Redman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Welch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We measured their neutralization potencies using in vitro HIV-1 pseudovirus neutralization assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Montefiori, 2009</xref>) against the SC4226618 and 6535 viral strains. We found potencies ranging from 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of ~0.13 ng/mL for CPT31 to ≥40 µg/mL for D5 IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). T1249-Fc exhibited intermediate potencies (IC<sub>50</sub>s = 0.99 µg/mL; 17 µg/mL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>), higher than IC<sub>50</sub>s measured for T1249 peptide alone, consistent with limited steric accessibility resulting in decreased potencies for larger fusion inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamburger et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Incubating with a fusion inhibitor at 37°C obviated the need for a 4°C incubation of virus and target cells, which we reasoned was desirable since low temperatures alter membrane fluidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avery et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simons and Vaz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Quinn, 1988</xref>), which could affect one or more steps in membrane fusion. Since target cells for HIV-1 are several microns in height, much thicker than the 0.5–1 µm limit for cryo-ET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck and Baumeister, 2016</xref>), we used stained, plastic-embedded samples that could be cut into 300–400 nm sections using a microtome, and then examined the samples in 3-D using ET. Although ET of stained, plastic-embedded sections results in lower resolution than cryo-ET, the minimal effects of radiation damage in plastic sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glaeser, 2016</xref>) was an advantage for locating rare attached virions. Thus, more cells could be assayed in plastic sections than in samples prepared by cryo-ET methods (e.g. by examining thin leading edges of cells or using focused-ion-beam milling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Villa et al., 2013</xref>] to prepare a sufficiently thin sample), therefore allowing for statistically significant observations of virion attachment events. We prepared samples by light fixation followed by high-pressure freezing/freeze substitution fixation (HPF-FSF) instead of the traditional chemical fixation protocol used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sougrat et al., 2007</xref>) because HPF vitrifies cells at ~10,000°/s, stopping all cellular movement within ms and allowing optimal preservation of ultrastructural features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kellenberger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McIntosh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sartori et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dahl and Staehelin, 1989</xref>). By contrast, chemical fixation immobilizes elements in the cell at different rates, and movement and rearrangement of transmembrane proteins may continue even in the presence of aldehyde fixatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brock et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stanly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>).

Since biosafety requirements for the current study necessitated the use of HIV-1 pseudoviruses instead of infectious HIV-1, we verified that the ultrastructure of HIV-1 pseudoviruses, including approximate numbers and dimensions of Env trimer spikes and the presence of collapsed (in mature virions) versus C-shaped (in immature virions) cores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benjamin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ganser, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wright et al., 2007</xref>), was preserved during the fixation, embedding, and staining procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>) consistent with our previous publications involving ET of infectious HIV-1 in tissue samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kieffer et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ladinsky et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>). These results are also consistent with previous direct comparisons of tomograms of stained and plastic-embedded versus unstained and cryopreserved SIV virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sougrat et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We conducted ET experiments by first incubating TZM-bl cells, a HeLa cell line that stably expresses high levels of human CD4 and coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Platt et al., 1998</xref>), with 130 µg/mL of inhibitor (either T1249-Fc, D5, or CPT31) and ~5000 TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL of HIV-1 pseudovirus at 37 °C for 2, 4, or 48 hr, followed by HPF, FSF, plastic embedding, sectioning, and visualization by ET. In order to verify that results were not dependent upon a particular viral strain, we used pseudoviruses derived from two primary isolate HIV-1 strains: SC4226618 (Tier 2) and 6535 (Tier 1B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2005</xref>), chosen for their sensitivity to the fusion inhibitors and because we had both wild-type and Env cytoplasmic tail-deleted forms of the 6535 pseudovirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

Because HIV-1 virions have not been visualized during the act of fusion, we assumed that viral fusion is a fast process that has yet to be captured by electron microscopy imaging of either cultured cells or tissues. In order to visualize the hypothesized pre-hairpin intermediate structure in which the gp41 transmembrane region and the fusion peptide link the viral and target cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan and Kim, 1998</xref>), we incubated HIV-1 fusion inhibitors that bind to the N-trimer region of gp41 that is exposed upon Env binding to the host receptor and coreceptor on target cells. We chose to use diverse fusion inhibitors to trap the hypothesized pre-hairpin intermediate structure linking the viral and host cell membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) and to avoid a temperature jump protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sougrat et al., 2007</xref>) that could result in unanticipated effects on membranes; for example, membrane trafficking events can be altered or stopped at decreased, non-physiological temperatures, and structures associated with them, such as Golgi cisternae, are perturbed and noticeably altered relative to physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ladinsky et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>We chose three fusion inhibitors with strong, medium, and weak neutralization potencies (CPT31, T1249-Fc, D5 IgG, respectively), incubated them at 37 °C with virus and target cells for variable times, and examined them in 3-D by ET. For all experimental conditions, we found virions linked to the surface of target cells by several (mean = 2.4 +/- 0.5; <italic>n</italic> = 116) narrow spokes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), thus all conditions contained sufficient numbers of virions and inhibitors to form stable attachments to target cells. By contrast, in control experiments with either no inhibitor, an irrelevant protein, or inhibitor added at a concentration equal to 1% of its neutralization IC<sub>50</sub> value, we did not observe virions attached to target cells. Based on current understanding of how fusion inhibitors prevent fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan and Kim, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eckert and Kim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>), we conclude that the attachment densities represent Env trimers in the pre-hairpin intermediate conformation that link viral and target cell membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><p>Having trapped virions in the act of fusion, we can use information gathered from tomograms to address mechanistic and structural details of fusion between viral and target cell membranes. First, the results suggest that only 2 to 3 (and occasionally 4) Envs participate in the reaction with target cells that is inhibited by a fusion inhibitor. This number, which could be somewhat inflated due to trapping of Envs using a fusion inhibitor, is consistent with studies suggesting that only a few HIV-1 Envs are required for fusion with a target cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Magnus et al., 2009</xref>). The number also represents a minority of the Env trimers on HIV-1, even considering that HIV-1 includes a unusually low number of spikes per virion (an average of ~14, with a range from 4 to 35 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chertova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Layne et al., 1992</xref>], compared with ~450 spikes on similarly-sized influenza A virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamaguchi et al., 2008</xref>]). STED microscopy studies suggested that HIV-1 spikes rearrange from a random distribution on immature virions to a cluster on mature virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chojnacki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chojnacki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carravilla et al., 2019</xref>). However, interspike distance distributions on mature virions derived from independent cryo-ET reconstructions revealed relatively random spike distributions rather than a single cluster of spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). Our finding of only 2–3 spokes per virion-target cell attachment site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) is also consistent with random spike distributions on mature virions since more attachment spokes would be expected if Envs are clustered. In addition, although free Env trimers on HIV-1 virions are difficult to identify conclusively by ET using stained, plastic-embedded samples, we sometimes found Env spikes on the opposite surface of attached mature virions as the attachment structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,d</xref>), consistent with the assumption that only two or three Envs are usually close enough to each other to participate in binding to host cell receptors and that slow lateral diffusion of HIV-1 Envs within the virion bilayer prohibits recruitment of additional Envs into the attachment structure. Interestingly, membrane fusion in other systems, for example mediated by influenza hemagglutinin or SNARE complexes, also requires only ~three fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ivanovic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mohrmann et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting mechanistic similarities that would be interesting to explore.</p><p>The ectodomains of Env trimers on immature virions are not expected to exhibit conformational changes that would prevent binding to CD4 and coreceptor. Indeed, immature virions can fuse with targets, although less efficiently than mature virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wyma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murakami et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with Env trimers on immature virions binding to receptors on target cells and forming pre-hairpin intermediate structures, we occasionally found immature virions attached to target cells that were incubated with a fusion inhibitor. Immature virions comprised &lt;5% of the datasets recorded. Attached immature virions exhibited comparable numbers and locations of spokes as we found for attached mature virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>), consistent with a similar distribution of Envs on mature and immature virions. Although measurements of Env mobility within the membranes of mature and immature virions differ, the HIV-1 viral membrane on both mature and immature virions is a low mobility environment, likely due to high lipid order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chojnacki et al., 2017</xref>). Our results suggest that the intrinsically low mobilities of HIV-1 Envs on both mature and immature virions limit the number of Env trimers that can participate in pre-hairpin intermediate structures with target cells.</p><p>The cytoplasmic tail of HIV-1 Env interacts directly with the viral matrix protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfadhli et al., 2019</xref>), and tail deletion has been suggested to increase the lateral mobility of Envs in the viral membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crooks et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pezeshkian et al., 2019</xref>). In order to determine the effects of cytoplasmic tail deletion on virion attachment to a target cell in the presence of a fusion inhibitor, we used ET to compare attachment sites for virions with wild-type and cytoplasmic tail-deleted Envs. We found a slight, but statistically significant, increase for the number of spokes in attachment sites formed between fusion inhibitor-treated target cells and the 6535-ΔCT versus wild-type pseudoviruses (3.9 +/- 1.2 for 6535-ΔCT to 2.4 +/- 0.5 for wild-type) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). These results are consistent with intrinsically low mobilities of HIV-1 Envs in the viral membrane that are increased only slightly for Envs that lack a cytoplasmic tail. Taken together, analyses of the numbers of apparent pre-hairpin intermediate structures trapped by fusion inhibitors on wild-type mature, wild-type immature, and cytoplasmic tail-deleted virions is consistent with the assumption that a minority of the relatively few HIV-1 Env trimers are involved in attachment via a pre-hairpin intermediate to target cells.</p><p>We also used the tomographic data to measure the dimensions at the virion-target cell attachment sites, finding that the approximate dimensions of the majority of the spokes (15.6 nm ±2.8 nm in length x 3.9 ± 0.8 nm in width; n = 20) are consistent with a pre-hairpin intermediate structure formed by gp41 alone after gp120 has dissociated (step iv, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), which we measured from an approximate model to be ~100 Å x ~ 22 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). By contrast, a hypothetical pre-hairpin intermediate containing gp120 (step iii, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) would be wider, with dimensions ~ 100 Å by ~120 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). This wider structure is roughly consistent with the ~100 Å x ~ 100 Å dimensions of each of the 5–7 rods of density that comprised the ‘entry claw’ in a previous ET study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sougrat et al., 2007</xref>). We suggest that the entry claw rods visualized after incubating virus-target cell samples at 4 °C and then warming to 37 °C represent a structure formed after the HIV-1 Env trimer has bound to CD4 (and possibly also to a coreceptor) but prior to gp120 dissociation. Given that entry claws were not visualized in the temperature jump protocol when the viruses and target cells were incubated in the presence of a fusion inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sougrat et al., 2007</xref>), the thick rod structures are unlikely to represent a pre-hairpin intermediate. We therefore suggest that the thick rods seen following temperature jump likely correspond to a structure resembling step ii in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>.</p><p>A potential explanation for why we observe 2–3 densities at virion-target cell attachment sites versus the 5–7 reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sougrat et al., 2007</xref>) could relate to the observation that the attachment surfaces in our imaging experiments were generally flat, as opposed to including a concave surface on the target cell that followed the convex surface of the virion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sougrat et al., 2007</xref>). This difference could result from use of different sample preparation protocols and/or target cells (T cells in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sougrat et al., 2007</xref> versus TZM-bl cells in our study). In any case, if HIV-1 virions contain a random assortment of a small number of Env trimers that diffuse slowly or not at all in the membrane, then only a small number of Envs would be available on the small contact surface formed by a roughly spherical virion and a flat cell membrane, whereas more Envs would be available for contacts with a larger contact surface formed by a virion interacting with a concave cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Indeed, a recent ET study of murine leukemia virus (MLV) attached to target cells revealed a concave surface on the target cell with ~28 spokes per attached virion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Riedel et al., 2017</xref>), a number that would be predicted to be higher than observed for HIV-1 even if HIV-1 were interacting with a concave portion of its target cell because MLV includes more spikes (at least 100 per virion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stano et al., 2017</xref>) compared with HIV-1 (7–14 per virion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chertova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Layne et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have used fusion inhibitors and ET of optimally preserved samples to visualize HIV-1 virions caught in the act of fusion with target cell membranes. These experiments revealed details of attachment sites with spokes representing pre-hairpin intermediate structures of HIV-1 Env. The spokes likely correspond to extended Env trimers after gp120 dissociation and prior to collapse into the post-fusion six-helical bundle structure (step iv in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Our observation of relatively few (2-3) spokes per attached virion implies that HIV-1 Env-mediated membrane fusion may require only a fraction of the ~14 Envs on each virion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chertova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Layne et al., 1992</xref>) and provides further details of an intermediate step on the pathway to viral entry.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of fusion inhibitors</title><p>A gene encoding T1249-Fc was constructed to encode the 39-residue T1249 peptide sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eron et al., 2004</xref>) fused at its C-terminus to a (Gly<sub>4</sub>Ser)<sub>7</sub> linker followed by human IgG1 Fc.

T1249-Fc, CPT31, or D5 IgG fusion inhibitor, each at a concentration of 130 µg/mL, was combined with pseudovirus (either SC4226618, 6535, or 6535-ΔCT, each at ~5000 TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL), and then immediately added to the cells and incubated for 2, 4, or 48 hr at 37 °C.

Disks were transferred under liquid nitrogen to cryo-vials (Nunc) containing 2.5% OsO<sub>4</sub>, 0.05% uranyl acetate in acetone and then placed in a AFS-2 freeze substitution machine (Leica Microsystems, Vienna). Samples were freeze substituted at −90°C for 72 hr, warmed to −20°C over 12 hr, held at that temperature for 24 hr, and then warmed to room temperature and infiltrated with Epon-Araldite resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Port Washington, PA). Sapphire disks were flat-embedded on teflon-coated glass slides with Secure-Seal adhesive spacers (Sigma) and Thermanox plastic coverslips (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Resin was polymerized at 60°C for 24 hr.</p><p>Once embedded, the sapphire disks were removed, leaving the cells as a monolayer within the resin wafer. The cells were observed with an inverted phase-contrast microscope to ascertain preservation quality and to select regions of interest (i.e. regions with &gt;10 cells in close proximity). These regions were extracted from the resin wafer with a microsurgical scalpel and glued to plastic sectioning stubs. Semi-thick (300–400 nm) serial sections were cut with a UC-6 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Vienna) using a diamond knife (Diatome, Ltd., Switzerland). Sections were collected onto formvar-coated copper-rhodium 1 mm slot EM grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.

Fischione Instruments, Export, PA) and imaged with a Tecnai TF-30ST transmission electron microscope (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) operating at 300 keV. Images were recorded with a XP1000 CCD camera (Gatan, Inc). For dual-axis tomography, grids were tilted +/- 64° and images taken at 1° intervals. The grid was then rotated 90° and a similar tilt-series was taken about the orthogonal axis. Tilt-series datasets were acquired automatically using the SerialEM software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>).

Objects that appeared to be spherical, were estimated to have a diameter of ~100 nm, and were proximal to a cell surface were examined at higher magnification (12,000x – 15,000x). These objects were observed at 0° tilt (perpendicular to the beam) and at +35° and −35° tilts to confirm that they were indeed spherical. Nonspherical objects, such as thin cellular projections or microspikes, would appear oblong or tubular at one or both high-tilt views (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Objects that remained spherical were further evaluated by observing through a defocus series to detect core structures that would be indicative of a HIV-1 virion (i.e. a bullet-shaped mature core or a C-shaped immature core [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benjamin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wright et al., 2007</xref>]). Detection of core structures allowed the object to be classified as a HIV-1 particle, and it was subsequently imaged for dual-axis tomography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). In most sample preparations, attached virions were found at an incidence of ~1 per every five cells in a given 400 nm section. On rare occasions, several (2-3) virions were found attached to a single cell, and each virion was recorded as a separate dataset.

They have done a careful job of setting the experimental conditions to avoid temperature jump, well known to produce artifacts in membrane traffic both at the plasma membrane and in the Golgi, by trapping the intermediate with each of three different fusion inhibitors that bind the three-helix coiled-coil formed by the segment often called HR1. They have also (correctly) avoided prolonged fixation by using freeze-substitution to achieve an effective &quot;freeze frame&quot;. Electron tomograms of 300-400 nm negatively stained sections of high-pressure frozen / freeze-substitution fixed samples were collected. They detect a substantial number of virions attached to the cell by between 2 and 4 thin &quot;spokes&quot;, about 130 Å long and spaced by between 70 and 140 Å. They can find no such particles when they do not trap with an inhibitor consistent with studies on other viruses showing that when an appropriate number of extended intermediates have formed adjacent to one another, bridging the two membranes, fusion ensues very rapidly.

Briefly, the target was imaged at 1° intervals through a +/-64° series. The sample was then rotated 90° within the microscope and a second tilt-series with identical parameters was taken about the orthogonal axis. The two tomograms were then merged to make a single reconstruction with a 50% smaller missing wedge, that preserves the inherent resolution of the data throughout its volume (see Mastronarde, D.N. (1997) Dual-axis tomography: An approach with alignment methods that preserve resolution. J. Struc. Biol. 120: 434-352). When necessary, tomograms were noise-filtered during processing and/or median-filtered during postprocessing to confirm the nature of spokes. Spokes were measured by viewing each one at an optimum tomographic angle (i.e., where its complete length could be unambiguously viewed from the virion surface to the cell surface, and then modeled as a single line. The line was measured in terms of pixels and then transposed to Ångstroms based on the pixel size of the original data.</p><p>In response to the request for statistics on these measurements, we now report the length and width of spokes as 15.6 ± 2.8 nm and 3.9 ± 0.8 nm (n = 20) in the text of the revised paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A potential concern relates to the use of fusion inhibitors to stabilize the intermediate pre-fusion state.

We don’t know how to definitively address this issue, however, since we can’t see the connections in the absence of an added fusion inhibitor. However, as pointed out by the reviewers, the number of connections we see correlates with findings in other fusion systems. In the revised paper (Discussion, third paragraph), we cited previous results showing that only a few influenza hemagglutinins and SNARES have been shown to be required for fusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The cells were &quot;lightly&quot; fixed (with 3% glutaraldehyde, 1% paraformaldehyde, mentioned in the subsection “Incubations for fusion inhibitor ET experiments”) prior to high-pressure freezing.

Our Baltec HPM010 high-pressure freezer and ancillary equipment is not housed in a BSL-2 facility, nor is it portable. Indeed, chemical fixation can affect image quality, but the major source of artifact is introduced by room temperature dehydration. This step is eliminated by high-pressure freezing, and subsequent freeze-substitution, thus yielding samples that are ~80% more reliably preserved than traditional chemical fixation alone. Furthermore, controls conducted throughout the study did not show any attached virions, nor structures resembling spokes associated with free virions, indicating that these structures were not aldehyde cross-links or artifacts thereof.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A number of studies have shown that HIV-1 VLPs, even in the absence of Env or CD4, bind to HeLa cells.
