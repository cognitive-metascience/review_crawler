to tumor growth and to maintaining a pro-tumorigenic, immunosuppressed microenvironment. We demonstrate that housing glioma-bearing mice in enriched environment (EE) reverts the immunosuppressive phenotype of infiltrating myeloid cells, by modulating inflammatory gene expression. Under these conditions, the branching and patrolling activity of myeloid cells is increased, and their phagocytic activity is promoted. Modulation of gene expression depends on interferon-(IFN)-γ produced by natural killer (NK) cells. This modulation disappears in mice depleted of NK cells or lacking IFN-γ, and was mimicked by exogenous interleukin-15 (IL-15). Further, we describe a key role for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that is produced in the brain of mice housed in EE, in mediating the expression of IL-15 in CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells. These data define novel mechanisms linking environmental cues to the acquisition of a pro-inflammatory, anti-tumor microenvironment in mouse brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>NK cells</kwd><kwd>Glioma</kwd><kwd>enriched environment</kwd><kwd>mouse model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AIRC2015 IG16699</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Limatola</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003407</institution-id><institution>Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRIN 2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Limatola</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CRCHU</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Starting Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tremblay</surname><given-names>Eve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Euronanomed2: Nanoglio</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santoni</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AIRC2014 IG16014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santoni</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The microenvironment of brain tumors can be modulated by in vivo conditions that change the brain levels of BDNF and IL-15, with effects on innate immune cell activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is a grade IV (WHO) brain tumor, characterized by high cell proliferation, active angiogenesis and invasion capability. Tumor cells produce immunosuppressive molecules that, rather than promoting the immune reaction against the tumor, recruit T regulatory cells and glioma-associated myeloid cells (GAMs). The latter population comprises microglia, peripheral monocytes, perivascular macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Quail and Joyce, 2017</xref>), and may represent up to 30% of total tumor mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Graeber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Markovic et al., 2009</xref>). GAMs play an active part in the enhancement of the invasive and proliferative properties of GBM, further contributing to the immunosuppressive phenotype of the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Markovic et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coniglio and Segall, 2013</xref>). There is a wide debate regarding the definition of GAM phenotype: the initial descriptions identified these cells as M2 type, by analogy to the phenotypic distinction originally used for macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sica et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murray et al., 2014</xref>). Subsequent studies identified a plethora of phenotypes amongst GAMs, with additional differences also observed between mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Szulzewsky et al., 2016</xref>). Murine GAMs express several genes that have anti-inflammatory properties, and many efforts aim to promote the expression of pro-inflammatory genes by GAMs, as this phenotype is associated with better patient prognosis and increased survival in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pyonteck et al., 2013</xref>). However, epidemiological studies have demonstrated that factors involved in chronic inflammation may increase the incidence of several tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mantovani et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Environmental stimuli have been shown to shape brain functions, modulating plasticity and learning and memory functions, and reducing the impact of neurodegenerative diseases in animal models and in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sale et al., 2014</xref>). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key cerebral mediator of these phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Branchi et al., 2004</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that housing mice in an enriched environment (EE) reduced intracranial glioma growth, with indirect mechanisms acting through innate immune natural killer (NK) cells, and with direct effects of BDNF on the truncated isoform 1 of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkBT1), which is expressed by tumor cells. Anti-tumor activity of an EE has been shown in different cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nachat-Kappes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garofalo et al., 2015</xref>), even if some results were not confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Westwood et al., 2013</xref>). Environmental stimuli also shape immune functions, modulating NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garofalo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Song et al., 2017</xref>), T helper cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rattazzi et al., 2016</xref>), and myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chabry et al., 2015</xref>). NK cells exert anti-tumor function by direct cytotoxic activity, producing several cytokines, chemokines and growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vivier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guillerey and Smyth, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stabile et al., 2017</xref>). Among the cytokines, interferon (IFN)-γ contributes to tumor immune-surveillance and interacts with T cells, dendritic cells and monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaplan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dunn et al., 2006</xref>). IFN-γ is a pleiotropic cytokine, which has anti-tumor activity in different neoplasms by inhibiting cell proliferation and exerting anti-angiogenic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parker et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, IFN-γ counters the acquisition of a pro-tumor phenotype by GAMs and reverses the immunosuppressive phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duluc et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The maturation and survival of NK cells require IL-15, which also stimulates IFN-γ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2006</xref>), and mice lacking IL-15 or one of its signaling components are devoid of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koka et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Despite the advancement of knowledge regarding the interactions between immune cells and the microenvironment of brain tumors, several aspects need further investigation. In this study, we focused on the effect of macro-environment on GAM phenotype. We report that housing mice in EE changes GAM phenotype by reducing the expression of anti-inflammatory genes and increasing the expression of pro-inflammatory ones. Exploring the underlying mechanisms, we identified NK cells as mediators of this immunodeviation, with key intermediate roles played by BDNF, IL-15 and IFN-γ.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Housing mice in EE modulates gene expression, K<sup>+</sup> channel functions and morphology of GAM</title><p>To investigate the effect of the macroenvironment on GAMs, C57BL/6 mice housed in standard environment (SE) or EE for 5 weeks after weaning were injected with syngeneic glioma cells (GL261) into the right striatum.

The results of the gene expression analysis indicate that in both housing conditions, monocytes only infiltrate the ILH and are virtually absent from the CLH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), whereas microglia are present in both hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In the ILH of EE mice, the expression of anti-inflammatory genes was reduced in both microglia and infiltrating monocytes, whereas the expression of anti-tumor, pro-inflammatory genes was increased only in microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). Consistently, when global expression profiles of the same cell populations were analyzed, similar results were obtained. Genes that were upregulated in microglia from the ILH of EE mice were enriched in Gene Ontology (GO) terms such as ‘response to interferon-gamma’ and ‘innate immune response’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>). We also observed the divergent activation of genes that are associated with ‘immune response’, which was further supported by the differential activation of pro-inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).</p><p>As potassium channels are differentially expressed in different microglia phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>), we analyzed their functional expression to further characterize the microglial activation state. Patch-clamp recordings were performed in GFP<sup>+</sup> cells of acute brain slices from glioma bearing <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>+/GFP</sup></italic> mice, which comprise GAMs, dendritic cells, and NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung et al., 2000</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, only GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the ILH have outward-rectifying potassium currents (K<sub>or</sub>, flowing through Kv1.3 and Kv1.5), which are absent in the CLH, and the average current amplitude is not modified by exposure to EE. Focusing on the peritumoral region, the occurrence of K<sub>or</sub> currents is increased by EE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In the CLH, the amplitude of the inward-rectifying K currents (K<sub>ir</sub>, carried by Kv2.1 channels) is increased in the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells of EE mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richter et al. (2014</xref>), and from the passive membrane properties, we identified these cells as microglia (see Materials and methods). We then analyzed GFP<sup>+</sup> cell morphology by two-photon microscopy, measuring cell branching and territory (i.e. mean area covered by single cells). Our data show that, in the peritumoral region of EE mice, GFP<sup>+</sup> cells have an increased number and length of branches, and cover a wider parenchymal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). On the other hand, these cells display a reduced patrolling activity, as indicated by reduced velocity and process extension into the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), which is probably balanced by their wider coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We also observed that only GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the peritumoral area rearrange their processes toward a pipette-guided focal application of ATP. The speed of these movements increases in EE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). This behavior could be due to an increased expression of <italic>P2RY12</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>) in CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from the brain of EE mice.</p><p>Myeloid cell morphology was also investigated inside the tumor. Two-photon analysis shows that in EE mice, GFP<sup>+</sup> cells inside the tumor have increased process length and total surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). Electron microscopy showed ultrastructural differences too: in EE mice, IBA1<sup>+</sup> cells inside the tumor have reduced cell body roundness, indicating ramified (versus amoeboid) morphologies, as well as reduced solidity, being delineated by smoother plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). Indeed, there was an increased prevalence of small ‘pseudopodia’ protruding from the cell bodies in the SE mice. In EE mice, microglia more often extended long process ramifications, sometimes wrapping around the tumor cells. They also contained an increased number of phagocytic vacuoles, sometimes with cellular elements showing signs of digestion. Secretory granules were observed in both housing conditions. Altogether these data demonstrate that in tumor-bearing EE mice, the phenotype of microglia and infiltrating myeloid cells is changed towards a patrolling, pro-inflammatory state, which actively trys to re-establish brain homeostasis and to restrain tumor growth.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33415.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of EE on myeloid cell morphology.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Left: current/voltage relationship of microglia cells in response to voltage steps stimulation (steps from −170 to +70 mV, only one out of two steps are shown; holding potential −70 mV) in CLH (n = 38/9 mice), peritumoral area (n = 60/9 mice) and inside the tumor (n = 57/9 mice) of SE housed, GL261-bearing mice.

To explore the mechanisms underlying NK-CD11b<sup>+</sup> cell communication, we first looked at their relative distribution within the tumor mass, using two-photon microscopy. We focused on measuring the distance between NK cells and myeloid cells, using <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> mice in which microglia are green, whereas GL261 glioma cells were visualized with RFP, and NK cells were stained with an Alexa-Fluor 633-conjugated NK1.1 Ab. The data indicate that in the EE condition, the number of NK cells that are in contact with myeloid (GFP<sup>+</sup>) cells is not significantly different from that in the SE condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). On the other hand, in EE conditions, the frequency of direct contacts between NK cells and glioma cells was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), suggesting that these structural interactions underlie the increased NK cell degranulation (see below). Electron microscopic analysis of tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) further shows that in EE mice, IBA1<sup>+</sup> cells with the ultrastructural characteristics of microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tremblay et al., 2012</xref>) and juxtaposed to NK cells contain an increased number of phagocytic vacuoles, sometimes containing cellular elements in the process of being digested. We confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garofalo et al., 2015</xref>) that in the brain of EE mice, there is an increased frequency of NK cells expressing granzyme B and IFN-γ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>), and this leads to an increased degranulation of NK cells ex vivo (not shown) which was further increased when challenged against tumor cells (GL261 and YAC-1 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).</p><p>NK cells were also more distant from CD31<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells, probably because of an increased colonization of the brain parenchyma in the EE condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>IFN-γ released by NK cells plays a critical role in the control of glioma growth</title><p>Investigating the potential role of IFN-γ as mediator of NK-cell-mediated effect, we demonstrated that glioma-bearing EE mice express higher levels of IFN-γ in the ILH, and that NK cell depletion abolishes this increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). To confirm the importance of IFN-γ produced upon housing in EE, mice were treated with an IFN-γ−blocking antibody (Ab-anti-IFN-γ), before analyzing the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes in CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from their brains. The efficacy of anti-IFN-γAb treatment was verified by analysis of MHCII protein expression in infiltrating CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells, brain IgG staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>), and CD31<sup>+</sup> cell density in the tumor area, as described below. IFN-γ depletion completely abolishes the effect of EE on CD11b<sup>+</sup> cell phenotypic changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). This treatment has consequences similar to those of NK cell depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garofalo et al., 2015</xref>), reducing the effect of EE on tumor volume and inhibiting the pro-survival effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c–d</xref>). EE and IFN-γ depletion alone have opposite effects on angiogenesis. EE housing reduces the extent of CD31 staining, probably because of the production of angiostatic chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coughlin et al., 1998</xref>); whereas IFN-γ depletion per se increases angiogenesis. When the two treatments are combined, the reduction induced by EE is less pronounced but still maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). The blunted effect of EE on tumor size reduction was at least partially dependent on a reduced inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, as more Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells were present in the tumor mass of IFN-γ-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), in accordance with the anti-proliferative activity of IFN-γ.

We also confirmed that IL-15 infusion increases the number of CD3<sup>–</sup>/NK1.1<sup>+</sup> cells (NK cells) in the brains of tumor-implanted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). These cells were mostly activated, being CD69<sup>+</sup> and expressing granzyme B and IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c–e</xref>). In accordance, chronic infusion of IL-15 increased IFN-γ levels in the brains of glioma-bearing mice. The IL-15-induced increase of IFN-γ depends on NK cells, being absent in mice treated with an anti-NK 1.1 Ab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). We then investigated the effect of IL-15 on myeloid cell phenotype. CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from the brains of glioma-bearing mice treated with IL-15, as described in the scheme of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, showed a phenotype shifted towards the pro-inflammatory state, with significantly increased expression of pro- and reduced expression of anti-inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Similar results were obtained when animals were injected with CT-2a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1f</xref>). In accordance with this modulation of gene expression, IL-15 treatment also reduced the amount of CD68<sup>+</sup> and F4/80<sup>+</sup>/CD68<sup>+</sup> cells in the tumor mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), indicative of reduced activation of GAMs. Interestingly, the IL-15-dependent modulation of gene expression was completely absent in glioma-bearing mice in which NK cells were depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), further supporting the hypothesis that IL-15 modulates CD11b<sup>+</sup> cell phenotype by acting through NK cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33415.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>IL-15 is involved in the effects of EE on brain tumor.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Left: mice housed in SE were infused for 7 days in the striatum, with vehicle or IL-15 through micro-osmotic pumps, starting 10 days after GL261 cell transplantation, as described in the scheme.

In different mouse models of glioma, GAMs acquire a predominant anti-inflammatory phenotype, and ‘re-education’ of these cells towards a pro-inflammatory, anti-tumor phenotype successfully reduces tumor size and increases the mean survival times of tumor-bearing animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mieczkowski et al., 2015</xref>). GAMs, however, cannot be simply considered as M2-like cells, as they assume a plethora of different phenotypes, partially overlapping with the classical M1- or M2-macrophages, but in large part unique to GAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szulzewsky et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, in human GAMs, genes associated with immune pathways are not upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Szulzewsky et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that additional models of GBM must be considered before translating the results obtained in mouse models to patients. Nevertheless, the importance of GAMs in brain tumors has been recognized in humans, highlighting the need for further investigations, and also the need to explore different approaches. It is known that living in environments that are enriched with sensorial, physical and social stimuli can modulate the brain microenvironment, affecting the levels of hormones involved in feeding behavior or linked to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, such as adiponectin, norepinephrine, BDNF and glucocorticoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2010</xref>). The external environment affects microglial cell proliferation in a brain-region-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehninger and Kempermann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehninger et al., 2011</xref>). Living environment also modifies brain-infiltrating myeloid cells in a mouse model of depression, in which the expression of pro-inflammatory genes is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chabry et al., 2015</xref>), affecting the response to antidepressant treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alboni et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, it changes microglial number and morphology in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rodríguez et al., 2015</xref>). However, the mechanistic links between the macroenvironment modifications and myeloid cell regulation are lacking. Among the potential candidates for this communication is BDNF, which is produced in the brain upon environmental stimuli, as well as other molecules that are secreted by peripheral and brain-infiltrating immune cells.</p><p>To evaluate these hypotheses, we first investigated the effects of EE on GAM phenotype and the possible role played by NK cells. Contrasting studies described either positive or no effects of EE on tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nachat-Kappes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garofalo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Westwood et al., 2013</xref>). The reason for these differences is not clear, and additional experimental approaches such as analyses of the animal microbiota could be useful. It is indeed possible that central and peripheral signals activated in EE-housed mice could modulate the microbial composition of the gut, in a bidirectional communication with the different tumor microenvironments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldszmid et al., 2015</xref>). Clinical studies demonstrate that specific distressing stimuli, such as depression, feelings of loneliness and lack of social relationships, represent important risk factors for cancer development and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armaiz-Pena et al., 2009</xref>). Herein, we demonstrate that housing animals in EE deeply modifies GAM phenotype, in particular microglial phenotype, as shown by Affymetrix microarray gene expression profiling, GO analyses and RT-PCR analyses. Microglia, and in general CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells, isolated from the brain of glioma-bearing mice housed in EE, show increased expression of pro- and reduction of anti-inflammatory genes, indicative of an anti-tumor phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hambardzumyan et al., 2016</xref>). EE also modifies CD11b<sup>+</sup> cell morphology, increasing the length and the number of cell branches, the speed of process movement towards ATP (which mimics an injury signal) and the expression of <italic>P2ry12</italic> mRNA, thus suggesting the re-establishment of a more efficient patrolling activity of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haynes et al., 2006</xref>). P2RY12 is specifically expressed by microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butovsky et al., 2014</xref>) and associated with ATP-dependent process patrolling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohsawa et al., 2010</xref>) and better survival of patients with astrocytoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). In EE, IBA1<sup>+</sup> cells infiltrating the tumor mass also have reduced cell body roundness as well as increased phagocytic vacuoles, indicating the acquisition of a more ramified morphology with higher phagocytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sierra et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Having previously shown that NK cells are involved in mediating the effect of EE on glioma progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garofalo et al., 2015</xref>), we now investigated the role of NK cells in EE-induced phenotypic switch of myeloid cells. Other studies also have correlated microglia/macrophage activation state with NK cell activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kmiecik et al., 2014</xref>). We demonstrate that NK cell depletion completely abolishes the effect of EE on pro- and anti-inflammatory gene expression in CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells. Moreover, upon housing in EE, there was a significant increase of direct contacts between glioma and NK cells, although the relative distance between GFP<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells and NK cells did not change, in agreement with the observations of an activated phenotype of NK cells in EE. The key role of NK cells as mediators of the effects of EE on myeloid cells could be considered to be a little surprising, given the low frequency of NK cells in brain tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kmiecik et al., 2013</xref>). However, we confirmed that, in EE, NK cells more efficiently colonize the brain, increasing their distance from CD31<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells, degranulate against glioma cells, and produce increased amounts of IFN-γ. Experiments in which IFN-γ was neutralized in glioma-bearing mice confirmed the crucial role of this cytokine as an effector of NK cell activity. IFN-γ has antitumor activities, increases tumor immunogenicity, and inhibits angiogenesis and proliferation in brain tumors too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duluc et al., 2009</xref>). We demonstrated that depletion of IFN-γ in glioma-bearing mice abolished the effect of EE on the phenotypic switch of myeloid cells, reduced the environmental effect on tumor volume and abolished the concomitant increase of mice survival. Depletion of IFN-γ also affected the reduction of angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation induced by EE. Analyzing the effect of IFN-γ in human GBM tissue, we reported the modulation of inflammatory gene expression in myeloid cells, thus demonstrating that IFN-γ also influences human myeloid cell phenotype.</p><p>It is known that pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by myeloid cells, such as IL-12 and IL-15, stimulate the production of IFN-γ by NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strengell et al., 2002</xref>). We demonstrated that, in glioma-bearing mice, brain infusion of IL-15: i) increased the frequency of infiltrating NK cells in the ILH, ii) increased the frequency of NK cells producing IFN-γ, and iii) mimicked the effect of EE on the switch to an inflammatory gene expression in myeloid cells. In mice depleted of NK cells, IL-15 did not induce this gene expression switch, thus demonstrating the importance of NK cells in mediating the effect of IL-15 on myeloid cells. In addition, IL-15 administration reduced the number of infiltrating F4/80<sup>+</sup>/CD68<sup>+</sup> cells in the tumor mass, in line with the hypothesis of a preferential NK-myeloid cell communication mediated by IL-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waldmann, 2006</xref>). In EE mice lacking IL-15Rα, we failed to observe the modulation of inflammatory genes, and tumor size did not decrease. These data demonstrate the crucial role played by IL-15 in mediating the cascade of pathways activated by NK cells and IFN-γ in glioma-bearing mice housed in EE. Moreover, they support the hypothesis of a therapeutic usage of IL-15, administered alone or in combination with IL-15Ra, in brain tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mathios et al., 2016</xref>). We also analyzed the differential expression of inflammatory genes in microglia (CD11b<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>low</sup>/Ly6c<sup>–</sup>/Ly6g<sup>–</sup> cells) and infiltrating monocytes (CD11b<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>+</sup>/Ly6c<sup>+</sup>/Ly6g<sup>–</sup> cells) isolated from the ILH and CLH of glioma-bearing mice. We demonstrated the absence of CD11b<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>+</sup>/Ly6c<sup>+</sup>/Ly6g<sup>–</sup>cells in the CLH, indicating a specific localization of infiltrating monocytes in the tumor region. We also described that both microglia and infiltrating myeloid cells express, in the tumor region, higher levels of anti-inflammatory genes, whereas their expression was reduced in both cell populations in EE. In contrast, the increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes upon housing in EE is almost restricted to microglia, demonstrating a major role for these cells in antitumor activity. Peripheral phagocyte depletion with clodronate-filled liposomes confirms the major role played by microglia in reducing tumor size in EE, whereas peripheral phagocytes control tumor size in SE. Altogether, these results indicate that brain-resident phagocytes are themselves targets of environmental stimuli, together with monocytes, although there are some differences in EE-induced phenotype modification.</p><p>To establish a mechanistic link between the variations in the macroenvironment and the modulation of myeloid cell phenotype, we considered BDNF as a potential mediator, because its brain levels increase upon psychosocial and physical enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Branchi et al., 2004</xref>). We demonstrate that BDNF stimulated the production of IL-15 in the brain of glioma-bearing mice, and specifically in microglia upon challenge with IL-4 or co-culture with glioma cells. In summary, our results suggest that the neurotrophins produced in the brain of glioma-bearing EE mice activate a virtuous cycle starting with the production of IL-15 by microglial cells that, in turn, stimulates NK cells to produce IFN-γ, with effects on myeloid cell phenotype, switching them towards an anti-tumor state (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), which explains the protective effects of the environment.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33415.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary of the events activated in EE-housed mice with glioma.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33415-fig7-v2"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Salts, glucose, adenosine 5’-triphosphate magnesium salt (Mg-ATP), hematoxylin, eosin, Percoll, BSA and deoxyribonuclease I were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).

A glass pipette containing ATP (2 mM) was placed in the center of the tumoral or peritumoral areas or in the <italic>CL</italic> striatum. Mg-ATP was pressure applied to the slices (100 ms; 5 p.s.i.) with a Pneumo pump (WPI). Changes in GFP fluorescence distribution were monitored by acquiring a fluorescent image every 10 s for 50 min. To quantify the speed of process rearrangement toward the pipette tip, we measured the increase of GFP fluorescence in a circular area centered on the pipette tip (10 µm radius). At each time point, the fluorescence increase in the area was calculated as ΔF = F F<sub>0</sub>, and then divided by F<sub>0</sub> (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>0</sub> is the average fluorescence before ATP puff), to normalize the difference in basal GFP fluorescence in slices from the two conditions. Slices were used from 2 to 7h after cutting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings</title><p>Visually identified GFP-expressing cells were patched in whole-cell configuration in the tumoral area, peritumoral area and CLH striatum. Micropipettes (4–5 MΩ) were usually filled with a solution containing (in mM): KCl 135, BAPTA 5, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2, HEPES 10, and Mg-ATP 2 (pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH, osmolarity 290 mOsm). Voltage-clamp recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Currents were filtered at 2 kHz, digitized (10 kHz) and acquired using Clampex 10 (Molecular Devices). The analysis was performed off-line using Clampfit 10 (Molecular Devices). The current/voltage (I/V) relationship of each cell was determined by applying voltage steps from −170 to +70 mV (ΔV = 10 mV) for 50 ms holding the cell at −70 mV between steps. Resting membrane potential and membrane capacitance were measured at the start of recording. Outward- and inward-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current amplitude was evaluated after subtraction of the leak current by a linear fit of the I/V curve between −100 and −50 mV. Cells were considered as expressing the outward-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current when the I/V relationship showed a rectification above −30 mV and the amplitude measured at 0 mV was at least 5 pA, after leak subtraction; similarly, cells showing a small inward rectification below −100 mV were classified as expressing the inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current when the subtracted current amplitude was at least 5 pA at −150 mV.</p><p>Membrane capacitance (Cm) of patched cells was estimated as the total charge (i.e., the current integral, Q step) mobilized in each cell by a 10 mV depolarizing step (V step): Q step/V step. Resting membrane potential (RP) and membrane resistance (Rm) were measured immediately after membrane rupture. Average values of Cm, Rm and RP are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33415.018</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Passive properties of patched microglia: membrane capacitance (Cm), resting membrane potential (RP) and membrane resistance (Rm) were measured as described in the methods.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Cm (pF)</th><th valign="top">Rm (MΩ)</th><th valign="top">RP (mV)</th><th valign="top">N</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Tum SE</td><td valign="top">26 ± 2</td><td valign="top">1.5 ± 0.1</td><td valign="top">–45 ± 3</td><td valign="top">57</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Tum EE</td><td valign="top">26 ± 1</td><td valign="top">2.1 ± 0.2</td><td valign="top">–46 ± 2</td><td valign="top">64</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peri SE</td><td valign="top">27 ± 1</td><td valign="top">1.9 ± 0.2</td><td valign="top">–43 ± 4</td><td valign="top">60</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peri EE</td><td valign="top">25 ± 1</td><td valign="top">2.2 ± 0.2</td><td valign="top">–49 ± 3</td><td valign="top">57</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>CLH</italic> SE</td><td valign="top">18 ± 3</td><td valign="top">2.7 ± 0.4</td><td valign="top">–53 ± 3</td><td valign="top">38</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>CLH</italic> EE</td><td valign="top">20 ± 1</td><td valign="top">2.4 ± 0.3</td><td valign="top">–47 ± 4</td><td valign="top">27</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Process movement</title><p>Image stacks were processed using the ImageJ ‘Manual Tracking’ plug-in (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov">http://imagej.nih.gov</ext-link>/ij/plugins/track/track.html) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pagani et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, stacks were initially background subtracted to optimize contrast. Track positions of single processes were transferred into a new coordinate system, in which the initial position of each track was set as the origin (x = 0, y = 0). For each moving process (i), with position vector Ri(t), the change in position from one frame to the next (ΔRi[t]) and the instantaneous velocity (vi[t]) were given by ΔRi(t)=Ri(t+Δt)−Ri(t), and vi(t)=ΔRi(t)/Δt respectively, where Δt is the elapsed time between the two frames. The mean velocity of each process was calculated as &lt;v&gt;= dx/dt, expressed in μm/min, defining dx as the mean accumulated distance of each process i sampled within the time interval dt. Migration length of single processes was also analyzed using the ‘Manual Tracking’ plug-in tool. Quantitative distributions of track parameters were analyzed with Origin 7 (OriginLab Co.) software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-28"><title>Morphological analysis of myeloid cells and 3D reconstruction</title><p>Brain slices from perfused brains were analyzed by confocal microscopy and skeleton analysis to assess myeloid cell morphology using endogenous GFP signal. Twenty μm z-stacks were acquired at 0.5 μm intervals using an FV1000 laser scanning microscope (Olympus) at ×60 objective. Cell morphology was measured in tumoral and peritumoral region using a method adapted from that described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morrison and Filosa (2013</xref>). Maximum intensity projections for the GFP channel of each image were generated, binarized, and skeletonized using the Skeletonize 2D/3D plugin in ImageJ, after which the Analyze Skeleton plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.net/AnalyzeSkeleton">http://imagej.net/AnalyzeSkeleton</ext-link>) was applied. The average branch number (process end points per cell) and length per cell were recorded for each image with a voxel size exclusion limit of 150 applied. The number of single and multiple junction points was additionally calculated to give an indication of branching complexity. The areas of the soma and scanning domain were measured for each cell. 3D reconstruction of NK cells, GL261 and myeloid cells was achieved by confocal microscopy analysis with a FV1200 (Olympus) Laser Scanning System, at 60x magnification. Myeloid and GL261 cells were detected using endogenous GFP and RFP signals respectively, NK cells were identified with an Alexa fluor 633 conjugated NK1.1 antibody. Acquisition files were then processed with ImageJ software for two-dimensional analysis. Three-dimensional reconstructions were generated with Imaris software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) and morphometric analysis of each reconstructed cell, both in acute slices and in perfused brain sections, was performed after surface and volume rendering. Distance plugin of Imaris software was applied to evaluate distances between surfaces of NK cells, GL261 and microglia.</p></sec><sec id="s4-29"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Immunoperoxidase staining for electron microscopy was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tremblay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bisht et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, mice housed in EE or SE were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (80 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused through the aortic arch with 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 4% paraformaldehyde. Only mice for which the perfusion was optimal were included in the study; brain sections containing the tumor were washed in PBS, quenched with 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, then with 0.1% NaBH<sub>4</sub>, washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mM at pH 7.4) containing 0.01% Triton X100, and processed freely floating for immunostaining. Sections were blocked in TBS containing 10% FBS, 3% BSA and 0.01% Triton X100, prior to overnight incubation at 4°C with primary antibody (rabbit anti-Iba1 1:1000). Sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies (biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG 1:200) for 1.5h. Staining was amplified by the ABC Vecta stain system (Vector laboratories), and revealed using diaminobenzidine (DAB; 0.05%) and hydrogen peroxide (0.015%) in TBS for 5 min. Sections were further processed for electron microscopy as follows: they were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and dehydrated using increasing concentrations of ethanol and finally immersed in propylene oxide. Following dehydration, sections were impregnated with Durcopan resin (EMS) overnight at RT, mounted between ACLAR embedding films (EMS), and cured at 55°C for 72h. Specific regions of interest were excised and mounted on resin blocks for ultrathin sectioning.</p><p>Ultrathin (65–80 nm) sections were cut and collected on bare square mesh grids (EMS) using an ultramicrotome (Leica Ultracut UC7) and imaged at 80kV with a FEI Tecnai Spirit G2 transmission electron microscope. Profiles of neurons, synaptic elements, microglia, myeloid cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and myelinated axons were identified according to well-established criteria. Microglia were identified both by their Iba1 immunoreactivity and by their association with extracellular space, with distinctive long stretches of endoplasmic reticulum, and with small elongated nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tremblay et al., 2010</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">, 2012</xref>). Myeloid cell bodies were photographed at various magnifications between 800x and 9300x using an ORCA-HR digital camera. In these images, we analyzed the size and shape of myeloid cells, ultrastructural features of microglia, contacts with NK and tumor cells, as well as phagocytic activity. All the analysis was performed by investigators blinded to the experimental conditions using FIJI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-30"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are shown as the mean ± SEM.

The modulations of gene expression were found to be dependent on interferon- (IFN) γ produced by NK cells and mimicked by interleukin-15 (IL-15). A role for BDNF linking environmental cues to the acquisition of a pro-inflammatory anti-tumor microenvironment in mouse brain was found.</p><p>The data presented are well illustrated and notably convincing. However, a singular time point analysis provided in this report coupled with notable conflicting data sets reported by others warrants a &quot;real&quot; need for rigor and the inclusion of cross-over analysis for this report to reach the muster for further consideration.</p><p>For example, while the reports cited (in Cell. 2010 Jul 9;142(1):52-64. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2010.05.029 and PLoS One. 2012;7(12):e51525. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0051525. Epub 2012) demonstrated positive effects of EE on tumor regression in models of breast, melanoma and colon cancer subsequent research performed by others have failed to reproduce such findings (F1000Res. 2013 Jun 12;2:140. doi: 10.12688/f1000research.2-140.v1. eCollection 2013). While EE has shown effects in on neurogenesis, brain injury, cognitive capacity, memory, learning, neuronal vitality, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, anxiety, depression, drug addiction, amongst others the impact levels have not been consistent throughout (recent examples reported in Behav Brain Res. 2016 Mar 15;301:72-83. doi: 10.1016/j.bbr.2015.12.028; Behav Brain Res. 2017 Jun 16;332:355-361. doi: 10.1016/j.bbr.2017.06.009. [Epub ahead of print]. This has led others to question differences based on differential tumor growth rates, microbiota of the mice housed in different facilities, variations in noise and handling between two environments as well as food or cage composition. As EE may not be consistent for results regarding decreased tumor growth this puts forward a need to provide further controls for the possibility of other influences that factors could affect cancer progression and related inflammatory profiles in this setting. Having such additional data in hand would increase the impact substantively of this important study.</p><p>On balance, I am certainly open to the fact that different laboratories may see different results based on investigator preferences and laboratory practice it is incumbent on the Journal to request as is responsible and reasonable for the authors to engage in cross validations of their data sets. Herein, placing SE housed mice into EE environments before and during tumor implantation and vice versa. Analyses of the animal microbioata and blood/plasma biomarkers during the crossed experiments would also prove helpful in validating the current data sets.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors have chosen to study an interesting and potentially clinically relevant aspect of glioblastioma biology, that of microglial/macrophage interactions. This group has elected to use implanted GL261 cells in syngeneic, immunocompetent mice as the primary model for these studies. This group's previous work demonstrated that an enriched housing environment (EE) reduces glioma cell growth. In this report, the authors provide needed mechanistic details to explain this observation. By in large, this is a well-designed series of experiments that is of interest to both the glioma and microglia/macrophage communities. I do have a few concerns that should be addressed prior to publication:</p><p>1) The near-exclusive use of a single model (GL261) limits the interpretation of these provocative results. This cell line is known to highly express MHCI, and is in and of itself moderately immunogeneic. It is therefore recommended that the authors repeat key figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–E</xref>) with at least one additional syngeneic model. GL26 and CT-2A are cell lines syngeneic in C57Bl/6, and would be relatively straightforward in this regard.</p><p>2) The authors did make use of the human cell line U87 in a xenograft system. However, based on the text, figures and figure legends, it is often unclear when this model was used. This is most confusing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. In panels B–E, it is unclear which model was employed for which experiment. Does EE/SE imply only C57Bl/6? Please be explicit.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> schematic and legend should be edited to make it clear that the CD11b(+) cells were isolated and assayed from the GBM explants- and not all cells. CD11b(+) cells isolated from nearly any organ in nearly any disease or quiescent state, once treated with IFN-γ ex vivo, are expected to express pro-inflammatory genes. This panel could be eliminated from the manuscript completely.</p><p>4) In general, the clinical implications of the results should be toned down considerably. There are nearly no correlative studies presented that make productive use of human tissues or clinical data. Response of a single, immunogenic model to treatment with IL15 treatment, while provocative, is not nearly sufficient to justify human studies.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Environmental stimuli shape microglial plasticity in glioma&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Normal or already transformed cells, originating from neurogenic niches, would migrate in brain parenchyma and transform at an unknown moment during their invasion. We reasoned that injecting tumor cells deep in the striatum, not far from the SVZ, would create a more realistic scenario of cell movement and growth in brain parenchyma, sensing and responding to the regional expression of specific extracellular matrix proteins.</p><p>2) Published reports by others deny the central conclusion of your study, making it mandatory that additional cross validating and confirmatory experiments be performed.</p><p>We are aware that contrasting results on the effects of environment on tumors have been published by different laboratories. It is a remarkable aspect of these studies that, we are convinced, deserves further investigation to understand which could be the confounding factors responsible of these differences.</p><p>To answer the reviewer, we performed additional experiments. In detail:</p><p>i) We repeated some of the experiments (effects of SE and EE on tumor size) in a different room, and the results do not change (now mentioned in the Materials and methods section and Results section).</p><p>ii) Some experiments (effects of SE and EE on tumor size) were performed by a different researcher, and the results do not change (now mentioned in the Materials and methods and Results sections, see above).</p><p>iii) The effect of animal handling was investigated in SE housed mice. At this aim, mice in SE were manipulated for the same time dedicated to EE-housed animals during toys change and cage modification. Results do not change, and are not shown in the text (SE: 4.19 ± 0.60 mm3 n=10; SE manipulated: 3.82 ± 0.14 mm3 n=5) but mentioned in the Materials and methods and Results sections (see above).</p><p>iv) A group of mice was first housed in EE and after tumor injection, in SE. Results demonstrate that this treatment was as effective as EE-tumor injection-EE, but these data are only mentioned in the method and result sections, see above (SE: 4.19 ± 0.6 mm3; EE: 0.5 ± 0.14 mm3 n = 6 one Way ANOVA p&lt;0.001 Dunn’s methods vs SE). Please note that the opposite experiment was already done in Garofalo et al., 2015. In that paper we housed mice in SE, injected the tumor, and moved mice in EE: this treatment did not result in a significant reduction of tumor size, demonstrating that the period of enrichment must precede tumor presence.</p><p>v) In addition, considering the importance to understand the possible reasons of contrasting results among different laboratories, and to better compare protocols, we decided to insert a table (new <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), describing all the details of our housing conditions, comprising the sanitary report, as suggested by Westwood, (2013).</p><p>3) Repeat the experiments using at least one additional mouse model (e.g. cell lines mentioned in the appended review are commercially available) on the basis that the GL261 cell line is so immunogenic that your entire paper may be the result of the brain's response to this single cell line.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this important consideration. We repeated some of the experiments with one of the suggested mouse cell line, CT-2a. Qualitatively, the results do not differ from what observed with GL261; we only observed some differences in the extent of reduction in tumor volume and in the modulation of gene expression in CD11b+ cells. There is only one significant difference in the response to the treatment with anti-IFNγ, where the effect of EE on tumor size is lost (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>) while with GL261 we observed a partial reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The new results are now shown in the Results section and in the figure supplements. Specifically:</p><p>i) Exposing mice to an EE was effective in reducing tumor size also in mice inEected with CT-2a (SE: 19.43 ± 3.4 mm3; EE: 8.58 ± 2.4 mm3, n=5 p&lt;0.001 one Way ANOVA p&lt;0.001 Holm Sidak). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>.</p><p>ii) We also isolated CD11b positive cells from these mice and the results obtained show that in mice injected with CT-2a and exposed to EE, there is a significant increase of expression of pro-inflammatory genes and a reduction of anti-inflammatory ones. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), in accordance with what observed in CD11b+ cells from mice bearing GL261 tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>iii) Mice injected with CT-2a were treted with Ab-IFNγ: under these conditions, no differences were induced by the housing conditions. SE: 27.26 ± 1.32 mm3; EE: 27.36 ± 1.35 n=4 (one way ANOVA p&lt;0.001 Holm Sidak vs EE), see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>, right). CD11b+ cells isolated from these mice had no differences in the expression level of pro- or anti-inflammatory genes in EE vs SE (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>iv) CT2a-injected mice were implanted with osmotic pumps releasing IL-15, as described before, and a significant reduction of tumor size was observed (Veh 14.70 ± 1.20 mm3 n= 4; IL-15: 5.32 ± 0.89 mm3 n=4 t test p=0.003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). CD11b+ cells isolated from these mice upregulated pro-inflammatory and down-regulated anti-inflammatory genes upon IL-15 treatment (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a quite interesting and original study even if the mechanistic link between EE and the shift in the microglial phenotype remains enigmatic.

We investigated the molecular link between EE and the induction of microglial phenotype: we have previously shown that EE induces an increase of brain BDNF (Garofalo et al., 2015); data shown in this paper demonstrate that BDNF infusion in the brain of glioma bearing mice induces IL-15 transcription in CD11b+ cells (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). IL-15 infusion in glioma bearing mice, in turn, switches microglia phenotype toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Results demonstrate that this treatment was as effective as EE-tumor injection-EE, but these data are only mentioned in the method and result sections, see above (SE: 4.19 ± 0.6 mm3; EE: 0.5 ± 0.14 mm3 n = 6 one Way ANOVA p&lt;0.001 Dunn’s methods vs SE). Please note that the opposite experiment was already done in Garofalo et al., 2015. In that paper we housed mice in SE, injected the tumor, and moved mice in EE: this treatment did not result in a significant reduction of tumor size, demonstrating that the period of enrichment must precede tumor presence.</p><p>v) In addition, considering the importance to understand the possible reasons of contrasting results among different laboratories, and to better compare protocols, we decided to insert a table (new <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), describing all the details of our housing conditions, comprising the sanitary report, as suggested by Westwood, (2013).</p><p>In our previous paper (Garofalo et al., 2015) we analyzed tumor size at two different time points (10 and 17 days). We did not repeat this analysis for CD11b+ cell phenotype but decided to focus on a single time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors have chosen to study an interesting and potentially clinically relevant aspect of glioblastioma biology, that of microglial/macrophage interactions. This group has elected to use implanted GL261 cells in syngeneic, immunocompetent mice as the primary model for these studies. This group's previous work demonstrated that an enriched housing environment (EE) reduces glioma cell growth. In this report, the authors provide needed mechanistic details to explain this observation. By in large, this is a well-designed series of experiments that is of interest to both the glioma and microglia/macrophage communities. I do have a few concerns that should be addressed prior to publication:</p><p>1) The near-exclusive use of a single model (GL261) limits the interpretation of these provocative results. This cell line is known to highly express MHCI, and is in and of itself moderately immunogeneic. It is therefore recommended that the authors repeat key figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–E</xref>) with at least one additional syngeneic model. GL26 and CT-2A are cell lines syngeneic in C57Bl/6, and would be relatively straightforward in this regard.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important consideration. We repeated some of the experiments with one of the suggested mouse cell line, CT-2a. Qualitatively, the results do not differ from what observed with GL261; we only observed some differences in the extent of reduction in tumor volume and in the modulation of gene expression in CD11b+ cells. There is only one significant difference in the response to the treatment with anti-IFNγ, where the effect of EE on tumor size is lost (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>) while with GL261 we observed a partial reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The new results are now shown in part in the Result section, and in part as Supplement to Figures. In detail:</p><p>i) Exposing mice to an EE was effective in reducing tumor size also in mice injected with CT-2a (SE: 19.43 ± 3.4 mm3; EE: 8.58 ± 2.4 mm3, n=5 p&lt;0.001 one Way ANOVA p&lt;0.001 Holm Sidak). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>.</p><p>ii) We also isolated CD11b positive cells from these mice and the results obtained show that in mice injected with CT-2a and exposed to EE, there is a significant increase of expression of pro-inflammatory genes and a reduction of anti-inflammatory ones. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), in accordance with what observed in CD11b+ cells from mice bearing GL261 tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>iii) Mice injected with CT-2a were treted with Ab-IFNγ: under these conditions, no differences were induced by the housing conditions. SE: 27.26 ± 1.32 mm3; EE: 27.36 ± 1.35 n=4 (one way ANOVA p&lt;0.001 Holm Sidak vs EE), see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>, right). CD11b+ cells isolated from these mice had no differences in the expression level of pro- or anti-inflammatory genes in EE vs SE (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>iv) CT2a-injected mice were implanted with osmotic pumps releasing IL-15, as described before, and a significant reduction of tumor size was observed (Veh 14.70 ± 1.20 mm3 n= 4; IL-15: 5.32 ± 0.89 mm3 n=4 t test p=0.003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5——figure supplement 1A</xref>). CD11b+ cells isolated from these mice upregulated pro-inflammatory and down-regulated anti-inflammatory genes upon IL-15 treatment (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors did make use of the human cell line U87 in a xenograft system. However, based on the text, figures and figure legends, it is often unclear when this model was used. This is most confusing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. In panels B–E, it is unclear which model was employed for which experiment. Does EE/SE imply only C57Bl/6? Please be explicit.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for this lack of clarity. We now label the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, to be as explicit as possible. The effect of EE on U87-MG xenograft on tumor size, NK cells infiltration and response to IL-15 was already shown in our previous paper (Garofalo et al., 2015). For this reason the effect of IL-15 on infiltrating NK cells in detail is shown here only for GL261.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> schematic and legend should be edited to make it clear that the CD11b(+) cells were isolated and assayed from the GBM explants- and not all cells. CD11b(+) cells isolated from nearly any organ in nearly any disease or quiescent state, once treated with IFN-γ ex vivo, are expected to express pro-inflammatory genes. This panel could be eliminated from the manuscript completely.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for the misunderstanding. We did stimulate a mixture of cells obtained from dissociated tissue (CD11b+ cells, tumor cells, and other cells). This si now better explained in the figure legend. This implicate that the response cannot be anticipated or compared with that obtained with IFNγ-treated pure CD11b+ cells.</p><p>Even if expected, in general, we believe that these data, obtained on human tissue/cells, provide additional value to our results. These are the only experiments we report on human tissue and validate our experimental hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In general, the clinical implications of the results should be toned down considerably. There are nearly no correlative studies presented that make productive use of human tissues or clinical data. Response of a single, immunogenic model to treatment with IL15 treatment, while provocative, is not nearly sufficient to justify human studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry but we cannot answer the review on this point, because we cannot find the text about the clinical implications of our study.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have responded to my queries and included appropriate cross validation data sets. However, since there are clear opposite results reported in the published literature I would have expected to see some level of discussion of the conflicting data sets with opinions as to why they might have occurred. This I believe important to the field and should be addressed prior to publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We now added another comment in the Discussion section that suggests possible explanations for the different results published on the effects of environment on tumors. We also added a new reference – Goldszmid et al., (2015).</p><p>“Contrasting studies described either positive or no effects on tumor progression for EE, considered as a sum of eu-stressing stimuli (13, 16) The reason of these differences is not clear and additional experimental approaches such as analyses of the animal microbiota could be useful. It is indeed possible that central and peripheral signals activated in EE housed mice could modulate microbial composition of the gut, in a bidirectional communication with the different tumor microenvironment (42).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Prior to publication, the manuscript will require some additional editing; some grammatical and English usage errors remain.</p></disp-quote><p>Careful re-editing has been performed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
