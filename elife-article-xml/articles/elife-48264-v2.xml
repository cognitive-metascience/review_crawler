Both Kenyon cells and their inputs from projection neurons are cholinergic, yet little is known about the physiological function of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in learning in adult flies. Here, we show that aversive olfactory learning in adult flies requires type A muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR-A), particularly in the gamma subtype of Kenyon cells. mAChR-A inhibits odor responses and is localized in Kenyon cell dendrites. Moreover, mAChR-A knockdown impairs the learning-associated depression of odor responses in a mushroom body output neuron. Our results suggest that mAChR-A function in Kenyon cell dendrites is required for synaptic plasticity between Kenyon cells and their output neurons.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48264.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>We can learn a surprising amount about how the brain forms memories by studying the humble fruit fly.

Studies in fruit fly larvae suggest that muscarinic receptors are required in Kenyon cells for the insects to learn how to associate odors with unpleasant experiences.</p><p>Bielopolski et al. now show that this is also the case in adult flies. Surprisingly, while acetylcholine usually excites fly neurons, activating muscarinic receptors inhibits Kenyon cells rather than exciting them. Labeled muscarinic receptors revealed that the receptors act within the input region of Kenyon cells. Moreover, reducing the levels of muscarinic receptors inside the cells stops flies from associating an odor with a mild electric shock. This manipulation also prevents the learning experience from weakening connections from Kenyon cells onto an MBON that triggers approach behavior. This suggests that allowing these changes in connectivity might be why muscarinic receptors are important for memory.</p><p>Understanding how memory works in flies can reveal basic principles that apply to many species, including humans.

In particular, neurons commonly express both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors for the same neurotransmitter, where the two may mediate different functions (e.g. direct excitation/inhibition vs. synaptic plasticity). In mammals, where glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter, metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) have been widely implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jörntell and Hansel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lüscher and Huber, 2010</xref>). Given the complexity of linking behavior to artificially induced plasticity in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schonewille et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yamaguchi et al., 2016</xref>), it would be useful to study the role of metabotropic receptors in learning in a simpler genetic model system with a clearer behavioral readout of synaptic plasticity. One such system is <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where powerful genetic tools and well-defined anatomy have yielded a detailed understanding of the circuit and molecular mechanisms underlying associative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Busto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cognigni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hige, 2018</xref>). The principal excitatory neurotransmitter in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is acetylcholine, but, surprisingly, little is known about the function of metabotropic acetylcholine signaling in synaptic plasticity or neuromodulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Here, we address this question using olfactory associative memory.</p><p>Flies can learn to associate an odor (conditioned stimulus, CS) with a positive (sugar) or a negative (electric shock) unconditioned stimulus (US), so that they later approach ‘rewarded’ odors and avoid ‘punished’ odors. This association is thought to be formed in the presynaptic terminals of the ~2000 Kenyon cells (KCs) that make up the mushroom body (MB), the fly’s olfactory memory center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Busto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cognigni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hige, 2018</xref>). These KCs are activated by odors via second-order olfactory neurons called projection neurons (PNs). Each odor elicits responses in a sparse subset of KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campbell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2014</xref>) so that odor identity is encoded in which KCs respond to each odor. When an odor (CS) is paired with reward/punishment (US), an odor-specific set of KCs is activated at the same time that dopaminergic neurons (DANs) release dopamine onto KC presynaptic terminals. The coincident activation causes long-term depression (LTD) of synapses from the odor-activated KCs onto mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) that lead to approach or avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso and Rubin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hige et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Séjourné et al., 2011</xref>). In particular, training specifically depresses KC-MBON synapses of the ‘wrong’ valence (e.g. odor-punishment pairing depresses odor responses of MBONs that lead to approach behavior), because different pairs of ‘matching’ DANs/MBONs (e.g. punishment/approach, reward/avoidance) innervate distinct regions along KC axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>Both MB input (PNs) and output (KCs) are cholinergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnstedt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yasuyama and Salvaterra, 1999</xref>), and KCs express both ionotropic (nicotinic) and metabotropic (muscarinic) acetylcholine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Crocker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Croset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shih et al., 2019</xref>). The nicotinic receptors mediate fast excitatory synaptic currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Su and O'Dowd, 2003</xref>), while the physiological function of the muscarinic receptors is unknown. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are G-protein-coupled receptors; out of the three mAChRs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (mAChR-A, mAChR-B and mAChR-C), mAChR-A (also called Dm1, mAcR-60C or mAChR) is the most closely homologous to mammalian mAChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Collin et al., 2013</xref>). Mammalian mAChRs are typically divided between ‘M<sub>1</sub>-type’ (M<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>3</sub>/M<sub>5</sub>), which signal via G<sub>q</sub> and are generally excitatory, and ‘M<sub>2</sub>-type’ (M<sub>2</sub>/M<sub>4</sub>), which signal via G<sub>i/o</sub> and are generally inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caulfield and Birdsall, 1998</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> mAChR-A seems to use ‘M<sub>1</sub>-type’ signaling: when heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, it signals via G<sub>q</sub> protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Collin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ren et al., 2015</xref>) to activate phospholipase C, which produces inositol trisphosphate to release Ca<sup>2+</sup> from internal stores.</p><p>Recent work indicates that mAChR-A is required for aversive olfactory learning in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, as knocking down mAChR-A expression in KCs impairs learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Silva et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is unclear whether mAChR-A is involved in olfactory learning in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>, given that mAChR-A is thought to signal through G<sub>q</sub>, and in adult flies G<sub>q</sub> signaling downstream of the dopamine receptor Damb promotes forgetting, not learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Himmelreich et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, it is unknown how mAChR-A affects the activity or physiology of KCs, where it acts (at KC axons or dendrites or both), and how these effects contribute to olfactory learning.</p><p>Here, we show that mAChR-A is required in KCs for aversive olfactory learning in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Surprisingly, genetic and pharmacological manipulations of mAChR-A suggest that mAChR-A is inhibitory and acts on KC dendrites. Moreover, mAChR-A knockdown impairs the learning-associated depression of odor responses in an MB output neuron, MB-MVP2, that is required for aversive memory retrieval. We suggest that dendritically acting mAChR-A is required for synaptic depression between KCs and their outputs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>mAChR-A expression in KCs is required for aversive olfactory learning in adult flies</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae with reduced mAChR-A expression in KCs show impaired aversive olfactory learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Silva et al., 2015</xref>), but it remains unknown whether mAChR-A in KCs also functions in learning in adult flies. We addressed this question by knocking down mAChR-A expression in KCs using two UAS-RNAi lines, ‘RNAi 1’ and ‘RNAi 2’ (see Materials and methods). Only RNAi 2 requires co-expression of Dicer-2 (Dcr-2) for optimal knockdown. To test the efficiency of these RNAi constructs, we expressed them pan-neuronally using elav-GAL4 and measured their effects on mAChR-A expression levels using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Both RNAi lines strongly reduce mAChR-A levels (RNAi 1: 39 ± 8% of elav-GAL4 control, or 61 ± 8% below normal; RNAi 2: 43 ± 10% of normal; mean ± s.e.m.; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then examined whether knocking down mAChR-A in KCs using the pan-KC driver OK107-GAL4 affects short-term aversive learning in adult flies. We used the standard odors used in the field (i.e. 3-octanol, OCT, and 4-methylcyclohexanol, MCH; see Materials and methods). Under these conditions, both UAS-RNAi transgenes significantly reduced aversive learning, whether training against MCH or OCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, knocking down mAChR-A did not affect learning when we trained flies with a more intense shock (90 V instead of 50 V, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that mAChR-A may only be required for learning with moderate intensity reinforcement, not severe reinforcement. Consistent with this, knocking down mAChR-A had no effect on naïve avoidance of MCH and OCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; see Materials and methods) or flies’ reaction to electric shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), showing that the defect was specific to learning, rather than reflecting a failure to detect odors or shock.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48264.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>mAChR-A is required in the MB for short-term aversive olfactory learning and memory but not for naive behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) qRT-PCR of mAChR-A with mAChR-A RNAi driven by elav-GAL4. The housekeeping gene eEF1α2 (eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2, CG1873) was used for normalization.

As expected, aversive olfactory learning was reduced by knocking down mAChR-A in αβ and γ KCs together using MB247-GAL4, but not by knockdown in α′β′ KCs using c305a-GAL4. To examine if αβ and γ KCs both participate in the reduced learning observed in mAChR-A knockdown flies, we sought to limit mAChR-A RNAi expression to either αβ or γ neurons. While strong driver lines exist for αβ neurons, the γ GAL4 drivers we tested were fairly weak (H24-GAL4, MB131B, R45H04-GAL4, data not shown), perhaps too weak to drive mAChR-A-RNAi enough to knock down mAChR-A efficiently. Therefore, we used MB247-GAL4, which was strong enough to affect behavior, and blocked GAL4 activity in either αβ or γ KCs by expressing the GAL80 repressor under the control of R44E04-LexA (αβ KCs) or R45H04-LexA (γ KCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bräcker et al., 2013</xref>).

Although the ∆F/F traces from the γ lobe had higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than some other lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) due to its larger size (averaging over more pixels) or shallower z-depth (less light scattering), a power analysis revealed that all lobes had SNRs high enough to detect an effect as large as that observed in the γ lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Initially, we bath-applied 10 µM muscarine, an mAChR-A agonist (<italic>Drosophila</italic> mAChR-B is 1000-fold less sensitive to muscarine than mAChR-A is [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Collin et al., 2013</xref>], and mAChR-C is not expressed in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davie et al., 2018</xref>]).

However, muscarine did not significantly affect the amplitude of odor responses in PN axons in the calyx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that the effect of muscarine on KCs arose in KCs, not earlier in the olfactory pathway.

We applied muscarine to flies with APL-specific expression of tetanus toxin (TNT), which blocks inhibition from APL and thereby greatly increases KC odor responses.

Although muscarine did not significantly affect peak ∆F/F during the odor in the α lobe, muscarine most likely did decrease α lobe odor responses, by the same logic as for calyx odor responses (see above). Given that calyx muscarine suppresses α′β′ axonal odor responses, the decrease in α′β′ KC GCaMP6f signal in the absence of odor likely reflects suppression of spontaneous action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>), as α′β′ KCs have the highest spontaneous spike rate out of the three subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Groschner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Turner et al., 2008</xref>).

While learning-associated plasticity in KC dendrites has been observed in honeybees, In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, olfactory associative memories are stored by weakening the synapses between KCs and output neurons that lead to the ‘wrong’ behavior. For example, aversive memory requires an output neuron downstream of γ KCs, called MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β or MB-MVP2. MB-MVP2 leads to approach behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>), and aversive conditioning reduces MB-MVP2’s responses to the aversively-trained odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hige et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>). We tested whether knocking down mAChR-A would prevent this depression. We knocked down mAChR-A in KCs using OK107-GAL4 and UAS-mAChR-A-RNAi 1, and expressed GCaMP6f in MB-MVP2 using R12G04-LexA and lexAop-GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We trained flies in the behavior apparatus and then imaged MB-MVP2 odor responses (3 hr after training to avoid cold-shock-sensitive memory). Because overall response amplitudes were variable across flies, for each fly we measured the ratio of the response to MCH (the trained odor) over the response to OCT (the untrained odor). Consistent with previous published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hige et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>), in control flies not expressing mAChR-A RNAi, the MCH/OCT ratio was substantially reduced in trained flies relative to mock-trained flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This was not because the OCT response increased, because there was no difference between trained and mock-trained flies in the ratio of the response to OCT over the response to isoamyl acetate, a ‘reference’ odor that was absent in the training protocol. This was also not because of any general decrease in odor responses, as shown by analyzing absolute response amplitudes to MCH, OCT and isoamyl acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, in flies expressing mAChR-A RNAi in KCs, the MCH/OCT ratio was the same between trained and mock-trained flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), indicating that the mAChR-A knockdown impaired the learning-related depression of the KC to MB-MVP2 synapse.

Knocking down mAChR-A prevents aversive learning from reducing responses of the MB output neuron MB-MVP2 to the conditioned odor, suggesting that mAChR-A is required for the learning-related depression of KC-&gt;MBON synapses.</p><p>Why is mAChR-A only required for aversive learning in γ KCs, not αβ or α′β′ KCs? Although our mAChR-A MiMIC gene trap agrees with single-cell transcriptome analysis that α′β′ KCs express less mAChR-A than do γ and αβ KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Croset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davie et al., 2018</xref>), transcriptome analysis indicates that α′β′ KCs do express some mAChR-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, γ and αβ KCs express similar levels of mAChR-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Crocker et al., 2016</xref>). It may be that the RNAi knockdown is less efficient at affecting the physiology of αβ and α′β′ KCs than γ KCs, whether because the knockdown is less efficient at reducing protein levels, or because αβ and α′β′ KCs have different intrinsic properties or a different function of mAChR-A such that 40% of normal mAChR-A levels is sufficient in αβ and α′β′ KCs but not γ KCs. This interpretation is supported by our finding that mAChR-A RNAi knockdown significantly increases odor responses only in the γ lobe, not the αβ or α′β′ lobes. Alternatively, γ, αβ and α′β′ KCs are thought to be important mainly for short-term memory, long-term memory, and memory consolidation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guven-Ozkan and Davis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krashes et al., 2007</xref>); as we only tested short-term memory, mAChR-A may carry out the same function in all KCs, but only its role in γ KCs is required for short-term (as opposed to long-term) memory. Indeed, the key plasticity gene DopR1 is required in γ, not αβ or α′β′ KCs, for short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qin et al., 2012</xref>). It may be that mAChR-A is required in non-γ KC types for other forms of memory besides short-term aversive memory, such as appetitive conditioning or other phases of memory like long-term memory. Our finding that mAChR-A is required in γ KCs for aversive short-term memory is consistent with our finding that mAChR-A knockdown in KCs disrupts training-induced depression of odor responses in MB-MVP2, an MBON postsynaptic to γ KCs required for aversive short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>). However, the latter finding does not rule out the possibility that other MBONs postsynaptic to non-γ KCs may also be affected by mAChR-A knockdown in KCs.</p><p>mAChR-A seems to inhibit KC odor responses, because knocking down mAChR-A increases odor responses in the calyx and γ lobe, while activating mAChR-A with bath or local application of muscarine decreases KC odor responses. Some details differ between the genetic and pharmacological results. In particular, while mAChR-A knockdown mainly affects γ KCs, with other subtypes inconsistently affected, muscarine reduces responses in all KC subtypes. What explains these differences? mAChR-A might be weakly activated in physiological conditions, in which case gain of function would cause a stronger effect than loss of function. Similarly, pharmacological activation of mAChR-A is likely a more drastic manipulation than a 60% reduction of mAChR-A mRNA levels. Although we cannot entirely rule out network effects from muscarine application, the effect of muscarine does not stem from PNs or APL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>) and locally applied muscarine would have little effect on neurons outside the mushroom body.</p><p>How does mAChR-A inhibit odor-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in KCs? Given that mAChR-A signals through G<sub>q</sub> when expressed in CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ren et al., 2015</xref>), that muscarinic G<sub>q</sub> signaling normally increases excitability in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caulfield and Birdsall, 1998</xref>), and that pan-neuronal artificial activation of G<sub>q</sub> signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae increases overall excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becnel et al., 2013</xref>), it may be surprising that mAChR-A inhibits KCs. However, G<sub>q</sub> signaling may exert different effects on different neurons in the fly brain, and some examples exist of inhibitory G<sub>q</sub> signaling by mammalian mAChRs. M<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>3</sub>/M<sub>5</sub> receptors acting via G<sub>q</sub> can inhibit voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gamper et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kammermeier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Suh et al., 2010</xref>), reduce voltage-gated Na +currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cantrell et al., 1996</xref>), or trigger surface transport of KCNQ channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>), thus increasing inhibitory K<sup>+</sup> currents. <italic>Drosophila</italic> mAChR-A may inhibit KCs through similar mechanisms.</p><p>What is the source of ACh which activates mAChR-A and modulates odor responses? In the calyx, cholinergic PNs are certainly a major source of ACh. However, KCs themselves are cholinergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnstedt et al., 2016</xref>) and release neurotransmitter in both the calyx and lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Christiansen et al., 2011</xref>). KCs form synapses on each other in the calyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>), possibly allowing mAChR-A to mediate lateral inhibition, in conjunction with the lateral inhibition provided by the GABAergic APL neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>What function does mAChR-A serve in learning and memory? Our results indicate that mAChR-A knockdown prevents the learning-associated weakening of KC-MBON synapses, in particular for MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β, aka MB-MVP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). One potential explanation is that the increased odor-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx observed in knockdown flies increases synaptic release, which overrides the learning-associated synaptic depression. However, increased odor-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx per se is unlikely on its own to straightforwardly explain a learning defect, because other genetic manipulations that increase odor-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in KCs either have no effect on, or even improve, olfactory learning. For example, knocking down GABA synthesis in the inhibitory APL neuron increases odor-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lei et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2014</xref>) and improves olfactory learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu and Davis, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The most intuitive explanation would be that mAChR-A acts at KC synaptic terminals in KC axons to help depress KC-MBON synapses. Yet overexpressed mAChR-A localizes to KC dendrites, not axons, and functionally rescues mAChR-A hypomorphic mutants, showing that dendritic mAChR-A suffices for its function in learning and memory. Does this show that mAChR-A has no role in KC axons? Our inability to detect GFP expressed from the mAChR-A MiMIC gene trap suggests that normally there may only be a small amount of mAChR-A in KCs. It may be that with mAChR-A-FLAG overexpression, the correct (undetectable) amount of mAChR-A is trafficked to and functions in axons, but due to a bottleneck in axonal transport, the excess tagged mAChR-A is trapped in KC dendrites. While our results do not rule out this possibility, a general bottleneck in axonal transport seems unlikely as many overexpressed proteins are localized to KC axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Trunova et al., 2011</xref>). We feel it is more parsimonious to take the dendritic localization of mAChR-A-FLAG at face value and infer that mAChR-A functions in KC dendrites.</p><p>How can mAChR-A in KC dendrites affect synaptic plasticity in KC axons? mAChR-A signaling might change the shape or duration of KC action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Burnstock, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghamari-Langroudi and Bourque, 2004</xref>), an effect that could potentially propagate to KC axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Juusola et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shu et al., 2006</xref>). Such changes in the action potential waveform may not be detected by calcium imaging, but could potentially affect a ‘coincidence detector’ in KC axons that detects when odor (i.e. KC activity) coincides with reward/punishment (i.e. dopamine). This coincidence detector is generally believed to be the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent adenylyl cyclase <italic>rutabaga</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levin et al., 1992</xref>). Changing the waveform of KC action potentials could potentially affect local dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx near <italic>rutabaga</italic> molecules. In addition, <italic>rutabaga</italic> mutations do not abolish learning (mutants have ~40–50% of normal learning scores) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yildizoglu et al., 2015</xref>), so there may be additional coincidence detection mechanisms affected by action potential waveforms. Testing this idea would require a better understanding of biochemical events underlying learning at KC synaptic terminals.</p><p>Alternatively, mAChR-A’s effects on synaptic plasticity may not occur acutely. Although we ruled out purely developmental effects of mAChR-A through adult-only RNAi expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), knocking out mAChR-A for several days in adulthood might still affect KC physiology in a not-entirely-acute way. For example, as with other G-protein-coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang and Zhuo, 2012</xref>), muscarinic receptors can affect gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">von der Kammer et al., 1998</xref>), which could have wide-ranging effects on KC physiology, for example action potential waveform, expression of key genes required for synaptic plasticity, etc. Another intriguing possibility is suggested by an apparent paradox: both mAChR-A and the dopamine receptor Damb signal through G<sub>q</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Himmelreich et al., 2017</xref>), but mAChR-A promotes learning while Damb promotes forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berry et al., 2012</xref>). How can G<sub>q</sub> mediate apparently opposite effects? Perhaps G<sub>q</sub> signaling aids both learning and forgetting by generally rendering synapses more labile. Indeed, although <italic>damb</italic> mutants retain memories for longer than wildtype, their initial learning is slightly impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berry et al., 2012</xref>); <italic>damb</italic> mutant larvae are also impaired in aversive olfactory learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Selcho et al., 2009</xref>). Although one study reports that knocking down G<sub>q</sub> in KCs did not impair initial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Himmelreich et al., 2017</xref>), the G<sub>q</sub> knockdown may not have been strong enough; also, that study shocked flies with 90 V shocks, which also gives normal learning in mAChR-A knockdown flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Such hypotheses posit that mAChR-A regulates synaptic plasticity ‘competence’ rather than participating directly in the plasticity mechanism itself. Why should synaptic plasticity competence be controlled by an activity-dependent mechanism? It is tempting to speculate that mAChR-A may allow a kind of metaplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham, 2008</xref>) in which exposure to odors (hence activation of mAChR-A in KCs) makes flies’ learning mechanisms more sensitive. Indeed, mAChR-A is required for learning with moderate (50 V) shocks, not severe (90 V) shocks. Future studies may further clarify how muscarinic signaling contributes to olfactory learning.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>mAChR-A</td><td/><td>FLYB: FBgn0000037</td><td>Also known as: mAChR, mAcR-60C, DM1, Acr60C, CG4356</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>MiMIC mAChR-A-stop</italic></td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Venken et al., 2011</xref>) PMID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21985007">21985007</ext-link></td><td>BDSC:59216</td><td><italic>mAChR-A<sup>MI13848</sup></italic></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>UAS-GCaMP6f (attP40)</italic></td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) PMID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23868258">23868258</ext-link></td><td>BDSC:42747</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>UAS-GCaMP6f (VK00005)</italic></td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) PMID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23868258">23868258</ext-link></td><td>BDSC:52869</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>lexAop-GCaMP6f</italic></td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnstedt et al., 2016</xref>) PMID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26948892">26948892</ext-link></td><td/><td>Gift from S.

Two imaging systems were used, #1 for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> except <bold>5C</bold>, and #2 for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, which differed in the following components: laser (1: Mai Tai eHP DS, 70 fs pulses; 2: Mai Tai HP DS, 100 fs pulses; both from Spectra-Physics); microscope (1: Movable Objective Microscope; 2: DF-Scope installed on an Olympus BX51WI microscope; both from Sutter); amplifier for PMT currents (1: Thorlabs TIA-60; 2: Hamamatsu HC-130-INV); software (1: ScanImage 5; 2: MScan 2.3.01). Volume imaging on System 1 was performed using a piezo objective stage (nPFocus400, nPoint). Muscarine was applied locally by pressure ejection from borosilicate patch pipettes (resistance ~10 MOhm; capillary inner diameter 0.86 mm, outer diameter 1.5 mm; concentration in pipette 20 mM; pressure 12.5 psi) using a Picospritzer III (Parker). A red dye was added to the pipette to visualize the ejected fluid (SeTau-647, SETA BioMedicals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Podgorski et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Movies were motion-corrected in X-Y using the moco ImageJ plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dubbs et al., 2016</xref>), with pre-processing to collapse volume movies in Z and to smooth the image with a Gaussian filter (standard deviation = 4 pixels; the displacements generated from the smoothed movie were then applied to the original, unsmoothed movie), and motion-corrected in Z by maximizing the pixel-by-pixel correlation between each volume and the average volume across time points. ∆F/F, activity maps, sparseness and inter-odor correlation were calculated as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al. (2014)</xref>. Briefly, movies were smoothed with a 5-pixel-square Gaussian filter (standard deviation 2). Baseline fluorescence was taken as the average fluorescence during the pre-stimulus period. Frames with sudden, large axial movements were discarded by correlating each frame to the baseline image and discarding it if the correlation fell below a threshold value, which was manually selected for each brain by noting the constant high correlation value when the brain was stationary and sudden drops in correlation when the brain moved. ∆F/F was calculated for each pixel as the difference between mean fluorescence during the stimulus period vs. the baseline fluorescence (∆F), divided by the baseline fluorescence. For pixels where ∆F did not exceed two times the standard deviation over time of that pixel’s intensity during the pre-stimulus period, the pixel was considered non-responsive. We excluded non-responsive flies and flies whose motion could not be corrected.</p><p>Inter-odor correlations were calculated by first aligning the activity maps of each odor response by maximizing the inter-odor correlations of baseline fluorescence, and then converting image matrices of the activity maps of each odor response into linear vectors and calculating the Pearson correlation coefficients between each ‘odor vector’. A threshold for baseline fluorescence was applied as a mask to the activity map to exclude pixels with no baseline GCaMP6f signal. Population sparseness was calculated for activity maps using the following equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vinje and Gallant, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Willmore and Tolhurst, 2001</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Structural imaging</title><p>Brain dissections, fixation, and immunostaining were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pitman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu and Luo, 2006</xref>). To visualize native GFP fluorescence, dissected brains were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS (1.86 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 8.41 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 175 mM NaCl) and fixed for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were washed for 3 × 20 min in PBS containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton-X-100 (PBT). The neuropil was counterstained with nc82 (DSHB) or monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (F3165, Sigma) and goat anti-mouse Alexa 647 or Alexa 546. Primary antisera were applied for 1–2 days and secondary antisera for 1–2 days in PBT at 4˚C, followed by embedding in Vectashield.

interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Inhibitory muscarinic acetylcholine receptors enhance aversive olfactory conditioning in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Mani Ramaswami as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, we do feel the work could be made acceptable but only after the essential changes noted below are handled experimentally.</p><p>All the reviewers note the interest in the core observation that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mAChR mediates inhibition in the mushroom body as well that it is required in Kenyon cells for aversive associative memory. However, the mechanism by which it functions, in terms of the receptor's localisation at Kenyon cell presynaptic terminals and role in mediating signalling required for learning-associated depression of γ Kenyon cell – MBON synapses is not sufficiently well established. In addition to responding constructively to the various specific comments listed in the appended reviews, the reviewers felt that would be crucially important to: (a) demonstrate (potentially using lines expressing genomically-tagged mAChRs) the physical presence of mAChR in γ Kenyon cell presynapses; and (b) reanalyse data for the crucial Figure 7D in a way shows changes to MCH/OCT and IAA induced responses separately, in order to clarify that there is no depression to either the shock paired or shock unpaired odorant. (The current Figure 7D could potentially be explained if there were depression observed in both cases).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Bielopolsky and coauthors analyse the expression muscarinic AcRs in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body as well as in their function in the physiology and plasticity of Kenyon cells that involved in encoding associative memory. This is interesting as the role of metabotropic ACh signalling has not been previously analysed at this level of resolution, in neurons and synapses that encode memory. The major conclusion of the paper is that mAchR is required in γ Kenyon cells to mediate synaptic depression that underlies reduced response to odor that has been associated with an aversive stimulus. This conclusion is well justified, based on several well-done experiments that point to the cell-autonomous function of mAChRs in Kenyon cells, their physiological role in reducing odor-evoked response, and their function both for physiological depression and associative memory formation. It is also broadly interesting mAChR function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> may prove to be anagolous to the role of mGluR in mammalian synapses. The paper is well written and clear.</p><p>Other, less clearly resolved but interesting aspects of the paper involve fundamental aspects of mAChR physiology in the calyx and in different classes of Kenyon cell axons, as revealed by RNAi based knockdown experiments and direct muscarine application. Muscarine application increases basal calcium-levels in calyx, but reduces odor evoked responses in axons may be explained as the authors proposed, but there could be alternative explanations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 7 shows normal levels of memory – which superficially contradicts Figure 2. Better and more clear labelling should be used to show that this is only true when there are much higher levels of aversive stimulation. This is also confusing because the imaging experiments shown in subsequent panels of the same figure use &quot;normal&quot; and lower levels of aversive stimulation.</p><p>2) The observations Figure 6 (subsection “KC odor responses are decreased by an mAChR agonist”) seem to be overinterpreted. I think the data are fine to include, but the differences in OCT responses vs. MCH responses in the different classes of Kenyon cell axons etc. are not particularly compelling and may simply be at the level of experimental and biological noise. I suggest focusing on the main, robust and interpretable thread of these observations, and to present the other data observations that will take follow up work to understand completely.</p><p>3) I also found the robust effect of mAChR in α′β′ cells to be confusing, given its apparent weak expression in this class of Kenyon cell. Can this be explained – perhaps the expression is not perfectly revealed by the MiMIC conversion line?</p><p>4) In subsection “mAChR-A is required for olfactory learning in γ KCs, not αβ or α′β′ KCs”, &quot;γ neurons project to the horizontal lobes only, while the axons of αβ and α′β′ neurons bifurcate to form the α an α′ portions of the vertical lobes and the β and β′ portions of the horizontal lobes&quot; is a bit confusing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the authors knock down a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR-A) first, in all Kenyon cells (KCs) and then in subsets, while reading out flies' ability to form odor-shock associations as well as neuronal calcium responses. They conclude that mAChR-As mediate a spatially localized inhibition of odor responses in the dendritic as well as the axonal compartments of Kenyon cells and that this inhibition is needed in γ Kenyon cells, specifically in the horizontal lobe for learning.</p><p>A major failing is the use of imprecise RNAi based methods to knockdown mAChR-A, the efficacy of which in blocking behavior depends on the drivers used (see essential revisions 1). Another issue is the way the Calcium imaging data was analyzed. The authors use imprecise analyses and then report a negative result (see essential revisions 1 and 2).</p><p>I feel the manuscript has convincingly shown that mAChRs mediate cholinergic inhibition and that this may affect learning in some way. This is an interesting, initial result. The additional claims about how it affects learning and that it is necessary in γ KCs lobes are not justified by the data and analyses. Significant re-analysis and possibly some new experiments might be needed in order to draw any mechanistic conclusions. How does the mAChR-A mediated inhibition influence plasticity? This question has not been answered here.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) γ KC specificity claim is not justified:</p><p>The RNAi knock downs depended on the driver lines used (subsection “mAChR-A is required for olfactory learning in γ KCs, not αβ or α′β′ KCs”). The authors use different RNAi driver in the behavior (Figure 2) and imaging experiments (Figure 3). In fact, the significant reduction in response for OCT not seen in Figure 3, appears in Figure 4E, reinforcing the notion that the differences being detected here fluctuate depending on the strength of the manipulation and might not reflect real physiological differences.</p><p>The signal to noise of the Ca response trace would depend on the size of the ROI being averaged. More careful analysis and/or experiments would be needed to conclude that γ KCs have larger increases in response sizes than other cell types. The authors should either image and analyze single KC somata or at least, draw ROIs that average a fixed number of pixels from a single plane in the volume (averaging in z should also be controlled for).</p><p>2) Claims of lobe specific effects of localized muscarine application are not justified:</p><p>In Figure 6, the authors claim to measure Ca-responses to either muscarine alone or muscarine plus odor in the various lobes and compare the effect of local muscarine application. When muscarine was applied in the horizontal lobes (Figures 6C,D), the spread of muscarine into the various lobes could be non-uniform. The regions of interest over which ∆F/F values were calculated (as drawn in Figure 6A) would probably include different ratios of muscarine-applied and muscarine un-applied neuropil. Ca-fluorescence should only be extracted from regions of the lobes over-lapping with muscarine (red dye) spread. This should be straightforward to re-analyze. The lack of a clear and significant difference in most if not all the lobes in Figure 6G might also be a result of this effect.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Bielopolsky et al. report learning experiments in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. They use an RNAi approach to knockdown a metabotropic acetylcholine receptor in the mushroom body, and this affects aversive associative olfactory learning. Downregulation of this receptor in γ-type Kenyon cells, but not other Kenyon cell types, is sufficient to impair learning. Odor-evoked calcium activity increases mainly in the Kenyon cell input region of the mushroom body (calyx), but also to some degree in axonal regions and not for both odorants used. Application of the receptor agonist muscarine also slightly decreased odor-evoked calcium activity in Kenyon cells when applied to the axons and slightly increased baseline calcium. However, application of muscarine to the calyx increased baseline calcium more pronounced and decreased odor-evoked calcium influx. Local injections of muscarine into lobes cause a slight decrease of calcium in γ lobes which leads them to conclude that mAChR-A might be present in axons and contribute to learning-induced synaptic plasticity. The data I do not find convincing because the restriction of the injected drug is only confirmed by dye application. Injection of the drug into the calyx causes effects in the α lobe. It might be possible that injection into the in γ lobe also affects calycal input. The argument that increasing the strength of the US compensates for the learning deficit induced by the RNAi construct I do not find convincing because one could conclude that a modified CS (changed through the RNAi expression) requires a stronger US to be learned. Also, the conclusion that &quot;odor coding&quot; is not affected by the mAchR-A knockdown I find difficult given that odor-evoked calcium is significantly increased. The plasticity observed in the MB-MVP2 neuron 3 hours after training and the absence of this plasticity when the receptor is downregulated is a very indirect hint that the receptor might be present on axons. Overall, the finding that a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor is required in γ-type Kenyon cells for learning but not odor avoidance is very nice, and I would like to congratulate the authors for that interesting result. The conclusion that this receptor is also localized to axons and has a role in presynaptic plasticity is not convincing. Localization studies of the receptor would be required.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Inhibitory muscarinic acetylcholine receptors enhance aversive olfactory learning in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor), Mani Ramaswami as Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been greatly improved by careful and constructive revisions but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance.</p><p>We would like you to please consider the comments below (reproduced verbatim) and respond appropriately with revisions if you agree, or with a brief rebuttal if you do not, and to submit a final revised manuscript that will then be acceptable for publication.</p><p>1) The authors emphasize differential effects on subsets of KCs when the data do not justify these claims. The claim of differential effects on KC subtypes may detract from the clear communication of the central observations.</p><p>a) The authors claim in Figure 2 with the driver MB247 Gal4 that only γ KC based learning involves AChR-A, by receptor knockdown. The behavioral readout here is aversive, differential odor conditioning with a specific CS-US pairing protocol. Had the authors used appetitive reinforcement or spaced training protocols with more repeats, they might have seen behavioral effects with other KC subtypes as well. Furthermore, they use a different driver, OK107 Gal4 for knockdown in Figure 3 to claim that odor responses are significantly increased by receptor knockdown only in γ KCs. The use of different drivers to draw a parallel between behavior and neuronal activity is not strictly correct.</p><p>b) The main claim made in Figure 6 is that muscarine application in the calyx differentially affects KC subtypes. This claim is based on the observation that muscarine application in the calyx depressed odor responses in all lobes except the α lobe. It is hard to explain how a manipulation in the calyx differentially affects only the α lobe axonal branch of α/β KCs. The odor-response traces for this same α lobe in Figure 6D rise when muscarine is applied, before odor delivery. It is unclear if the experiment is clean enough to support the claim being made. Note also that the γ KCs, which are described as the main targets of the effect of mAChR-A in Figure 2 and Figure 3 behave similarly to other KC subtypes in this figure.</p><p>c) Figure 8 shows that mAChR-A knockdown prevents learning-related plasticity in a γ KC compartment. This does not show that other KCs and KC compartments are not similarly affected by mAChR-A.</p><p>d) I would instead argue that Figure 5 indicates that odor responses in all KC subtypes are affected by mAChRs in a similar, important, surprising manner; consistent with the behavior and MBON imaging observations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48264.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to responding constructively to the various specific comments listed in the appended reviews, the reviewers felt that would be crucially important to: (a) demonstrate (potentially using lines expressing genomically-tagged mAChRs) the physical presence of mAChR in γ Kenyon cell presynapses;</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to use CRISPR to generate an mAChR-A-FRT-stop-FRT-V5 allele that would allow endogenous mAChR-A to be conditionally tagged with V5 in cells expressing FLP.

This</p><p>suggests that mAChR-A is localized to KC dendrites. This overexpressed construct can also rescue learning in a mAChR-A hypomorph background, showing that dendritically localized mAChR-A functions in learning (i.e., the dendritic FLAG signal isn’t an artifact like misfolded mAChR-A stuck in the ER). See subsection “mAChR-A localized to the MB calyx can rescue learning in a mAChR-A hypomorphic mutant” and new Figure 7.

Actually, we used the same RNAi lines and GAL4 drivers in both behavior and imaging. In particular, we used both RNAi 1 and RNAi 2 for behavior (RNAi 1 in Figure 1, Figure 2; RNAi 2 in Figure 1) and for imaging (RNAi 1 in Figure 4; RNAi 2 in Figure 3). We used the same GAL4 drivers for both behavior and imaging: OK107 to label all KCs (Figure 1 behavior; Figure 3 imaging), and mb247-GAL4, R44E04-LexA&gt;lexAop-GAL80 (Figure 2 behavior, Figure 4 imaging). It’s true that in Figure 2 we also tested some other drivers on behavior, but as they either caused no behavior defect or were less specific than the γ-specific driver, there was no need to test them on imaging. We apologize for our text being unclear, and we have added the following text to stress this point: “(this driver and RNAi combination was also used for behavior in Figure 1C)” (subsection “mAChR-A suppresses odor responses in γ KCs”) and “the same driver and RNAi combination used in the behavioral experiments in Figure 2B” (subsection “mAChR-A suppresses odor responses in γ KCs”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In fact, the significant reduction in response for OCT not seen in Figure 3, appears in Figure 4E, reinforcing the notion that the differences being detected here fluctuate depending on the strength of the manipulation and might not reflect real physiological differences.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we don’t understand this comment.

However, the SNR was high enough that these differences do not affect the statistical power of our comparisons. We measured the SNR as the reciprocal of the coefficient of variation (CoV, or standard deviation divided by mean) of GCaMP signal over time during the pre-stimulus period (2 s before the odor). Because ∆F/F = (F-F0)/F0 = F/F0 – 1 (so F/F0 = ∆F/F + 1), and F0 = mean signal during the pre-stimulus period, the CoV of fluorescence during the pre-stimulus interval equals the standard deviation of ∆F/F during the pre-stimulus interval.</p><p>The CoV was in general very low (0.02 – 0.05, corresponding to a SNR of 20 – 50). Differences in SNR in this range would not substantially affect the chances of detecting an effect size as large as what we observed in the γ lobe (effect size, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 1.3 for OCT, 1.8 for MCH). We simulated 2 groups of 20 random samples (n=20 was the smallest sample size out of the αβ and α′β′ lobes) where the effect size of the difference between the 2 groups was 1.3. Each sample had a ‘ground truth’ value, from which we sampled 3 ‘time points’ that were subject to noise with SNR from 1–50 (we sampled 3 time points because the peak of the odor response almost always occurred between 1–2 s after odor onset, and our frame rate was ~3 Hz). The maximum of these 3 time points was taken as the measured ‘peak odor response’. We ran 1000 simulations, ran t-tests on the simulated data, and counted how many gave a p-value &lt; 0.0125 (a Holm-Bonferroni correction for the 4 mushroom body regions that did not consistently show significant differences between control and mAChR-A-RNAi flies) – this fraction is the statistical power for detecting a difference in the non-γ lobes with effect size 1.3. The power was constant at ~0.91 for SNR above 12, whereas our SNRs were in the range 20–50. Thus, in our data, the SNR was high enough that differences in SNR between lobes would not affect the statistical power to detect an effect as large as what we observed in the γ lobe. This analysis now appears in new Figure 3—figure supplement1, referred to in subsection “mAChR-A suppresses odor responses in γ KCs”.</p><p>Still, to accommodate the reviewer’s concern, we have changed the framing of the relevant paragraph to “we next asked how odor responses in αβ, α′β′ and γ KCs are affected by mAChR-A knockdown”, and the concluding sentence to “However, we do not rule out the possibility that mAChR-A knockdown also affects αβ and α′β′ odor responses in a way that does not affect short-term memory, especially as αβ and α′β′ odor responses were somewhat, though non-significantly, increased.” See subsection “mAChR-A suppresses odor responses in γ KCs”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Claims of lobe specific effects of localized muscarine application are not justified:</p><p>In Figure 6, the authors claim to measure Ca-responses to either muscarine alone or muscarine plus odor in the various lobes and compare the effect of local muscarine application.

It is unclear if the experiment is clean enough to support the claim being made.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the sentence: “Although muscarine did not significantly affect peak ∆F/F during the odor in the α lobe, muscarine most likely did decrease α lobe odor responses, by the same logic as for calyx odor responses (see above).” See subsection “KC odor responses are decreased by an mAChR agonist”.</p><p>We also note that the β lobe also shows a small bump in response to muscarine alone in Figure 6B, so at least the α and β branches show qualitatively similar responses (although we agree that it’s puzzling why the α lobe shows a more sustained increase in GcaMP6f signal compared to the β lobe). We added the phrase “with small increases in the β and γ lobe that were not statistically significant” (subsection “KC odor responses are decreased by an mAChR agonist”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Note also that the γ KCs, which are described as the main targets of the effect of mAChR-A in Figure 2 and Figure 3 behave similarly to other KC subtypes in this figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we feel that we already address this point by discussing the different results for mAChR-A RNAi knockdown vs. muscarine application in the Discussion section, starting with “while mAChR-A knockdown mainly affects γ KCs, with other subtypes inconsistently affected, muscarine reduces responses in all KC subtypes.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Figure 8 shows that mAChR-A knockdown prevents learning-related plasticity in a γ KC compartment. This does not show that other KCs and KC compartments are not similarly affected by mAChR-A.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and added two sentences to the Discussion section: “Our finding that mAChR-A is required in γ KCs for aversive short-term memory is consistent with our finding that mAChR-A knockdown in KCs disrupts training-induced depression of odor responses in MB-MVP2, an MBON postsynaptic to γ KCs required for aversive short-term memory (Perisse et al., 2016). However, the latter finding does not rule out the possibility that other MBONs postsynaptic to non-γ KCs may also be affected by mAChR-A knockdown in KCs.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) I would instead argue that Figure 5 indicates that odor responses in all KC subtypes are affected by mAChRs in a similar, important, surprising manner; consistent with the behavior and MBON imaging observations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and think that this point is conveyed by the above changes together with existing discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
