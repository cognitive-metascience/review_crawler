A second wave of beneficial <italic>gltA</italic> mutations then evolved that reduced CS activity to below the ancestral level.

They generally adapt to these challenges through genetic mutations that modify features they already have. However, occasionally a species may acquire an entirely new characteristic – known as an evolutionary innovation – that allows it to colonize a new environment or adopt a new mode of life.</p><p>The Lenski Experiment, which began in 1988, is an ongoing study of the evolution of bacteria grown in the laboratory. The experiment started with twelve identical populations of bacteria and has so far tracked the genetic mutations that have been acquired by the populations over tens of thousands of generations. Fifteen years into the experiment, bacteria in one of the populations evolved the ability to exploit a new food source, a molecule called citrate. The bacteria in this population have multiple mutations in a gene called <italic>gltA,</italic> which encodes an enzyme called citrate synthase. However, it was not clear how these mutations contributed to the ability of the bacteria in this population to use citrate.</p><p>Here, Quandt et al. have used a variety of genetic and biochemical techniques to examine the mutations in <italic>gltA</italic>. They found that one mutation occurred before the bacteria evolved the ability to use citrate, and others occurred afterward. The first mutation in <italic>gltA</italic> increased the activity of the citrate synthase enzyme, which paved the way for a key mutation affecting citrate transport into cells that allowed the bacteria to consume the new food source. However, once the bacteria evolved the ability to use citrate, and more mutations in other genes refined this process, the increased citrate synthase activity became detrimental. At this point, the bacteria acquired a second <italic>gltA</italic> mutation that lowered citrate synthase activity to a level below what it had been in the original bacteria before the first <italic>gltA</italic> mutation.</p><p>The Lenski Experiment presents a rare opportunity to examine the complete history of an evolutionary innovation. Quandt et al. findings show that evolutionary 'reversals' may be necessary to adjust cell processes in different ways as an innovation first evolves and is further refined. A challenge for future work is to identify the other mutations that, together with the first <italic>gltA</italic> mutation, were necessary for the bacteria to evolve the ability to use citrate.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09696.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09696.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>evolutionary innovation</kwd><kwd>epistasis</kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>flux balance analysis</kwd><kwd>metabolic network</kwd><kwd>genetic basis of adaptation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI-0939454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blount</surname><given-names>Zachary D</given-names></name><name><surname>Barrick</surname><given-names>Jeffrey E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000183</institution-id><institution>Army Research Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W911NF-12-1-0390</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barrick</surname><given-names>Jeffrey E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellington</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name><name><surname>Georgiou</surname><given-names>George</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00-GM087550</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barrick</surname><given-names>Jeffrey E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000925</institution-id><institution>John Templeton Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RFP 12-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blount</surname><given-names>Zachary D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000774</institution-id><institution>Defense Threat Reduction Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellington</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name><name><surname>Georgiou</surname><given-names>George</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A long-term evolution experiment with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> shows that the appearance and optimization of a new trait can require both co-opting existing cellular pathways for new roles and reversing a history of previous adaptation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Evolutionary descent with modification has produced organisms with complex metabolic and gene regulatory networks. When a microbial population encounters a new environment, mutants encoding more effective variants of these networks that improve nutrient utilization or reveal latent metabolic capabilities may evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ryall et al., 2012</xref>). While there are many degrees of freedom that evolution can potentially access in altering cellular networks, only those mutational pathways that do not include deleterious intermediate steps are likely to be realized in most populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bridgham et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weinreich et al., 2006</xref>). Laboratory studies have characterized mutational pathways that enable microorganisms to access new enzyme activities when there is strong selection for a new trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Näsvall et al., 2012</xref>). Combinations of metabolic and regulatory mutations that enable microorganisms to evolve toward optimal growth rates under defined conditions have also been exhaustively mapped at a whole-genome level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conrad et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tenaillon et al., 2012</xref>). To this point, however, we have rarely had the opportunity to observe the interplay of these two regimes of optimization and innovation as they must occur over longer evolutionary timescales in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrick and Lenski, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The Lenski long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) with <italic>E. coli</italic> provides a unique opportunity to study how metabolic and regulatory networks have changed over a history spanning more than 25 years of microbial adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lenski and Travisano, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lenski et al., 1991</xref>). In particular, cells in one of the twelve LTEE populations evolved a qualitatively new metabolic capability—aerobic citrate utilization (Cit<sup>+</sup> phenotype)—that enabled them to colonize a previously unoccupied ecological niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blount et al., 2008</xref>). This Cit<sup>+</sup> innovation is highly beneficial because it grants access to an abundant and previously untapped nutrient. Yet, it is also very rare. So far, a Cit<sup>+</sup> variant has evolved in just one of the twelve LTEE populations, and then only after ∼15 years of evolution. The rarity of the Cit<sup>+</sup> innovation suggests that accessing this new metabolic trait is contingent on a multi-step mutational pathway.</p><p>The evolution of aerobic citrate utilization in the LTEE involved three stages: potentiation, actualization, and refinement. Actualization refers to the first appearance of phenotypically Cit<sup>+</sup> cells. This transition was caused by a duplication that activated expression of the <italic>citT</italic> citrate:succinate antiporter gene through promoter capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blount et al., 2012</xref>). However, on its own this mutation confers only extremely weak citrate utilization. Subsequently, this rudimentary Cit<sup>+</sup> trait was refined to a stronger phenotype, Cit<sup>++</sup> , when cells that were capable of fully exploiting citrate during each 24 hr growth cycle evolved, coincident with a large increase in cell density in this LTEE population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blount et al., 2008</xref>). Chief among the refining mutations was a promoter mutation that activated expression of the <italic>dctA</italic> C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylate:H<sup>+</sup> symporter gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Quandt et al., 2014</xref>). Strains reconstructed with just the <italic>citT</italic> duplication and this <italic>dctA</italic>* mutation are capable of fully utilizing citrate (i.e., they are Cit<sup>++</sup>) . However, this simple two-step mutational pathway was apparently inaccessible without the prior evolution of one or more unknown mutations that created a potentiated genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blount et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>A whole-genome phylogeny of this LTEE population has provided candidates for other mutations that contributed to the potentiation and refinement steps of Cit<sup>++</sup> evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blount et al., 2012</xref>). We show here that one target of interest is the <italic>gltA</italic> gene, which encodes the enzyme citrate synthase (CS). CS catalyzes the first irreversible step in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle: the aldol condensation of oxaloacetate (OAA) and acetyl-CoA to form citrate. Multiple mutations in one gene are rare in LTEE lineages that have retained the low ancestral mutation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wielgoss et al., 2011</xref>), yet the <italic>gltA</italic> gene was mutated twice in most Cit<sup>++</sup> isolates, once before and once after Cit<sup>+</sup> evolved. Due to the conspicuous metabolic function of CS and the appearance of the later <italic>gltA</italic> mutations specifically in Cit<sup>+</sup> isolates, it was previously hypothesized that these mutations refined the Cit<sup>+</sup> phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blount et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we characterized the effects of <italic>gltA</italic> mutations on competitive fitness, mRNA expression levels, and enzyme activity. Integrating this information with molecular dynamics simulations and genome-scale models of metabolism provided further insight into the molecular effects of these mutations and how they impacted cellular networks. We conclude that mutations affecting CS activity, and more broadly flux through the TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt, were instrumental for potentiating the evolution of Cit<sup>+</sup> , and then for refining the Cit<sup>++</sup> phenotype. Our results underscore two principles of the evolution of complex systems that operate on long timescales. First, certain mutational paths that are immediately adaptive because they improve fitness in the current niche may be fortuitously co-opted to make future innovative leaps to new traits possible. Second, evolutionary innovations will often have disruptive effects on cellular networks, inverting epistatic relationships and prompting new waves of adaptation that may even reverse the effects of mutations that were necessary for accessing an innovation in the first place.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Citrate synthase mutations occur before and after citrate utilization evolves</title><p>In a previous study, genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of clones isolated from the Ara–3 LTEE population revealed multiple mutations in the gene for citrate synthase (<italic>gltA</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blount et al., 2012</xref>).

Two of the three <italic>gltA2</italic> mutations found in the sequenced clones and six other <italic>gltA2</italic> mutations were present in ≥5% of the population at some point. All of these additional <italic>gltA2</italic> alleles are also nonsynonymous mutations, except for one that is a single-base substitution 14 base pairs upstream of the <italic>gltA</italic> start codon. The first <italic>gltA2</italic> mutation (<italic>gltA2-1)</italic> was detected at 33,000 generations. This mutation was apparently completely displaced within ∼1000 generations by competition with various other genetically diverged subpopulations, some of which had other <italic>gltA2</italic> alleles. This period of coexistence lasted ∼5000 generations with the <italic>gltA2-3</italic> and <italic>gltA2-5</italic> alleles each dominating for a time. By 38,000 generations, the <italic>gltA2-4</italic> mutation had swept to fixation within the population, and no new <italic>gltA</italic> mutations were observed after 40,000 generations.</p><p>In a separate experiment, an early Cit<sup>+</sup> 33,000-generation LTEE clone with the <italic>gltA1</italic> mutation, but no <italic>gltA2</italic> mutation, was genetically backcrossed with the LTEE ancestor strain using recursive genome-wide recombination and sequencing (REGRES) to determine which evolved alleles were necessary for the Cit<sup>+</sup> phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Quandt et al., 2014</xref>). This procedure involved several rounds of selecting for colony growth on agar containing citrate as the only carbon source. We found a de novo point mutation 182 base pairs upstream of the <italic>gltA</italic> start codon (<italic>gltA2-R</italic> allele) in every one of the sequenced REGRES clones that retained the <italic>gltA1</italic> mutation present in the initial Cit<sup>++</sup> clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Quandt et al., 2014</xref>).

However, the <italic>gltA1</italic> (A258T) mutation greatly diminished NADH binding, resulting in an inability to saturate the enzyme within the range of detection in the binding assay, which extends up to ∼10 μM NADH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dickinson, 1970</xref>). Likewise, the <italic>gltA1</italic> mutant displayed a <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> for NADH that was higher by a factor of ∼30 relative to wild-type enzyme.

After energy minimization, we observed subtle differences in the predicted conformation of each enzyme variant, most notably around the NADH binding site. The most pronounced changes were in the orientation of histidine-110 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), even though this amino acid is distant from every <italic>gltA</italic> mutation. In the wild-type GltA structure, histidine-110 adopts an upward conformation that allows for accommodation of NADH in the binding pocket. The A258T <italic>gltA1</italic> mutation is predicted to reorient the histidine-110 side chain toward the binding pocket, presumably creating an unfavorable steric barrier to NADH binding. Addition of secondary <italic>gltA2</italic> mutations (A162V or A124T) resulted in simulated structures with histidine-110 oriented between these two extremes.

This observation agrees with the known importance of citrate synthase in the biosynthesis of glutamate in glucose minimal media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis and Gilvarg, 1956</xref>). However, when citrate is the sole carbon source, FBA predicts optimal growth when there is no flux through CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In fact, any CS activity is detrimental because sufficient flux to synthesize glutamate (and other compounds) from TCA cycle intermediates is already available. Under these conditions, oxaloacetate (OAA) is diverted into gluconeogenesis for the production of essential glycolytic intermediates and sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sauer and Eikmanns, 2005</xref>). This shift in metabolism leads to FBA predicting an increase in flux through the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase (<italic>pck</italic>) and malic enzyme (<italic>maeA/maeB</italic>) reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Eliminating CS flux also preserves its other CS substrate, acetyl-CoA, so that it can be used for other biosynthetic processes, rather than to produce unneeded TCA intermediates. Cit<sup>++</sup> cells must balance using both glucose and citrate, so the optimal level of CS activity in these cells is predicted to be low but not zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), consistent with the effects of the <italic>gltA2</italic> mutations we studied.</p><p>Since acetate is initially excreted during glucose growth and then subsequently utilized after glucose is depleted, it can represent a distinct resource niche in the LTEE, as described above. FBA indicates that optimal growth on acetate occurs when the flux through citrate synthase is approximately 30% higher than the level that is optimal for growth on glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This increase is expected because CS is needed for the glyoxylate cycle, the major pathway for acetate assimilation in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kornberg, 1966</xref>). Thus, FBA predicts that the <italic>gltA1</italic> mutation that increased CS flux improved the component of competitive fitness in the LTEE related to acetate utilization. Flux through the bypass portion of the glyoxylate pathway, comprised of the isocitrate lyase (<italic>aceA</italic>) and malate synthase (<italic>aceB</italic>) reactions, is needed for optimal growth on acetate but not for growth on glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This FBA prediction supports our hypothesis that the LTEE mutations in <italic>iclR</italic> and <italic>arcB</italic>, which we showed improve growth on acetate-enriched media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), do so because they derepress transcription of <italic>aceA</italic> and <italic>aceB</italic>.</p><p>The FBA predictions motivated us to look for other mutations in central metabolism that may have contributed to refining the Cit<sup>++</sup> phenotype. Loss of isocitrate lyase (<italic>aceA</italic>) activity is predicted to be beneficial for growth on citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) because it eliminates unnecessary input of acetyl-CoA into the TCA cycle via the glyoxylate shunt. We found that a nonsense mutation in <italic>aceA</italic> was present in ∼15% of the LTEE population in the 33,500-generation sample and ∼97% in the next 34,000-generation sample. Thus, nearly all Cit<sup>++</sup> cells had either the <italic>aceA, gltA2-1</italic>, or <italic>gltA2-9</italic> allele at 33,500 generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). By 34,000 generations the <italic>aceA</italic> mutation had nearly swept to fixation within the Cit<sup>++</sup> clade and all subsequent <italic>gltA2</italic> alleles occurred in that genetic background. An <italic>aceA</italic> mutation may be especially necessary to adjust isocitrate lyase flux because, as discussed earlier, these strains already contain mutations in the <italic>iclR</italic> and <italic>arcB</italic> transcriptional regulators that appear to compromise the regulatory mechanisms that would normally repress <italic>aceA</italic> gene expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have established that mutations in the <italic>gltA</italic> gene encoding citrate synthase (CS) were critical for both potentiating the evolution of aerobic citrate utilization in the Lenski LTEE and for the subsequent refinement of this new metabolic capability.

We found evidence that the clade in which Cit<sup>+</sup> would eventually evolve had previously evolved a suite of mutations that improved the utilization of acetate.

Initially only glucose and acetate, a byproduct of glucose metabolism, are accessible to Cit<sup>–</sup> cells. The rudimentary Cit<sup>+</sup> trait enabled very limited utilization of some of the abundant citrate present in the growth medium. Once this ability was refined to the Cit<sup>++</sup> phenotype by further mutations, all of the citrate present was fully exploited. The areas of each box roughly reflect the relative amounts of each of the three carbon sources. (<bold>B</bold>) The initial <italic>gltA1</italic> mutation potentiated the evolution of Cit<sup>+</sup>. This mutation and additional mutations in <italic>iclR</italic> and <italic>arcB</italic> all improve acetate utilization in Cit<sup>–</sup> cells by increasing flux through the TCA and glyxolyate cycles. The order of accumulation of these mutations, interspersed with many other mutations during the LTEE, is represented by arrows on the left side of the figure. These mutations may potentiate the evolution of the weak Cit<sup>+</sup> phenotype because they create a potentiated version of central metabolism that is capable of replenishing succinate and/or other C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylates that must be exported in exchange for citrate import by the CitT antiporter. In accordance with this model, the addition of the CitT-activating mutation (<italic>citT</italic>) to an evolved genetic background that crucially contains the <italic>gltA1</italic> mutation results in a rudimentary Cit<sup>+</sup> phenotype that is neutral or slightly beneficial to fitness and thus represents a path accessible to evolution, denoted by an arrow to mark the transition as shown in left bar graph. In contrast, adding the <italic>citT</italic> mutation to the same genetic background but without the <italic>gltA1</italic> mutation is highly deleterious to fitness, rendering this path inaccessible to evolution within the LTEE population, as shown in right bar graph.

The <italic>gltA1</italic> mutation that increased citrate synthase activity was beneficial to fitness when it evolved prior to the Cit<sup>+</sup> innovation when only glucose and acetate could be utilized, as shown in the bar graph on the left. While necessary for the evolution of the rudimentary Cit<sup>+</sup> phenotype by <italic>citT</italic> activation, the effect of <italic>gltA1</italic> mutation is suboptimal for fitness once the <italic>dctA</italic>* mutation evolves and the citrate utilization niche can be fully exploited.

Rather than give rise to this type of stable ecological diversification, the much lower concentration of glucose (and therefore acetate) in the LTEE appears to have largely favored the success of generalists that incorporate mutations that improve growth on both substrates.

An allosterically deregulated citrate synthase enzyme, which continuously inputs increased carbon flux into the TCA cycle during growth on glucose/acetate, coupled with overall transcriptional derepression of the TCA and glyoxylate cycles, could replenish the intracellular supply of succinate and/or other C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylates that are excreted in exchange for citrate by the CitT antiporter. The unbalanced loss of these important biosynthetic precursors might explain the detrimental fitness effect of becoming Cit<sup>+</sup> via the <italic>citT</italic> mutation in cells lacking <italic>gltA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Thus, the <italic>gltA1</italic> mutation was necessary for potentiating the evolution of Cit<sup>+</sup> because it converted the <italic>citT</italic> duplication from a prohibitive step downward into a valley in the fitness landscape into a step in an upward mutational route.</p><p>After strong citrate utilization (Cit<sup>++</sup> phenotype) evolved in the LTEE due to the activation of the DctA transporter by the <italic>dctA</italic>* promoter mutation, multiple secondary <italic>gltA2</italic> alleles reached high frequencies in this population in separate lineages vying for dominance. These <italic>gltA2</italic> mutations were beneficial for growth on citrate as the primary carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), and they share a common overall effect: all are expected to decrease citrate synthase activity. When growing on citrate as a carbon source, the CS reaction is expected to be detrimental in that it consumes acetyl-CoA and diverts OAA that is needed for gluconeogenesis back into the TCA cycle, a futile-cycle under these conditions. While allosteric regulation of wild-type CS may have been able to adjust flux through this reaction to the very low levels that are optimal under these conditions, this was apparently not possible with the <italic>gltA1</italic> mutation already present. Therefore, <italic>gltA2</italic> mutations emerged that reverse the change in enzyme activity caused by <italic>gltA1</italic>, either by decreasing mRNA expression levels, by reducing the catalytic proficiency of this enzyme, and/or by restoring allosteric inhibition by NADH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>To a first approximation, this LTEE population can be thought of as having evolved through three metabolic epochs: first, glucose utilization was optimized, leading to greater acetate accumulation; second, acetate utilization was optimized in conjunction with further improvements in glucose growth; third, citrate utilization was discovered and optimized. As a whole, the LTEE populations have explored numerous variations on the complex metabolic and regulatory networks of <italic>E. coli</italic> as they have adapted. This diversity has allowed some lineages of cells to explore new nutrient niches, in particular citrate utilization. While rudimentary citrate utilization via activation of the <italic>citT</italic> gene could presumably have arisen at any time and in any of the LTEE populations, we have shown that it would have been at a selective disadvantage if it appeared in a non-potentiated genetic background. Moreover, if the structure of the metabolic and regulatory networks and their component genes yielded relatively few genetic pathways with which to improve growth on glucose, it is unlikely that the multi-step mutational pathway to Cit<sup>+</sup> that first required mutations that improve acetate utilization would ever have been realized. Therefore, complexity in both the resource environment and in the genetic architecture of the cell conspired to make this metabolic innovation possible.</p><p>More broadly, our results demonstrate that evolutionary innovations may rely not only on the acquisition of novel genes or the co-option of molecular machinery for entirely new purposes, but also on the inherent malleability of core cellular processes. The components of an organism's metabolic, regulatory, and developmental networks have evolved to interact in complex ways that are attuned to its current niche. Yet, these networks are also poised such that they can be dynamically reorganized toward new purposes by only a few mutations in key enzymes and regulatory proteins. As we observed for changes in citrate synthase activity at different stages in the emergence of citrate utilization during the Lenski LTEE, it may often be case that evolution must fine-tune essential links in these networks as it traverses epistatic turns and switchbacks on the tenuous mutational paths that lead to the successful colonization of new niches.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>All <italic>E. coli</italic> strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Viable cell counts in the inocula were roughly equivalent to the population bottleneck encountered during each daily transfer of the LTEE. Thus, regrowth maintained the representative genetic diversity of the population. Genomic DNA was isolated from several milliliters of each culture using Qiagen Genomic-tip 100/G columns. Standard DNA library preparation and sequencing on an Illumina Genome Analyzer instrument at the Michigan State University Research Technology Support Facility produced 36-bp single-end reads. These reads were mapped to the genome using the <italic>breseq</italic> computational pipeline (version 0.25) in polymorphism mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deatherage and Barrick, 2014</xref>). The frequencies in each sample of <italic>gltA</italic> mutations and other base changes characteristic of each clade were estimated by counting how many reads aligned to the position in question had the reference versus variant allele.

To create the pKO3 plasmids for allelic replacement, a 1-kb fragment including ∼500 bp of flanking sequence on each side of the desired allele was PCR amplified from cells encoding the desired allele: strain REL607 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeong et al., 2009</xref>) for <italic>gltA<sup>wt</sup></italic>; CZB154 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blount et al., 2012</xref>) for <italic>gltA1, iclR,</italic> and <italic>arcB</italic>; and strain R1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Quandt et al., 2014</xref>) for <italic>gltA2-R</italic>. This fragment was combined with PCR-amplified and DpnI-digested pKO3 vector backbone using the Gibson isothermal assembly method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>). pKO3 plasmids containing each allele of interest were integrated into the chromosomes of recipient strains by electroporation followed by selection for chloramphenicol resistant colonies on LB agar at 43°C. Excision of the pKO3 plasmid backbone was selected for by subsequent plating on LB agar lacking NaCl and supplemented with 6% d-sucrose followed by incubation at 30°C. Sucrose resistant clones were screened for successful allelic replacement by PCR amplification of genomic DNA and Sanger sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"> <title>Growth curves</title><p>Strains were revived from frozen stocks and grown in LB. Saturated overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 into saline followed by a 1:100 dilution into the medium used for the assay and grown overnight again.

First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed from purified total RNA (0.5 μg) using the Invitrogen M-MLV reverse transcription system with a gene-specific reverse primer for <italic>gltA</italic> or the <italic>ihfB</italic> reference gene. Total cDNA (1.25 ng) and primers were added to Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY).

Each model was then protonated (37°C, pH 7.4, 0.1 salt) using Protonate3D. As further preparation for QM/MM analyses, non-bridging solvent molecules were removed, a 6 Å solvent sphere was added, and charges were neutralized by the addition of KCl. Lastly, amino acid substitutions in a given GltA variant were added sequentially with energy minimization to an RMS gradient of 10<sup>-3</sup> kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup> using the Amber12 force field with Extended Hückel Theory and R-field solvation electrostatics after each mutation.

The model incorporates 2,750 reactions and 1954 metabolites. Default media conditions and reaction bounds were used. Carbon source uptake fluxes were set at 10 mmol per gram dry cell weight per hour unless otherwise stated. To simulate combined utilization of citrate and glucose, the uptake fluxes for each carbon source were adjusted to match the molar ratio at which they are present in DM25 (10:1). We used flux variability analysis to predict the full ranges of flux values for reactions in central metabolism that exist within the set of optimal global solutions. There was no variability in the optimal flux predicted for the citrate synthase reaction under any of the conditions we tested.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Richard Lenski, Dacia Leon, Christopher Marx, Noah Ribeck, Caroline Turner, and Johnny Blazeck for helpful discussions.

It was known that a mutation involving <italic>citT</italic> was important for initial citrate uptake and a second mutation in <italic>dctA</italic> was essential for full utilization of the resource. However, the rarity of the adaptation (occurring in only 1 of 12 populations) suggested that other potentiating mutations were involved. The authors argue that a mutation in citrate synthase (<italic>gltA</italic>) was a critical for enabling citrate consumption to evolve.

The authors demonstrate that <italic>gltA1</italic> can increase fitness on acetate, but that the mutation becomes deleterious once cells have acquired the ability to utilize citrate. A second set of mutations (termed <italic>gltA2</italic>) is able to compensate for the cost of <italic>gltA1</italic>. The authors show that <italic>gltA1</italic> increases activity of citrate synthase by removing allosteric inhibition by NADH, while subsequent mutations in the gene reduce activity of the protein through a variety of methods. Finally Quandt et al. use metabolic modeling to show that optimal growth on acetate involves increased flux through citrate synthase relative to glucose, and that optimal growth on citrate requires no flux through this pathway. Combining these bits of evidence the authors suggest that utilization of citrate involved a mutation in <italic>gltA</italic> that improved growth on acetate and potentiated the <italic>citT</italic> mutation, by increasing flux through TCA. Once cells became strong citrate utilizers, the initial <italic>gltA</italic> mutation became deleterious driving the evolution of a diversity of secondary mutations to compensate for its cost.

This shows that even in central metabolism that the path of evolution is not a straight forward walk but involves different paths in specific sequences. Extending this to primary metabolism will help to shift our current thinking on how &quot;conserved&quot; primary metabolism is. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, it was difficult to interpret the ancestry of the secondary gltA alleles. This figure would probably be served better if part A showed haplotypes rather than individual alleles and the haplotypes were used for the coloring in part B. It would also be helpful if these colors were maintained throughout the figures to allow the reader to follow the data.</italic> </p><p>Since there is no recombination in this <italic>E. coli</italic> evolution experiment (the bacteria are strictly asexual), haplotype and allele frequencies are equivalent. The &quot;Muller plot&quot; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> is a standard way of illustrating genetic dynamics in an asexual population, with sectors representing new mutations nested within previous ones to show linkage.</p><p>Since it may not be perfectly clear from the figure that all of the <italic>gltA1</italic> alleles arise separately (in independent lineages derived the ancestral genotype with the <italic>gltA</italic> allele, and not nested within one another), we have added a statement to clarify this point to the figure legend: &quot;Each of the <italic>gltA2</italic> alleles (shaded as in panel A) evolved independently and defines a separate evolved genotype and all of its descendants.&quot;</p><p>We think that keeping the colors of the <italic>gltA2</italic> alleles all as similar shades of blue/purple (rather than representing them with entirely distinct colors) is the most useful way of showing our the data. It emphasizes that all <italic>gltA2</italic> alleles seem to have similar affects on cellular metabolism (decreasing citrate synthase flux). So, one can rapidly assess the overall total frequency of cells with any <italic>gltA2</italic> allele in the LTEE population over time in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> by following all blue/purple sectors together as one visual category. Depicting the <italic>gltA2</italic> alleles all in a similar shade also makes it easier to illustrate interactions (in the remaining figures) between a generic <italic>gltA2</italic> allele and other key evolved alleles (<italic>gltA1, citT, dctA*, iclR</italic>, etc.) that we do represent using very distinct colors.</p><p>In any case, we always label the exact <italic>gltA2</italic> allele that is being studied and do currently maintain the same (subtle) color scheme for distinguishing among them in other figures.</p><p><italic>In all figures, evidence of statistical support for claims of difference needs to be provided. SE bars are not the equivalent of statistical support. 95% CI are more acceptable for this purpose.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this comment. We have altered the gene expression data to show 95% CI instead of SE bars since we rely on this figure to show statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The fitness measurements already use 95% confidence intervals throughout. All of the arguments that we make related to growth curve data are based on very large differences, for which there is really no question that they are statistically significant.</p><p>Reviewer #2:<italic>Quandt et al. investigate the mutational pathway that allowed the evolution of citrate consumption in one population of</italic> E. coli <italic>in the Lenski Long-Term Experiment.
