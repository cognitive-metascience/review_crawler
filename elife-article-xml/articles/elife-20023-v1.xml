Gas-chromatographic mass-spectral analyses of <italic>A. oligospora</italic>-derived volatile metabolites identified several odors mimicking food cues attractive to nematodes. One compound, methyl 3-methyl-2-butenoate (MMB) additionally triggered strong sex- and stage-specific attraction in several <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species. Furthermore, when MMB is present, it interferes with nematode mating, suggesting that MMB might mimic sex pheromone in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species. Forward genetic screening suggests that multiple receptors are involved in sensing MMB. Response to fungal odors involves the olfactory neuron AWCs. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed the GPCRs expressed in AWC.

To minimize the risk of being eaten, prey have often evolved specific behaviors and strategies such as camouflage, avoidance, mimicry, and tonic immobility to increase their chance of survival.Â In turn, predators also evolved enhanced predatory strategies to secure food sufficient to survive and reproduce, giving rise to an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dawkins and Krebs, 1979</xref>).</p><p>While most carnivores are animals, examples of predacious plants and fungi exist. Venus flytraps, sundews and pitcher plants acquire some or most of their nutrients from trapping and consuming insects, a feature that evolved in response to nitrogen limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Darwin, 1875</xref>). Many fungi that grow in nitrogen-poor environments have likewise evolved carnivorism and nematodes, being the most numerically abundant animals on earth, conveniently became the prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barron, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nordbring-Hertz, 1988</xref>). This predatory lifestyle has independently evolved multiple times among different fungal lineages including Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barron, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liou and Tzean, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). Nematode-trapping fungi depend on their elaborate traps to prey on nematodes. However, the majority of the nematode-trapping fungi do not constitutively generate these trapping structures; trap-morphogenesis is only triggered by the presence of nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pramer and Stoll, 1959</xref>). This suggests that trap-formation might be a highly energy-consuming process and that, to conserve energy, these fungi have evolved to sense signals from nematodes, which indicate the presence of prey. One such signal is the group of nematode pheromones, ascarosides.Â These pheromones regulate various aspects of behavior and development in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and are sufficient to induce trap-morphogenesis in several species of nematode-trapping fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsueh et al., 2013</xref>). Since the nematode-trapping fungi have clearly evolved the ability to eavesdrop on nematode communication, we wondered whether the nematodes also sense and respond to their fungal predators.</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> is known to respond to pathogenic bacteria. For example, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> triggers an aversive learning behavior, while another pathogen <italic>Bacillus nematocida</italic> attracts <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Niu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Bacterial secondary metabolites are able to modulate the signaling and the protective lawn-avoidance behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, demonstrating that the sensory neurons of <italic>C. elegans</italic> are critical for its defensive responses against pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pradel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). By contrast, little is known about how <italic>C. elegans</italic> responds to its natural predators such as the nematode-trapping fungi, with only an early study showing that the nematode <italic>Panagrellus redivivus</italic> was attracted to a species of nematode-trapping fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balan and Gerber, 1972</xref>). Many prey are known to begin fleeing when they sense a possible predator, while many predators are also known to attract their prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haynes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rosier, 2011</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the behavioral and molecular basis for how <italic>C. elegans</italic> responds to <italic>Arthrobotrys oligospora</italic>, one of the most common nematode-trapping fungal species and one that we had previously found to eavesdrop on ascarosides produced by <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsueh et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> and other nematodes are attracted to <italic>A. oligospora</italic> and the attraction observed for <italic>C. elegans</italic> is mediated by the two AWC olfactory neurons. We identified several odorants produced by <italic>A. oligospora</italic> and found that many of the odorants attracted <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and appear to represent olfactory mimics of the food and sex cues. Through genetic screens and single-cell transcriptome analyses of the AWC neuron, we identified the potential chemosensory receptors that were expressed in this neuron, which is involved in sensing some of these fungal odors. Our study shows that in order to catch its nematode prey, <italic>A. oligospora</italic> has evolved to lure the nematodes by producing olfactory mimicry of the food and sex cues that are attractive to <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nematode-trapping fungus <italic>A. oligospora</italic> attracts <italic>C. elegans</italic> and other nematodes</title><p>To study how <italic>C. elegans</italic> responds to one of its natural predators, the nematode-trapping fungus <italic>A.Â oligospora</italic>, we tested the chemotaxis behavior of <italic>C. elegans</italic> in the presence of the fungal culture.

We found that the adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> were consistently attracted to <italic>A. oligospora</italic>, suggesting that the fungus might lure the worms by producing compounds that are attractive to them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

To investigate why adult hermaphrodites were so attracted to this odor, we further examined the chemotaxis behavior in different developmental stages of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We found that attraction to MMB was both sex- and developmental stage-dependent, as L1 larvae, dauers, and the male animals did not exhibit strong attraction to this odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, when we tested MMB attraction in other <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species, we found that MMB was highly attractive to adult females but repulsive to males in the gonochoristic species such as <italic>C. remanei</italic>, <italic>C. nigoni</italic> (sp. 9), and <italic>C. afra</italic> (sp.7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Therefore, we monitored the mating behavior of <italic>C. afra</italic> in the presence or absence of MMB to examine whether MMB might interfere with mate seeking. We chose this species as we found that it has a highly robust and reproducible mating behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). When one female and two males were placed on a 3 cm NG plate without food, the nematodes mated within averageÂ ofÂ ~5 min.

The design of our genetic screen followed an approach similar to that used in the screen that identified the diacetyl receptor, <italic>odr-10</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sengupta et al., 1996</xref>). In brief, mutagenized animals were given a choice between MMB and IAA (another odor sensed by the AWC neurons). Under this condition, more than 95% of the wild-type N2 animals preferred MMB. We expected that mutants with specific defects in sensing MMB, but with otherwise intact AWC function, would exhibit an abnormal preference for IAA in our screen. After two rounds of behavioral screen enrichment, mutant lines were isolated for further analyses. In total, we isolated thirteen mutants with varying degrees of chemotactic deficiency to MMB. Two mutants (<italic>sy837</italic> and <italic>sy838</italic>) showed dramatic decreases in MMB attraction, whereas eleven other mutant lines only exhibited minor decreases. Diminished MMB attraction seemed to be specific, as attraction to other odorants such as IAA and BA remained at wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). SNP mapping with the Hawaiian strain revealed the mutations mapped to chromosome X for both strongly defective mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Complementation assays revealed that the two mutants failed to complement each other, suggesting that the phenotype was likely caused by a mutation in the same gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). By whole-genome sequencing of the two mutant lines (PS7117 and PS7118), we found that both lines had mutations in the <italic>odr-7</italic> gene, causing premature stop codons at codon 83 and codon 188 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). A genomic rescue line generated with the fosmid WRM0639bF05 that contains the <italic>odr-7</italic> geneÂ restored the chemotaxis defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

The fact that in <italic>A. oligospora</italic> trap morphogenesis is usually only triggered by the presence of nematodes makes it even more challenging. Since trap morphogenesis takes more than 12 hr, there is a long period during which nematodes could escape before the functional traps become fully developed. In this study, we have shown that <italic>A. oligospora</italic> may overcome this problem by luring nematodes to stay nearby, by producing several volatile compounds that mimic nematode food and sex cues.</p><p>In nature, <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes are most commonly associated with rotten fruits and plants where they feast on the bacterial blooms in these decomposing materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">FrÃ©zal and FÃ©lix, 2015</xref>). Several of the odors we identified from <italic>A. oligospora</italic>, including the sulfurous compounds DMDS, DTP and SMT, have pungently overripe or rotten smells, suggesting that these odors might be sensed as food cues by nematodes and, as a result, are attractive to <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Such olfactory mimicry is also employed by various plants to attract pollinators. For example, the dead horse arum (<italic>Helicodiceros muscivorus</italic>) and the infamous corpse flower (<italic>Amorphophallus titanium</italic>) are known to produce rotten smells to attract insects; in both cases, one of the odors identified was DMDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lim, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shirasu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stensmyr et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, carnivorous plants such as the Venus flytraps, sundews and pitcher plants produce volatiles that mimic fruits and flowers to attract insect prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Giusto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jurgens et al., 2009</xref>). These examples demonstrate that olfactory mimicry of food might be a common strategy used by carnivorous plants and fungal species to lure their prey.</p><p>MMB, the most attractive compound we identified from <italic>A. oligospora</italic> volatiles, elicited a strong sex- and developmental stage-specific attraction for many <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes. In the gonochoristic <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species (<italic>C. remanei</italic>, <italic>C. nigoni</italic> and <italic>C. afra</italic>), MMB was highly attractive to the females but repulsive to the males. In the hermaphroditic <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species including <italic>C.Â elegans</italic> and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, MMB was highly attractive to the adult hermaphrodites, but not to the males, dauers, or larvae. The presence of MMB strongly interfered with mating in <italic>C. afra</italic>, which is in contrast to the presence of diacetyl, another attracting chemical that is likely to be a food cue. If the female nematodes were adapted to MMB, mating was also strongly affected. Therefore, we hypothesize that MMB might be an olfactory mimic of a sex pheromone produced by male nematodes.</p><p>Multiple species have been reported to produce pheromone mimics to attract prey or pollinators. For example, the American bolas spider <italic>Mastophora hutchinsoni</italic> produces odorants that mimic female moth sex pheromones to attract different moth species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haynes et al., 2002</xref>). Orchids such as <italic>Ophrys sphegodes, O. exaltata</italic> and <italic>Mormolyca ringens</italic> produce volatile compounds that greatly resemble the chemical composition of female bee pheromones in order to attract the male bees as pollinators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mant et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schiestl et al., 2000</xref>). Whether male <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes produce any volatile sex pheromones is currently unknown, but a recent study has found that male pinewood nematodes <italic>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</italic> produce an as yet unidentified volatile pheromone that attracts the females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shinya et al., 2015</xref>). Our study suggests that MMB produced by <italic>A. oligospora</italic> might function as an olfactory mimic of a sex pheromone produced by male nematodes to attract hermaphrodites or females. Therefore, it would be of interest to screen male <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes for the production of any volatile compounds that could be functionally or structurally related to MMB. Why <italic>A. oligospora</italic> produces an odor that only attracts the females and the hermaphrodites is open to speculation. We suspect that in the niches inhabited by <italic>A. oligospora</italic>, there is a larger population of female and hermaphroditic nematodes than males. Furthermore, males are potently attracted to females and hermaphrodites so they might be also lured to the trapped female and hermaphroditic nematodes. <italic>C. elegans</italic> dauers are not attracted to MMB or <italic>A. oligospora</italic>, which might enable them to better survive <italic>A. oligospora</italic> predation. MMB attraction only seems to be conserved in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species; <italic>P. pacificus</italic> was attracted to <italic>A. oligospora</italic>, but not to MMB, suggesting that <italic>A. oligospora</italic> attraction is likely mediated via other odorants in <italic>P. pacificus.</italic></p><p><italic>A. oligospora</italic> has evolved a strategy of olfactory mimicry to efficiently attract prey, but is this strategy common among other species of predacious fungi? Most known nematode-trapping fungi, like <italic>A. oligospora</italic>, only generate traps upon sensing the presence of nematodes, so they may benefit by attracting their prey. We believe that the olfactory mimicry strategy used by <italic>A. oligospora</italic> likely represents a conserved mechanism that is employed by many other predacious fungi. In fact, an earlier study reporting that the nematode <italic>Panagrellus redivivus</italic> was attracted to another <italic>Arthrobotrys</italic> species supports this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balan and Gerber, 1972</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the olfactory neuron AWCs are known to mediate chemoattraction to certain volatile compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bargmann et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bargmann and Horvitz, 1991</xref>). AWC neurons have also recently been shown to function in thermosensationÂ and to respond to several other types of sensory stimuli, indicating that this neuron plays multiple roles in sensing environments and modulating <italic>C. elegans</italic> behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuhara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zaslaver et al., 2015</xref>). We believe that our single-cell RNA-seq analysis of AWC neurons provides a useful transcriptomic dataset with which the <italic>C. elegans</italic> community can study diverse functions of AWC. Our study has demonstrated that AWC neurons can sense different odors produced by <italic>A. oligospora</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and the response is likely to be primary, as strong activation of the AWC<sup>on</sup> neuron was still observed in the <italic>unc-13</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We have identified at least 34 chemosensory GPCRs expressed in the AWC neurons, many of which might be candidates for receptors of the <italic>A. oligospora</italic> odors. <italic>A. oligospora</italic> attracts a broad range of nematode species, and we suspect that this is due to theÂ production of a multitude of attractive odorants that are attractive to different nematode species and are sensed by multiple chemoreceptors in the nematodes. As a consequence, attraction to <italic>A. oligospora</italic> has been maintained in nematodes throughout evolution despite the strong selective pressure against it.</p><p>In conclusion, our data hasÂ shown that <italic>A. oligospora</italic> has evolved to produce olfactory mimics of food and sex cues to lure its nematode prey, revealing a novel molecular mechanism for microscopic predator-prey interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We expect that this example of coevolution will provide a foundation for future work that will further elucidate how different nematodes interact with different predatory fungi, while having broader implications for understanding other types of predator-prey interactions and their coevolution.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20023.015</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title><italic>A.Â oligospora</italic> produce volatiles that mimic food and sex cues to attract <italic>C. elegans</italic> via its olfactory neuron AWCs.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20023.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20023.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-20023-fig8-v1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>All nematodes used in this study were maintained under standard conditions at 20Â°C. <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains used in this study included N2, CB4856 (Hawaiian), CX2065 <italic>odr-1(n1936),</italic> CX2205 <italic>odr-3(n2150),</italic> CB3329 <italic>che-10(e1809),</italic> PR678 <italic>tax-4(p678),</italic> CX3085 <italic>tax-2(ks31); tax-4(p678),</italic> CX4 <italic>odr-7(ky4),</italic> PR813 <italic>osm-5(p813),</italic> NL333 <italic>gpa-1(pk15),</italic> PS6663 <italic>syEx1324[Pstr-2::GCaMP6s::unc-54 3'UTR; Pofm-1::RFP],</italic> PS6712 <italic>syEx1336[Pstr-2::GCaMP6s::unc-54 3'UTR; Pofm-1::RFP] unc-13(e51);</italic> CX3695 <italic>kyIs140[str-2::GFP + lin-15(+)]</italic>, PS7117 <italic>odr-7(sy837)</italic>, PS7117 <italic>odr-7(sy837)</italic>, and TWN1 <italic>odr-7(sy837)</italic>; yphEx1[WRM0639bF05+ ofm-1::RFP].

In order to obtain independent biological replicates for statistical analysis, we then also sequenced five aliquots of five individual RT-PCR products from five individually dissected AWC neurons.</p><p>As a control for detecting the activities of genes with housekeeping and other functions not specific to AWC, we reused two published RNA-seq read sets, generated by RT-PCR of two separate dilute aliquots from a single preparation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> whole animal RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwarz et al., 2012</xref>). The preparation was obtained from starved mixed-stage hermaphrodites, mostly L3 and L4 stage larvae, with some young adults and L2-stage larvae, and a few L1-stage larvae and eggs; as before, we briefly describe it as âlarval RNAâ. This larval RNA had previously been quantitated and tested for quality with a Bioanalyzer, and successfully used for standard full-length RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mortazavi et al., 2010</xref>). The two RNA-seq read sets counted as technical rather than biological replicates, because their starting RNA aliquots derived from a single whole larval RNA stock. However, single-cell RT-PCR amplification is an inherently noisy procedure for both technical and biological reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davidson et al., 2014</xref>), and the different expression values for genes in the two larval RNA-seq read sets therefore provided important information about the noisiness of comparisons between expression levels of genes in AWC neurons versus whole animals. We thus treated these two larval read sets as independent replicates in our statistical analysis (below), while pooling them into a single data set for estimates of gene activity in whole larvae.</p><p>We did two rounds of RNA-seq analysis. Our initial round of RNA-seq analysis was done by methods essentially identical to those in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwarz et al. (2012)</xref>.Â In particular, we mapped raw RNA-seq reads to <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein-coding genes from the WS190 release of WormBase with bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>), and used ERANGE 3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mortazavi et al., 2008</xref>) to quantitate their mapped read counts per gene and their gene expression levels in Reads per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads (RPKM). We carried out this initial analysis using only the RNA-seq data from our pool of nine AWC cells, along with our previously published whole-larval RNA-seq data as a control for housekeeping and non-specific genes. RPKM values from this analysis (mapped to current gene names in WormBase), along with current gene annotations, are given in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 7âsource data 2</xref>.</bold> </p><p>Subsequently, as we added more data, both our sequencing technologies for the AWC RT-PCRs and our RNA-seq analysis methods became more advanced than they had been in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwarz et al. (2012)</xref>. For RNA-seq, although the first round of AWC RNA-seq had raw 38-nt sequencing reads as before, the second round had raw 50-nt reads instead, and their FastQ quality coding scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cock et al., 2010</xref>) changed between the first and second AWC sequencing runs. To allow coherent use of all AWC reads as a single pooled data set for quantitating AWC gene expression, we recoded the quality scale of the older AWC read set (fastq-illumina, phred score with offset of 64) to that of the newer (fastq-sanger, phred score with offset of 33) using <italic>seqret</italic> from EMBOSS 6.5.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rice et al., 2000</xref>) before further analysis.</p><p>After RNA-seq of the AWC cells, we likewise used more advanced methods to analyze the RNA-seq data. All reads were quality-filtered as follows: AWC reads that had failed Chastity filtering were discarded (Chastity filtering had not been available for the larval reads); raw 38-nt reads were trimmed 1 nt to 37 nt; all reads were trimmed to remove any indeterminate (âNâ) residues or residues with a quality score of less than 3; and raw 38-nt reads that had been trimmed below 37 nt were deleted, as were raw 50-nt AWC reads that had been trimmed below 50 nt. This left us with a total of 131,614,334 filtered AWC reads for analysis, of which 96,433,929 reads could be partitioned into biologically independent replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 2A</xref>).</p><p>Proceeding to RNA-seq analysis proper, we used RSEM (version 1.2.17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>, PMID 21816040) with bowtie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) and SAMTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2009</xref>) to map filtered reads to a <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene index and generate readcounts and gene expression levels in transcripts per million (TPM). To create the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene index, we ran RSEM's <italic>rsem-prepare-reference</italic> with the arguments ââ<italic>bowtie2 âtranscript-to-gene-map</italic>â upon a collection of coding DNA sequences (CDSes) from both protein-coding and non-protein-coding <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes in WormBase release WS245Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harris et al., 2014</xref>). The CDS sequences were obtained from <italic>ftp:/â/âftp.ââsanger.ââac.ââuk/âpub2/âwormbase/âreleases/âWS245/âspecies/âc_âelegans/âPRJNA13758/âc_âelegans.ââPRJNA13758.ââWS245.ââmRNA_âtranscripts.ââfa.ââgz</italic> and <italic>ftp:/â/âftp.ââsanger.ââac.ââuk/âpub2/âwormbase/âreleases/âWS245/âspecies/âc_âelegans/âPRJNA13758/âc_âelegans.ââPRJNA13758.ââWS245.ââncRNA_âtranscripts.ââfa.âgz</italic>.</p><p>To analyse overall gene expression levels in AWC neurons, we pooled all 132 million RNA-seq reads from both the nine-cell pool and the five individual cells into a single AWC read set before mapping them and computing their genewise TPMs. Similarly, to analyse overall gene expression levels in whole larvae for comparison to AWC neurons, we pooled all 23.4 million RNA-seq reads from both larval data sets into a single larval data set before mapping it and computing its TPMs.</p><p>Conversely, to analyze the statistical significance for differences of gene expression between AWC neurons and whole larvae, we used only the read sets from the individual AWC neurons. Our past experience with single-cell RNA-seq data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwarz et al., 2012</xref>) led us to expect that gene expression data from single AWCs would be highly noisy, but that this noise would be canceled out by pooling non-overlapping subsets of the individual AWCs and analyzing them as independent biological replicates. We thus mapped and quantitated the single-cell AWC read sets as two pools (cells 1, 2, and 4 for pool 1; cells 3 and 5 for pool 2). Cells were chosen for the two pools so that the total number of reads in the two pools would be as close to equal as possible (45.7 million and 50.7 million reads for pools 1 and 2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 2A</xref>).</p><p>For each RNA-seq data set of interest, we computed mapped reads and expression levels per gene by running RSEM's <italic>rsem-calculate-expression</italic> with the arguments &quot;<italic>--bowtie2 -p 8 --no-bam-output --calc-pme --calc-ci --ci-credibility-level 0.99 --fragment-length-mean 200 ââfragment-length-sd 20 --estimate-rspd --ci-memory 30000</italic>&quot;. These arguments, in particular '<italic>--estimate-rspd</italic>', were aimed at dealing with single-end data from 3'-biased RT-PCR reactions; the arguments '<italic>--phred33-quals</italic>' and '<italic>--phred64-quals</italic>' were also used for the AWC and larval reads, respectively. We computed posterior mean estimates both for read counts and for gene expression levels, and rounded PMEs of read counts down to the nearest lesser integer. We also computed 99% credibility intervals (CIs) for expression data, so that we could use the minimum value in the 99% CI for TPM as a reliable minimum estimate of a gene's expression (minTPM). We defined non-zero, above-background expression for a gene in a given RNA-seq data set by that gene having an minimum estimated expression level of at least 0.1 transcripts per million (TPM) in a credibility interval of 99% (minTPM). The most relevant results from RSEM analysis are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 7âsource data 1</xref>.

DESeq2 was run in R 3.2.3, using default parameters to compute p-values that had been adjusted for multiple testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Noble, 2009</xref>) by the collective false discovery rate (FDR) formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). We computed these FDR-adjusted p-values (âpadjâ) by testing two pools of individual AWC read sets against two larval sets, at an Î± threshold of 0.01; genes for which this gave significant changes are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 7âsource data 1</xref>. We defined genes expressed significantly more strongly in AWC than in whole larvae as those genes with padjÂ â¤Â 0.01 and AWC/larvae expression ratios ofÂ &gt;1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data availability</title><p>RNA-seq reads for the wild-type AWC neurons are available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA), under accession number SRP074082 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?study=SRP074082">http://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?study=SRP074082</ext-link>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Fatal attraction: nematophagous fungus <italic>A. oligospora</italic> mimics olfactory cues of sex and food to lure nematodes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Leslie B Vosshall (Reviewer #1); Douglas Portman (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript demonstrates that several species of nematodes are attracted to a nematode-trapping fungus, <italic>A. oligospora</italic>. A single volatile produced by <italic>A. oligospora</italic>, MMB, is sufficient to attract females or hermaphrodites from many nematode species. In hermaphrodite <italic>C. elegans</italic>, this attraction requires AWC sensory neurons, and AWC neurons respond to many odors produced by <italic>A. oligospora</italic>, including MMB. The description and identification of volatiles that attract <italic>C. elegans</italic> is interesting, and provides a platform for further study of micro predator-prey relationships.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) Of greatest concern is that many of the data are apparently not subjected to any statistical analysis. If results are non-significant in all panels without reported statistics, the majority of the paper's claims are unsupported. It is troubling that the only statistics in the paper have ~6 times higher Ns than other experiments. This should be easily addressed.</p><p>2) The sex pheromone mimicry was criticized by both reviewers, phrased in the following manner:a) The claim in the text and the title that MMB mimics a sex pheromone only based on its selective effect on adult female hermaphrodites is very speculative. I do not have an issue with equating MMB with a food cue because the GC-MS-identified volatiles are plausible microbial metabolites, but nothing that the fungi produce looks like a worm pheromone. Further, AWC has never been described as a pheromone-sensing neuron.</p><p>b) The idea that MMB mimics sex pheromones is a major point of the paper. While the rationale for the production of food-like cues is good, I'm not entirely convinced that the authors have demonstrated that MMB mimics a sex pheromone. The authors' conclusion stems from two observations: first, that hermaphrodites are more strongly attracted to MMB than are males, and second, that hermaphrodite attraction is adult-specific. With regard to the first point, it's been recently shown that hermaphrodites are significantly more attracted than males to the food cue diacetyl and to bacterial food itself (Ryan et al. Curr Biol 2014). Thus, sex specificity alone is not conclusive evidence (i.e., we wouldn't call diacetyl a sex pheromone). If MMB is truly mimicking a male sex pheromone, there are several predictions â for example, the presence of MMB might interfere with hermaphrodite responses to genuine male pheromones, and srx-96 mutant hermaphrodites should be less attracted to males. The problem with this, as the authors note, is that there's little evidence in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that hermaphrodites are attracted to male pheromones at all â the only relevant evidence I know of is from the Schroeder lab (Izrayelit et al. 2012 ACS Chem Biol). Certainly, it could be that the more relevant function of MMB is to mimic male sex pheromones of related (likely male/female) nematode species, but evaluating this would not be straightforward. With regard to the second point (adult-specificity), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> pretty clearly indicates that L1 animals are indeed attracted to <italic>A. oligospora</italic>. It's true that dauers are not attracted, but given how little we know about dauer sensory behavior, I'm not sure this is particularly informative.</p><p>Both reviewers recommend to rewrite the paper to remove this speculation â this requires a change to every part of the paper, including the title and removing the extensive pheromone speculation in the Discussion. It is an interesting observation, but the elucidation mechanism would require a lot more work.</p><p>3) The text identifies mutations in <italic>odr-7</italic> as the likely locus responsible for the decrease in chemotaxis, but when compared to <italic>odr-7</italic> mutants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the EMS mutants appear to have a stronger phenotype. To claim that <italic>odr-7</italic> is the source of MMB loss, a rescue experiment is required, or at least failure to complement with <italic>odr-7</italic> mutants. It is similarly necessary to show Hawaiian chemotaxis to MMB to make the mapping results interpretable. Further I don't understand the logic that <italic>odr-7</italic> mutants are necessarily affecting only chemosensory receptor expression as the underlying mechanism for perturbations in MMB sensing. Couldn't it be any number of other transcriptional targets of <italic>odr-7</italic> that would affect the behavior (e.g. downstream signaling components specific to AWC)?</p><p>4) The <italic>srx-96</italic> phenotype is very weak and no rescue experiments are offered to show that this defect maps to AWC. It is obvious that the very large number of chemosensory receptors in the worm make it very hard to get big phenotypes, but pulling back on the interpretation is warranted unless the authors can do more with this receptor.</p><p>5) A central conclusion of the paper is: &quot;<italic>A. oligospora</italic> has evolved to lure the nematodes by producing olfactory mimicry of their food and sex cues which are attractive to Caenorhabditis nematodes.&quot; Clearly <italic>A. oligospora</italic> produces multiple compounds that are attractive to worms. However, to conclude that it has evolved to lure nematodes by producing these compounds would seem to require some very specific evidence: namely, that these cues are produced specifically in order to attract prey, rather than being generated as metabolic (by-)products common to many fungi. I'm not convinced that the production of food-like cues is a specific adaptation that promotes predation by <italic>A. oligospora</italic>. These cues could more like generic secretions of many fungi to which <italic>C. elegans</italic> is attracted simply because they provide reliable signals of food sources. (The latter idea seems to be consistent with the production of MMB and other compounds by truffles.) In order to show that this is a &quot;striking example of coevolution&quot; (Discussion), I think the authors need more convincing evidence that the production of these signals is a trait that has arisen as a result of the predatory lifestyle. A step toward this might be to examine the relationship between predation and cue production in a family of related predatory and non-predatory fungi. Of course, this gets quite complicated: it's easy to imagine a scenario where a non-predatory ancestor produces some attractive cues. Since there are then a lot of nematodes in the neighborhood, predatory abilities are more likely to evolve. But would this mean that these cues are produced specifically to attract nematodes? Is this &quot;striking coevolution&quot;? I'm certainly no evolutionary biologist, so I'm open to persuasion here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20023.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Major comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Of greatest concern is that many of the data are apparently not subjected to any statistical analysis.

With regard to the second point (adult-specificity), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> pretty clearly indicates that L1 animals are indeed attracted to A. oligospora.

It is an interesting observation, but the elucidation mechanism would require a lot more work.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewerâs concerns about whether MMB truly mimics the sex pheromone and thus decided to conduct additional experiments to see if we can find more clues about how MMB affects the nematode behavior. As the reviewers suggested, if MMB is truly mimicking a male sex pheromone, the presence of MMB might interfere with the animalâs responses to genuine male pheromones. We therefore monitored the mating behavior of a male/female <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species (<italic>C. afra</italic>, also known as sp. 7) in the presence or absence of MMB and the results were included in the revision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We selected <italic>C. afra</italic> because it has highly robust and reproducible mating behavior. Using a worm tracker, we found that <italic>C. afra</italic> wild-type male and female animals would mate within an average of ~5 minutes after they were put on the assay plate. However, in the presence of MMB, the majority of the animals failed to mate during the entire tracking period (30 minutes). If the female worms were pre-exposed to MMB before mating, the majority of the animals also failed to mate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). As a control, we also tracked mating behavior in the presence of another attractant that is more likely a food cue, diacetyl, and found that mating was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). We therefore think that this additional evidence further supports the idea that MMB might mimic a sex pheromone. We have also rephrased the wording in our manuscript, in order to make our interpretation of the data more nuanced and less speculative.</p><p><italic>3) The text identifies mutations in odr-7 as the likely locus responsible for the decrease in chemotaxis, but when compared to odr-7 mutants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the EMS mutants appear to have a stronger phenotype. To claim that odr-7 is the source of MMB loss, a rescue experiment is required, or at least failure to complement with odr-7 mutants. It is similarly necessary to show Hawaiian chemotaxis to MMB to make the mapping results interpretable. Further I don't understand the logic that odr-7 mutants are necessarily affecting only chemosensory receptor expression as the underlying mechanism for perturbations in MMB sensing. Couldn't it be any number of other transcriptional targets of odr-7 that would affect the behavior (e.g. downstream signaling components specific to AWC)?</italic> </p><p>We generated a fosmid rescue line and tested the chemotaxis behavior. The defect can be rescued by the fosmid that contains the wild-type <italic>odr-7</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The Hawaiian chemotaxis to MMB is now included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The screen was designed to avoid identifying the mutants in downstream signaling components, as these mutants were still attracted to another attractive compound, IAA. We did not think that the <italic>odr-7</italic> is affecting only the chemosensory receptor expression. Our logic was that since the only two mutants with strong defects came out from the screen were both <italic>odr-7</italic>, it is more likely that multiple receptors were involved in sensing this compound.</p><p><italic>4) The srx-96 phenotype is very weak and no rescue experiments are offered to show that this defect maps to AWC. It is obvious that the very large number of chemosensory receptors in the worm make it very hard to get big phenotypes, but pulling back on the interpretation is warranted unless the authors can do more with this receptor.</italic> </p><p>We generated a genomic rescue line for the <italic>srx-96</italic> mutant, but it only partially rescued the phenotype. Therefore, we have removed the <italic>srx-96</italic> result and removed the gene name from our model figure.</p><p><italic>5) A central conclusion of the paper is: &quot;A. oligospora has evolved to lure the nematodes by producing olfactory mimicry of their food and sex cues which are attractive to Caenorhabditis nematodes.&quot; Clearly A. oligospora produces multiple compounds that are attractive to worms. However, to conclude that it has evolved to lure nematodes by producing these compounds would seem to require some very specific evidence: namely, that these cues are produced specifically in order to attract prey, rather than being generated as metabolic (by-)products common to many fungi. I'm not convinced that the production of food-like cues is a specific adaptation that promotes predation by A. oligospora. These cues could more like generic secretions of many fungi to which C. elegans is attracted simply because they provide reliable signals of food sources. (The latter idea seems to be consistent with the production of MMB and other compounds by truffles.) In order to show that this is a &quot;striking example of coevolution&quot; (Discussion), I think the authors need more convincing evidence that the production of these signals is a trait that has arisen as a result of the predatory lifestyle. A step toward this might be to examine the relationship between predation and cue production in a family of related predatory and non-predatory fungi. Of course, this gets quite complicated: it's easy to imagine a scenario where a non-predatory ancestor produces some attractive cues. Since there are then a lot of nematodes in the neighborhood, predatory abilities are more likely to evolve. But would this mean that these cues are produced specifically to attract nematodes? Is this &quot;striking coevolution&quot;? I'm certainly no evolutionary biologist, so I'm open to persuasion here.</italic> </p><p>In the subsection âIdentification of <italic>A. oligospora</italic>-derived odorants that attract <italic>C. elegans</italic>â, we described the results of the volatile compounds produced by <italic>A. oligospora</italic>. Indeed, some of the compounds such as DMDS were commonly identified in different species including the truffles. We also detected DMDS in another two non-predatory ascomycetous species (<italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic> and <italic>A. niger</italic>). However, MMB is only present in <italic>A. oligospora</italic> but absent in the other two none-predatory fungi, demonstrating that MMB is not a general fungal odor that is produced by many fungal species. We think the production of MMB in <italic>A. oligospora</italic> is related to attracting the nematodes but agree that this may not be a âstrikingâ example of coevolution. Thus, we have removed the word âstrikingâ in the text, which is indeed unnecessary.</p></body></sub-article></article>
