coding genes does not occur in trypanosomes and the cellular copy number of each mRNA must be determined post-transcriptionally. Here, we provide evidence that codon choice directs the levels of constitutively expressed mRNAs. First, a novel codon usage metric, the gene expression codon adaptation index (geCAI), was developed that maximised the relationship between codon choice and the measured abundance for a transcriptome. Second, geCAI predictions of mRNA levels were tested using differently coded GFP transgenes and were successful over a 25-fold range, similar to the variation in endogenous mRNAs. Third, translation was necessary for the accelerated mRNA turnover resulting from codon choice. Thus, in trypanosomes, the information determining the levels of most mRNAs resides in the open reading frame and translation is required to access this information.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32467.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes are made up of DNA and contain the instructions to make molecules called proteins. This information is stored as a genetic code consisting of four bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). The order of these bases and their different combinations serves as a blueprint for making thousands of different proteins and to assemble living cells.</p><p>Converting the information in the genes into proteins requires several steps. First, the code from the DNA needs to be transcribed into RNA and then processed to make messenger RNA, or mRNA for short, which in turn is translated into proteins. Cells decode mRNAs by reading the bases as groups of three, also called codons. Most codons specify an amino acid – the building blocks of proteins – but certain codons also mark the start and end point of a protein. This ensures that the mRNA is read in the correct ‘frame’ and the desired proteins are made.</p><p>Any cell contains thousands of different proteins and each protein has its own unique level. The mechanisms used to set the number of each different type of protein can operate at every point in the process. In many organisms, the number of times a gene is transcribed to make an mRNA, underpins differences in protein levels. Trypanosomes, for example, are parasites that cause a range of devastating diseases in humans and livestock. They lack the ability to set individual mRNA levels by regulating how often the gene is transcribed. This suggests that the expression of thousands of mRNAs is regulated by a common control mechanism later in the process ending in protein synthesis. However, until now, it was unclear what these mechanisms are.</p><p>Most amino acids are encoded by more than one codon. The different codons for one amino acid are not equivalent and using a different codon can lead the mRNA to yield more or less protein. Evolution acts on these differences between codons, and the ‘codon choice’ in any one mRNA represents the outcome of natural selection. Now, Nascimento, Kelly et al. found that codon choice directs both the levels of mRNAs and the level of translation.</p><p>For the experiments, a new metric that enables a prediction of the level of expression for each mRNA was created. This metric (known as the ‘gene expression codon adaptation index’ or geCAI for short) could relate the codon choice to mRNA levels. For example, mRNAs with a low index score had shorter half-lives, i.e., how long that mRNA remained in the cell before being broken down.</p><p>Nascimento, Kelly et al. confirmed this by measuring mRNA levels in specific genes tagged with distinguishable markers and revealed that the codon choice indeed dictated the rate at which an mRNA would be broken down. A separate study by Jeacock, Faria and Horn looked more closely at how codon choice contributes to the control of the copy number of proteins. However, genes and mRNAs involved in development could deviate from the levels predicted by the geCAI metric, which suggests that other mechanisms may be in place to control the stability these mRNAs.</p><p>The importance of codon choice in setting mRNA levels has now been demonstrated in several organisms, including yeast and trypanosomes, which suggests that this process is more widespread than previously realised.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>codon choice</kwd><kwd>mRNA expression</kwd><kwd>trypanosome</kwd><kwd>Trypanosome brucei</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Freitas Nascimento</surname><given-names>Janaina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003341</institution-id><institution>Cambridge Overseas Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Freitas Nascimento</surname><given-names>Janaina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>637765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>085956/Z/08/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carrington</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The information for mRNAs expression level is set by codon choice in trypanosomes and requires translation to be interpreted into a turnover rate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In trypanosomatids, RNA polymerase II dependent transcription of protein coding genes is polycistronic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Van der Ploeg, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Worthey et al., 2003</xref>). Individual monocistronic mRNAs are produced after co-transcriptional processing by <italic>trans</italic>-splicing a 39 nucleotide, capped, exon to the 5’ end and linked endonucleolytic cleavage and polyadenylation of the upstream mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sutton and Boothroyd, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Murphy et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ullu et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matthews et al., 1994</xref>). This mechanism of mRNA transcription has co-evolved with the structure of the genome; protein coding genes occur in tandemly arrayed clusters containing up to hundreds of genes in one transcription unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ivens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berriman et al., 2005</xref>). The transcription start sites for these gene clusters have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kolev et al., 2010</xref>) and are marked by histone variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Siegel et al., 2009</xref>) and although the nature of promoters remains incompletely defined, a GT-rich promoter element has been identified that can both initiate transcription and cause histone variant deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wedel et al., 2017</xref>). There is remarkable synteny between the genomes of trypanosomatid species that diverged hundreds of millions of years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El-Sayed et al., 2005</xref>) suggesting a functional organisation of genes within polycistronic transcription units. In most cases, this is not due to the presence of an equivalent of prokaryotic operons but appears to be linked to the distance from the transcription start site. For example, genes up-regulated during heat shock tend to be distal to the transcription start site so that they continue to be transcribed by elongating RNA polymerase II for &gt;60 min after transcription initiation has stopped as a consequence of the stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kelly et al., 2012</xref>). As yet, there is no convincing evidence for selective regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription of individual genes or transcription units.</p><p>In the absence of regulation based on selective transcription of individual genes, the disparate levels of individual mRNAs within a trypanosome cell is dependent solely on post-transcriptional processes. In trypanosomatids, some very abundant RNA polymerase II transcribed mRNAs are encoded by tandemly arrayed multigene families so one pass of the RNA polymerase transcribes multiple copies of the genes in series producing increased numbers of pre-mRNAs. For example, α- and β-tubulins are encoded by a tandem array of 19 copies of each gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ersfeld et al., 1998</xref>). However, the majority of genes are single copy and are expressed in the cell at different levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kolev et al., 2010</xref>) so mechanisms for regulation of mRNA abundance must exist and these must act post-transcriptionally.</p><p>It is probable that the abundance of each mRNA is regulated at several levels during its production/degradation cycle: the rate of maturation against the decay rate of the pre-mRNA in the nucleus; the rate of export to the cytoplasm against the half-life of the mature mRNA in the nucleus; the half-life of the mature mRNA in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haanstra et al., 2008</xref>). Most work aimed at understanding determinants of mRNA levels has investigated <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that modulate the cytoplasmic half-life of the minority of mRNAs that alter in response to a developmental or an environmental trigger. In <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> there are a series of developmental forms that are adapted to different host niches and the variation in mRNA expression levels between the mammalian bloodstream form (BSF) and the insect midgut procyclic form (PCF) has been used to assay for factors necessary for a decreased half-life in one developmental form. <italic>Cis</italic>-elements have been identified in the 3’UTRs that differentially affect stability and/or rate of translation of mRNAs in specific developmental stages; the best characterised being those in procyclin mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Furger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hehl et al., 1994</xref>), cytochrome oxidase subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mayho et al., 2006</xref>), and a short stem loop, necessary and sufficient for response to external purine concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernández-Moya et al., 2014</xref>). Manipulation of these elements rarely quantitatively recapitulates the observed variations in mRNA levels in vivo whereas transfer of an entire 3’UTR can (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Webb et al., 2005a</xref>), this may reflect a combinatorial mechanism necessary for complete developmental regulation.</p><p><italic>Trans</italic>-acting factors that affect mRNA levels have been identified. The most spectacular examples of these include the RNA recognition motif-containing proteins RPB6 and RPB10. Over expression of RBP6 is sufficient to drive PCFs through several successive developmental transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kolev et al., 2012</xref>) and over expression of RBP10 causes a PCF transcriptome to switch to BSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mugo and Clayton, 2017</xref>). Other RNA binding proteins have been shown to have specific effects on sets of mRNAs, for example RBP42 binds within the open reading frame (ORF) of many mRNAs that encode proteins involved in energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Das et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, ZPF3 binds the LII <italic>cis</italic>-element in the EP1 procyclin mRNA 3’ UTR and displaces a negative regulator of translation leading to increased EP1 protein abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Walrad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Walrad et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>These observations provide strong evidence for co-ordinated regulation of mRNA cohorts and have led to a model in which the fate of cytoplasmic mRNAs is regulated by a combinatorial mechanism dependent on a set of interactions between RNA-binding proteins and their cognate sites in individual mRNAs. In this model, the information for the range of possible fates for any mRNA is contained in discrete <italic>cis</italic>-elements. However, the model is derived from a consideration of a small subset of mRNAs prone to dramatic regulation and further, it fails to consider work that demonstrated a codon bias in highly expressed genes in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and related trypanosomatid species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seward and Kelly, 2016</xref>). The use of favoured codons in highly expressed genes correlated with cognate tRNA gene numbers and led to the suggestion that translational selection was likely to act on highly abundant genes. Moreover, selection was also acting in proportion to mRNA abundance to reduce the biosynthesis requirements of those transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seward and Kelly, 2016</xref>). More recently, it has been shown that codon choice is a major determinant of mRNA levels in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>) operating through a system that monitors the rate of translation elongation involving displacement of the RNA helicase DHH1 which in turn affects the activity of the NOT1 deadenylase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>). Further, codon choice is also an important determinant of maternal mRNA turnover in zebra fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mishima et al., 2016</xref>) and Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that codon use is also central to the regulation of mRNA levels in trypanosomes. A novel codon usage statistic, the gene expression codon adaptation index (geCAI), was developed that maximises the relationship between codon usage and the measured transcript abundance for the full range of mRNAs present in a cell. Then geCAI predictions were tested using differently coded GFPs and mRNA levels were predicted with &gt;90% accuracy over a ~ 25 fold dynamic range. An investigation of the mechanism of how geCAI determined mRNA levels showed that mRNAs with low geCAI scores had shorter half-lives and that turnover was prevented if translation was blocked. These observations and measurements show that for most mRNAs the majority of the information determining mRNA levels resides in the ORF and is accessed by the translating ribosome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The experiments described below originated from an observation made during attempts to reduce expression of a transgene encoding a MS2 binding protein-green fluorescent protein-nuclear localisation signal (MS2bp-GFP-nls) fusion protein. Of the approaches used, adjusting the open reading frame (ORF) to codons that were under-represented in highly expressed mRNAs was more effective than other modifications including mutating the AG acceptor dinucleotide to AA in the trans-splicing site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Siegel et al., 2005</xref>), using a synthetic 5’UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Siegel et al., 2005</xref>) and using a 3’UTR from a low abundance mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We decided to re-visit the calculation of the association between codon scores and expression levels. Building on the observation that altering codon use affected both protein and mRNA levels for the MS2bp-GFP-nls transgene described above, the approach taken was to make an assumption that codon use directly affected mRNA levels for most constitutively expressed genes and to derive a codon statistic for genes that best correlated with their measured mRNA abundance levels.</p><p>To estimate the abundance of individual mRNAs, an RNA-Seq analysis of poly(A) enriched RNA was performed with three biological replicates of mid-log phase PCF <italic>T. brucei</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kelly et al., 2017</xref>) (EBI Array Express E-MTAB-3335).

Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used to avoid distributional assumptions about the hidden distribution of per-gene translational efficiencies and the observed distribution of mRNA abundance estimates. To calculate the codon values, the measured expression levels of mRNAs from 5136 single copy genes were used. This set of genes represented the genome with the following exclusions: (i) mRNAs with &gt;2 fold differential expression when BSF and PCF trypanosomes were compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kelly et al., 2017</xref>) as the mRNA abundance are likely to be modulated by <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA binding proteins and thus obscure the codon score learning process. (ii) mRNAs encoded by single copy genes without a homologue in at least one other kinetoplastid species, this was a mechanism to exclude any potentially spurious ORFs that may not encode proteins. (iii) mRNAs encoded by multicopy genes families as the accuracy of TPM calculations is compromised by uncertainty of copy number and associated errors in allocation of many sequence reads to individual genes.</p><p>The calculation of codon weights Ci proceeded by randomly generating a set of codon scores <italic>S</italic> were Ci [0,1]. Here, a score of 1 means that a codon has the maximum positive effect on mRNA levels and a score of 0 the minimum effect. The geCAI score of an ORF was evaluated as the geometric mean of the scores for all codons in that ORF. The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between geCAI scores for the 5136 ORFs and mRNA abundances was then computed. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm was then employed to introduce stochastic changes into the codon score matrix and the entire set of genes was rescored and the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient recalculated. If in a given generation of the Markov chain, a matrix was found that produced a higher correlation coefficient than the current best matrix, then it replaced the current best matrix and formed the basis for subsequent generations of stochastic modification. One thousand chains each starting from a different random starting matrix were initiated and allowed to run for 5000 generations. In all cases, stationary phase was reached between 1500 and 2000 generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

A mid-log phase PCF cell contains approximately 50000 mRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhalia et al., 2006</xref>) and so 20 TPM is equivalent to one mRNA molecule/cell, so the range of transcript abundance for the vast majority is between ~1 and 40 mRNAs/diploid gene pair/cell. The use of geCAI allows a prediction of a range of expression level for an mRNA based on the sequence of the ORF alone, for example an ORF with a geCAI score of 0.35 will be expressed at 2.5 mRNAs/cell on average with the vast majority of mRNAs in a range between 1 and 5.</p><p>Several previously developed codon usage statistics were tested to determine if these could explain the measured mRNA levels. Of the tested methods, CAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carbone et al., 2005</xref>) and tAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tuller et al., 2010</xref>) provided the best correlation but the predictive capacity was limited with Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients of ρ = 0.16 and ρ = 0.13 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These measures may be unsuitable for this type of analysis as each assumes the effectiveness of the 'best' codon for each amino acid is equivalent, for example that the most efficient codon for glycine will have the same effect as the most efficient codon for alanine. There is evidence that this is not the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gardin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The geCAI values for each codon in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> are derived from the mRNA levels measured in the transcriptome analysis used in this study. There is variation in the measurements of mRNA levels in transcriptome analyses from different studies that probably has a range of origins: identity of the cell line, growth conditions, methodology of RNA preparation, RNA-Seq and data analysis and similar variation has been found in studies in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harigaya and Parker, 2016</xref>). The consequence is that any table of geCAI codon values contains an element reflecting how mRNA levels were measured, but the underlying principle that codon choice is a major determinant of mRNA levels is unaffected. To illustrate this point, transcriptome data from three other studies were analysed to determine geCAI values as above. The Pairwise Pearson correlation (r) between log<sub>2</sub>(mRNA abundance) measures from this study and three others ranged from 0.68 to 0.86 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5A</xref>). The calculation of geCAI values for each codon showed variation derived from the differences in transcriptome measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5B and C</xref>). Each set of geCAI codon values was then used to derive geCAI scores for each of the 5136 mRNAs and these were plotted against the mRNA expression level determined in the cognate study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The GFP protein abundance was expressed relative to eGFP and plotted against geCAI score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>); the geCAI score was able to predict GFP protein abundance with 84% accuracy (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.84).

Equal numbers of cells of the four cell lines were mixed, RNA extracted and expression levels for each GFP mRNA measured in transcripts per million transcripts (TPM). Three separate analyses were performed using three independent clones for each GFP transgene. In analysing the results, the measured expression level of each GFP mRNA was adjusted to compensate for the effect of gene copy number and the dilution effect from the mixing of four different cell lines. Trypanosomes are diploid and any endogenous single copy gene will be present in two copies per cell, each of the four cell lines contained a haploid copy of a different GFP transgene so in the mixed population used to prepare RNA there are eight copies of an endogenous gene for one copy of each of the individual GFP transgenes, effectively an 8-fold lower copy number. After adjusting for the effective difference in copy number within the sequenced pool, GFP mRNA abundance was plotted against geCAI values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The Pearson’s correlation coefficient between GFP mRNA levels and geCAI was r<sup>2</sup> = 0.92 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Therefore, as the genomic integration site, UTRs and amino acid sequence were all identical, codon use was the major determinant of steady state levels for the transgene derived GFP mRNA and protein.</p><p>The ~25 fold range of GFP mRNA levels, 2.5 to 60 mRNAs/diploid gene pair equivalent/cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) is similar to the range present in mRNAs from single copy genes in the transcriptome. The measurements for the GFP mRNAs are in the higher end of the endogenous transcriptome, probably because the range of GFP geCAI scores included values higher than those present in most endogenous single copy genes. Thus, altering codon use can account for the range of steady state level of most mRNAs and the geCAI score is a good predictor of mRNA level for single copy genes not subject to developmental regulation. Furthermore, discrepancy between geCAI score for a gene and the observed mRNA or protein abundance for that gene is an indicator that other regulatory mechanisms, such as <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA binding proteins may be acting on that gene to modulate mRNA abundance. mRNAs for cytosolic ribosomal proteins have significantly higher geCAI scores than those encoding mitochondrial ribosomal proteins</p><p>The mRNA abundance measurements used to obtain geCAI codon weights did not include mRNAs for 67 of the 75 cytosolic ribosomal proteins as these are encoded by gene families with two or three members.

Five different GFP transgene constructs with a range of geCAI scores were modified by insertion of a 48 base hairpin (24 base pairs) in the 5’UTR located 59 nucleotides from the cap and 88 nucleotides from the initiation codon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref>).

As expected, there was no detectable expression of GFP by flow cytometry in any of the cell lines containing a transgene with a hairpin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6C and 6D</xref>), therefore the hairpin-containing mRNAs were not translated.

Could this observation be explained by the persistence of decapped mRNA stabilised by the hairpin blocking 5’ to 3’ decay?

Reduction of the length of the hairpin from 24 bp to 18 bp still blocked translation and no GFP fluorescence was observed.

Over this time the core gene expression machinery present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor has been largely conserved but selective transcription of individual genes by RNA polymerase II has been lost and individual mRNAs arise by co-transcriptional processing of polycistronically transcribed precursors. Tens or hundreds of genes, mostly with no obvious functional link to each other, are transcribed from a single start site and monocistronic mRNAs arise by co-transcriptional <italic>trans</italic>-splicing and polyadenylation. The downstream consequence is that individual mRNA levels must be set post-transcriptionally.</p><p>An observation that altering the codon use of a transgene to codons under-represented in highly expressed mRNAs not only reduced protein expression but also the cognate mRNA to a similar extent led us to investigate the effect of codon use on mRNA levels. The major finding presented here is that codon use is central to the regulation of mRNA levels in trypanosomes. A novel codon usage metric, the gene expression codon adaptation index (geCAI), was developed that maximises the relationship between codon usage and the measured mRNA abundance. The geCAI score for an ORF allows a prediction of mRNA levels for constitutively expressed genes. Differently coded GFPs were used as a test and mRNA expression levels were successfully predicted over a ~ 25 fold range, similar to the range of endogenous mRNAs. The differences in GFP mRNA levels resulted from differences in the half-lives of the mRNAs, the lower the geCAI score, the shorter the half-life. An investigation of the mechanism of geCAI mediated mRNA half-life showed that translation was necessary as mRNA turnover was reduced/prevented if translation was blocked using a hairpin in the 5’UTR. Further, insertion into the 5’UTR of secondary structure that greatly reduced but did not block translation had only a small effect on steady state mRNA levels, providing evidence that the sensor for geCAI mediated turnover was detecting ribosome progression rather than frequency of translation initiation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Development of geCAI</title><p>Initial attempts at a numerical analysis of codon choice and mRNA levels using existing codon metrics were not particularly successful especially for the expression of reporter genes containing codons found infrequently in abundant mRNAs. For example, the most commonly used codon metric is the codon adaptation index (CAI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sharp et al., 1987</xref>) and previous work had found only a weak correlation between CAI and protein levels in both <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horn, 2008</xref>) and the related species <italic>Leishmania mexicana</italic> and <italic>L. major</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Subramanian and Sarkar, 2015</xref>). However, this association between codon use and mRNA abundance suggested that perhaps an alternative metric may have increased explanatory power. The aim in developing geCAI was to account for the full range of mRNA levels present in the procyclic form of <italic>T. brucei</italic>. The measured mRNA levels for the set of single copy, non-developmentally regulated genes were used to compute a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between transcript abundance and the geCAI score. The final Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between geCAI score and mRNA levels was ρ = 0.55, indicating that codon usage is responsible for more than 50% of the variation in the expression of mRNAs from different genes. The main difference between the geCAI and other CAI statistics is that the codon weight matrix is global rather than local. Specifically, for a conventional CAI matrix one codon for each amino acid must be assigned a value of 1, other synonymous codons for each amino acid must have values ≤ 1 and&gt;0. This makes the assumption that the translation efficiency of the optimal synonymous codon for each amino acid is equivalent. This local constraint (one codon for each amino acid has a value = 1) is not enforced when calculating geCAI but a single global constraint that stipulates that at least one from the 61 codons must have the maximum value of 1 and that all other codons must have values ≤ 1 and&gt;0. Thus, unlike other codon weight matrices, such as CAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sharp et al., 1987</xref>) and tAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">dos Reis et al., 2004</xref>), the optimal synonymous codon for one amino acid does not necessarily have the same value as the optimal synonymous codon for any other amino acid. This more accurately represents the real relationship between codons and thus enables greater explanatory power.</p><p>In the set of geCAI values for all amino acids, only six codons have a value of 1 and there is also an unexpected variation in values between codons encoding similar amino acids. For example, all six codons for serine have geCAI values below 0.25 whereas threonine codons range from 0.75 to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The selection for these contrasting geCAI values for similar amino acids is not obvious but may be related to maintaining most mRNAs at low copy number.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>geCAI and mRNA abundance</title><p>The geCAI scores provided a prediction of a range mRNA abundance, for example the vast majority of mRNAs encoding ORFs with a geCAI score of 0.35 vary between 1 and 5 mRNA molecules per cell. This range of mRNA levels suggests that there are determinants of the final mRNA levels that lie outside codon use: first, through the action of <italic>cis</italic>-elements and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors the alter mRNA stability directly. Second, it is not known whether all the polycistronic transcription units are transcribed at the same rate, so some of the variation might arise from differential transcription rates. Third, the cohort of single copy genes will include some that are developmentally regulated in one of the several other developmental forms not considered here. However, the predictive ability of geCAI scores for mRNA expression level is remarkable and, along with the experiments altering translation of the reporter mRNA, provides good evidence that the half-life of most mRNAs is set by a translation associated process.</p><p>Developmentally regulated mRNAs provide an example of cohorts of mRNAs that alter in response to external signals. In the PCFs used in experiments here, the expression levels of the sets of developmentally regulated mRNAs do not correlate well with geCAI scores. Many mRNAs down regulated in PCFs (when compared to BSFs) were expressed at levels lower than predicted by geCAI scores. This might be expected if the intrinsic geCAI expression level of these mRNAs is modulated by <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the UTRs to destabilise the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Webb et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clayton, 2013</xref>). Conversely, many mRNAs upregulated in PCFs relative to BSFs were expressed at levels greater that would be predicted by the geCAI score. This indicates that these mRNAs are actively stabilised in PCFs and that developmental regulation comes from a combination of active stabilisation and destabilisation that modulates geCAI score mediated stability. Two comparative analyses of BSFs and PCFs by ribosome profiling showed that regulated translation was common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vasquez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jensen et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, could inhibition or stimulation of translation directly cause alteration to mRNA levels? The evidence here where reducing the frequency of translation had little effect on mRNA levels indicates the two are not necessarily linked. Further, the weak correlation between geCAI score for an ORF and the ribosome density indicates that abundant mRNAs (high geCAI score) are not necessarily translated frequently. However, should a <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor act in a similar manner to Fragile X mental retardation protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>) and cause ribosome slowing or stalling during translation then an effect on mRNA stability could follow.</p><p>The differential speed of progression of a ribosome on different codons is generally held to be dependent on the supply of cognate charged tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fluitt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2014</xref>) and this forms the basis of the tRNA adaptation index (tAI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">dos Reis et al., 2004</xref>).

Changes in tRNA pools in response to external stimuli is an attractive model for regulating gene expression in developmental transitions and deletion of individual tRNA genes can alter mRNA levels in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bloom-Ackermann et al., 2014</xref>). Direct measurements of the tRNA pools in trypanosomes would inform whether a similar change underpins any of developmental transitions in trypanosomes.</p><p>In summary, we have developed and validated a new codon use metric, the gene expression codon adaptation index (geCAI) and shown that it can be used to predict the expression level of many mRNAs in PCF trypanosomes. The lack of selective regulation of transcription of most protein coding genes in trypanosomes means that the effect of codon use on mRNA levels is particularly apparent. Mechanistically, the evidence supports a model in which the speed or processivity of ribosome progression determines mRNA half-life. This is similar to the process identified in yeast and, if there is a common mechanism in yeast and trypanosomes, it is likely that it has a very early evolutionary origin possibly dating from the last eukaryotic common ancestor, and that it may be present in many diverse eukaryotes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Gene expression codon adaptation index</title><p>A script to enable estimation of geCAI codon weights is available for download under the GPL V3.0 licence at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/SteveKellyLab/geCAI">https://github.com/SteveKellyLab/geCAI</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kelly, 2017</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/geCAI">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/geCAI</ext-link>).</p><p>A codon weight matrix was generated with each codon randomly assigned a weight in the interval [0, 1] with a constraint that at least one codon had a value of 1.

For northern blots, 3 μg of each sample was loaded in 1.2% agarose gel after denaturation with glyoxal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrington et al., 1987</xref>). Quantitative analyses were done using phosphoimager and ImageQuant TL 1D v7.0 (GE Healthcare). All probes used were the complete ORFs: each GFP was probed specifically with the cognate ORF. 18S ribosomal RNA was used as loading control.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Christine Clayton for discussions, Nancy Standart for a critical reading of the manuscript and Grzegorz Kudla for the gift of a range of GFP ORF clones.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32467.019</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Sequences of the various MS2bp-GFP-nls transgenes used is the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</title><p>Each sequence is split into three: the 5’ sequences, the open reading frame in bold, and 3’ sequences.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-32467-supp1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32467.020</object-id><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>GFP transgene mRNA sequences</title><p>(A) GFP transgene sequence after integration. 5’ region from an alpha-tubulin gene, <italic>trans</italic>-splice acceptor sites in red (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kolev et al., 2010</xref>), GFP open reading frame in green, and 3’ region from an actin gene, polyadenylation sites in blue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kolev et al., 2010</xref>).

The authors state that their dataset differs from all the others and therefore comparisons are meaningless.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not mean to give the impression that the comparison with other datasets is meaningless. We wrote ‘The ability to compare geCAI with other datasets was restricted by the low correlation values between RNA-seq measured mRNA levels determined in different labs for PCFs (Supplementary file 9A)’.</p><p>What we meant by this is that the calculation of the values for geCAI are dependent on measured transcriptome mRNA abundances and these vary in datasets from different labs (see below). So, the use of the geCAI values derived from the transcriptome measured here and then applied to another dataset (with different values for mRNA abundances) would not be the best approach. The best route is a calculation of geCAI values for each of the other datasets to compensate for the variation in measured mRNA levels.</p><p>The RNAseq quantitation of transcriptomes vary for the reasons outlined below and it is likely that all, including the dataset we produced, represent approximations to the actual mRNA levels in cells. This variation is not unique to trypanosome labs and has been described in more detail in yeast. The important point here is not that one set of values for geCAI allows predictions for all datasets but that the calculation of geCAI for a dataset allows prediction of expression for mRNAs measured using the same conditions for growth, RNA prep etc. This calculation is necessary to compensate for the variations in measures of mRNA abundance.</p><p>Why is there variation between the RNAseq derived mRNA expression levels in data from different labs? There are two non-exclusive possibilities described below:</p><p>1) The differences represent real differences in mRNA expression level due to different genotypes; different adaptations to culture, different culture conditions including cell density at harvesting and media composition, including cell density at time of mRNA harvesting.</p><p>2) The differences arise for technical reasons, bearing in mind that most stable mRNAs have half-lives of 10 to 30 minutes:</p><p>- The amount of time taken to wash the cells between culture flask and cell lysis, a 1, 5 or 10 minute centrifugation will have a differential effect on mRNA abundance of different genes depending on the half-life of that mRNA.</p><p>- The composition and temperature of any wash solution.</p><p>- The method used to prepare mRNA.</p><p>- The method used for library construction and RNAseq.</p><p>- The analysis of the RNAseq data to quantitate mRNA expression levels.</p><p>Looking at the published methods for the available datasets, there are differences in at least 8 of the variables above and this excludes pre-treatment with cycloheximide used in the ribosome foot printing preotocols which is known to alter mRNA levels within &lt;10 minutes (see Figure 2 in Webb et al., 2005 as an example). No two datasets from different labs used identical methodology and the correlation between RNAseq datasets reflected this in by the analysis in Supplementary file 8.</p><p>We have calculated geCAI values for other datasets to show that the method for generating geCAI predictions of mRNA levels is applicable to all datasets.</p><p>We used the following more recently published RNA seq datasets; the methodology and analysis has vastly improved in the last 5 years, in particular the length of sequence read and these are generally more reliable.</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28742275 (Christiano et al., 2017 – PCF data)</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27756224 (Hutchinson et al., 2016 – BSF and PCF)</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25145465 (Fadda et al., 2014 – PCF data as also used for PCF half-lives (see below))</p><p>Importantly, we have also provided a script on GitHub so that the calculation of geCAI values is accessible for anyone to use on their own data.</p><p>We have also highlighted in the text that the geCAI values are dependent of strain, conditions and lab and computing protocols. We realise now that we should have emphasised this much more strongly in the original manuscript.</p><p>Supplementary file 3 gives the correlations between dataset and shows that the best correlation is between two datasets from the same study but from different developmental forms. The fact that this correlation between two developmental forms is better that between datasets for the same developmental form from different studies suggests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, the reviewers disagree. If their CAI only works with their own dataset then it is the CAI that is problematic.</p></disp-quote><p>See above; the problem arises due to the variation in RNAseq datasets not with the geCAI method. The method will work with all datasets but the geCAI values would have to be recalculated to allow for variations due to the factors listed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, although they claim that the CAI reflects mRNA half-life, the authors ignore the published transcriptome-wide half-life measurements.</p><p>Please show the following scatter plots (essential):a) CAI vs other procyclic form RNASeq datasets.

The use of more replicates obviously reduces the error in mRNA abundance measurements for the cell line, growth conditions, RNA extraction method, and RNAseq protocol and analysis that was used. It does not in itself make it a more accurate measure of the absolute values for mRNA abundance for procyclic form <italic>T. brucei</italic> (the actual levels in the cell). As stated above, biological and technical variability between strains and experiments mean that mRNA abundance estimates for the same genes vary between experiments. This is the expected behaviour and not a limitation of our (or any other) study.</p><p>We have used one of the additional ribosomal profiling datasets. We did not use the Antwi et al. dataset as values were only available for ~60% of the mRNAs, whereas the other two contained values for &gt;98% of the 5136 genes used for the analysis. The two datasets used gave similar results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Overall the generation of the data and figures need to be more comprehensively described (see comment 1)</p><p>Figure 1C: How does the new geCAI compare to the CAI or tAI?

The RNAseq was performed on a mixture of four cell lines each containing a haploid copy of a GFP transgene. Trypanosomes are diploid, so any endogenous single copy gene will be present in two copies per cell in all four cell lines. So, in the mixed population there are eight copies of an endogenous gene for one copy of each of the GFP transgenes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 2: This figure does not contain sufficient information.

As stated in the manuscript: mRNA was extracted from a mixture of equal numbers of cells from four cell lines each expressing a differently coded GFP from a single integrated transgene (haploid). Let’s call them GFPA, GFPB, GFPC and GFPD. If we imagine one hundred cells in the mixture, 25 will be expressing GFPA, 25 will express GFPB and so on. So, in the one hundred diploid cells in the mixture, there will be 200 copies of a normal single copy gene and 25 copies of each GFP transgene, that is one eighth.</p><p>We have modified the text to try and clarify further.</p><p>I am not sure how one emission spectrum can contaminate another. In addition, all GFPs had exactly the same amino acid sequence and so the same emission spectra.
