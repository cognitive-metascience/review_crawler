a capacity to recognize short peptides via their tetratricopeptide repeat domains (KLC<sup>TPR</sup>). Here, using X-ray crystallography, we show how kinesin-1 recognizes a novel class of adaptor motifs that we call ‘Y-acidic’ (tyrosine flanked by acidic residues), in a KLC-isoform-specific manner. Binding specificities of Y-acidic motifs (present in JIP1 and in TorsinA) to KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> are distinct from those utilized for the recognition of W-acidic motifs, found in adaptors, that are KLC-isoform non-selective. However, a partial overlap on their receptor-binding sites implies that adaptors relying on Y-acidic and W-acidic motifs must act independently. We propose a model to explain why these two classes of motifs that bind to the concave surface of KLC<sup>TPR</sup> with similar low micromolar affinity can exhibit different capacities to promote kinesin-1 activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>molecular motor</kwd><kwd>kinesin-1</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L006774/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dodding</surname><given-names>Mark P</given-names></name><name><surname>Steiner</surname><given-names>Roberto A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S000917/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dodding</surname><given-names>Mark P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S000828/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steiner</surname><given-names>Roberto A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>X-ray crystallography reveals how kinesin-1 recognises a novel class of cargo adaptor motifs in an isoform-specific manner.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transport of cellular components along microtubules (MTs) is important in virtually all cell types and required for normal cellular activities. For neuronal function, MT-based transport is particularly critical due to the long distances that need to be travelled and strong links exist between intracellular transport and the pathogenesis of neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chevalier-Larsen and Holzbaur, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franker and Hoogenraad, 2013</xref>). The kinesin-1 motor, is responsible for the anterograde (plus-end directed) transport along MTs of a wide range of cargoes such as protein complexes, ribonuclear protein assemblies, vesicles, and organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>). Defects in kinesin-1-mediated transport have been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's, Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and hereditary spastic paraplegia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mandelkow and Mandelkow, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morfini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morihara et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>At the molecular level, kinesin-1 is a tetramer consisting of two ATP-dependent motor-bearing heavy chains (KHCs) and two light chains (KLCs) that in mammalian cells are encoded by three (Kif5A-C) and four (KLC1-4) closely related genes, respectively, with distinct cell and tissue expression profiles. When not engaged in active transport, kinesin-1 is maintained in an autoinhibited state resulting from an intramolecular interaction in which the C-terminus of a single KHC tail binds at the N-terminal motor dimer interface preventing the structural transition required for ADP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaan et al., 2011</xref>). Regulatory KLCs interact with KHCs using their N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) region that precedes an unstructured region followed by a cargo-anchoring tetratricopeptide repeat domain (TPR) and a disordered C-terminal region that varies considerably between isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The unstructured region N-terminal to KLC<sup>TPR</sup> (TPR domain of KLC) features a leucine-phenylalanine-proline (LFP) triplet followed by Asn/Ser and flanked by negatively charged Asp/Glu residues that is highly conserved in all KLCs isoforms. We have shown that this 'LFP-acidic' region engages in cis with KLC<sup>TPR</sup> contributing to the maintenance of the autoinhibited state, and is likely important in cargo-driven activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yip et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38362.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> binds Y-acidic peptides with low micromolar affinity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of KLC.

However, adaptor (or scaffolding) proteins that provide a molecular link between kinesin-1 and its cargoes play a clear role in coordinating motor's activity and driving transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>). While vesicular cargoes interact with adaptors that can bind to multiple sites on both KHCs and KLCs, diversity of recognition is often mediated by the interaction of the KLC<sup>TPR</sup> domain with short disordered peptide sequences on the adaptors. One important class of such peptides features a tryptophan residue flanked by aspartic or glutamic acid residues (for example, EWD). Experimentally validated 'W-acidic' recognition motifs are found in a growing list of adaptors including the SifA-kinesin interacting protein (SKIP), a critical host determinant in <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis and a regulator of lysosomal positioning, the neuronal protein calsyntenin-1 (CSTN-1), dynein intermediate chain (DIC), nesprin-2, gadkin, and cayman ataxia protein (BNIP-H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoyama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dodding et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Konecna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ligon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McGuire et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson and Holzbaur, 2015</xref>). Remarkably, W-acidic motifs have an intrinsic capacity to promote kinesin-1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dodding et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farías et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pu et al., 2015</xref>). We have solved the X-ray structure of KLC2<sup>TPR</sup> in complex with the W-acidic peptide of SKIP (SKIP<sup>WD</sup>, sequence TNLEWDDSAI) thus deciphering the structural basis for the recognition of this important class of adaptor peptides by kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pernigo et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Despite the importance of W-acidic motifs, cargo adaptors exist that do not feature this type of recognition sequence. A prominent example is the c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein 1 (JIP1) that is involved in the anterograde transport of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a key determinant in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matsuda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scheinfeld et al., 2002</xref>). The most C-terminal region of JIP1 (sequence YTCPTEDIYLE, JIP1<sup>C-term</sup>) has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for kinesin-1 binding and, in contrast to W-acidic sequences, JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> has a strong preference for the KLC1 isoform, rather than KLC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Verhey et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> binding to KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> is not sufficient to promote kinesin-1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawano et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, KHC binding by JIP1 as well as the cooperation of additional proteins, like FEZ1 or JIP3, is required for cargo transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blasius et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu and Holzbaur, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hammond et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Satake et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Using a structural approach we show here how kinesin-1 selects adaptors, like JIP1, that rely on an alternative 'Y-acidic' (tyrosine-acidic) motif for recognition. We also show how the solenoid-shaped KLC<sup>TPR</sup> domains utilize distinct, yet partly overlapping, portions of their concave surface to select between W-acidic and Y-acidic motifs in an isoform-specific manner following a general 'induced-fit' principle. Our work helps understanding the versatility and complexity of cargo recognition mediated by KLC<sup>TPR</sup> domains that depends on their unanticipated remarkable plasticity. We propose a model to explain why W-acidic and Y-acidic motifs that bind to the concave groove of KLC<sup>TPR</sup> with similar low micromolar affinity exhibit different capacities to promote kinesin-1 activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Y-acidic C-terminal motifs bind to KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> with low micromolar affinity</title><p>JIP1 is an important adaptor protein that can couple kinesin-1 to several cargoes thus enabling their transport along MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left-hand side). While its JNK-binding domain (JBD) is required for interaction with JNK, its PTB domain binds several proteins, including APP, apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), p190RhoGEF, dual leucine zipper bearing kinase (DLK), and JIP3 (JSAP1). The short JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> stretch that binds to KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> is highly conserved and characterized by a low theoretical pI value of 4.57 due to the presence of multiple acidic amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, top). The most C-terminal tyrosine (Y709 in human JIP1) is particularly important for the interaction and its replacement by an alanine has been shown to result in loss of KLC1 binding in immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Verhey et al., 2001</xref>). As Y709 is embedded within the acidic patch we refer to this region as the Y-acidic core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To further validate this interaction, we employed an in vitro fluorescence polarization (FP) assay. We first measured the affinity between TAMRA-labelled JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> and the highly homologous KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> and KLC2<sup>TPR</sup> domains. We find that at 150 mM NaCl TAMRA-JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> binds to KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> with a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 0.95 μM whilst its affinity for KLC2<sup>TPR</sup> is significantly lower (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> &gt;94 μM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) consistent with a previously reported specificity of JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> for KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, like we observed for W-acidic peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pernigo et al., 2013</xref>), binding affinity measurements at varying NaCl concentrations indicate that Y-acidic motifs rely on an electrostatic component for recognition. <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values for TAMRA-JIP1<sup>C-term</sup>:KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> binding are 0.48 μM and ~10 μM at NaCl concentrations of 85 and 500 mM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A control isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiment carried out using unlabeled JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> indicates that the TAMRA label does not interfere with the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Another protein that has also been shown to bind to KLC1 in co-IP experiments is TorsinA, a constitutively inactive AAA+ (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) protein whose gene is linked to early-onset dystonia type 1 (DYT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kamm et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right-hand side). As gene deletions revealed that its last ~80 amino acids are sufficient for the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kamm et al., 2004</xref>), we inspected the primary structure of this region and noticed that its C-terminus shares similarities with JIP1<sup>C-term</sup>, particularly, with respect to the conservation of a Y-acidic core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, bottom). We thus hypothesised that this region might be responsible for KLC1 binding. Similarly to JIP1, we find that a TAMRA-labeled peptide encompassing the last 12 amino acids of mouse TorsinA (TAMRA-TorsinA<sup>C-term</sup>) binds at 150 mM NaCl with <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values of 1.7 μM and &gt;24 μM to KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> and KLC2<sup>TPR</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and that affinity for KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> depends on the ionic strength of the medium with <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values of 1.2 μM and ~30 μM at NaCl concentrations of 85 and 500 mM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, Y-acidic motifs bind to KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> with low micromolar affinity at physiological ionic strength and may provide a common mechanism for distinguishing between isoforms with preference for KLC1 over KLC2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Strategy employed for the structural elucidation of KLC1<sup>TPR</sup>-specific Y-acidic peptide complexes</title><p>To elucidate how the well-established JIP1 cargo adaptor is recognized by KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> we pursued a crystallographic approach. We were previously successful in obtaining diffracting crystals of KLC2<sup>TPR</sup> in complex with the cognate SKIP<sup>WD</sup> W-acidic peptide by engineering a chimeric construct in which the peptide was fused N-terminal to KLC2<sup>TPR</sup> via a flexible (TGS)<sub>4</sub> linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pernigo et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we used a similar approach. However, as JIP1 binds to KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> using its C-terminus we hypothesized that a free carboxyl group might be important for the interaction. We therefore fused JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> downstream of KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> via a flexible (TGS)<sub>10</sub> linker. Crystals of the chimera grew readily in a variety of conditions. However, they exhibited very limited diffraction (worse than 15 Å resolution) or, more often, no diffraction at all. To improve crystal quality, we decided to employ Nanobodies (Nbs) as crystallization chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pardon et al., 2014</xref>). Using the chimera as an antigen, a pool of 29 high-affinity Nbs was generated and a subset later employed in crystallization trials following purification of each individual Nb:chimera complex. Nb-mediated crystallization dramatically improved crystal quality and allowed us to collect X-ray data for the complex to 2.7 Å resolution using synchrotron radiation. We also sought to obtain structural information on TorsinA binding. To this end, we replaced the JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> sequence with that of TorsinA<sup>C-term</sup> and produced crystals that diffracted X-rays at 2.3 Å resolution.

The structures of the complexes reveal that the C-terminal peptides bind in an extended conformation straddling across the KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> concave surface with a direction opposite to that of super-helical coiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The epitope recognized by the Nb used as crystallization chaperone is totally distinct from the peptide-binding region and maps on the outer surface with contributions from residues on TPR4(α8) and TPR5. The KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> domain is typically very well defined in both structures. However, most of the stretch connecting the single non-TPR αN helix to α11 of TPR6 (residues 437 – 459) could not be modeled due to flexibility. Also, electron density for helix α1 of TPR1 is of significantly poorer quality compared to all other TPR helices indicating that this region is more disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

While the KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> domains are essentially identical in both Y-acidic peptide-bound structures (rmsd = 0.75 Å over 259 equivalent Cα atoms), a similar global superposition between the peptide-free ('open', PDB code 3NF1) and the TorsinA<sup>C-term</sup>-bound ('closed') structures gives a rmsd of ∼4.1 Å for 253 equivalent Cα atoms. An analysis using the DynDom algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poornam et al., 2009</xref>) indicates that peptide recognition elicits a conformational transition that is best described by a ∼30° rotation of an N-terminal domain with respect to a hinge region largely contributed by residues belonging to second-half and first-half of TPR3(α6) and TPR4(α8) (residues 323 – 329, 348 – 350, 353 – 358), respectively, while the C-terminal region (second-half of α8 to α12) is fixed. As a result, the TPR1(α1) helix axis undergoes a lateral displaced of over 16 Å. Each individual domain behaves essentially as a rigid unit (rmsd N-terminal moving domains = 1.06 Å over 117 equivalent Cα atoms, rmsd C-terminal fixed domains = 0.88 Å over 131 equivalent Cα atoms).

While JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> and TorsinA<sup>C-term</sup> peptides display a virtually identical main-chain trace for their Y-acidic core, conformational variability is observed for their N-terminal portion that is not conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Overall, a combination of electrostatics, specific interactions often mediated by receptor asparagine residues, and the intrinsically malleable nature of the cargo adaptor peptides, plays a main role in the recognition process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Cellular validation of the KLC1<sup>TPR</sup>-JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> interface and molecular determinants of KLC1 specificity</title><p>To further validate the KLC1<sup>TPR</sup>-JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> interface and to rationalize the strong preference of this cargo adaptor for KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> over the highly homologous KLC2<sup>TPR</sup> observed in FP measurements, we employed immunoprecipitation in HeLa cells in combination with structure-guided mutagenesis. Cells were co-transfected with wild-type and mutant constructs expressing hemagglutinin (HA)–KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> and FLAG-JIP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). For mutagenesis, key KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> interface residues R266, N343, N386, N469 were substituted with a serine to alter their salt bridge/H-bonding capabilities while V305 was replaced with a threonine to generate an isosteric change with altered polarity. We also mutagenized residues not at the interface as negative controls (Q222A, E484A, E488A) Overall, we find that all amino acid substitutions at the interface, but not negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), substantially reduce the affinity between KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> and JIP1 with residual binding quantified ranging from ∼15% to ∼35% compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In particular, a very strong effect is observed for the R266S replacement that prevents the formation of a salt bridge with the (p<sup>+2</sup>) acidic side-chain and a similar near-abrogation of binding is engendered by an increase in polarity (V305T) within the receptor cavity surface that interacts 'face-on' with the aromatic ring of (<italic>p<sup>0</sup></italic>) tyrosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The N343S and N469S substitutions are particularly informative with respect to the specificity of Y-acidic peptides for the KLC1 isoform over KLC2. A sequence comparison between KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> and KLC2<sup>TPR</sup> highlights that the only two interface residues that differ between these isoform domains are KLC1 N343 and N469. These are naturally present as serine residues (S328 and S454, respectively) in KLC2 (highlighted by arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The structure shows that asparagines at these topological positions play a key role in maintaining the stability of the complex via H-bond interactions at positions <italic>p<sup>−5</sup></italic> and <italic>p<sup>−1</sup></italic> of the main chain cargo peptide. Our co-IP experiment shows that a substitution at either of these positions by a serine, thus imparting KLC2<sup>TPR</sup>-like properties, negatively affects the stability of the complex. To further probe the role of these residues in KLC1 specificity, we have generated KLC2<sup>TPR S328N</sup>, KLC2<sup>TPR S454N</sup>, and KLC2<sup>TPR S328,454N</sup> variants and used them in FP measurements to determine their affinity for TAMRA-JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). We find that both individual substitutions increase the affinity for the JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> peptide with S328N playing a main role (~37 fold increase in activity compared to KLC2<sup>TPR</sup>). Importantly, the KLC2<sup>TPR S328,454N</sup> double variant binds TAMRA-JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> with an affinity comparable to KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 1.29 μM) and the same is true for TAMRA-TorsinA<sup>C-term</sup> binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Therefore, residues N343 and N469 are entirely responsible for the specificity of Y-acidic motif for KLC1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Y-acidic and W-acidic motifs bind at partly overlapping sites on KLC<sup>TPR</sup> and are differentially affected by the presence of the LFP-acidic intramolecular region</title><p>We have previously solved the X-ray structure of KLC2<sup>TPR</sup> in complex with the SKIP<sup>WD</sup> W-acidic peptide, thus providing a structural basis for the recognition of this widespread adaptor motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pernigo et al., 2013</xref>). A comparative analysis with the structures presented here reveals that Y-acidic and W-acidic motifs are recognized by partly overlapping binding sites that are shifted with respect to each other along the inner channel generated by the TPR right-handed super-helical arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The W-acidic motif binds toward the N-terminal end of the channel with its critical tryptophan residue sandwiched between TPR2 and TPR3 while the Y-acidic motif is positioned more C-terminally with its key tyrosine residue stabilized by the interface between TPR3 and TPR4 approximately at the same location occupied by the SKIP<sup>WD</sup> leucine at (<italic>p</italic><sup>−2</sup>). Although W-acidic binding also occurs by an 'induced fit' mechanism, it elicits a more restrained closure of the receptor compared to Y-acidic binding, defined by smaller rotation (∼20.0˚) with respect to an alternative, more N-terminal, hinge axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Despite these differences, W-acidic and Y-acidic binding sites partly overlap and in agreement with this we find that an unlabeled SKIP<sup>WD</sup> peptide is able to specifically compete TAMRA-JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> binding in a concentration-dependent manner in our FP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The functional implication of this is that a single KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> is not expected to simultaneously engage both types of cargo adaptors. The partial separation of Y-acidic and W-acidic binding sites on KLC<sup>TPR</sup> has also a possible important functional consequence. We have solved previously the 4 Å-resolution structure of KLC2<sup>extTPR</sup>, an extended TPR featuring the conserved LFP-acidic region N-terminal to the KLC<sup>TPR</sup> domain that contributes to kinesin-1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yip et al., 2016</xref>). In this structure the KLC2<sup>TPR</sup> domain is in its 'open' (ligand-free) conformation and we could model a stretch five poly-Ala residues between helices α1, α3, α5 that likely defines the general location of the intramolecular LFP-acidic region. The poly-Ala peptide partly overlaps with the SKIP<sup>WD</sup> binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and consistent with this we found that a TAMRA-SKIP<sup>WD</sup> peptide binds in an FP assay with lower affinity to KLC2<sup>extTPR</sup> compared to KLC2<sup>TPR</sup> due to the inhibitory effect of the intramolecular LFP-acidic stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yip et al., 2016</xref>). We have now also measured the affinity of TAMRA-SKIP<sup>WD</sup> for KLC1<sup>extTPR</sup> and KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> and, like for KLC2, the presence of the LFP-acidic region significantly inhibits binding, in this case, by more than one order of magnitude (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> from 0.64 ± 0.02 μM to 8.20 ± 0.37 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast, TAMRA-JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> binds with a similar affinity to either KLC1<sup>extTPR</sup> (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 2.21 ± 0.06 μM) or KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 0.95 ± 0.09 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yip et al., 2016</xref>). A structural superposition between KLC1<sup>TPR</sup>-JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> and KLC2<sup>extTPR</sup> allows to rationalize the minimal impact that the LFP-acidic extension has on JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> binding. We observe that the KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> N-terminal domain rotation elicited by JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> binding is compatible with the presence of the poly-Ala peptide as no clashes are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This is largely due to the more advanced position along the inner KLC<sup>TPR</sup> cavity of this adaptor peptide compared to SKIP<sup>WD</sup>. Thus, although with the obvious limitation imposed by a poly-Ala model that does not allow to reveal the full range of possible intermolecular interactions, we suggest that while an intramolecular interaction with the LFP-acidic region is not compatible with SKIP<sup>WD</sup> binding, this might be of little or no interference with JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> loading.

An important region on the regulatory light chains that is often engaged by adaptors is their KLC<sup>TPR</sup> domain. TPR domains are found in a wide range of proteins and represent common platforms for protein-protein interactions (D'Andrea and Regan, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeytuni and Zarivach, 2012</xref>). Like some other repeat-containing proteins, such as leucine-rich-repeats and WD40s, TPR domains have been traditionally considered fairly rigid docking platforms that respond with limited conformational alterations to ligand binding, thus lending support to the view that they are essentially pre-organized architectures onto which specific ligand-binding residues are 'grafted' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cortajarena and Regan, 2006</xref>). Such a static view has been more recently mitigated by examples of TPR domains that undergo some conformational changes in response to protein-protein interactions. For example, a reduction of the solenoid super-helical pitch has been observed in the TPR domain of the Pex5p receptor in response to loading the peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stanley et al., 2006</xref>). Also, in the magnetosome-associated protein, MamA the N-terminal portion of its TPR domain undergoes a radial movement of ∼3° upon binding of a putative ligand imitator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zeytuni et al., 2011</xref>). Our crystallographic analysis of the recognition mechanism of Y-acidic motifs by KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> that extends our previous work on the recognition of W-acidic motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pernigo et al., 2013</xref>), strongly challenges the view of TPR motifs as rigid scaffolds. Instead, it portrays their strongly adaptive nature as binding of these motifs involves rotations of the N-terminal portion of the molecule of up to ∼30° with respect to alternative hinge axes. Overall, KLC<sup>TPR</sup> domains display the remarkable ability to employ inter-TPR repeats as separate 'compartments' to stabilize different peptide types in an isoform-specific manner.</p><p>While JIP1 is one of the best-established and most studied adaptors, the role for TorsinA in the context of kinesin-1-based transport is less clear. TorsinA, the founding member of the Torsin family, is a constitutively inactive AAA+ protein of medical importance as a three-base pair (ΔGAG) deletion that removes one of a pair of glutamic acid residues (Glu-302/303) in proximity of its C-terminus is linked to DYT1, a neurological disorder that leads to uncontrollable muscular movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ozelius et al., 1997</xref>). In cells, TorsinA is predominantly localized in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or nuclear envelope (NE) where its ATPase enzymatic activity requires the stimulation by one of two transmembrane cofactors, LAP1 (lamina associated polypeptide 1) or LULL1 (luminal domain like LAP1), via their luminal domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). However, the exact biological function of TorsinA and other family members is at present uncertain although they clearly play a role in the integrity of the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Laudermilch and Schlieker, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, wild-type TorsinA expressed in brain CAD cells has been found co-localized with endogenous KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> at the distal end of processes, whereas mutant TorsinA<sup>ΔGAG</sup> remained confined to the cell body thus opening the possibility that the wild-type protein undergoes anterograde transport along MTs possibly acting as a molecular chaperone regulating kinesin-1 activity and/or cargo binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kamm et al., 2004</xref>). This intriguing function would imply the existence of an endogenous TorsinA cytosolic pool that might be available to interact with kinesin-1. Indeed, the literature suggests that oxidative or heat-shock stresses can induce TorsinA translocation from the ER to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hewett et al., 2003</xref>). Our structural study shows that the C-terminus of TorsinA binds, like JIP1, preferentially to KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> with a similar low micromolar dissociation constant. In addition to the interaction with the Y-acidic core, KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> appears also perfectly poised to stabilize the additional negatively charged residue at position <italic>p</italic><sup>+3</sup> as well as the more divergent peptide region N-terminal of the Y-acidic core. These interactions define a rather robust molecular interface that, on the basis of structural considerations, warrants a deeper analysis of a possible functional role of TorsinA as a kinesin-1 adaptor/cargo. Interestingly, a comparison of the KLC1<sup>TPR</sup>-TorsinA<sup>C-term</sup> structure with that of the recently solved complex between the Torsin<sup>AAA+</sup> domain and its LULL1 activator reveals that the TorsinA<sup>C-term</sup> region can undergo a dramatic structural transition. The TorsinA<sup>C-term</sup> segment that is part of the Torsin<sup>AAA+</sup> domain folds into a α-helix in the complex with LULL1 playing a role in its stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demircioglu et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, TorsinA<sup>C-term</sup> assumes a completely extended conformation when in complex with KLC1<sup>TPR</sup>. This change in secondary structure is reminiscent of that undergone by the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the tubulin-like FtsZ upon binding to different regulatory proteins where the CTD folds into a α-helix when bound to the <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsZ-binding domain of ZipA and <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> FtsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mosyak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szwedziak et al., 2012</xref>) while it takes an extended conformation when bound to SlmA from <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic>, and <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schumacher and Zeng, 2016</xref>). This plasticity has been suggested to be important for the versatile recognition of different regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schumacher and Zeng, 2016</xref>). Similarly, it could be a mechanism utilized by TorsinA to select different partners, in this case, in alternative subcellular locations.</p><p>The role of cargo adaptors in kinesin-1 motor activation is a complex and an incompletely understood one. Remarkably, adaptors featuring W-acidic motifs appear to encode both motor recognition (via KLC<sup>TPR</sup> binding) and activation capacities. For example, an artificial transmembrane protein containing either of the two cytosolic W-acidic motifs of calsyntenin was shown to induce kinesin-1’s vesicular association and anterograde transport in a KLC-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawano et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, these motifs can also functionally substitute for homologous regions within the vaccinia virus KLC binding protein A36 and activate transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dodding et al., 2011</xref>) or when fused to LAMP1, promote lysosome transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pu et al., 2015</xref>). Differently, while the C-terminal Y-acidic region of JIP1 is sufficient to recruit KLC1 to vesicles, it is not able to activate transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawano et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, JIP1 requires interactions with the coiled-coil region of KHC and the KHC-tail binding protein FEZ1, or JIP3, a separate member of the JIP family, for full activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blasius et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hammond et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Satake et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, a clear cooperative role of JIP1 and JIP3 has been identified for the anterograde axonal transport of TrkB receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun et al., 2017</xref>), further supporting previous results that indicated that JIP1 and JIP3 are co-transported in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hammond et al., 2008</xref>). The structural results presented here in conjunction with our previous studies allow us to formulate some hypotheses as to why Y-acidic and W-acidic motifs induce different functional responses. Our previous work has demonstrated that binding of W-acidic motifs displaces an intramolecular interaction between the KLC<sup>TPR</sup> and the LFP-acidic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yip et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, binding of W-acidic motifs or disruption of the LFP-acidic intramolecular interaction triggers global changes in the KLC conformation, promotes kinesin-1 activity and results in an additional binding site on KHC-tail becoming accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yip et al., 2016</xref>). A key piece of data supporting this model is the observation that inclusion of the inhibitory LFP-containing sequence on KLC1/2<sup>TPR</sup> substantially reduces its affinity for W-acidic peptides. On the other hand, inclusion of the LFP-acidic sequence has very little effect on KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> affinity for the JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> Y-acidic peptide. This suggests that Y-acidic binding might co-exist with LFP-acidic binding and therefore cannot alone initiate this activation pathway. Two possibilities then present themselves – firstly, cooperative interactions with JIP3 serve to displace the LFP-acidic linker, driving the same activation pathway. Alternatively, the LFP-acidic linker remains bound and there is an as yet uncharacterized activation pathway triggered by JIP1/JIP3 binding that is more reliant on the additional direct adaptor interactions with KHC. Our ITC and mass spectrometry data suggest the possibility that could be driven by steric effects resulting from the JIP3<sup>LZ2</sup>-mediated dimerization of KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> within the kinesin-1 tetramer, a notion further substantiated by the recent publication of a KLC2<sup>TPR</sup>-JIP3<sup>LZ2</sup> structure that shows two TPR domains (in their ‘open’ conformation) symmetrically bound to the JIP3<sup>LZ2</sup> coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cockburn et al., 2018</xref>). However, our data strongly argue that a functional JIP1-JIP3 transport complex would have its TPR domains in their closed conformation induced by Y-acidic binding. Structural insight into ternary KLC1-JIP1-JIP3 complexes and the tetrameric kinesin-1 tail region will be required to fully address the question of co-operativity in kinesin-1-mediated transport.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning</title><p>Codon-optimized DNA sequences encoding the TPR domain of mouse KLC1 (residues 205 – 496, Uniprot Q5UE59, KLC1<sup>TPR</sup>) fused either to the C-terminal 11 amino acids of human JIP1 (residues 701 – 711, Uniprot Q9UQF2, JIP1<sup>C-term</sup>) or the C-terminal 12 amino acids of mouse TorsinA (residues 322 – 333, Uniprot Q9ER39, TorsinA<sup>C-term</sup>) linked via a (Thr-Gly-Ser)<sub>5 or 10</sub> flexible connector were purchased from Genscript and subcloned between the NdeI/XhoI sites of a pET28 vector (Novagen).

Kinesin-1 family members (Kif5A-C) exist as heterotetramers with kinesin light chains (KLC1-4). In this study, Pernigo et al. identify a recognition motif that is important for the interaction between KLC1 and a cargo adaptor (JIP1) and a candidate cargo (TorsinA). The authors describe a Y-acidic motif that, as opposed to the previously identified non-KLC isoform specific W-acidic motif, has a strong preference for KLC1 binding. The Y and W-acidic motifs are partially overlapping and adaptors that bind to these sites compete for interacting with the KLC1. This work is technically well executed and provides new information for how KLCs interact with adaptors or cargos. However, given previous work in the field, including studies from this group, I do not find the results presented here to be a significant enough advance to merit publishing in <italic>eLife</italic>. Journals that focus more on cell biology and the cytoskeleton would be a more appropriate venue for this work.</p><p>1) The argument suggesting that KLC1 specificity over KLC2 is due to the N to S substitutions at residues 343 and 469 is not fully convincing given the limited cellular validation. The authors mutate N343S and N469S in KLC1. Do the converse substitutions in KLC2 increase the Y-acidic motif binding affinity for KLC2? It would also be beneficial to characterize the change in binding affinities for the selected mutants as performed for the WT KCL1<sup>TPR</sup> and JIP1 peptide in Figure 1D.</p><p>2) The proposed model for how JIP1 and JIP3 cooperate to activate KLC1 is quite speculative. The data in which JIP1 peptide binding to the KLC1 TPR domain does not affect JIP3 binding affinity is not fully supportive of a cooperative function. The proposed dimerization mediated by KLC1 TPR and JIP3<sup>LZ2</sup> should also be further explored. The use of larger protein domains or full-length proteins might be beneficial to account for contributions from other regions of these proteins.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Pernigo, Dodding, Steiner and colleagues have identified a novel interaction motif, which they call &quot;Y-acidic,&quot; in JIP1 and TorsinA that enables binding specifically to KLC1 but not KLC2. Intriguingly, the Y-acidic motif binds to KLC1 in such a way that it does not interfere with the binding of peptides that affect KLC autoinhibition. This suggests that adaptors with a Y-acidic motif would not automatically trigger kinesin-1 activation, which is in contrast to adaptors with a W-acidic motif. Their Y-acidic-adaptor model is thought-provoking and appealing when considering mechanisms that coordinate cargo binding and motor activation. Overall, the manuscript is well written, and the data are clearly presented.</p><p>Some questions arise as the authors attempt to translate their structural observations into how the Y-acidic motif would mediate cellular functions (Figure 3D). In their IP experiments, to show that these KLC mutations are acting specifically, the authors should include a mutation that is not predicted to interfere with JIP1 binding. It would also be nice if they could introduce reciprocal mutations in JIP1 to directly test the Y-acidic motif. Similarly, can the authors mutate the KLC2 serines equivalent to N343 and N469 in KLC1 and cause KLC2 to bind JIP1? It would be nice if the authors could provide evidence via cell imaging that co-localization of KLC1 and JIP1 in cells is regulated by the Y-acidic motif, or at least that a cellular function is regulated by the Y-acidic motif mediating an interaction with KLC1/kinesin-1. As it stands, it is not clear whether this interaction may ultimately be redundant with other points of interaction between JIP1 and KLC/kinesin-1 in cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Pernigo et al. report the binding mode of adaptor proteins to the light chain of kinesin-1 (KLC). They have in particular determined the structure of the binding motif of Jip1 and of Torsin1, C-terminal peptides of about 10 residues, to the TPR domain of KLC1, allowing them to propose a mechanism for the specificity of these adaptors for KLC1 vs. KLC2. To crystallize these complexes, they used a fusion KLC1-peptide protein in addition to nanobodies as crystallization chaperones, an approach that is worth mentioning. And more generally, the structural results justify publishing in <italic>eLife</italic>. I have nevertheless several concerns which are listed below.</p><p>1) The dissociation constant of the complex of KLC1-TPR with the C-term peptide of Jip1 or of TorsinA is in the μM range. Yet the peptides interact quite extensively with KLC1 and one could have expected a higher affinity. The authors mention that the measured affinities are consistent with the results of Zhu et al. But can we exclude an interference of the TAMRA probe used in the fluorescence experiments? An orthogonal method, preferably using unlabeled peptides (e.g. by ITC), performed in the same lab with the exact same buffer and proteins, would ascertain the affinity values.</p><p>I note that many interactions are of electrostatic nature while the buffer used contains 150 mM NaCl. It is therefore possible that the ionic strength has a substantial effect on the affinity.</p><p>2) According to Figure 2B, the TPR binding surface is mostly basic. This is puzzling because the Jip1 C-term peptide contains several hydrophobic residues (in particular the IYL motif). At which level is the electrostatic potential depicted? The same remark applies also to Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and to the TorsinA peptide.</p><p>3) Figure 3C indicates that the C-term carboxyl group of Jip1 makes a salt bridge with KLC1. This point is rapidly mentioned in the text (subsection “KLC1<sup>TPR</sup>-Y-acidic peptide interface”, last paragraph) but not discussed further. It is striking that in both Jip1 and Torsin1 the interacting peptide includes the C-terminal of the protein, as is also the case of the PipB2 protein mentioned in the Discussion. This suggests that the C-term carboxyl contributes substantially to KLC binding. This point could be discussed further (and could be tested experimentally, using a carboxy C-term modified peptide in affinity experiments).</p><p>4) I am not an expert in ITC and I could be wrong, but the titration curve in Figure 5A seems weird to me and my understanding is that the first part of this titration curve was not used in the fitting curve. Is the experiment reproducible? For the least, an explanation is needed.</p><p>5) It is not clear what the goal of the MS experiment was and what could be concluded (Figure 5C). Do the authors suggest that TPR dimerization is mediated by JIP3<sup>LZ2</sup> dimer (according to the title of Figure 5)? The MS data are not consistent with this view, because a KLC1-Jip1 dimer is detected in the absence of JIP3<sup>LZ2</sup>. In addition, the authors propose that the N-term helix of the TPR domain may mediate KLC1 dimerization. An alternative hypothesis would be that the TPR-Jip1 construct dimerizes via the Jip1 peptide of one molecule that would interact 'in trans' with the TPR domain of another molecule. A control with a construct comprising the TPR domain alone would be welcome. Moreover, because the experiment is performed with an excess of TPR-Jip1 over JIP3<sup>LZ2</sup>, a 2-1 stoichiometry is not unexpected. It seems to me that a conclusion can hardly be drawn from these data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38362.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>We thank the reviewers and editors for the opportunity to submit a revised version of our manuscript by Pernigo et al. entitled 'Structural basis for isoform-specific kinesin1 recognition of Y-acidic cargo adaptors'.

In addition, a new reciprocal IP (IP for HA rather than FLAG) for R266S is presented in Figure 5A that further reinforces the specificity of assays used here. Finally, in new FP experiments, amidation of the JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> peptide to remove the carboxy group on the C-terminus eliminates the interaction (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) It is also worth highlighting here the recent study by Nguyen et al.

For example, in the first paper describing the JIP1-KLC1 interaction, the crucial tyrosine of the Y-acidic motif was shown to be required for the kinesin-1 dependent accumulation of JIP1 in neurite tips (Verhey et al., 2001, Figure 4-5). This was further substantiated in a later paper from the Verhey lab (Hammond et al., 2008) which examined co-operative transport of JIP1 and JIP3 and confirmed that the C-terminal/Y residue was required for efficient transport of the JIP1-JIP3 complex (Figure 7). Kawano et al., 2012 also confirmed that the C-terminal 11 amino acids of JIP1 were sufficient to recruit KLC1 to vesicles although not to activate kinesin dependent transport (Figure 7). Additionally, Satake et al., 2013 show by coIP and IF (Figure 1) that while full-length GFP-JIP1 accumulates at neurite tips in a kinesin-1 dependent manner, GFP-JIP1-dCT (dCT = delta C-terminus, lacking the final four amino acids that are an integral part of the Y-acidic motif) does not. GFPJIP1-dCT shows fluorescence intensity at the tips comparable to that of GFP alone. In this paper the GFP-JIP1-dCT construct is even used as a 'de facto' negative control to assess the relative impact of other JIP1 mutations on kinesin-1 recruitment. Although all the above references were already citied in the original submission we have further clarified in the revised text that an intact JIP1 C-terminus (containing the Y-acidic motif) is necessary (although not sufficient) for kinesin-1 transport mediated by KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> recruitment.</p><p>Experimentally, our new IP data presented in Figure 5A using full length JIP1 and JIP3 demonstrates that they interact co-operatively with KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> and, importantly, show its dependence on the Y-acidic interface as defined by the R266S mutation, further highlighting the importance of this interaction site. The discussion has been expanded to include further consideration of this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Pernigo et al. report the binding mode of adaptor proteins to the light chain of kinesin-1 (KLC).

I have nevertheless several concerns which are listed below.</p><p>1) The dissociation constant of the complex of KLC1-TPR with the C-term peptide of Jip1 or of TorsinA is in the μM range. Yet the peptides interact quite extensively with KLC1 and one could have expected a higher affinity. The authors mention that the measured affinities are consistent with the results of Zhu et al. But can we exclude an interference of the TAMRA probe used in the fluorescence experiments? An orthogonal method, preferably using unlabeled peptides (e.g. by ITC), performed in the same lab with the exact same buffer and proteins, would ascertain the affinity values.</p></disp-quote><p>At the request of this reviewer we have determined thermodynamic parameters for the binding of unlabelled JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> to KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> using ITC. The experiment was carried out at 500mM NaCl as KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> tends to precipitate in the cell at low salt concentration upon stirring. FP measurements at this NaCl concentration give <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 10.37 ± 0.45 µM and ITC measurements give <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 11.66 ± 1.85 µM. The two measurements are therefore entirely consistent with each other and confirm that the TAMRA label does not interfere with binding. The ITC data and relative thermodynamic parameters for this experiment are reported in a novel Figure 1—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I note that many interactions are of electrostatic nature while the buffer used contains 150 mM NaCl. It is therefore possible that the ionic strength has a substantial effect on the affinity.</p></disp-quote><p>The interaction between the KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> domain and Y-acidic peptides elucidated in this work and also that between KLC2<sup>TPR</sup> and W-acidic peptides studied in our previous work (Pernigo et al., 2013) has an electrostatic component (peptides are acidic and the concave surfaces of KLC<sup>TPR</sup> domains are positively charged). The effect of ionic strength of the interaction between KLC2<sup>TPR</sup> with and W-acidic peptides of the cargo adaptor SKIP was investigated to some extent in our 2013 paper. At the request of this reviewer we have now also explored the effect of varying NaCl concentrations for both the KCL1<sup>TPR</sup>-JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> and KLC1<sup>TPR</sup>-TorsinA<sup>C-term</sup> interactions. In the case of KCL1<sup>TPR</sup>-JIP1<sup>C-term</sup>, <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values are 0.48 ± 0.06 µM and 10.37 ± 0.45 µM at [NaCl] = 85 and 500 mM, respectively, while for KCL1<sup>TPR</sup>TAMRA-TorsinA<sup>C-term</sup><italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values are 1.23 ± 0.10 µM and 29.9 ± 2.8 µM at the same NaCl concentrations, respectively. Therefore, as expected from our previous work, there is an electrostatic component to the binding. Our choice of [NaCl]=150mM for most FP measurements allows for high affinity interactions while minimising KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> precipitation. All FP measurements at varying NaCl concentrations are now presented in a novel Figure 1—figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) According to Figure 2B, the TPR binding surface is mostly basic. This is puzzling because the Jip1 C-term peptide contains several hydrophobic residues (in particular the IYL motif). At which level is the electrostatic potential depicted? The same remark applies also to Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and to the TorsinA peptide.</p></disp-quote><p>We used consistent threshold values (+10<italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub>T/e (blue) to -10<italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub>T/e (red)) to depict the electrostatic potential in all surface representations. As mentioned in our reply to the previous point and consistent with this reviewer's suggestion the binding does contain an electrostatic component. Therefore we consider not too puzzling that the overall character of the receptor surface is basic given the overall acidic nature of the cargo adaptor peptides. Threshold values are now explicitly mentioned in the relevant figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3C indicates that the C-term carboxyl group of Jip1 makes a salt bridge with KLC1. This point is rapidly mentioned in the text (subsection “KLC1<sup>TPR</sup>-Y-acidic peptide interface”, last paragraph) but not discussed further. It is striking that in both Jip1 and Torsin1 the interacting peptide includes the C-terminal of the protein, as is also the case of the PipB2 protein mentioned in the Discussion. This suggests that the C-term carboxyl contributes substantially to KLC binding. This point could be discussed further (and could be tested experimentally, using a carboxy C-term modified peptide in affinity experiments).</p></disp-quote><p>Both Jip1 and TorsinA use their carboxy termini in the interaction with KLC1<sup>TPR</sup>.</p><p>The suggestion by this reviewer to use a C-term modified peptide is an excellent one. To this end we have synthesized a modified TAMRA-JIP1<sup>C-term</sup> featuring C-terminal amidation. We find that a free carboxylic group in JIP1 is absolutely required for the interaction. This piece of data is now presented in a novel Figure 3—figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I am not an expert in ITC and I could be wrong, but the titration curve in Figure 5A seems weird to me and my understanding is that the first part of this titration curve was not used in the fitting curve. Is the experiment reproducible? For the least, an explanation is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The first part of the titration shown in Figure 5A (Figure 5D in the revised figure) was also used for fitting and it is not a question of reproducibility. The reason why the height of the first portion of this thermogram is different is because we used a smaller injection volume compared to subsequent ones in an attempt to better sample the initial portion of the curve. We have now mentioned this explicitly in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is not clear what the goal of the MS experiment was and what could be concluded (Figure 5C). Do the authors suggest that TPR dimerization is mediated by JIP3<sup>LZ2</sup> dimer (according to the title of Figure 5)? The MS data are not consistent with this view, because a KLC1-Jip1 dimer is detected in the absence of JIP3<sup>LZ2</sup>. In addition, the authors propose that the N-term helix of the TPR domain may mediate KLC1 dimerization. An alternative hypothesis would be that the TPR-Jip1 construct dimerizes via the Jip1 peptide of one molecule that would interact 'in trans' with the TPR domain of another molecule. A control with a construct comprising the TPR domain alone would be welcome. Moreover, because the experiment is performed with an excess of TPR-Jip1 over JIP3<sup>LZ2</sup>, a 2-1 stoichiometry is not unexpected. It seems to me that a conclusion can hardly be drawn from these data.</p></disp-quote><p>The main purpose of the experiment was to provide an orthogonal observation of the stoichiometry of two KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> bound to the JIP3<sup>LZ2</sup> coiled-coil dimer suggested by the ITC experiment. The MS data indeed show a complex of this stoichiometry. While our manuscript was under revision Cockburn et al. have published the crystal structure of the KLC2<sup>TPR</sup>-JIP3<sup>LZ2</sup> complex that is entirely consistent with our observations. Given the availability of this new crystal structure we have moved our MS data to the supplementary information (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) and added the relevant reference to the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
