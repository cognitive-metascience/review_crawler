neuronal implementation is not known. For example, a problem in vision, how the eye detects image motion, has long been analysed using Hassenstein-Reichardt (HR) detector or Barlow-Levick (BL) models. These both simulate motion detection well, but the exact neuronal circuits undertaking these tasks remain elusive. We reconstructed a comprehensive connectome of the circuits of <italic>Drosophila</italic>‘s motion-sensing T4 cells using a novel EM technique. We uncover complex T4 inputs and reveal that putative excitatory inputs cluster at T4’s dendrite shafts, while inhibitory inputs localize to the bases. Consistent with our previous study, we reveal that Mi1 and Tm3 cells provide most synaptic contacts onto T4. We are, however, unable to reproduce the spatial offset between these cells reported previously. Our comprehensive connectome reveals complex circuits that include candidate anatomical substrates for both HR and BL types of motion detectors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24394.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24394.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>motion vision</kwd><kwd>connectomics</kwd><kwd>elementary motion detector</kwd><kwd>T4 cell</kwd><kwd>optic lobe</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takemura</surname><given-names>Shin-ya</given-names></name><name><surname>Nern</surname><given-names>Aljoscha</given-names></name><name><surname>Chklovskii</surname><given-names>Dmitri B</given-names></name><name><surname>Scheffer</surname><given-names>Louis K</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubin</surname><given-names>Gerald M</given-names></name><name><surname>Meinertzhagen</surname><given-names>Ian A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DIS-0000065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meinertzhagen</surname><given-names>Ian A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Connectomic analysis identifies the complex circuits of a visual motion-sensing neuron that qualify them to generate direction-selective motion sensing signals using both Hassenstein-Reichardt and Barlow-Levick models.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A classic problem in visual neuroscience, how the visual system detects image motion, has recently undergone resurgent interest in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

Both models compare two visual inputs separated in time and space and simulate motion detection well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haag et al., 2016</xref>). However, the exact neural mechanism underlying the detection of direction by motion-sensing cells is still understood only imperfectly.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24394.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Visual motion-detection pathways and circuits in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Diagrams of two major predicted models of motion detection: (<bold>A</bold>) the Hassenstein-Reichardt (HR) and (<bold>B</bold>) Barlow-Levick (BL) type.

These cells respond to visual motion in a directionally-selective manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>), and have four subtypes, T4a-T4d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>). Each subtype is tuned to one of four cardinal directions of stimulus motion, front-to-back (T4a), back-to-front (T4b), upward (T4c) and downward (T4d) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>), approximately one each per unit column of the medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mauss et al., 2014</xref>). Each in turn projects its terminal to a specific stratum, one of four in the motion-sensing fourth neuropile, the lobula plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). There, T4 signals from hundreds of columns sum to generate wide-field motion responses in target, directionally-selective tangential cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borst et al., 2010</xref>), aided by various lobula plate interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mauss et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>How do T4 cells compute the direction of motion? A recent connectomic study using serial-section EM (ssEM) identified two medulla cell types, Mi1 and Tm3, as the direct pathways between L1 and T4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>). Detailed analyses revealed that the weighted centre of the Mi1-mediated receptive field is displaced from that of the Tm3-mediated subfield, and that the direction of displacement between the two subfields aligns in ~70% of cases with T4’s preferred direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>). Electrophysiological recordings demonstrate a temporal offset between the responses of the two cell types: Mi1 exhibits a peak light response later than that in Tm3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behnia et al., 2014</xref>), although the time difference (~15 ms) is probably too small to account for T4’s measured temporal frequency optimum of ~1 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>). The direction of spatial offsets from Tm3 to Mi1, generally consistent with T4’s preferred direction, matches the requirements of non-delay and delay input channels of a BL-type detector.</p><p>Despite this evidence, there are multiple indications that Mi1 and Tm3 inputs are not the only players in T4’s motion detection. First, a BL-type detector requires Mi1 and Tm3 inputs to T4 to have different signs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); this is not supported by available neurotransmitter information (see below). Second, whereas each T4 dendrite is orientated primarily in a direction aligned with its directional preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>), Mi1 and Tm3 synapses on those dendrites are distributed with substantial overlap. Third, although recent experiments confirm a general role for Mi1 in ON-motion detection, they suggest that Tm3 is required for responses only to fast-motion stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ammer et al., 2015</xref>), so that other inputs must be active under slow-motion stimulus conditions.</p><p>Here, we use a superior EM technique to reconstruct T4 cells and their presynaptic partners, and provide a comprehensive anatomical view of this critical step in fly motion vision. Our results suggest new candidate circuits for motion detection, including previously unidentified inhibitory pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Medulla connectome reconstruction using Focussed Ion-Beam milling Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIBSEM)</title><p>To reconstruct T4’s input circuits comprehensively we used a new method of focussed ion-beam milling scanning electron microscopy (FIBSEM), which enabled a more comprehensive dense connectome with greater accuracy (see Methods).

Secondarily, we benefit from greater image quality of FIBSEM.

In addition, a T4 cell also connects reciprocally to other T4s in neighbouring columns. Only very few synapses onto T4s were from other cell types or could not be identified: an Mi10 neuron makes a few input synapses (~0.6%), with the remaining 3.1% from several unidentified profiles that left the reconstructed volume, each contacting a T4 at ≤3 synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). At least some of these unidentified synapses are likely to be from branches of other T4s that reside outside the imaged region. We therefore reason that our dense FIBSEM reconstruction captures all input cell types to T4 and is now reliably definitive.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24394.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Distributions of synaptic inputs onto T4.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Counts of synaptic inputs to T4s from each class of input neuron from neighbouring columns are shown in the corresponding hexagonal array.

With ssEM, we densely reconstructed a single medulla column, but applied additional tracing of L1 and Tm3 cells in 18 surrounding columns. This was possible because we collected the original TEM images from thin sections that covered a much larger area than the cropped image series used to reconstruct the single column. The FIBSEM dataset used in the current study is superior to ssEM in the comprehensiveness of the dense reconstruction it supports, but was limited to seven medulla columns (Home and its six neighbors) contained wholly within the imaged volume. We thus lacked complete access to any columns beyond this FIB-imaged volume.

For each Mi1 and Tm3, we found a field centre of L1 connections, assumed to originate from within a regular hexagonal grid, weighted by their respective synapse counts as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>. Then, for each T4, the Mi1 and Tm3 field centres were calculated, also weighted by their respective synapse counts. The Tm3 to Mi1 offset is plotted in x,y dimensions, with Mi1 at 0, 0, where 1.0 represents the distance between two adjacent ommatidia. A significant limitation is that most Tm3 cells extend beyond the FIB-imaged volume and hence are not fully reconstructed. The eight Tm3s that feed the 'fb' T4, for example, have an estimated completeness of 100, 100, 94, 85, 72, 61, 49, and 42%. Given this incompleteness we compute 'raw' displacements (from the partial cells) and 'adjusted' displacements, using estimates of completeness supplemented by the locations for input connections. While the direction and magnitude of these offsets are roughly within the previously reported range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>), no consistent alignment with a T4’s directional sensitivity is observed. However, the errors are large, as shown by the difference between 'raw' and 'adjusted' values, and given only one fully reconstructed T4 for each direction no statistics are possible. Thus, we can neither confirm nor refute the previously reported displacements between Mi1 and Tm3 field centres.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24394.008">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24394.008</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-24394-fig4-figsupp2-v3"/></fig><fig id="fig4s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24394.009</object-id><label>Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>Synaptic inputs to T4 cells in Column E.</title><p>Left: Four subtypes of T4 cells each with dendrites orientated primarily in a single direction.

Likewise, Tm3 synapses appear to distribute evenly over the T4 dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, while Mi1 cells can be readily assigned to specific columns, Tm3s occupy more variable positions in the column periphery, and cannot be so assigned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Calculating anatomical receptive fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>), is also limited because wide collaterals of Tm3 cells in strata M1 and M5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) extend beyond the 7-column region. The reconstructed Tm3s therefore receive some input from columns not contained in the FIBSEM image stack used here and which we therefore could not trace. This limits the accuracy with which potential spatial offsets between Tm3 and other cell types could be determined (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref> and Discussion).</p><p>Inputs to T4 from Mi4 and Mi9 are noticeably segregated from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>). Significantly, Mi9’s input synapses always cluster at the tips of the T4 dendrites while Mi4’s inputs localize to their bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Inputs from other T4 cells also clustered towards T4’s dendrite tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The T4-T4 synapses showed striking subtype selectivity connecting with cells with the same direction preference, apparently qualifying a group of T4s to signal each other about a particular stimulus direction. This subtype selectivity was observed without exception in every T4-T4 contact. The retinotopic positions of the presynaptic T4s lie relative to the postsynaptic T4 in a direction opposite to the cell’s preferred direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>Like Mi4, C3 and CT1 also made synapses at the bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Even though CT1 is a wide-field neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), its connections are displaced from the Mi1 centre in a manner very similar to that of Mi4 and C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that each columnar arbour may serve a local computational role. We therefore counted each column’s CT1 arbour as a separate unit per column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Finally, TmY15 is presynaptic to T4s with a branching arbour extending more widely than the 7-column area in stratum M10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have reconstructed three TmY15 cells in the 7-column volume, of which two are only partial, suggesting that this cell type is distributed less frequently than one cell per column.

Our findings reveal potential substrates for both BL- and HR-type motion detectors. A recent imaging study reported that T4 cells indeed use both HR model preferred-direction enhancement and BL model null-direction suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haag et al., 2016</xref>). Which individual inputs onto T4’s dendrites fulfill the requirements for enhancement and suppression of directional selectivity? Of the synaptic inputs to T4 that are anatomically qualified to serve as two channels of a motion detector, several could support BL motion detectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). First, inputs from Mi4, C3 and CT1 onto T4’s dendrite bases, which could form one input channel, are putatively inhibitory and therefore opposite in sign to excitatory input from Mi1 and Tm3 which could form another channel. Second, the vectors of physiological direction preference of each T4, as inferred from dendrite orientation, match those measured in a direction from excitatory inputs (dendrite shaft, Mi1/Tm3) to inhibitory inputs (dendrite base, Mi4/C3/CT1) in accordance with a BL motion detector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Third, the inhibitory inputs arrive via a di- or trisynaptic pathway from L1, via L5 or Mi1 and others (e.g. L1→L5→Mi4→T4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> in ref 16). By contrast, putatively excitatory inputs from Mi1 and Tm3 onto T4’s dendrite shafts are monosynaptic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggesting a possible time delay between excitatory and inhibitory channels, but one that would be too short alone to account for the temporal frequency optimum in T4 cells of about 1 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Among the potential inputs that could serve as HR motion detectors we first consider Mi1 and Tm3, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>). A role for these cells in T4’s motion computation has been confirmed: Mi1 block flies are motion blind to ON-edge stimuli, while Tm3 input is specifically required to detect fast ON-edge motion in the preferred direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ammer et al., 2015</xref>). The polarities of transmission at both Mi1 and Tm3 inputs are likely to be the same because both appear to use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. In fact, a recent calcium imaging study has shown an enhanced T4 response when both cells are activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Strother et al., 2017</xref>). Thus Mi1 and Tm3 could function as two excitatory input channels in an HR EMD circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), potentially depending on visual stimulus conditions such as different visual contrasts or velocities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ammer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>This interpretation, however, runs counter to two features. First, assuming the measured directions of receptive field offsets between Mi1 and Tm3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>), the relative timing of the two inputs recorded by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behnia et al. (2014)</xref> is contrary to that in an HR EMD. Moreover, the magnitude of the spatial offset itself appears to be very small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borst and Helmstaedter, 2015</xref>). While our new data do not deny a role for Mi1 and Tm3 cells in motion detection, uncertainties in the direction of their small anatomical offsets (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) do make it difficult to uphold our previous conclusion that these offsets provide the core of an EMD.</p><p>Two additional input cell types, Mi9 and T4-T4 connections, that make synapses onto the leading edges of T4’s dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and E</xref>) could also function as excitatory input channels of an HR model. In this case they would work together with Mi1 and/or Tm3, qualified by their substantial spatial offsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, possible roles of Mi9 depend on two properties of this cell type: the sign of the glutamatergic synapses and the nature of its light response – Mi9 might respond to OFF rather than ON-stimuli, with main synaptic input from L3 and Mi4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Indeed recent imaging results indicate that Mi9 does respond to OFF stimuli and is likely to provide inhibitory input to T4 dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Strother et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenz et al., 2017</xref>). T4-T4 synapses are also qualified to contribute to an HR mechanism: input from other T4s is spatially offset against the cells’ preferred direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and predicted to be delayed since an additional synapse is involved (e.g. Mi1→T4→T4 vs Mi1→T4). However, blocking T4’s synaptic outputs does not abolish directionally selective responses in T4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haag et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that a mechanism based on T4-T4 synapses would, at least under some conditions, have to act in parallel with others. Such parallel contributions of several T4 input pathways could, for example, serve to broaden the T4 response curve for: stimulus velocity, which peaks at a temporal frequency of ~1 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>); or the range of stimulus modalities, for example to different light intensities or stimuli of differing spectral composition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we report the complete set of input cell types to direction-selective T4 cells, and reveal that these circuits are anatomically qualified to implement direction selectivity using both HR model preferred-direction enhancement and BL model null-direction suppression, as has indeed recently been reported from imaging studies in both T4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haag et al., 2016</xref>) and T5 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leong et al., 2016</xref>). While not precluding the contribution of specific inputs to directional selectivity, synaptic inhibition from specific medulla cells could also be required for other reasons, and could function to signal something entirely different. For example, in addition to acting locally, CT1 is anatomically qualified to modulate the gain of T4 and T5 neurons in response to overall levels of motion.

First, the medulla region of interest (ROI) was identified, which contained seven medulla columns. The image set of the ROI was then divided into 234 smaller overlapping cubes, each 5 × 5 × 5 µm (for a total reconstructed volume of ~30,000 µm<sup>3</sup>). In each cube, presynaptic T-bar ribbons were first detected automatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plaza et al., 2014</xref>) and then annotated by hand with Raveler, along with corresponding postsynaptic sites. Manual annotation took a total of ~6000 person-hours to identify both pre- and postsynaptic sites, with 8–10 proofreaders working in parallel on different non-overlapping subsets of cubes. Next, a watershed algorithm was applied to the pixel-wise predictions to generate the initial over-segmentation of the volume. The over-fragmented volume was then refined using a context-aware two-stage agglomeration framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parag et al., 2015</xref>) to produce the final segmentation. The segmentation was improved through a manual process of ‘focussed’ proofreading in which we concentrated on the divisions between cells that are both biologically improbable and that produce important 3D neuron shapes, especially if these be doubtful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plaza et al., 2012</xref>). An additional inspection centred on features thought improbable, such as ‘orphan’ fragments that failed to touch the surface of any cube. This manual proofreading took a total of ~4000 person-hours, with 8–10 proofreaders working simultaneously on different non-overlapping subsets of cubes. The cubes were then stitched together using a combination of automatic and manual operations. Neuron 3D reconstructions were generated with software NeuTu-EM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/janelia-flyem/NeuTu/tree/flyem_release">https://github.com/janelia-flyem/NeuTu/tree/flyem_release</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>], with a copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/NeuTu">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/NeuTu</ext-link>), in which we examined synaptic locations and distributions, and T4’s dendrite orientations. Neuron reconstructions were closely examined for proofreading errors. Cell types of reconstructed neurons were identified by comparing the shapes of their arbours with the shapes of previously reported neuron reconstructions and from light microscopy. Connectivity matrices were generated by combining the results of neuron reconstructions with those for synapse mappings. The plots of spatial offsets for the columnar inputs (Mi4, Mi9, C3, and CT1) were calculated as the centre of mass of locations weighted by synapse count of the associated column in an ideal hexagonal array, referenced to the centre of the same calculation for Mi1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Genetics, immunohistochemistry and light microscopy</title><p>Gal4 or Split-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>) driver lines used to visualize T4 input neurons were, SS02432 (R48A07AD, VT046779DBD) (Mi9), SS01019 (R48A07AD; R13F11DBD) (Mi4), SS00809 (R19F01AD; R71D01DBD) (Mi1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Strother et al., 2017</xref>), R26H09AD; R29G11DBD (C3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tuthill et al., 2013</xref>), SS01001 (R65E11AD; R20C09DBD) (CT1) and VT048653 (TmY15).

For these experiments, fly brains were dissected in PBS, fixed in 2% (v/v) PFA (prepared from a 20% stock solution, Electron Microscopy Sciences, #15713) in PBS for 1 hr, washed with PBT (0.5% v/v TX-100 in PBS), incubated with PBT-NGS (PBT with 5% v/v Normal Goat Serum) for 30 min and then incubated for ~2 days with primary antibodies (anti-GAD1 1:1000 dilution or anti-VGlut 1:5000 and anti-ChAT 1:50) in PBT-NGS on a nutator at 4°C, followed by further washes with PBT and incubation with secondary antibodies (DyLight 649 AffiniPure Donkey anti Rabbit IgG (H+L), Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., #711-495-152,1:300 dilution and DyLight 549 AffiniPure Donkey anti Mouse IgG (H+L), Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc #715-505-151, 1:300 dilution) in PBT-NGS for ~2 days. After additional washes, brains were mounted in SlowFade Gold antifade (ThermoFisher Scientific) under a no. 1.5 coverslip using small amounts of modeling clay as flexible spacers. Brains were imaged with the anterior brain surface towards the coverslip, except C3 cells, which were imaged from the posterior to favour their different cell body locations. Native fluorescence was used to detect the GFP marker in these experiments. Images were acquired on an LSM 710 confocal microscope with a 63 × 1.4 NA objective. With the exception of the anti-GAD1 labeling of Mi9 and Tm3, all images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> with labeling of a given neurotransmitter marker show brains processed together in the same tube. However, the labeled brains were mounted and imaged individually with some specimen specific adjustments of laser power and gain, and/or of brightness and contrast post-imaging. Multiple specimens were examined for each cell type with similar results. For CT1, 12/12 cells from six brains showed GAD1 immunoreactivity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Data access</title><p>Our 7-column medulla raw data have been published on the Janelia/Howard Hughes Medical Institute website, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://emdata.janelia.org/">http://emdata.janelia.org/</ext-link>#/repo/medulla7column.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the contributions and support of all members of the Janelia FlyEM project and proofreaders in the Meinertzhagen lab, as well as members of the Janelia FlyLight project for assistance in generating some of the light microscopy data.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The comprehensive connectome of a neural substrate for 'ON' motion detection in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Alexander Borst (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Karl Fischbach (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>There are two principles to extract the direction of motion: enhancement of excitation in the preferred direction (Hassenstein &amp; Reichardt model, HR) and suppression of excitation in the null direction (Barlow-Levick model, BL). Recent papers have shown that both movement detection mechanisms (HR &amp; BL) do not exclude each other but work together to shape motion sensitivity in T4 and T5 cells. T4 cells inside the 10th layer of the fly's medulla and the sibling T5 cells in the 1st lobula layer are known to be the most peripheral directionally sensitive columnar neurons in the optic lobe of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. There exist 4 T4 and T5 subtypes (a-d) per column, one for forward, one for backward, one for up, and one for down movement. T4 and T5 are representatives of two separate motion sensitive pathways, the L1-ON pathway and the L2-Off pathway respectively.</p><p>Takemura et al. use FIBSEM to reconstruct the synaptic inputs to direction selective neurons in the fly visual system. They provide what appears to be a fairly comprehensive accounting of the numbers and spatial distributions of synapses from eight presynaptic cell types onto 4 different T4 subtypes. In particular, the authors identify many more synapses compared to their previous EM study of this circuit, demonstrating that the superior resolution of FIBSEM was essential to accurately quantifying synaptic connectivity. While some input neurons like Mi1 and Tm3 make contact to the central location of the dendrite, irrespective of the preferred direction of the T4 cell, other input neurons switch their location on the T4-cell dendrite depending on the directional tuning of the specific T4-subtype, e.g. Mi9 and other T4 cells on the 'null-side' and Mi4, C3 and CT1 on the 'preferred-side'. In summary, the work represents an outstanding and important contribution which will form the basis of many forthcoming functional studies to unravel the cellular mechanisms of motion vision in the fly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Here are the following major concerns:</p><p>1) The biggest problem is how to deal with this work's predecessor, Takemura et al., 2013, where the same authors had found a spatial offset between Mi1 and Tm3 that goes along with the preferred direction of the T4-subtype, and consequently had stated: 'We identified Mi1 and Tm3 inputs to T4 neurons as the two arms of a candidate correlation-based motion detector.' The new data set is unable to confirm this previous finding but brings up new cell types that clearly switch their contact site with the directional tuning of T4-subtypes. These new cell types had been a) missed or underestimated with respect to their number of contacts before, and b) not seen to switch position on the dendrite in a directional selective way. There appear to be two major reasons why the previous report was incomplete and misleading: first, the anisotropic resolution with 50 nm along the Z-axis only allowed about 50% of the T4 input synapses to be identified, and second, the 2013 paper densely reconstructed only a single column. This latter fact comes as a surprise because the previous report had stated: 'We therefore decided to reconstruct all the synaptic connections among neurons within a single reference column, as well as all the connections between the reference column and neurons within six nearest-neighbour columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).' This point weighs much more severely, because it introduced a systematic error, leaving out those cells that contact T4-cells in the neighboring columns and provide the spatial offset needed for the computation of motion direction. The current paper, thus, contains two major revisions: a) the previous offset between Mi1 and Tm3 cannot be confirmed, b) new cell types are found that show the required spatial offset. While the current paper addresses these critical points at several locations and qualifies the previous data accordingly, they don't do so consequently and are trying to rescue the previous hypothesis. The authors should make these statements most visibly and clear-cut in the Abstract, e.g. by saying: 'Consistent with our previous study, Mi1 and Tm3 form the two most frequent input synapses on T4 cells. We are, however, unable to reproduce the spatial offset between these cells reported earlier which lead to the proposal that they form the two arms of the motion detector. ' This is the cleanest way to deal with the problem. It is especially important since the previous paper caused strong resonance within and outside the <italic>Drosophila</italic> community, was heavily cited (more than 160 within the 3 years after its appearance), and served as the basis for several subsequent studies.</p><p>2) Related to this point, I don't understand, in principle, how a given offset between the receptive fields of Mi1 and Tm3 can give rise to direction selectivity to all four T4 cells within this column: if the offset is along the PD for the T4a cell, it would be in the ND for the T4b cell. The only way this can be done is by differently weighing the synaptic input from Mi1 and Tm3 across the dendrite of T4a versus T4b cells, irrespective of any potential offset between the receptive fields of Mi1 and Tm3. The data of respective synaptic input sites on the T4 cell dendrites have been collected and reveal no offset that goes along with the direction selectivity of the T4 cells. Thus, the previous statement cannot only be not confirmed but also be firmly refuted.</p><p>3) The data about Tm3 and TmY15 belong to the main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>, and not to the supplement. Then, the same scale should be used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> for all the different cell types. Also, since <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref> represent the main findings of this study in a nice and comprehensive way, they should be given more space.</p><p>4) The immuno-stainings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> are incomplete with respect to (1) cell types (only 5 cell types are shown!), (2) transmitters (only GABAergic and cholinergic neurons are tested), as well as (3) with respect to the various proteins indicative for the respective transmitter (for GABA-ergic neurons, one should stain with abs against the GABA, GAD and the VGAT, for cholinergic neurons, one should also stain with abs against VAChT, etc pp.). This paper is about connectivity, and the treatment of the transmitter types in this supplement is rather cursory, compared to the analysis of the connectivity. The authors should at least try to provide immuno-stainings against ChAT and GAD1 for all input cells.</p><p>5) The finding that the anatomy allows for implementation of BL as well as of HR functionality, is not surprising as both functions have been shown to exist in parallel in functional studies. This is mentioned by the authors, but I suggest that they shape their discussion starting from that point and ask which components could fulfill which task. To me the discussion still reads as if the authors are looking for a decision which model holds true.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24394.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Here are the following major concerns:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The biggest problem is how to deal with this work's predecessor, Takemura et al., 2013, where the same authors had found a spatial offset between Mi1 and Tm3 that goes along with the preferred direction of the T4-subtype, and consequently had stated: 'We identified Mi1 and Tm3 inputs to T4 neurons as the two arms of a candidate correlation-based motion detector.'

' This is the cleanest way to deal with the problem. It is especially important since the previous paper caused strong resonance within and outside the Drosophila community, was heavily cited (more than 160 within the 3 years after its appearance), and served as the basis for several subsequent studies.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is correct that the present paper failed to confirm the spatial offset between the receptive subfields of Mi1 and Tm3 that we had reported earlier in our 2013 paper. We recognize and have tried to deal with this point carefully in the main text as well as several supplemental figures. We agree with the reviewer that the Abstract should also mention this point. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we therefore revised the Abstract as follows:</p><p>“Analysing computations in neural circuits often uses simplified models because the actual neuronal implementation is not known. For example, a problem in vision, how the eye detects image motion, has long been analysed using Hassenstein-Reichardt (HR) detector or Barlow-Levick (BL) models.[…] Our comprehensive connectome reveals complex circuits that include candidate anatomical substrates for both HR and BL types of motion detectors.”</p><p><italic>2) Related to this point, I don't understand, in principle, how a given offset between the receptive fields of Mi1 and Tm3 can give rise to direction selectivity to all four T4 cells within this column: if the offset is along the PD for the T4a cell, it would be in the ND for the T4b cell. The only way this can be done is by differently weighing the synaptic input from Mi1 and Tm3 across the dendrite of T4a versus T4b cells, irrespective of any potential offset between the receptive fields of Mi1 and Tm3. The data of respective synaptic input sites on the T4 cell dendrites have been collected and reveal no offset that goes along with the direction selectivity of the T4 cells. Thus, the previous statement cannot only be not confirmed but also be firmly refuted.</italic> </p><p>We completely understand the reviewer’s concern, and the reviewer is correct that our previous statement is not confirmed by the current study. The current FIBSEM dataset has allowed us to trace synaptic connections in a 7-column volume with unprecedented accuracy. However, because of the different methods used, it was not possible to trace outside the etched volume using FIBSEM as we were able to do for the previous ssEM analysis, in which we could sparsely trace additional neurites beyond a single column (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A). Because of this limitation, we have no access to synapses from L1 to Tm3 that occur in the distal medulla outside the FIB-imaged volume. Unlike Mi1, Tm3 cells are multicolumnar and thus receive synaptic inputs from L1s that belong to columns lying beyond even the 7-column volume. Insofar as there is no obvious other way to assign Tm3 cells to specific columns by anatomical means (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), these synapses are required because calculating the preciseTm3-mediated receptive subfield for each T4 subtype is the only way to determine offsets between Tm3 and other cell types. This is different for unicolumnar neurons such as Mi1, which can be matched to a column unambiguously even without such detailed calculation. Despite this fact, we attempted to see the spatial offset between Mi1 and Tm3 using all the available data, but we can neither confirm nor refute the displacements between Mi1 and Tm3 field centers (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B). So, regrettably we cannot make any conclusion whether the spatial displacement between the receptive fields of Mi1 and Tm3 exists or not. We tried to explain this point thoroughly in the text (subsection “Spatial offset between different inputs distributed over T4 dendrites”).</p><p><italic>3) The data about Tm3 and TmY15 belong to the main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>, and not to the supplement. Then, the same scale should be used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> for all the different cell types. Also, since <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref> represent the main findings of this study in a nice and comprehensive way, they should be given more space.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> has been moved to Figure 3—figure supplement 1 so that two panels B and C could be expanded. The sizes of panels C-E have not been changed, to enable the synaptic puncta to continue to be visualized clearly.</p><p>For the reviewer’s first point, let us explain the reason why we have not included the synapse plots of Tm3 and TmY15. The five input cell types in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) are all unicolumnar cells, and hence can be explicitly assigned to their associated columns. However, as also explained in our response to point 2 above, Tm3 and TmY15 are multicolumnar neurons that give no clue as to the exact column to which we should assign them. We therefore have no compatible way to plot their synaptic counts into the same hexagonal array (also because of the lack of access to the upstream input synapses as mentioned above). The plots of spatial offsets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> were calculated based upon the weighted synapse counts of the associated columns in the hexagonal array. Therefore the receptive field centres of Tm3 and TmY15 cannot be calculated in the same way as for other input neurons. Although we lacked several of those significant synaptic inputs, we have tried to see if the spatial offset between Mi1 and Tm3 can be seen in the new reconstruction of FIBSEM according to the method we used previously (Takemura et al., 2013). We can, however, neither confirm nor refute the previously reported displacements between Mi1 and Tm3 field centres (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B).</p><p><italic>4) The immuno-stainings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> are incomplete with respect to (1) cell types (only 5 cell types are shown!), (2) transmitters (only GABAergic and cholinergic neurons are tested), as well as (3) with respect to the various proteins indicative for the respective transmitter (for GABA-ergic neurons, one should stain with abs against the GABA, GAD and the VGAT, for cholinergic neurons, one should also stain with abs against VAChT, etc pp.). This paper is about connectivity, and the treatment of the transmitter types in this supplement is rather cursory, compared to the analysis of the connectivity. The authors should at least try to provide immuno-stainings against ChAT and GAD1 for all input cells.</italic> </p><p>Following this suggestion, we have now provided the immunostaining results for two more cell types, Mi9 and Tm3 and also included immunolabelling with a marker for glutamatergic neurons (anti-VGlut).</p><p><italic>5) The finding that the anatomy allows for implementation of BL as well as of HR functionality, is not surprising as both functions have been shown to exist in parallel in functional studies. This is mentioned by the authors, but I suggest that they shape their discussion starting from that point and ask which components could fulfill which task. To me the discussion still reads as if the authors are looking for a decision which model holds true.</italic> </p><p>At the reviewer’s suggestion, we revised the discussion part of the main text by adding some sentences mentioning the recent functional studies. Our data suggest that both models may indeed co-exist using different paired inputs. Here is a highlight from our revision:</p><p>“The finding of additional T4 inputs and their synaptic arrangements allows us to compare the predictions from functional studies with the requirements of different models of motion detection. Our findings reveal potential substrates for both BL- and HR-type motion detectors. A recent imaging study reported that T4 cells indeed use both HR model preferred-direction enhancement and BL model null-direction suppression (Haag et al., 2016). Which individual inputs onto T4’s dendrites fulfill the requirements for enhancement and suppression of directional selectivity? Of the synaptic inputs to T4 that are anatomically qualified to serve as two channels of a motion detector, several could support BL motion detectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). First, […]”</p></body></sub-article></article>
