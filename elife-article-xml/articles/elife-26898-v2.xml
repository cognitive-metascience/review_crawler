It can cleave multiple substrates including itself, fibronectin, ephrinB, cadherin-11, pcdh8 and pcdh8l (this work). Cleavage of cadherin-11 produces an extracellular fragment that promotes CNC migration. In addition, the adam13 cytoplasmic domain is cleaved by gamma secretase, translocates into the nucleus and regulates multiple genes. Here, we show that adam13 interacts with the arid3a/dril1/Bright transcription factor. This interaction promotes a proteolytic cleavage of arid3a and its translocation to the nucleus where it regulates another transcription factor: tfap2α. Tfap2α in turn activates multiple genes including the protocadherin pcdh8l (PCNS). The proteolytic activity of adam13 is critical for the release of arid3a from the plasma membrane while the cytoplasmic domain appears critical for the cleavage of arid3a. In addition to this transcriptional control of pcdh8l, adam13 cleaves pcdh8l generating an extracellular fragment that also regulates cell migration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural crest</kwd><kwd>ADAM</kwd><kwd>metalloprotease</kwd><kwd>protocadherin</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>embryo</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31-DE023275</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abbruzzese</surname><given-names>Genevieve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO3-DE025692</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cousin</surname><given-names>Helene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1-DE016289</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alfandari</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24-OD021485</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alfandari</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The regulation of tfap2α expression by adam13 is essential during cranial neural crest cell migration in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cranial neural crest (CNC) cells are a transient population of natural stem cells that are induced at the border of the neural and non-neural ectoderm by a combination of signals including BMP, Wnt and FGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dorsky et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Monsoro-Burq et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tribulo et al., 2003</xref>). These signals mediate the expression of key transcription factors that define placodal and neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Groves and LaBonne, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Milet and Monsoro-Burq, 2012</xref>). Among those the transcription factor tfap2α is one of the earliest and most conserved factors that controls the fate of neural border cells and later neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Croze et al., 2011</xref>). While loss of tfap2α in all vertebrates tested leads to craniofacial defects, mutations in the tfap2α gene in humans are associated with the Branchiooculofacial Syndrome highlighting the importance of this gene for craniofacial development and neural crest cell biology throughout evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoffman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martinelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meshcheryakova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Van Otterloo et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Once induced, CNC cells migrate toward the ventral side of the embryo to contribute to most of the craniofacial structures. Many proteins have been shown to contribute to CNC migration, including multiple cell adhesion molecules such as integrins, cadherins and protocadherins, as well as cell surface metalloproteases that can effectively modulate these adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Alfandari et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, while cadherin-11 is required at the surface of CNC, an excess of the protein prevents migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borchers et al., 2001</xref>). The cytoplasmic domain of cadherin-11 binds to the GEF trio and promotes filopodia formation in the migrating CNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kashef et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, cadherin-11 also localizes to nascent focal adhesion and interacts with the proteoglycan syndecan-4 via its transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Langhe et al., 2016</xref>). Lastly, the extracellular domain of cadherin-11 is cleaved by the metalloprotease adam13 producing an extracellular fragment that promotes cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCusker et al., 2009</xref>). This fragment can compete with the integral cadherin-11 to decrease contact inhibition of locomotion by a homophilic-dependent binding site, but this site is not required for its ability to promote CNC migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbruzzese et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Other cadherin superfamily members are cleaved by ADAM metalloproteases. In Xenopus, the protocadherin pcdh8l is essential for CNC migration both in vivo and in vitro suggesting that it affects the basic cell locomotion machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rangarajan et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, the protocadherin pcdh8 (PAPC), which can functionally replace pcdh8l in the neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>) is a substrate for adam13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abbruzzese et al., 2014</xref>). In chick, cleavage of cadherin-6 by adam10 and adam19 is also critical for proper migration of the neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schiffmacher et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, controlled expression of cadherin and protocadherin combined with proteolytic processing of these cell adhesion molecules appears to play a critical role in neural crest cell migration.</p><p>In addition to its proteolytic cleavage of cadherin-11, adam13/33 has been shown to play critical roles in CNC induction in <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> by cleaving ephrinB, reducing its inhibitory activity upon the Wnt signaling pathway and allowing for a robust expression of snai2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wei et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, knock down of adam13 in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> has no effect on snai2 expression but affects CNC migration in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cousin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Alfandari et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cousin et al., 2012</xref>). While the proteolytic role of adam13 is clearly important, the role of its cytoplasmic domain is also critical. We have shown that the cytoplasmic domain of adam13 is cleaved by gamma secretase and translocates into the nucleus where it regulates the expression of thousands of genes. The cleavage by gamma secretase requires a self-proteolytic cleavage by adam13 in its own cysteine rich domain and is therefore dependent on the adam13 proteolytic activity. In the absence of the cytoplasmic domain, adam13 cannot support CNC migration, but addition of a soluble form of its cytoplasmic domain fused to GFP, which partition exclusively in the nucleus, rescues cell migration. Similarly, addition of a single leucine in the cytoplasmic domain of adam13 that creates a nuclear export signal prevents adam13 ability to rescue CNC migration. This ability to regulate cell migration and gene expression is shared by the cytoplasmic domains of adam13 orthologues from <italic>C-elegans</italic> to marsupial, as well as the cytoplasmic domains of adam19 from frog and mouse, demonstrating the evolutionary conservation of this role. In contrast, the cytoplasmic domains of adam9 and adam10, which also translocate into the nucleus, cannot compensate for the loss of the adam13 cytoplasmic domain, revealing the specificity of this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cousin et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Because, the cytoplasmic domain of adam13 does not possess any sequence similarity with transcription factors. We have investigated how it can modulate the expression of so many target genes. Here, we show that adam13 regulates the expression of the transcription factor tfap2α, which in turn regulates the protocadherin pcdh8l, a target of adam13 critical for CNC migration. We further show that adam13 physically interacts with the transcription factor arid3a/dril1/BRIGHT. This transcription factor is required for adam13’s ability to induce tfap2α. In human Hek293T cells, adam13 stimulates the production of a shorter fragment of arid3a at the plasma membrane, which translocates to the nucleus. The production of the shorter fragment depends on the adam13 cytoplasmic domain, while the translocation from the membrane depends on the adam13 proteolytic activity. We propose that adam13 may interact with arid3a at the plasma membrane providing a pool of transcription factor that can be released upon cleavage of the adam13 cytoplasmic domain. This function is likely conserved and could contribute to many of the biological processes that are regulated by ADAM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Alfandari et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dreymueller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giebeler and Zigrino, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pollheimer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reiss and Saftig, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adam13 cleaves pcdh8l</title><p>We have previously shown that adam13 cleaves the protocadherin pcdh8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abbruzzese et al., 2014</xref>). Given the similarity in sequence between pcdh8 and pcdh8l and the critical role that pcdh8l plays during CNC migration, we hypothesized that adam13 may also cleave pcdh8l. To test this hypothesis, we co-transfected an N-terminal flag-tagged-pcdh8l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) along with either adam13 (A13) or a proteolytically inactive mutant form adam13E/A (A13E/A) in human Hek293T cells. Western blot analysis of conditioned media from transfected cells shows the presence of the extracellular fragment of pcdh8l only when co-transfected with adam13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The approximate size of the fragment (&gt;60 kDa) suggests that it includes the cadherin repeats 1 to 4 of pcdh8l (EC1-4). This was confirmed by generating a truncated form of pcdh8l including these domains, which migrates at the same position as the cleaved fragment (data not shown). No fragment was observed when pcdh8l was co-transfected with A13E/A suggesting that the proteolytic activity of adam13 is responsible for the cleavage of pcdh8l. To confirm these findings in vivo, we generated a monoclonal antibody to the cytoplasmic domain of pcdh8l (mAb 2F4). This antibody recognizes a protein of the appropriate size (120 kDa), expressed at the appropriate stage (stage 20), localized to the CNC in whole mount immunostaining and to the plasma membrane of CNC cells in vitro. We further confirmed that it recognizes pcdh8l but not pcdh8 transfected in Hek293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). At stage 20, the main protein recognized is the full length at 120 kDa, but two minor shorter fragments can be seen at ≈60 (1) and ≈40 kDa (2), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These fragments increased in embryos injected with the adam13 mRNA suggesting that adam13 can also cleave pcdh8l in vivo.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26898.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>adam13 cleaves pcdh8l.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of full length pcdh8l.

To that effect, we injected an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide known to block adam13 translation (MO13) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCusker et al., 2009</xref>) at the one-cell stage and the various mRNA at the 8-cell-stage in a dorsal animal blastomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moody, 1987</xref>). A lineage tracer (RFP mRNA) was co-injected in all cases to follow the migration of the CNC as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCusker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbruzzese et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abbruzzese et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cousin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cousin et al., 2012</xref>). When MO13 is injected alone 57% of the embryos show no fluorescent CNC in the migration pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Injection of a MO13-resistant adam13 mRNA significantly rescued CNC migration (26% inhibition). Injection of the pcdh8l extracellular fragment (EC1-4) mRNA rescued CNC migration significantly (47% inhibition), but less efficiently than the adam13 mRNA. Surprisingly, we found that loss of adam13 could be significantly rescued by the full length pcdh8l mRNA even more efficiently (36% inhibition) than with EC1-4, a phenomenon that was not observed for cadherin-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCusker et al., 2009</xref>).

As expected we found that arid3a is equally distributed between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Interestingly, in the nucleus a smaller fragment (40 kDa) is observed, and this fragment is much more abundant in the nucleus of cells co-transfected with adam13. We then tested if this fragment was also observed in cells co-transfected with the adam13 protease dead mutant (A13E/A) and the mutant lacking the cytoplasmic domain (A13ΔCyto). In both conditions, we found that the fragment was not increased by these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). We then tested if Arid3a was localized to the plasma membrane in Hek293T cells, as previously described for B-cells, and if adam13 and the various mutants affected this localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Transfected Arid3a was found in the membrane fraction of Hek293T cells in all conditions tested. In cells expressing adam13, the 40 kDa fragment of arid3a (arid3a Short) was enriched. This fragment was dramatically increased in cells expressing the A13E/A mutant, suggesting that the proteolytic activity of adam13 is not responsible for the production of arid3a Short. In contrast, cells expressing A13ΔCyto express the same level of arid3a Short than those expressing only arid3a. Taken together, these results show that adam13 regulates arid3a post-translational modification (proteolytic cleavage) and nuclear translocation. These results are compatible with a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11-1</xref>) in which the adam13 cytoplasmic domain is part of a complex that either cleaves arid3a at the plasma membrane or stabilizes a cleaved form of arid3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11-2</xref>).

This regulation is mediated by the interaction of adam13 with the arid3a transcription factor and requires both the cytoplasmic domain and metalloprotease activity of adam13 in naïve ectoderm. Our results suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of adam13 is critical for either stabilizing or inducing the cleavage of arid3a at the plasma membrane. This fragment is then accumulated in the nucleus of cells co-transfected with adam13. The accumulation of this fragment in the nucleus appears to be controlled by the adam13 proteolytic activity, as it is impaired in the A13E/A mutant. Given adam13’s ability to cleave itself within its cysteine rich domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaultier et al., 2002</xref>), thus becoming a substrate for gamma-secretase, to cleave and release the cytoplasmic domain from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cousin et al., 2011</xref>), we propose that the complex containing the cleaved arid3a, and at least the adam13 cytoplasmic domain is then free to translocate into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). This model is consistent with the essential roles of both the proteolytic and cytoplasmic domain of adam13 in animal cap and the CNC. It is also consistent with the observation that the GFP-C13 fusion protein containing the adam13 cytoplasmic domain, which is found only in the nucleus, is unable to induce tfap2α expression. On the other hand, the fact that the adam13 E/A mutant can induce the reporter in Hek293T cells even at a lower efficiency is puzzling. While this construct clearly increases the arid3a fragment, it does not allow its efficient nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B and C</xref>). One possible explanation is that it may act as a dominant mutant by trapping e2f1 at the plasma membrane. Arid3a was originally identified in a screen of E2F1 binding protein as E2FBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Suzuki et al., 1998</xref>). In Hek293T cells, e2f1 inhibits the tfap2a promoter activity and is able to block both adam13 and arid3a induction of the reporter (data not shown). Thus by binding to the endogenous E2F1 protein in Hek293T cells, A13E/A could sequester E2F1 at the plasma membrane and increase the reporter activity. In Xenopus, e2f1 is expressed maternally and is strongly down regulated at stage 20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Owens et al., 2016</xref>) when the animal caps are extracted. Thus, A13E/A expression would have no effect on its ability to translocate in the nucleus.</p><p>In B-cells, ARID3a also known as Bright, is post translationally modified. First, it is palmitoylated and associate with lipid raft at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>). Upon stimulation of the B-cell receptor, arid3a is sumoylated, dissociate from the lipid raft and is then free to regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prieur et al., 2009</xref>). It is possible that in the neural crest cells, adam13 regulates a pool of arid3a associated with lipid raft at the plasma membrane. It could do this by helping assemble the proper signaling complex including the enzyme responsible for arid3a post-translational modification. In the complex, the presence of a protease would cleave off the N-terminal domain of arid3a. This cleavage could be important for releasing a transcriptional inhibitor (e.g. e2f1) or simply destabilizing arid3a interaction with the plasma membrane. Given the widespread expression of arid3a, this would provide a mechanism by which the transcription factor is only activated in the right cells and at the right time. Our results show that adam13 expression dramatically increases the nuclear localization of a cleavage product of arid3a (arid3a Short), while it does not affect the overall distribution of the intact arid3a protein. This depends on both the proteolytic activity and the cytoplasmic domain of adam13. It is tempting to speculate that this fragment (arid3a Short), which has not been described before, is responsible for the increased expression of tfap2α. Based on the calculated molecular weight of the fragment, it is likely to maintain the intact ARID (DNA binding) domain as well as the RECKLES domain that control the nuclear localization. It will be interesting to determine if adam13 stabilizes arid3a Short or produces it. If this model were correct, we would expect that proteins that interfere with the production of the cleaved cytoplasmic domain would also interfere with adam13’s ability to induce tfap2α. We have previously shown that the secreted Wnt receptor Fz4-v1, binds to adam13 and prevents its proteolytic activity. We further showed that KD of Fz4-v1 induces an early production of the adam13 cytoplasmic fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abbruzzese et al., 2015</xref>). In embryos, KD of Fz4-v1, increases both tfap2α and pcdh8l transcription (data not shown), while In Hek293T cells, expression of Fzd4-v1 inhibits adam13 activation of the tfap2α reporter further supporting our model.</p><p>Our results also show that adam13 activation of tfap2α in naïve ectoderm does not require β-catenin, while tfap2α has been shown to be induced by β-catenin in the CNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Crozé et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, we also show that adam13 induction of tfap2α requires the presence of tfap2α. Both adam13 and tfap2α are initially expressed in the entire ectoderm and become excluded from the neural plate to be restricted to the neural folds and later neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Alfandari et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luo et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, the quantitative expression pattern of tfap2α and adam13 by RNA-seq is nearly identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Owens et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that adam13 and tfap2αexpression is initially controlled by the same transcription factor possibly β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deardorff et al., 2001</xref>), and that adam13 is later required for the maintenance and amplification of tfap2αexpression within the neural fold and neural crest cells. This is compatible with the fact that adam13 is not required for β-catenin induction of snai2 in the CNC in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>. Also consistent with this model, we find that both arid3a and tfap2α can induce the tfap2α reporter individually, and the combination of these two proteins produces an additive increase in the luciferase expression (data not shown). We also tested if adam13 could initiate a full CNC program in naïve ectoderm. We found that while snail2 and twist can be induced by adam13, cadherin 11, sox8 and sox10 were not (data not shown) suggesting that adam13 is not capable to induce neural crest cells from naïve ectoderm.</p><p>Ultimately, adam13 induction of tfap2α results in the induction of pcdh8l and the up-regulation of Cpn8a in the CNC, two proteins critical for CNC migration. The fact that CNC lacking adam13 can migrate in vitro while those missing pcdh8l cannot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rangarajan et al., 2006</xref>) might be explained by the observation that the CNC lacking adam13 eventually expresses both tfap2α and pcdh8l suggesting that another control of tfap2α expression is activated later on. This may or may not require the involvement of other ADAM proteases. In particular, it is possible that adam19, which can activate the tfap2α reporter in Hek293T cells may compensate for the loss of adam13 in the CNC. It will be of interest to test if tfap2α expression in mouse is also regulated by ADAM proteases and if this contributes to craniofacial development. Given the conserved ability of the adam19 cytoplasmic domain from mouse and Xenopus to functionally replace the adam13 cytoplasmic domain, together with the ability of adam19 to induce the tfap2α reporter, it is tempting to speculate that adam19, which is expressed in mouse CNC and contributes to the cardiac neural crest cell development, could regulate tfap2α to promote CNC migration. While a role for adam13/33 and adam19 in mouse CNC has not been shown, it is possible that the craniofacial phenotypes are subtle and may have been missed in the individual Knock out reports.</p><p>Our results show that the extracellular fragment of multiple cadherins and protocadherin can rescue CNC migration. In particular, we have shown that the extracellular fragment of Cadherin-11 can rescue CNC migration in embryos lacking adam13 or expressing a non-cleavable form of cadherin-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbruzzese et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, the extracellular fragment of pcdh8l partially rescues CNC migration in embryos lacking adam13. It is interesting to note that one can greatly improve the rescue either by injecting full-length pcdh8l together with adam13 lacking a cytoplasmic domain (data not shown). This mutant form of adam13 can cleave pcdh8l but cannot regulate transcription and therefore the level of the protocadherin. Alternatively, greater rescue is also achieved by expressing the EC1-4 fragment of pcdh8l together with tfap2α showing that the transcriptional and proteolytic activity of adam13 can be uncoupled. Why can the various cadherin and protocadherin fragments rescue migration? We have shown that the extracellular fragment of cadherin-11 bind to ErbB2 (EGF receptor 2) and regulates Akt phosphorylation (Mathavan et al., submitted). In cancer cells, the extracellular fragment of E-cadherin can also bind to ErbB2 to promote cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brouxhon et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brouxhon et al., 2014b</xref>). This suggests that a common structure within the Cadherin/protocadherin extracellular domain can bind and signal through growth factor receptors.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The larger role of ADAM regulation of transcription</title><p>Our results show how ADAMs can regulate transcription via their cytoplasmic domain.

Our preliminary results show that mouse adam33 and adam12 are also able to induce the tfap2α reporter when transfected in Hek293T cells even if less efficiently than adam13 or adam19 while Xenopus adam9, 10 and 11 do not (data not shown). A better understanding of the precise regulation of tfap2α transcription by the various ADAMs will be necessary to determine if they all regulate gene expression by a common mechanism. Similarly, the observed role of adam12 in mediating TGF-β signaling, may involve an interaction with arid3a, a protein known to be downstream of the TGF-β effector Smad2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Callery et al., 2005</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jean-Pierre Saint-Jeannet (Reviewer #2); Mike Klymkowsky (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Given the list of essential changes, including several new experiments, the Board and reviewers invite you to respond soon with an action plan and a timetable for the completion of the additional work. We will share your comments with the reviewers and get back to you with recommendations.</p><p>In this manuscript the authors assign a role of ADAM13 in the regulation of AP2a, a key gene in neural crest patterning. the demonstrate that full-length ADAM13 can induce expression of the downstream target gene PCNS, and that this is dependent upon the induction of AP2a via an interaction with ARID3a. The authors show that ADAM13 cleaves the protocadherin PCNS and regulates its expression through activation of Ap2α, an important neural plate border specifier. Interestingly the latter activity requires both the proteolytic domain and cytoplasmic tail of ADAM13 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal cap explants. Overall this study provides important mechanistic insights into the transcriptional activity of this important class of molecules during neural crest development. While generally the results support their conclusions, there are a few areas that would strengthen their findings:</p><p>1) The necessity of ARID3a</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the authors show that knockdown of Arid3a, in concert with A13, can almost completely rescue the AP2a induction as well as PCNS induction. However, what is surprising is the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, in which AP2a/PCNS can rescue the migration defect yet Arid3a does not. This is important, since their data seems to imply an absolutely requirement for Arid3a in the actions of ADAM13. How is this explained? How was this CNC migration quantified? Representative images would be helpful and a clearer explanation of these effects is necessary. Finally, the x-axis on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> should be labelled.</p><p>2) Localization and cleavage of Arid3a by ADAM13</p><p>In the Discussion, the authors propose a model whereby Arid3a is stored at the plasma membrane, and then cleaved by ADAM13 to be released into the cytoplasm and then translocated to the nucleus. This is interesting, but the authors do not show any data to support this idea, and in addition the failure of Arid3a rescue s above calls this into question. Do the authors have any immunofluorescence data to support this idea? Also, is there direct evidence of Arid3a cleavage by ADAM13 by Western blot?</p><p>3) The nuclear activity of ADAM13</p><p>Along the same lines, it is proposed that ADAM13, either alone or with Arid3a, may act directly in the nucleus and can bind to β-importin. Yet the authors state in data not shown that expressing both of these proteins together does not result in the induction of AP2a, at least in HEK293 cells. This seems at odd with their overall basic hypothesis. Can this be explained further from a mechanistic level? As noted above, the membrane to nucleus model does not seem fully able to explain this effect without additional data.</p><p>4) The interaction of ADAM13 and Arid3a</p><p>- Arid3-flag is visible in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> lane in the absence of ADAM13. How is that explained?</p><p>- There is a need for more accurate normalization (particularly given the very high levels Arid/Fox protein and the small level of precipitated Arid/Fox proteins.</p><p>- The authors need to demonstrate the specificity of the various anti-ADAM13 antibodies used in this analysis, at the very least by presenting an immunoblot of whole cell and whole embryo lysates probed with the antibody.</p><p>- Have the authors seen the co-localization of ADAM13 with either Arid or Fox proteins within embryos? Do they see interactions between the cytoplasmic tail of ADAM13 and either protein?</p><p>5) PCNS effects</p><p>The ADAM13 morpholino/down regulation (MO) phenotype can be partially ameliorated (rescued) by expression of either a fragment of pcdh8l and that ADAM13 can cleave pcdh8l when constructs are co-transfected into human HEK293T cells. Has this observation be repeated in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(B</xref>) it is difficult to tell if the relative amounts of full length and cleaved pcdh8l are the same in the control and MO treated embryos.</p><p>What is the extent of ADAM13 down-regulation in the ADAM13 MO embryos? The significance of these rescue studies is unclear since, the authors note that the protocadherin PAPC can replace pcdh8l. As noted later on in the manuscript, cadherin-11 and PAPC can rescue ADAM13 MO phenotypes; do cadherin-11 or PAPC influence pcdh8l expression or cleavage alone or in ADAM13 MO embryos? Does expression of pcdh8l alter cadherin-11 or PAPC expression levels? In terms of genetic analysis are we looking at various forms of by-pass suppressor?</p><p>In their animal cap experiments, injection of ADAM13 RNA induced increased pcdh8l expression, it appears (based on data from Xenbase) that ADAM13 is expressed maternally. ADAM13 RNA appears to be supplied maternally, does the ADAM13 MO reduced pcdh8lRNA/protein levels in animal caps? Does ADAM13 RNA also increase cadherin-11 or PAPC RNA (see above)? The authors should note the relative level of endogenous ADAM13 to exogenous ADAM13 in these studies.</p><p>6) The neural crest effects of ADAM13</p><p>It is remarkable that ADAM13 is sufficient activate Ap2α and PCNS in animal cap explants, and it would be interesting to know whether ADAM13 can induce a full program of neural crest differentiation in this context. There is little information in the manuscript on the expression pattern of Arid3a as it relates to neural crest development. The authors should comment on the timing/sequence of expression of these factors, as the model predicts that ADAM13 and Arid3a act upstream of Ap2α and PCNS.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for sending us your revised manuscript and response to reviewers. These have been considered by the handling <italic>eLife</italic> editors and the referees, and we are pleased to inform you that the assessment has been generally positive. However, the editors and referees have these outstanding concerns that we would like to ask you to address in a revision:</p><p>I still find that parts of the manuscript are written in a needlessly confusing way, and there are still strings of meaningless characters here and there within, at least, my copy.</p><p>First, perhaps the Abstract could start with:</p><p>&quot;Adam13/33 is a cell surface metalloprotease critical for cranial neural crest (CNC) cell migration; it can cleave multiple substrates including itself, fibronectin, ephrinB, and cadherin-11, and pcdh8l/PCNS (this work).&quot;</p><p>In the Abstract, it appears that the gene regulatory effects of ADAM13 are directly mediated by the proteolytic cleavage Arid3a, which in turn influences the activity of Tfap2a. This should be made clearer.</p><p>I would remove &quot;post-translational modification&quot; for clarity's sake.</p><p>In the Introduction, there is the impression that it is the nuclear localization of the Adam13 cytoplasmic domain that regulates gene expression; at the same time there is the observation that the interaction between Adam13 and Arid3a is critical, apparently because it is involved in a cytoplasmic complex that leads to the proteolytic cleavage of Arid3a.</p><p>Does this mean that the nuclear localization of the Adam13 cytoplasmic domain is unnecessary for Adam13's effects on gene expression?</p><p>Is there any evidence that the full length and cleaved forms of Arid3a differ in their effects on gene expression?</p><p>These points need to be clarified in the text; the reader (me) is left with the impression that Arid3a is cytoplasmic until it is proteolytically processed.</p><p>Final note; the word &quot;this&quot; can often be confusing, since it is not always clear what &quot;this&quot; refers to. Various minor typographical errors of this type should be corrected.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26898.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] While generally the results support their conclusions, there are a few areas that would strengthen their findings:</p><p>1) The necessity of ARID3a</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the authors show that knockdown of Arid3a, in concert with A13, can almost completely rescue the AP2a induction as well as PCNS induction.

This can be explained by the fact that Arid3a expression does not depends on ADAM13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) and that they function together. Simply put, an excess of Arid3a cannot alleviate the lack of ADAM13. We will correct the missing x-axis and will provide representative examples. Migration was scored as described in the methods by injecting a lineage tracer together with either MO and/or mRNA at the 8-cell-stage in a dorsal animal blastomere and scoring for the presence or absence of fluorescent neural crest within the migration pathway.

This localization is critical for its ability to respond to the B-cell receptor signal. Upon signaling by the BCR, arid3a translocates into the nucleus where it regulates gene expression. Our model suggests that ADAM13 may play a similar role by which it regulates Arid3a translocation to the nucleus.</p><p>We have performed multiple new experiments which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. In Hek293T cells ADAM13 increases a fragment of Arid3a in the nucleus of transfected cells (Arid3a short). This depends both on the cytoplasmic domain and proteolytic activity similar to the requirement for ADAM13 regulation of AP2a expression.

We have performed membrane fractionation confirming that Arid3a is indeed associated with the plasma membrane. In Bcell, Arid3a is palmytoylated locally to the plasma membrane where it interacts with the B-cell receptor. Stimulation of the BCell receptor induce a sumoylation of Arid3a which can then go to stimulate gene expression.

All 3 genes are down regulated in the neural plate, but maintained in the neural fold. Based on the published expression pattern the mRNA and proteins are likely to be co-expressed in the neural fold during CNC specification. We are currently performing additional ISH for Arid3a but it is unclear if these will be better than those published already.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thank you for sending us your revised manuscript and response to reviewers. These have been considered by the handling eLife editors and the referees, and we are pleased to inform you that the assessment has been generally positive. However, the editors and referees have these outstanding concerns that we would like to ask you to address in a revision:</p><p>I still find that parts of the manuscript are written in a needlessly confusing way, and there are still strings of meaningless characters here and there within, at least, my copy.</p><p>We have been working on the text to make it clearer, the new data have changed the story significantly but we had tried to maintain the text close to the original manuscript. We hope the new version is clearer. The string of character appears only during the pdf conversion and appears to be due to some incompatibility between Word from PC and MAC. We will make sure that we find all of the issues.</p><p>First, perhaps the Abstract could start with:</p><p>&quot;Adam13/33 is a cell surface metalloprotease critical for cranial neural crest (CNC) cell migration; it can cleave multiple substrates including itself, fibronectin, ephrinB, and cadherin-11, and pcdh8l/PCNS (this work).&quot;</p><p>Done.</p><p>In the Abstract, it appears that the gene regulatory effects of ADAM13 are directly mediated by the proteolytic cleavage Arid3a, which in turn influences the activity of Tfap2a. This should be made clearer.</p><p>This is done. I wanted to be very cautious that we have not shown proteolysis. It could also be the stabilization of a proteolytic fragment that is independent of adam13.</p><p>I would remove &quot;post-translational modification&quot; for clarity's sake.</p><p>Done.</p><p>In the Introduction, there is the impression that it is the nuclear localization of the Adam13 cytoplasmic domain that regulates gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>This was the original hypothesis and is still a possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At the same time there is the observation that the interaction between Adam13 and Arid3a is critical, apparently because it is involved in a cytoplasmic complex that leads to the proteolytic cleavage of Arid3a.</p></disp-quote><p>The complex is most likely at the plasma membrane (on the cytoplasmic side) rather than in the cytoplasm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does this mean that the nuclear localization of the Adam13 cytoplasmic domain is unnecessary for Adam13's effects on gene expression?</p><p>Our previous work showed that introducing a single leucine in the cytoplasmic domain of adam13 that created a nuclear export signal was sufficient to prevent adam13 ability to rescue CNC migration (Cousin et al., 2011 DevCell). This strongly suggests that the cytoplasmic domain of adam13 needs to translocate to regulate gene expression. Our current results show that translocation is not sufficient. It has to go to the plasma membrane to control arid3a. It is likely that the complex (Arid3a/adam13cyto) translocates but it is not demonstrated here.</p><p>Is there any evidence that the full length and cleaved forms of Arid3a differ in their effects on gene expression?</p></disp-quote><p>No there is no evidence that the cleaved and full length differ in their ability to regulate gene expression. These form of Arid3a have never been described before. Given the likely cleavage site the ARID domain would be maintained together with the NLS and the sumoylation site. As such it is likely that the truncated form will also regulate transcription. The N-term portion of the protein is thought to promote protein-protein interaction. We plan to test this in the future but feel that the manuscript is already long and complex without this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These points need to be clarified in the text; the reader (me) is left with the impression that Arid3a is cytoplasmic until it is proteolytically processed.</p></disp-quote><p>We will clarify.</p><p>1) There is clearly abundant full length Arid3a at the membrane in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus so proteolytic processing is not required for nuclear translocation.</p><p>2) The interaction of Arid3a with adam13 increases this proteolytic processing and the fraction of that short from present in the nucleus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As described in B-cells for Bright, only a fraction of the protein is associated with lipid raft and able to respond to BCR (Here adam13) signaling.</p><p>Final note; the word &quot;this&quot; can often be confusing, since it is not always clear what &quot;this&quot; refers to. Various minor typographical errors of this type should be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>We will try to correct all of those before the next submission.</p></body></sub-article></article>
