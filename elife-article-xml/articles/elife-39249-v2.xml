Hygroreception allows animals to avoid desiccation, an existential threat that is increasing with climate change. Humidity response, however, remains poorly understood. Here we find that humidity-detecting sensilla in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> antenna express and rely on a small protein, Obp59a. Mutants lacking this protein are defective in three hygrosensory behaviors, one operating over seconds, one over minutes, and one over hours. Remarkably, loss of Obp59a and humidity response leads to an increase in desiccation resistance. Obp59a is an exceptionally well-conserved, highly localized, and abundantly expressed member of a large family of secreted proteins. Antennal Obps have long been believed to transport hydrophobic odorants, and a role in hygroreception was unexpected. The results enhance our understanding of hygroreception, Obp function, and desiccation resistance, a process that is critical to insect survival.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39249.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Some insects have a sense – called hygroreception – that allows them to detect changing levels of moisture in the air. These insects use this sense to avoid becoming too dry, or to find food or places to lay their eggs. In many species, including the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the antennae are important for hygroreception. Cells in the antennae produce lots of small proteins called odorant binding proteins, or Obps for short. These proteins are believed mostly to help the antennae to detect various chemical signals in the air, but it was not known if any of these proteins were also involved in hygroreception.</p><p>Obp59a is an odorant binding protein that is found in the parts of the antennae that sense moisture, and Sun et al. set out to establish whether it has a role in hygroreception in the fruit fly. A closer look confirmed that Obp59a proteins were indeed found specifically in the moisture-sensitive parts of the antennae, the hygroreceptive sensilla. Further experiments showed that flies without Obp59a could not respond properly to changing humidity over periods of seconds, minutes and hours. These results indicated that Obp59a is important for insect hygroreception.</p><p>Perhaps unexpectedly, these mutant flies were also more resistant to drying out. Sun et al. suggest that, because flies without Obp59a struggle with hygroreception, they may also become more cautious to avoid becoming too dry. Further experiments could now test this hypothesis. Since insects like mosquitoes use hygroreception to find their human hosts or choose where to lay their eggs, Obp59a may become a useful target for controlling insect-borne infections. Also, understanding insect hygroreception may yield new insights into how climate change will affect insect populations around the world.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hygroreception</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd><kwd>antenna</kwd><kwd>odorant binding protein</kwd><kwd>desiccation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dwight N. and Noyes D.

Mosquitoes, for example, use hygroreception to find humans on which to feed, and to find water sources on which to lay eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Okal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Takken, 1991</xref>). Hygroreception helps animals avoid desiccation, a peril that is increasing due to climate change. Small insects, which have a high ratio of surface area to volume, are especially vulnerable to water loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gibbs et al., 2003</xref>). The ability to sense humidity levels may allow an insect to avoid dangerously dry conditions or to initiate physiological changes that protect it against desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stinziano et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The antenna functions as a humidity detector in many insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altner and Loftus, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tichy, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yokohari, 1978</xref>). In the antenna of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, humidity detection occurs largely in a three-chambered cavity called the sacculus. The second chamber of the sacculus contains a small number of sensilla that act as hygroreceptors and thermoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Enjin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Frank et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kim and Wang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Knecht et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Knecht et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shanbhag et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>). These sensilla belong to a morphological class known as coeloconic sensilla, which are small relative to other sensilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shanbhag et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The molecular basis of hygroreception remains enigmatic. A major advance was recently made through the discovery that four ionotropic receptors expressed in the sacculus (IR93a, IR25a, IR68a, and IR40a) are required for hygrosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Enjin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Frank et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kim and Wang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Knecht et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Knecht et al., 2016</xref>). However, the precise role of these receptors in hygroreception remains unclear. Moreover, the downstream effects of hygrosensory signaling remain poorly understood.</p><p>Also enigmatic has been a family of small secreted proteins called Odorant binding proteins (Obps). These proteins are remarkably numerous, extremely abundant, and highly divergent in sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Graham and Davies, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hekmat-Scafe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Menuz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vogt et al., 1989</xref>). There are 52 <italic>Obp</italic> genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, of which 27 were found expressed in the antenna in a recent RNAseq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Menuz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Younus et al., 2014</xref>). Five of the 10 most abundantly expressed genes in the antenna are <italic>Obps</italic>. Although Obps are widely believed to carry odorants to odor receptors in olfactory sensilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leal et al., 2005</xref>), there is limited in vivo evidence to support this role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pelosi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vogt and Riddiford, 1981</xref>), and a recent genetic study found that a mutant olfactory sensillum lacking abundant Obps did not show a decreased magnitude of response to a variety of odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larter et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>One highly abundant member of the <italic>Obp</italic> family, <italic>Obp59a</italic>, is striking in two respects. First, it is exceptional in its high degree of sequence conservation among insects. Unlike nearly all other <italic>Drosophila Obps</italic>, it has clear orthologs in a variety of insect orders examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vieira and Rozas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). Second, it is the most highly localized of the abundant antennal Obps: its expression is restricted to the sacculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larter et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that <italic>Obp59a</italic> is expressed in the same sensilla as the <italic>IRs</italic> that are essential to hygroreception. We generate <italic>Obp59a</italic> mutants and find that they are defective in three distinct hygrosensory behavioral paradigms: one operating over the course of seconds, one over minutes, and one over hours. Finally, we show that <italic>Obp59a</italic> mutants survive desiccation better than controls. The results, taken together, add a new dimension to our understanding of hygroreception, of Obp function, and of a process that is critical to insect life and will become even more critical as climate change progresses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Obp59a</italic> maps to a chamber of the sacculus</title><p>We mapped <italic>Obp59a</italic> and examined its specificity of expression, initially by two means.

Flies were given a binary choice between higher and lower regions of humidity, and a ‘wet preference’ was calculated at one hour intervals as (H-L)/(H + L), where H is the number of flies in the region of high humidity and L is the number in the region of low humidity. Thus, the wet preference may vary between 1.0 (complete preference for high humidity) to −1.0 (complete preference for low humidity). We first gave flies a choice between 70% and 20% RH and found that by the first time point (5 min), control flies showed a strong preference for high humidity; this preference continued for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Obp59a is one of only two Obps with clear orthologs across insect orders. This conservation suggests that its structure represents a good solution to a difficult problem that is common to many insects.</p><p>A role for an Obp in humidity detection was unexpected. Antennal Obps are widely believed to transport hydrophobic odorants through the aqueous sensillum lymph to odor receptors in the dendritic membranes of olfactory receptor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leal, 2013</xref>). An <italic>Obp59a</italic> mutant was normal in response to both attractant and repellent odorants in behavioral tests. Obp59a seems unlikely to carry water molecules across the aqueous lymph to the dendrites of hygrosensory neurons.</p><p>One proposed model for the mechanism of hygroreception is that a change in humidity alters the structure of hygrosensory sensilla, with the structural change being transduced into neuronal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altner and Loftus, 1985</xref>). It is conceivable that <italic>Obp59a</italic> mutants contain a subtle defect in the structure or composition of the sensillum, and therefore do not undergo a normal structural change in response to changes in humidity. Such a role might fit well with the high abundance of Obp59a within hygrosensory sensilla. Obp59a could possibly affect sensillum structure or composition via a role in transporting hydrophobic components of the cuticular wall of the sensillum.</p><p>The concept of an alternative role for an antennal Obp is consistent with a recent study showing that the classic odorant-transport model may not apply to all antennal Obps and all olfactory sensilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larter et al., 2016</xref>). An Obp-to-sensillum map was constructed for all 10 of the abundant Obps, and when one particular sensillum, ab8, was genetically depleted of its sole abundant Obp, it showed a robust electrophysiological response to odorants; in fact the peak response was increased in many cases. These results suggested that Obp28a is not required for the transport of odorants to Ors in the ab8 sensillum.</p><p>Taken together, the results reveal an unexpected molecular component required for normal humidity response. Our findings add further support to the concept that antennal Obps do not have a single, unifying function, but rather play diverse roles. The results also identify a new target that could be useful in controlling insect vectors that rely on humidity to find their human hosts and oviposition sites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The role of humidity detection in fitness</title><p>Deletion of a gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> often causes a decrease in fitness.

This abnormality would trigger the induction of a defensive state that protects the fly against the existential threat of desiccation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Obp59a</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>FLYB:FBgn0034766</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>G. morsitans morsitans</italic>)</td><td><italic>Obp59a</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>Vectorbase: GMOY006081</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>wCS</italic></td><td>DOI: 10.1016/j. <break/>neuron.2014.07.012</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Obp28a<sup>-</sup></italic></td><td>DOI: 10.7554/eLife.20242</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Obp59a<sup>1</sup> and Obp59a<sup>2</sup></italic></td><td>this paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>IR40a-GAL4</italic></td><td>Bloomington <break/>Drosophila Stock <break/>Center</td><td>BDSC:41727</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>IR25a-GAL4</italic></td><td>Bloomington <break/>Drosophila Stock <break/>Center</td><td>BDSC:41728</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>IR93a-GAL4</italic></td><td>DOI: 10.1016/j. <break/>cub.2016.03.049</td><td>FLYB:FBtp0102896</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>IR68a-GAL4</italic></td><td>DOI: 10.7554/ <break/>eLife.26654</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>IR8a-GAL4</italic></td><td>Bloomington <break/>Drosophila Stock <break/>Center</td><td>BDSC:41731</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Obp59a-GAL4</italic></td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>Created using 5' and <break/>3' fragments cloned <break/>into pBGRY1.

For behavioral testing of desiccated flies, flies were first placed in empty 29 mm food vials in the dark on 200 mL desiccant (W.A. Hammond Drierite Co., Ltd.) in a sealed 1000 mL Nalgene jar (ThermoFisher) for 5 hr at 25°C. No food source was present during this desiccation period.

Ten flies, five male and five female, were gently placed in 100 × 15 mm Petri dishes (BD Falcon) and sealed with size 66–68 nylon mesh (FabricandSewing.com). Salt solutions influencing humidity were prepared in a separate Petri dish. 35 × 10 mm Petri dishes (BD Falcon) were glued in the center of 100 × 15 mm dishes. High humidity above the central dish was created with 10 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O (96% RH) or highly concentrated NaCl (70% RH). Lower humidity above the outer dish was created with 20 ml concentrated LiCl (20% RH) or NaCl (70% RH). The 100 × 15 mm Petri dish was then covered and allowed to equilibrate for two hours in an environmental room maintained at a constant temperature of 25°C and 70% humidity; the assays were performed under these conditions as well. The RH in the region above each solution was stable and the boundary between them was sharp, as confirmed with a hygrometer (Hanna Instruments). Petri dishes containing flies were then inverted atop the Petri dishes containing solutions, so that flies were free to walk on the nylon mesh. Flies were recorded under infrared lighting for 300 s. The fraction of flies in the central dish was scored blind to genotype at 5 s intervals. Hygrotaxis index = (# flies in higher humidity) / (total # of flies).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Multidish humidity preference arena</title><p>The assay was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Enjin et al.

Nunclon ∆ Multidishes (ThermoFisher #167063) were prepared with a different solution in each half: either saturated LiCl (20% RH), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (50% RH), or NaCl (70% RH), or ddH<sub>2</sub>O (96% RH). Mesh was stretched over the Multidish and sealed with the edges of a lid whose face had been removed. Above this frame a second, intact lid was placed. This second lid contained on its inner surface two 5 mm x 22 mm x 60 mm rectangular arenas constructed from trimmed Hybrislip covers (Sigma-Aldrich #GBL716022). Each half of the length of each arena was over a different solution. Each arena housed a different population of flies, mutant in one arena and control in the other. In this way, the two genotypes could be tested in parallel in the same chamber. Before adding the flies, the Multidish was allowed to equilibrate for two hours in the environmental room at 25°C and 70% RH as described above. Then 20 flies, half male and half female, which were not desiccated or starved beforehand, were gently tapped in through holes in the cover so that flies walked on the nylon mesh within each arena. The holes were then resealed with clear tape. Flies were recorded under infrared lighting for 24 hr. A wet preference index (WPI) of flies was scored blind to genotype at 1 hr intervals: (# flies in higher humidity - # flies in lower humidity) / (total # of flies).

A desiccated fly was immobilized in a cut pipette tip with proboscis exposed. A dry cotton swab was held at 1 mm distance from the antennae. Water was then presented on a cotton swab held at 1 mm distance from the antennae. A fly was recorded as a responder to the dry or wet cotton swab if it extended its proboscis twice within one minute. 1 M sucrose was then presented to the fly on a cotton swab, but this time by directly touching the proboscis. Data were discarded for the fly if it did not extend its proboscis to sucrose (~25% of the flies).

Flies were then sorted by sex over CO<sub>2</sub>. 20 sex-segregated flies were taken from culture bottles and placed in an empty 35 × 10 mm Petri dish. Dishes were then placed in 150 mm diameter x 15 mm chambers with different humidities: 0% RH (produced using 25 mL Drierite) or 70% RH (25 mL saturated NaCl), at 25°C in the dark. No food source was present during the desiccation period. Numbers of dead flies were scored blind to genotype over evenly-spaced time intervals.

includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Humidity response depends on the small soluble protein <italic>Obp59a</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Leslie Griffith as Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Rachel Wilson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Both the function of olfactory binding proteins as well as the molecular basis for hygrosensation are still very much open questions. In this paper, the authors provide evidence that a soluble extracellular protein in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> antenna (called <italic>Obp59</italic>) is a key part of the molecular mechanisms of hygroreception in this organism, bringing these two areas together in an unexpected way. The data in general are high quality and clearly presented. The reviewers had several issues that if addressed will improve the paper.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Are moist and dry sensing neurons still present in the <italic>Obp59a</italic> mutants? IR93a/25a/40a/68a Gal4 expression is only shown for the WT animals. Either survival or non-survival is interesting, but knowing the answer would be valuable.</p><p>2) As the authors point out, &quot;It is conceivable that <italic>Obp59a</italic> mutants contain a subtle defect in the structure or composition of the sensillum.&quot; In Figure 3D</p><p>the antennal segment from mutant animals looks much different from WT. Is this accurate? Is the sacculus still open to the environment? Do other responses that require the sacculus (see Ai et al., 2010) still occur? Examining some other sacculus-dependent behavior e.g. the response to propionic/acetic acids (which has been mapped to chamber 3 of the sacculus) in the mutant would address this important point, though a higher resolution look at the sacculus would also help.</p><p>3) What change is occurring in these mutants that is endowing them with greater dehydration tolerance? To assess whether these changes directly reflect the loss of hygrosensing, it would be useful to test the desiccation tolerance of <italic>Ir93a</italic> mutants, which lack both moist and dry sensing. For <italic>Obp59a</italic>, are the mutant animals the same size as the WT? Other possibilities include that their surface area/volume ratios are different which could easily influence hygrosensory behaviors and/or desiccation resistance. Alternatively, the mutants might just spend less time searching for water (because they don't know they're dry), so they don't exhaust themselves in (hopeless) searching. If authors already have locomotor data already they should report it.</p><p>4) The results presented differ from published papers from other groups in several places. Authors show that flies prefer 96% to 70% relative humidity. But Perttunen and Salmi, 1956, Enjin et al., 2016 and Knecht et al., 2017 all reported that <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> prefer 70% to higher levels. And in the experiments presented here, there is relatively little change in behavior after desiccation. Perttunen and Salmi, 1956, Enjin et al., 2016 and Knecht et al., 2017 all observed big switches in preference toward high humidity post desiccation. Potential reasons for these discrepancies in behavior should be discussed in text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39249.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Are moist and dry sensing neurons still present in the Obp59a mutants?

In particular, the mutant sacculus is still open to the environment. We have added a figure that illustrates these points (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).

As for size, we had considered the possibility that the greater desiccation resistance of <italic>Obp59a</italic> mutants might be due to smaller size and correspondingly greater surface area-to-volume ratio. We found that <italic>Obp59a</italic> females do in fact weigh less than controls, but that mutant males weigh the same as controls. Since both sexes show a desiccation resistance phenotype, but only females show the weight phenotype, the resistance seems not to be explicable simply in terms of weight. We prefer therefore not to include these data in the manuscript.</p><p>As for locomotor behavior, the revised manuscript shows that <italic>Obp59a<sup>1</sup></italic> performs normally in a test of climbing behavior (Figure 5G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The results presented differ from published papers from other groups in several places.

Knecht et al.. 2017, have shown that the valence of this decision is dependent on the hydration status of the flies. We have added the suggestion that the preference we have observed in our experiments may reflect the conditions in which we have cultured them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And in the experiments presented here, there is relatively little change in behavior after desiccation.

We tested the effects of desiccation only in the faster hygrotaxis paradigm (Figure 4), which has a different duration, size, and geometry from that of Knecht et al., 2017. Also, the procedures used to desiccate flies are different: we did not provide the flies with a sucrose source during desiccation, which could affect their thirst level. N.B. We did not find a report of a change in preference in Enjin et al., 2016.)</p></body></sub-article></article>
