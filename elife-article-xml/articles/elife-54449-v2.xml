arrays, which are repositioned by chromatin remodeling complexes to control DNA accessibility. The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> RSC (<underline>R</underline>emodeling the <underline>S</underline>tructure of <underline>C</underline>hromatin) complex, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler family, plays critical roles in genome maintenance, transcription, and DNA repair. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and crosslinking mass spectrometry (CLMS) studies of yeast RSC complex and show that RSC is composed of a rigid tripartite core and two flexible lobes. The core structure is scaffolded by an asymmetric Rsc8 dimer and built with the evolutionarily conserved subunits Sfh1, Rsc6, Rsc9 and Sth1. The flexible ATPase lobe, composed of helicase subunit Sth1, Arp7, Arp9 and Rtt102, is anchored to this core by the N-terminus of Sth1. Our cryo-EM analysis of RSC bound to a nucleosome core particle shows that in addition to the expected nucleosome-Sth1 interactions, RSC engages histones and nucleosomal DNA through one arm of the core structure, composed of the Rsc8 SWIRM domains, Sfh1 and Npl6. Our findings provide structural insights into the conserved assembly process for all members of the SWI/SNF family of remodelers, and illustrate how RSC selects, engages, and remodels nucleosomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>chromatin remodeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U24GM129547</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nogales</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM63072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nogales</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-GM127018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nogales</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM110064</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ranish</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HL133678</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ranish</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nogales</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of the yeast RSC complex, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling family, determined by cryo-electron microscopy, reveals a conserved structural core and the mode of nucleosome engagement.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotes have four major families of chromatin remodelers: SWI/SNF, ISWI, CHD, and INO80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>). Each of these remodelers plays distinct roles based on how they select and affect target nucleosomes. Together, these remodelers give rise to the distinct chromatin landscapes observed in eukaryotic cells and determine how genetic information is organized, replicated, transcribed, and repaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yen et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> there are two members of the SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodelers: RSC and SWI/SNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Côté et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cairns et al., 1996</xref>). SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers reposition nucleosomes by translocating DNA around the histone octamer, and in vitro assays have shown that they move nucleosomes to the ends of linear DNA fragments before evicting the histones from the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clapier et al., 2016</xref>). RSC is essential for yeast viability and is ten times more abundant than SWI/SNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cairns et al., 1996</xref>). In the context of transcription, RSC is responsible for maintaining nucleosome free regions (NFR), while SWI/SNF plays a role in remodeling nucleosomes during transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nagai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krietenstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klein-Brill et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, RSC is also involved in many transcription-independent processes, such as mitotic division, double stranded break repair, and telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krietenstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Erkina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuryan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campsteijn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ungar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ng et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>RSC has a molecular weight of ~1.1 MDa and is composed of 17 proteins, with two copies of Rsc8 and one copy of either Rsc1 or Rsc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cairns et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cairns et al., 1999</xref>). Seven of the proteins (Arp7, Arp9, Rsc6, Rsc8, Sfh1, Sth1 and Rsc9) are conserved in all eukaryotic SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes, with Sth1 containing the ATPase domain that is responsible for the remodeling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cairns et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saha et al., 2002</xref>). Two additional subunits are conserved in yeast (Npl6 and Rtt102), and the rest are complex specific (Htl1, Ldb7, Rsc1/2, Rsc3, Rsc30, Rsc4 and Rsc58). Three subunits, Arp7, Arp9 and Rtt102, are shared between RSC and SWI/SNF, and the two Arps have been found to be important for efficient remodeling activity of RSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clapier et al., 2016</xref>). The SWI/SNF paralog of Rsc8, Swi3, has been shown to be important for complex assembly and to likely play a scaffolding role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2007</xref>), while the paralog of Sfh1, Snf5, has been found to be important for remodeling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sen et al., 2017</xref>). RSC contains six bromodomains (BrDs), two in RSC1/2 and Rsc4, and one in Rsc58 and Sth1. Additionally, Rsc1/2 also contain a BAH domain. The BrD and BAH domains of RSC have all been shown to interact with histones H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chambers et al., 2013</xref>), with the BrDs favoring acetylated H3 tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), and in vitro binding assays have shown that the affinity of RSC for acetylated H3 nucleosomes is indeed greater than for unmodified nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chatterjee et al., 2011</xref>). In vivo deletions or mutations in these domains have been shown to decrease cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cairns et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kasten et al., 2004</xref>). The fungal-specific subunits Npl6, Htl1, Ldb7, Rsc3 and Rsc30, have been proposed to form a structural module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilson et al., 2006</xref>), with Npl6 and Htl1 interacting with Rsc8, and Ldb7 with Sth1 and Arp9. Rsc3 and Rsc30, which dimerize with each other, share a very similar architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angus-Hill et al., 2001</xref>), with an N-terminal Zinc cluster that has been shown to bind to the DNA sequence CGCG that preferentially occurs at gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Badis et al., 2008</xref>). Deletion of Rsc3 has been shown to weaken the ability of RSC to maintain NFR in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Badis et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>High-resolution structural studies of the SWI/SNF family of remodelers had until recently been limited to fragments, such as the Arp module (Arp7, Arp9 and some combination of Rtt102 and HSA helix of Snf2 [paralog to Sth1]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schubert et al., 2013</xref>), the SwiB domain of the human SMARCD (homolog of Rsc6), the WH domain of SMARCB (homolog of Sfh1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2015</xref>), the SWIRM domain of Swi3 (paralog of Rsc8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Da et al., 2006</xref>), the RPT domain of SMARCB (homolog of Sfh1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sammak et al., 2018</xref>), the SWIRM-RPT complex of SMARCC-SMARCB (homologs of Rsc8 and Sfh1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yan et al., 2017</xref>), the SANT domain of SMARCC (homolog of Rsc8), and the ATPase of Snf2 (homolog of Sth1) on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dürr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xia et al., 2016</xref>) and in complex with a nucleosome with different ATP analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Early structural studies of full SWI/SNF remodeling complexes by negative stain electron microscopy (EM) were limited by low resolution and/or reconstruction artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chaban et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dechassa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Asturias et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leschziner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leschziner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skiniotis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2003</xref>), with only one study able to map the location of some subunits within the complex (for the yeast SWI/SNF complex using subunit deletion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have used cryo-EM to determine the structure RSC. The core of the complex was resolved to 3 Å, which allowed us the de novo building of this entire region. The complex is scaffolded around a central Rsc8 dimer from which other evolutionarily conserved subunits assemble, leading to a model for the biogenesis of the complex that agrees with that previously proposed for human SWI-SNF complexes based on biochemical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mashtalir et al., 2018</xref>). We were also able to determine the structure of RSC bound to a nucleosome at 19 Å resolution, which, together with our structure of the core of RSC, and previous ones for the Arp module and nucleosome, allowed us to reveal how RSC engages nucleosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of RSC and RSC-NCP</title><p>We have used cryo-EM to determine the structure of the chromatin remodeler RSC from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> purified using the TAP-tag (on Sth1) method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

However, SWI/SNF lacks a tail lobe, indicating that while RSC and SWI/SNF share a conserved core architecture, RSC features additional regulatory domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Altogether, the core of RSC appears to bind the nucleosome in a well-defined orientation that in our docking-based model places the catalytic domain of Sth1 in a position that would allow it to interact with the SHL2. The fact that we observe nucleosome-bound RSC, even without a stable binding of the catalytic domain of Sth1 to the NCP, indicates that the contacts through the RSC core are sufficient for nucleosome engagement. It also makes our structure a likely intermediate in a pathway to full engagement of a nucleosome by RSC. We propose that the contacts made by the RSC core with the NCP contribute to the processivity of the nucleosome remodeling function of the catalytic domain of Sth1 (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Structural organization of RSC</title><p>The RSC core is critically defined by subunits Rsc8, Rsc6, Rsc9, Rsc58, Sth1, and Sfh1.

Most of the structured regions of Rsc6 are in the body, except for a small region at the very C-terminus of the protein (residues 445–483), which occupies the space in between the three lobes. Rsc9 also primarily located in the body, but for a small region at the very N-terminus terminus (residues 28–80) interacts with the surface of the arm and head lobes. The N-terminal BrD and C-terminal Scaffold II domain of Rsc58 are in the head lobe, while the central Scaffold I domain is in the body lobe. Sth1 spans three lobes, the head, body and leg. The Scaffold I domain is in the head while the Scaffold II domain goes between the body to the head and back to the body. From the RSC-NCP model, we observe that Sth1 then continues from the Scaffold II domain to the HSA helix that, along with Arp7, Arp9 and Rtt102, form the leg lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). From the HSA helix, Sth1 continues into the ATPase domain that would putatively bind the nucleosome at position SHL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

The helical bundle is made up of the two CC domains of Rsc8, along with the CC domains of Rsc6 and Htl1. This helical bundle interacts with the α-solenoid belly made up of the armadillo repeats of Rsc9 and the SwiB domain of Rsc6. Finally, the hook region off the belly contains β-strands from Rsc9 and Rsc6 that come to together to form a b-sandwich. Given the position of the Rsc9 sequences model in our structure, it is likely that the RFX-type WH of Rsc9 is part of the tail. In addition to these major structural regions there are some smaller elements that contribute to the body lobe. These include a segment of Rsc58 that binds between the belly and the backbone, a small segment of Sth1 that binds to the surface of the helical bundle, and a small segment of Sth1 that binds the surface of the armadillo repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The last two components of the body are the Rsc3 and Rsc30 dimer that binds the surface of the Rsc9 armadillo repeat on top of Sth1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The Rsc3 and Rsc30 dimer appears to be absent in 75% of the RSC particles that were used in the high-resolution analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), in agreement with previous findings showing that some RSC complexes lack Rsc3 and Rsc30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angus-Hill et al., 2001</xref>).

Of these proteins, only Rsc8 and Sth1 are evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that this region probably contributes to specific functions of the RSC complex. Rsc58, Rsc4 and Rsc1/2 are notable for containing histone reader domains: BrD and BAH domains. Only one other protein within RSC, Sth1, has a histone reader domain (a BrD). These domains have been shown to interact with acetylated lysines on histone tails, particularly H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chambers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chatterjee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duan and Smerdon, 2014</xref>).

RSC could then engage the nucleosome through its arm region and place the SHL2 site of the nucleosome in position to bind the flexibly tethered catalytic domain of Sth1. The ATPase domain would then be able to translocate the DNA around the histone octamer, while the core of RSC holds onto the histone core through its direct interactions with histones. This process is very likely to apply to all SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers, as they share the same architecture and contain the conserved subunits/domains involved in the steps just proposed. Specifically, all complexes have bromodomains to bind acetylated histones (minimally in the C-terminus of their catalytic subunit), a Sfh1 homolog to bind the acidic patch of the nucleosome, and a catalytic DNA translocase domain to remodel nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of nucleosome engagement.</title><p>Mechanistic model of RSC engaging a nucleosome.

The incorporation of the ARID subunits is followed by the addition of the ATPase module, which includes the conserved SMARCA, ACTB, and ACTL6A subunits, which are the homologs of yeast Sth1, Arp7, and Arp9, respectively.</p><p>It is important to note that this initial assembly process primarily involves evolutionarily conserved subunits and domains and is thus likely conserved for all SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015</xref>). This model is supported by the structural similarities we observe between the yeast SWI/SNF and RSC complexes (and in agreement with a recently reported structure of yeast SWI/SNF bound to a nucleosome by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2019</xref>). In the case of RSC, assembly would then continue with the addition of the yeast specific factor Npl6, which completes the arm lobe, and RSC-specific subunits Htl1, Rsc58, Rsc1/2, Rsc4, and Ldb7. These subunits either contribute to the scaffold of the complex (Htl1 and Ldb7), serve to anchor bromodomains to the core (Rsc1/2 and Rsc4), or both (Rsc58). The last two subunits to be recruited to the complex are likely the RSC-specific subunits Rsc3 and Rsc30, which form the tail module.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our studies provide the detailed structure for the conserved core of SWI/SNF complexes and lead to a model of assembly for this family of remodelers that agrees with previous biochemical data on mammalian complexes. Our work also provides a model of how RSC stably contacts the core histones in a nucleosome via its body module, while engaging nucleosomal DNA via the Sth1 ATPase. Both the structural integrity of the core and the interaction with nucleosomes rely on evolutionarily conserved subunits, while the non-conserved proteins in RSC are likely to play a role in recruitment and regulation of the complex. Future studies will be needed to understand the mechanisms by which individual members of the SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodelers are brought to different genome loci and are distinctly regulated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein purification</title><p>SWI/SNF was purified from <italic>Saccharomyces cerivisiae</italic> using a modified TAP purification as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nagai et al.

Additionally, segments of some chains we observe around this site appear to have been more flexible in the Ye et al. structure. The region of Sth1 attributed to residues (2-34) by Ye et al is assigned by us to correspond to Ldb7 residues 6–36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1s1">Appendix 1—figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, two β-strands within the β-sandwich that we identified as being the ZZ domain of Rsc8 were proposed to correspond to Rsc4 residues 429–449 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1s1">Appendix 1—figure 1—figure supplement 1B C, D</xref>). This resulted in a change in register for a third β-strand (residues 364–390) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1s1">Appendix 1—figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F, G, H</xref>). Within our map, we see connecting density between the SANT and ZZ domains of Rsc8 that allowed us to trace this chain.</p><p>Our docking of the ARP module into the leg density and prediction that the ATPase module would bind at the SHL2 site of the nucleosome matched well with the structure of Ye et al. Within their structure they were able to observe the binding of the ATPase domain to the SHL2 site. This likely explains the shift of the ARP module between our two reconstructions, with the ARP module closer to the nucleosome in their reconstruction then in ours. This likely means that the ARP module remains flexible to some degree until the ATPase module binds the nucleosome.</p><p>One major difference between the three structure of RSC bound to the nucleosome was the length of the DNA used in generating the nucleosome. We had only the 147 bp WIdom 601 sequence with no extranucleosomal DNA, Ye et al used the 147 bp WIdom 601 sequence with an additional 20 bp on one end making the total length 174 bp and Wagner et al used the 145 bp WIdom 601 with an additional 58 bp on one end and 37 bp on the other making the total length 237 bp. Due to the extra length of the extranucleosomal DNA in their structure, Wagner et al were able to observe the extranucleosomal DNA extending to the tail lobe where it appears to bind. In our RSC-NCP sample we also observe the tail lobe binding DNA but, in that case, the entire tail lobe is swiveled down towards the nucleosome and is interacting with the nucleosomal DNA. Due to the lack of resolution in both structures for this region, it was not possible to determine structure of the tail lobe and therefore, future studies will be required to identify full function of the tail of RSC.</p></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="appendix-2"><title>Appendix 2</title><boxed-text><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title>Sfh1 and SMARCB1 C-terminal α-helix binds nucleosomal acidic patch</title><p>During the submission of this manuscript two studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wagner et al. (2019)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Valencia et al.

In the study by Wagner et al, the structure of RSC-NCP was determined using cryo-EM and it was shown that a portion of the C-terminus of Sfh1 forms an α-helix and binds the acidic patch of the nucleosome. Valencia et al show that the C-terminal region of SMARCB1 (Sfh1 homolog) forms an α-helix by NMR. Additionally, these authors showed that this α-helix will crosslink to residues near the acidic patch of the nucleosome and by computational docking that this α-helix will bind the acidic patch of the nucleosome. Valencia et al also showed that deletions of mutations in this helix reduced remodeling efficiency in vitro but did not prevent nuclear localization in vivo. These last two findings support our proposal that that Sfh1 and the arm lobe plat a role in nucleosome engagement but not RSC recruitment.</p></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="appendix-3"><title>Appendix 3</title><boxed-text><sec id="s10" sec-type="appendix"><title>Structural comparison of RSC and SWI/SNF</title><p>During the submission of this manuscript the structure of SWI/SNF bound to a nucleosome was published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al. (2019)</xref>. While at the time of final submission of this manuscript, the structure by Han et al has not been deposited yet, and a direct comparison could not be made, several clear similarities and differences are apparent. While the overall structure of SWI/SNF and RSC appear to be similar with respect to organization of homologous subunits, the resulting shape of the complex differs. The core of RSC appears to have three distinct lobes (head, body and arm) but in the case of SWI/SNF the core appears to form a single triangular shaped lobe.</p><p>The biggest difference between the two remodelers appears to stem form the lack of many of the head lobe components of RSC in SWI/SNF (e.g. Rsc58, Rsc1/2, Rsc4 and Ldb7). Because of this, the remaining head lobe components of SWI/SNF, the SANT domains of Swi3 (Rsc8 homolog) and the anchor domain of Snf2 (homologous to the Scaffold II domain of Sth1), interact more closely with the body lobe.</p><p>The body lobe of SWI/SNF is organized in a similar way as in RSC, but the overall shape appears different. While Swi1, Swi3 and Swp73 are similar to their RSC counterparts Rsc9, Rsc8 and Rsc6, they are different enough so that the body appears to curve toward the arm lobe in SWI/SNF as opposed to away from it, as in RSC. Interestingly it appears that Swi6 may be homologous to Htl1 as they share similar binding sites in the helical bundle within the body.</p><p>The region most similar between RSC and SWI/SNF appears to be the arm lobe. This may be due to structural or functional constraints, considering that it is the arm lobe of both complexes that interacts the nucleosome. However, the arms of the two complexes bind over the nucleosome at different positions. The arm of RSC binds over the H2A/H2B dimer of the nucleosome while in SWI/SNF, the arm binds over the H3/H4 surface. So, it remains to be seen why the binding sites for the arm lobes is different between these two complexes despite the lobes themselves being so similar.</p></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54449.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Wolberger</surname><given-names>Cynthia</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The RSC complex is nucleosome remodeler that maintains nucleosome-free regions in yeast and is the most abundant member of the SWI/SNF family of enzymes. This paper reports the cryo EM structure of the RSC complex core, containing 14 of the 17 RSC subunits. The structure reveals the architecture of the complex, and the similarities and differences as compared to other SWI/SNF remodelers. A low-resolution structure of RSC bound to a nucleosome core particle suggest a model for how RSC engages its substrate. Taken together, this work is an important advance in the chromatin and transcription fields, and provides a structural basis for interpreting previous biochemical studies in order to derive a possible model for RSC assembly and function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54449.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors' note: we include below the reviews that the authors received from another journal, along with the authors’ responses.]</p><p>As you will see the paper has been significantly changed. While all the original content is still present, we have restructured most of this. This was in part to fit the <italic>eLife</italic> format but also to accommodate the additional discussion on analyzing our structure. In addition to these changes and additions we have also added (as was asked) a comparison of our structure with the one published in Science by Ye et al. The comparison has been added as Appendix I. We also included two other Appendices (II and III) which cover three new papers: 1) [Valencia et al., Cell] on the analysis of SMARCB1 C-terminus and its ability to bind the acidic patch of the nucleosome, 2) [Wagner et al., bioRxiv] on the structure of RSC bound to a nucleosome, and 3) on the SWI/SNF bound to a nucleosome.</p><p>Overall, we felt that while some of the issues raised by the reviewers are understandable and will help us revise our manuscript, others are not.</p><p>One of the major areas of concern raised was that the assembly process could not be determined from our structure alone. This is indeed true, but it misses the fact that our model is based not only on our structure, but also on published literature (citation 16: Mashtalir, N. et al.) that provides biochemical data in support of our model. To emphasize this, we will change “The pattern of protein‐protein interactions observed in our structure provides insight into RSC assembly” to “Based on the observed protein-protein contacts in our structure of RSC and previous mass spectrometry analysis of the assembly of human BAF complexes, we propose a model for RSC assembly”. In this way we clarify that the model we propose originates from previous biochemical data and that our structure can now help to rationalize this model at the domain level. While we thought that this would be obvious, given that the literature describing the assembly process is highly cited in our work, it appears that both reviewers 1 and 2 did not recognize this and we will make it as clear as possible in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We have now included more extensive discussion on this by referencing the key intermediates that Mashtalir et al. have found.</p><p>The other major issue that was brought up (by reviewer 1 and 2) was that our cryo-EM structure of the RSC-NCP was too low of a resolution and that our claims about the structure were too speculative. While it is true that our structure of nucleosome-bound RSC is at low resolution (similar to previously published structures) nearly all previous reconstructions were of very low quality (e.g. Leschziner et al., 2007, Yuriy et al., NSMB 2008, Dechassa et al., 2008 and Zhang et al., 2018). It should be noted that resolution does not always accurately measure map quality. Therefore, while our map is at a similar resolution to previous reconstructions it does not suffer from the clear misalignment, anisotropy, and apparent flattening of previous works. Specifically, the EM map by Zhang et al., which was suggested by reviewer 1 to be of similar quality to ours, suffers from severe flattening and precludes fitting of the molecular components, as revealed by even the most cursory inspection. We therefore strongly disagree with the claim that our structure does not provide significant new insight into the architecture of nucleosome-bound RSC. Based on our map, we can unambiguously dock and assign all observable density, the core, the ARP module and the nucleosome. As far as not being able to observe any bromodomain density we would like to point out that one would not expect to see these domains because they are flexibly attached to the core of the complex and even in the case of the nucleosome bound complex, they would be interacting with histone tails, which are themselves also flexible.</p><p>The remaining issues raised by reviewer 1 are hard to comprehend.</p><p>Specifically, (i) the issue with Rsc3 and Rsc30 being sub-stoichiometric has been well documented and the corresponding literature has been cited in our paper; (ii) we do not think that measuring complex stoichiometry based on the gel or running a glycerol gradient to ascertain that we indeed purified an assembled complex is worthwhile, given that we have a 3-Å resolution structure of the core of complex; (iii) we cite 2 of the 3 key papers the reviewer mentions we “missed” (which includes one authored by some of the co-authors of our study), while the third is only tangentially relevant.</p><p>It is our assessment that the paper can be revised to clarify some of the issues raised by the reviewers. However, several of the issues raised are not applicable, as detailed above.</p><p>In addition to these general considerations, we provide point-by-point answers to the reviewers’ comments below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the first part of this paper, the authors use cryo-EM to determine the structure of free RSC, one of two SWI/SNF complexes present in yeast, and were able to resolve the core of this complex to 3.1 angstroms. The core has a more rigid region consisting of a head, body, and arm regions plus a more flexible leg region. The structure they observe is at a higher resolution than any previously reported structure for a SWI/SNF complex and provides detailed information about the subunit-subunit interactions within this complex. They complement their cryo-EM structure by also probing the structure using chemical crosslinking and mass spectrometry (CL<sup>-</sup>MS) in collaboration with the Ranish lab.</p><p>In support of their CL<sup>-</sup>MS results they cite similar data from the Kadoch lab, but missed the earlier work from Sen et al., 2017, using yeast SWI/SNF that is actually more similar to RSC.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not use the work of the Kadoch lab to support our CL<sup>-</sup>MS results. Their work is mainly cited for the assembly process that they propose. The work of Sen et al. is cited (number 22) for other findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From their data it was not clear how they handled the heterogeneity of RSC since their purified enzyme had both Rsc1 or Rsc2, which are mutually exclusively of each other in the complex, and raises the question why they didn’t tag Rsc1 or Rsc2 so they could purify one or the other form of the RSC complex.</p></disp-quote><p>In our cryo-EM data processing we did not find that the complexes could be distinguished based on whether they contain Rsc1 or Rsc2. However, we did find a region in our cryo-EM map where we could model a small region of Rsc1 and 2 that is highly similar between these two proteins. It is worth noting that the sequences of Rsc1 and Rsc2 are &gt;40% identical and another 20% is highly homologous, suggesting that they form highly similar contacts within RSC.</p><p>We reasoned that if Rsc1 or 2 lead to two structurally distinct complexes we would be able to distinguish these computationally, while otherwise, the two can be treated as the same. The latter ended up being the case as the regions that anchor the two proteins into the core of the complex are highly similar.</p><p>We have included an additional figure (Figure 1 - figure supplement 6) showing an alignment of the regions of RSC1 and 2 we modeled and its fit into the density.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful if in the paper the authors stated which portions of each of the 14 different subunits were visualized in the core and were well resolved and which portions were too flexible to be resolved.</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 4 contains this information.</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 4 was essentially indiscernible and needs to be remade so that it can be actually read.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made a new version of the domain map figure for the main text (Figure 1F). It does not have the secondary structure prediction or sequence conservation mapped on to the domain map. Instead it the modeled region shown in much larger font. We chose to keep the original figure (we made some changes) in the supplement (Figure 1—figure supplement 4) because the secondary structure predication was used when building to assign proteins to chains.

At this resolution it is not possible to readily discern the structural features or subunit organization of how RSC interact with nucleosomes. The other serious issue with this structure is the lack of observable density of the ATPase domain where it should be engaging nucleosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>While our resolution is not significantly better than the work of Zhang et al., our reconstruction is far more homogeneous and isotropic, and thus allowed use to unambiguously dock the structure of the nucleosome. Additionally, we performed cryo-EM where we are able to observe the nucleic acid of the nucleosome far better then what is possible in negative stain, which was the method used by Zhang et al. We also want to emphasize that the map by Zhang et al. suffers from severe flattening while ours does not.</p><p>While we are not certain of why we do not observe clear density for the ATPase domain, one possibility is that the stability of the interaction is reduced in the absence of extranucleosomal DNA.

We used acetylated nucleosome because is has been shown that RSC has a higher affinity for H3 acetylated nucleosomes” (citations 24, 25, and 26 can be used as well as others).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The assumption that the structure of free RSC remains the same when bound to nucleosomes as used in this paper is too much of an extrapolation and suffers from the lack of data. There seems to be too much prediction and modeling used in this part, all because of the lack of resolution of the nucleosome-bound structure. The authors are left to make correlations based on previous data and are unable to truly move the field forward in terms of how RSC interacts with nucleosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with this statement. While we do not have high resolution for the core of RSC in our RSC-NCP structure, we can still see that the overall shape remains the same. We can fit the core of RSC, the ARP module and NCP unambiguously into our RSC-NCP map.</p><p>We did use existing structures of the ARP and NCP and our newly determined RSC core structure for docking, and, as we stated, we were able to <italic>unambiguously</italic> place them within the lower resolution structure. For this reason, our model cannot consider “too much of an extrapolation.”</p><p>Lastly while we do not have high resolution for the regions that interact with the nucleosome, through the unambiguous docking of high-resolution structures of the pieces we are able to indicate what regions are interacting with the nucleosome (Sfh1, Rtt102 and Npl6) and which are not (the SWIRM, ZZ and SANT domains of Rsc8 – all of which have been predicted to bind DNA or nucleosomes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the nucleosome has four acetylated lysines, there doesn’t seem to be any clear discernible structure showing the six bromodomains of RSC interacting with their likely targets.

I also found Figure 3 hard to read as the text is too small.</p></disp-quote><p>As we explain in the paper, the bromodomains are likely flexible with respect to the core. This is part of the reason we do not see them. We are also unlikely to see the bromodomains in the RSC-NCP complex, as the flexible bromodomains would be interacting with flexible histone tails, making them very flexible relative to the rest of the RSC-NCP complex.</p><p>We have cited Chatterjee et al.

This reveals a tripartite core made up of the Sth1, RSC8, RSC9, Sfh1, Rsc6 subunits, which are conserved in evolution. As a result, the findings are likely to inform structure of human complexes that play important roles in a range of human diseases.</p><p>The structure refers to lower resolution negative stain structure of the SWI/SNF complex. From this it is concluded that SWI/SNF is likely to lack the tail lobe. As the tail lobe is not well resolved in RSC, an alternative is that it is dynamic in SWI/SNF and not resolved.</p></disp-quote><p>This is true. However, we can include 2D-class averages where we can see a tail density for RSC and not SWI/SNF. The reason we do not see the tail density in 3D is because we did not sort for it, and as it is sub-stoichiometric, it is only observable at much lower density thresholds. We can however do the sorting in 3D to show this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The structure of the complex is used to infer the pathway by which it is assembled. It is incorrect to do this. No measurements have been made of the timing with which nascent proteins associate, and assembly intermediates predicted to arise in the absence of different subunits have not been identified. The structure defines interfaces that indicate how the complex is held together, not how it is assembled, and the manuscript should be re-written to reflect this.</p></disp-quote><p>We can change “The pattern of protein‐protein interactions observed in our structure provides insight into RSC assembly” to “Based on the observable protein-protein contacts in our structure of RSC, along with previous mass spectrometry analysis of the assembly of human BAF complexes, we propose a model for RSC assembly.”</p><p>We chose to build off the model that was proposed in a recent paper from the Kadoch lab (citation 16: Mashtalir, N. et al.). In their study, Mashtalir et al. did not investigate how nascent proteins associate, but they did identify “assembly intermediates predicted to arise in the absence of different subunits” by knocking out a subunit and analyzing the resulting complexes by mass spectrometry. What our work adds to theirs is subunit detail as we can see which subunits are interacting and suggest what their model would look like in atomic detail. This needs to be made clearer in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A low-resolution structure of RSC bound to a nucleosome is also provided. This should be submitted as a separate EMDB submission with statistics. Given the low resolution, it is highly speculative to describe interaction surfaces for components of the complex, such as bromodomains and the protein surfaces that contact nucleosomes. The nucleosome complex is used to propose a mechanism for remodelling involving, for example, interactions with histone acetylation marks. However, the manuscript adds nothing new in this respect as none of the interactions with acetylated histones are resolved.</p></disp-quote><p>We will be depositing the RSC-NCP map to the EMDB and can include an FSC curve to Figure 1—figure supplement 8.

The SWI/SNF family of remodelers have been studied extensively over the past several decades and are of high biological importance. While low resolution reconstructions of SWI/SNF modelers have been determined, the only high-resolution data that exists for SWI/SNF remodelers are of the ATPase domain alone and bound to the nucleosome.</p><p>Here, Patel et al. used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of apo RSC to near atomic resolution, as well as a low-resolution structure of RSC bound to the nucleosome. The overall structure can be subdivided into 5 distinct modules that include portions of 14 of its 17 subunits. Subunit assignments were verified by mass spectrometry crosslinking experiments. The main body of the structure is constructed around a Rsc8 dimer, and the authors put forth a model for how RSC assembles into a complex. Surprisingly, the ATPase domain is not resolved in either structure, suggesting that the ATPase-containing module is extremely flexible. The structure of RSC is a seminal achievement and will not only shed new insights on decades of past biochemical research but be informative for future studies on SWI/SNF remodeling.</p><p>Overall, there are no major issues that need to be addressed.
