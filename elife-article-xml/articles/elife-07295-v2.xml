The ABA biosynthesis genes <italic>NCED3</italic> and <italic>NCED5</italic> were identified as direct targets required for WRKY33-mediated resistance. Loss-of-WRKY33 function resulted in elevated ABA levels and genetic studies confirmed that WRKY33 acts upstream of <italic>NCED3/NCED5</italic> to negatively regulate ABA biosynthesis.

One fungus called <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> is able to infect many different species of crop plants—including tomatoes and grapes—and can cause severe damage both before and after harvest. This fungus belongs to a group of microbes that kill the plant cells they invade and then extract the nutrients from the dead cells.</p><p>Some plants are able to resist infection by <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and researchers have identified several proteins that are involved in this resistance. One such protein is called WRKY33, which is able to bind to DNA to regulate the activity of particular genes. However, it was not clear exactly which genes were involved in the response to <italic>B. cinerea.</italic></p><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> is a small flowering plant that is often used in research. Mutant <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants lacking WRKY33 are very susceptible to infection with <italic>B. cinerea</italic>. Here, Liu et al. use several genetic techniques to find out which genes WRKY33 regulates when <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants are exposed to the fungus. The experiments indicate that WRKY33 can alter the activity of over 300 genes. Some of these genes had previously been shown to be targets of WRKY33 and are involved in cell responses to plant hormones and the production of an antimicrobial molecule called camalexin.</p><p>Liu et al. also show that two genes called <italic>NCED3</italic> and <italic>NCED5</italic>—which are required for the production of a plant hormone called abscisic acid—are repressed by WRKY33. Mutant plants lacking WRKY33 had increased levels of abscisic acid and further experiments suggested that the repression of <italic>NCED3</italic> and <italic>NCED5</italic> by WRKY33 is important to resistance against the fungus.</p><p>Liu et al.'s findings provide the first detailed view of which genes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> are regulated by WRKY33 when the plant is exposed to <italic>B. cinerea</italic>. A future challenge is to understand how blocking the production of abscisic acid protects plants against <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and other similar fungi.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07295.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07295.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>global &lt;italic&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/italic&gt; WRKY33 binding site<italic>Arabidopsis</italic> WRKY33 binding sites</kwd><kwd>WRKY33-mediated resistance</kwd><kwd>ABA signaling</kwd><kwd>ChIP-seq</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IMPRS PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Shouan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 670</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Somssich</surname><given-names>Imre E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A genome-wide view of the gene regulatory network governed by WRKY33 has identified key targets that negatively regulate ABA biosynthesis to provide immunity against infection by a necrotrophic fungus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Necrotrophic fungi including <italic>Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, and <italic>Alternaria brassicicola</italic> are the largest class of fungal phytopathogens causing serious crop losses worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Łaźniewska et al., 2010</xref>). These pathogens extract nutrients from dead host cells by producing a variety of phytotoxic compounds and cell wall degrading enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Williamson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mengiste, 2012</xref>). <italic>B. cinerea</italic> has a broad host-range, causes pre- and postharvest disease, and is the second most agriculturally important fungal plant pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dean et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Plant immunity towards <italic>B. cinerea</italic> appears to be under complex poorly understood genetic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rowe and Kliebenstein, 2008</xref>). Apart from the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana RESISTANCE TO LEPTOSPHAERIA MACULANS 3</italic> (<italic>RLM3</italic>), no major <italic>R-gene</italic> has been associated with resistance to necrotrophs. However, over the past two decades numerous genes that influence the outcome of <italic>B. cinerea</italic>—host interactions have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mengiste, 2012</xref>). Among these are several transcription factors (TFs) consistent with the large transcriptional reprogramming observed in host cells upon <italic>Botrytis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birkenbihl and Somssich, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birkenbihl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Windram et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, several MYB-type TFs regulate distinct host transcriptional responses towards <italic>B. cinerea</italic>. BOS1 (<italic>BOTRYTIS SUSCEPTIBLE 1</italic>)/MYB108 appears to restrict necrosis triggered by <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and <italic>A. brassicicola</italic>, and loss-of-BOS1 function increased plant susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mengiste, 2012</xref>). In response to stress and <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection, BOS1 physically interacts with and is ubiquitinated by BOI, a RING E3 ligase that contributes to defense by restricting the extent of necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Luo et al., 2010</xref>). MYB51 is involved in the transcriptional activation of indole glucosinolate biosynthetic genes, which also contributes to resistance towards necrotrophs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kliebenstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sánchez-Vallet et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, the MYB-related genes <italic>ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 1 (AS1)</italic> and <italic>MYB46</italic> appear to play a role in disease susceptibility as such mutants show increased disease resistance towards <italic>B. cinerea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nurmberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ramírez et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Ethylene and jasmonic acid (ET, JA) signaling are critical for host immunity to necrotrophic pathogens, and several transcriptional activators and repressors of the ET and JA pathways impact resistance to <italic>B. cinerea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glazebrook, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bari and Jones, 2009</xref>). In particular the TFs ERF1, ORA59, ERF5, ERF6, and RAP2.2, have regulatory functions in host susceptibility to this fungus. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berrocal-Lobo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pré et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moffat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). Transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines overexpressing <italic>ERF1</italic> or <italic>ORA59</italic> confer resistance to <italic>B. cinerea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kazan and Manners, 2013</xref>), whereas <italic>RNAi-ORA59</italic> silenced lines were more susceptible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berrocal-Lobo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pré et al., 2008</xref>). Both ERF1 and ORA59 appear to be the key integrators of the ET- and JA-signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pieterse et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, the bHLH transcription factor MYC2/JIN1 is a master regulator of diverse JA-mediated responses by antagonistically regulating two distinct branches of the JA signaling pathway in response to necrotrophs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kazan and Manners, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The WRKY family of TFs modulates numerous host immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pandey and Somssich, 2009</xref>). In particular, WRKY33 is a key positive regulator of host defense to both <italic>A. brassicicola</italic> and <italic>B. cinerea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birkenbihl et al., 2012</xref>). WRKY33 was directly phosphorylated in vivo by the MAP kinases MPK3 and MPK6 upon <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection and subsequently activated <italic>PAD3</italic> expression by direct binding to its promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mao et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>PAD3</italic> encodes a key biosynthetic enzyme required for the production of the antimicrobial compound camalexin. Moreover, WRKY33 directly interacted with its own promoter, suggesting a positive feedback regulatory loop on <italic>WRKY33</italic> expression. WRKY33 was also found to interact with the VQ-motif containing protein MAP KINASE SUBSTRATE1 (MKS1/VQ21) and to form a ternary complex with the MAP kinase MPK4 within the nucleus of resting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreasson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Qiu et al., 2008</xref>). Upon challenge with the hemibiotrophic pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> or upon elicitation by the microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) flg22, the active epitope of the bacterial flagella, activated MPK4 phosphorylates MKS1 thereby releasing WRKY33 from the complex and leading to its detection at the <italic>PAD3</italic> promoter.</p><p>We previously reported that activation of <italic>Arabidopsis WRKY33</italic> resulted in rapid and massive host transcriptional reprogramming upon infection with <italic>B. cinerea</italic> strain 2100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birkenbihl et al., 2012</xref>). Compared to resistant wild-type (WT) plants, susceptible <italic>wrky33</italic> mutants displayed early inappropriate activation of salicylic acid (SA)-related host responses, elevated SA and JA levels, and down-regulation of JA-associated responses at later infection stages. Consistent with these results ChIP analysis demonstrated that WRKY33 directly binds to the regulatory regions of <italic>JAZ1</italic> and <italic>JAZ5</italic>, two genes encoding repressors of JA signaling, but also to the ERF class TF gene <italic>ORA59</italic> involved in JA-ET crosstalk, and to two camalexin biosynthesis genes <italic>CYP71A13</italic> and <italic>PAD3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birkenbihl et al., 2012</xref>). Although <italic>pad3</italic> plants are susceptible to <italic>B. cinerea</italic> 2100, <italic>wrky33</italic> mutants are more highly susceptible. Genetic studies revealed that altered SA responses at later infection stages may contribute to the susceptibility of <italic>wrky33</italic> to <italic>B. cinerea</italic>, but were insufficient for WRKY33-mediated resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birkenbihl et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, WRKY33 apparently targets additional genes whose functions are critical for establishing full WRKY33-dependent resistance towards this necrotroph.</p><p>In this paper, we performed ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses to identify WRKY33-regulated target genes in the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome following infection with <italic>B. cinerea</italic> 2100. The study uncovered numerous targets many of which are associated with the regulation of hormonal signaling pathways. Expression of the majority of WRKY33 direct targets is down-regulated upon infection, but some notably genes of camalexin biosynthesis are strongly up-regulated, indicating that WRKY33 is a dual functional TF acting in a promoter-context dependent manner. Subsequent genetic and hormonal studies verified components of abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis as being critical for WRKY33-dependent resistance towards this necrotrophic fungus. This study provides the first genome-wide view of the gene regulatory network underlying plant immunity governed by a host specific TF.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide detection of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> WRKY33 binding sites in response to <italic>B. cinerea</italic> 2100</title><p>To gain a deeper insight into how WRKY33 regulates plant immunity towards <italic>B. cinerea</italic> 2100, we performed ChIP-seq for genome-wide in vivo identification of WRKY33 DNA-binding sites.

Using the DREME/MEME software, we determined conserved consensus sequences within high confidence WRKY33 binding sites across the genome. Of the 1684 identified WRKY33 binding regions, 80% contained the well-established W-box motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We also found W-box extended sequence motifs within the WRKY33 binding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). These W-box extended motifs also included the core sequence GACTTTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which was reported to be bound by <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> WRKY70 and to be required for WRKY70-activated gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Machens et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Apart from the W-box and W-box variants, we found one additional sequence motif, T/GTTGAAT that occurs in 60% of the WRKY33 binding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). More than 48% (817 out of 1684) of WRKY33 binding peaks contained both this new motif and the W-box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We performed electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA) using recombinant WRKY33 protein to determine whether this newly identified DNA element is bound by WRKY33. Two DNA oligonucleotide probes were synthesized whose sequences were derived from two WRKY33 targets (<italic>WAKL7, PROPEP3</italic>) containing either one or three copies of the motif, respectively. A previously described DNA oligonucleotide containing three W-boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mao et al., 2011</xref>) and a W-box mutated version hereof W-boxmut served as positive and negative controls. A clear interaction (mobility shift) was observed between WRKY33 and the labeled W-box probe but not with W-boxmut and the two probes harboring the T/GTTGAAT motifs (M-3 and M-7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Specificity of W-box binding was confirmed in competition experiments, wherein only an excess of the W-box probe was able to compete for binding of the protein. Thus, T/GTTGAAT does not appear to be a WRKY33 direct binding site and its functionality remains unclear.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Differential expression of WRKY33 target genes upon <italic>B. cinerea</italic> 2100 infection</title><p>ChIP-seq studies in different organisms have revealed that the majority of binding sites bound by specific TFs in vivo do not result in altered expression levels of associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacQuarrie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate the impact of WRKY33 binding on target gene expression, we performed RNA-seq and examined <italic>WRKY33</italic>-mediated gene expression changes in mock and <italic>B. cinerea</italic> 2100 (14 hpi) treated 4-week old <italic>wrky33</italic> and WT plants. Three independent biological replicates were generated and analyzed allowing us to identify genes with consistently altered expression after inoculation. In WT plants, the expression of 6101 genes was altered twofold or more (p ≤ 0.05) compared to non-infected plants, with 3048 genes being up-regulated and 3053 genes being down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In <italic>wrky33</italic>, upon infection, the expression of 7441 genes was altered more than twofold, 3583 of them being up-regulated and 3858 down-regulated. A common set of 4686 genes showed changes upon infection in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Comparative profiling of mock treated plants identified 705 genes that were differentially expressed between <italic>wrky33</italic> and WT in the absence of the pathogen, 458 of them being up-regulated and 247 down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Comparing the expression profiles of <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infected <italic>wrky33</italic> and WT plants (<italic>wrky33 B.c</italic> vs WT <italic>B.c</italic>), we identified 2765 differentially expressed genes dependent on WRKY33, of which 1675 were up-regulated in the mutant (termed WRKY33-repressed genes) and 1090 were down-regulated in the mutant (termed WRKY33-induced genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>).</p><p>We then compared the WRKY33-dependent differentially expressed gene set obtained by RNA-seq with the WRKY33 target gene set revealed by ChIP-seq. This comparison identified 318 WRKY33-regulated target genes that were both bound by WRKY33 and exhibited WRKY33-dependent altered gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Of these, 240 (75%) were repressed upon infection while 78 (25%) were induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). We named those genes WRKY33-repressed targets and WRKY33-induced targets, respectively. Based on this analysis, WRKY33 appears to have a prominent repressive role on the transcription of many specific host genes indicating a negative regulatory function of WRKY33 in mediating immunity to this pathogen. Genes displaying altered expression in the <italic>wrky33</italic> mutant compared to WT but showing no binding of WRKY33 at their respective gene loci were defined as WRKY33-dependent non-targets (1435 WRKY33-repressed non-targets and 1012 WRKY33-induced non-targets; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The overlap between observed WRKY33 binding and altered expression of the associated genes upon fungal infection was around 20% (318 of 1576). This fraction is similar to values reported for other plant TFs such as EIN3, HBI1, and BES1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>WRKY33 represses transcription of many plant immunity genes</title><p>Compared to the entire genome the identified WRKY33-regulated targets were significantly enriched in gene onthology (GO) categories involved in diverse biological processes and molecular functions related to different forms of stress, external and endogenous stimuli, signal transduction, transport, metabolic processes and catalytic activity (p &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and many of these genes are repressed upon <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). For example, genes related to ‘defense response’ were highly overrepresented among WRKY33-repressed targets (38%) and in the WRKY33-repressed non-target sets (17%), suggesting that WRKY33 mainly functions as a repressor of plant defense responses. However, it is important to note that nearly 18% of the WRKY33-induced targets were associated to defense responses compared to only 3% of the WRKY33-induced non-targets. This indicates that WRKY33 can also act as a direct activator of defense gene expression, very likely in a promoter-context dependent manner. Particularly prominent among the WRKY33-induced targets are genes associated with responses to the phytohormone ethylene (ET; 21%).</p><p>Apart from hormonal pathways discussed below, genes associated with the GO terms ‘cell death’ or related to diverse ‘kinase activities’ were markedly enriched among WRKY33-repressed targets and non-targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). 42 out of 318 WRKY33-regulated targets are involved in cell death, and 38 of these appear to be repressed by WRKY33 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). This WRKY33-mediated repression may be an important feature required to reinforce resistance towards the necrotroph <italic>B. cinerea</italic> that depends on dead host tissue to complete its life cycle. Furthermore, 41 of the WRKY33-regulated target genes encode for various kinases, and again the majority of these genes appear to be negatively regulated by WRKY33 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). For the WRKY33-regulated target <italic>LecRK VI.2</italic>, a critical role in resistance against hemibiotrophic <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. tomato DC3000 and necrotrophic <italic>Pectobacterium carotovorum</italic> bacteria has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Singh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Several TF gene families involved in defense were targeted by WRKY33. In total, WRKY33 binding was found at 133 TF gene loci. Predominant among these are members of the AP2/ERFs, MYBs, WRKYs, and NACs families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, expression of only 16% (21 of 133) of these genes was directly modulated in a WRKY33-dependent manner after <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection (complete list see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>). WRKY factors are predicted to form a highly interconnected regulatory sub-network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Llorca et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, 18 <italic>WRKY</italic> genes were identified as direct targets of WRKY33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, only seven genes, <italic>WRKY33, WRKY38, WRKY41, WRK48, WRKY50, WRKY53,</italic> and <italic>WRKY55,</italic> showed altered expression upon WRKY33 binding at 14 or 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

The TF WRKY33 plays a major role in conferring resistance of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants to the fungal necrotroph <italic>B. cinerea</italic>. In the present work, combined genome-wide binding studies and transcriptional analyses allowed us to identify WRKY33 binding sites within the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome upon fungal infection, and to correlate WRKY33 binding to altered transcriptional outputs. By including appropriate mutants in this study, we identified components of the ABA hormonal pathway that act downstream of WRKY33 to mediate host resistance.</p><p>Such a genome-wide analysis of in vivo target sites for a selected TF expressed under its native promoter in intact pathogen-infected plant tissue has not yet been reported. Thus, in a broader perspective, this study also sets the framework for establishing a comprehensive gene regulatory network model of plant immunity.</p><p>The number of high-affinity WRKY33 binding sites within the genome by far exceeds the number of direct WRKY33 target genes affected in their transcriptional response during <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection. Overall, 80% of the WRKY33 targets were not significantly differentially expressed in the <italic>wrky33</italic> mutant upon infection compared to WT. This excess number of gene loci bound by a given TF but unaffected in their expression is consistent with previous ChIP-seq studies although the reasons for this discrepancy remain to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacQuarrie et al., 2011</xref>). One plausible explanation may be that transcriptional activation/repression at specific promoter sites is context dependent, and may require, apart from WRKY33 binding, additional diverse signaling inputs. For example, we detected strong enrichment of WRKY33 within the promoters of numerous genes coding for receptors of various MAMPs and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) including <italic>FLS2</italic>, <italic>EFR</italic>, <italic>CERK1, PEPR1</italic>, and <italic>PEPR2</italic>, but no altered expression of these genes in the <italic>wrky33</italic> mutant upon <italic>Botrytis</italic> infection. <italic>WRKY33</italic> is also strongly and rapidly induced during MAMP/DAMP-triggered immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lippok et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yamaguchi et al., 2010</xref>), and thus a regulatory function of WRKY33 at these promoters may require additional signals/co-factors only triggered during MAMP/DAMP signaling. Additionally, spatial and temporal differences in the activation of target genes need to be considered. The current paper provides a snapshot of global WRKY33 function during <italic>Botrytis</italic> infection. Whether WRKY33 binding results in temporally distinct transcription patterns, as was observed for EIN3 in the ethylene response, remains to be investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). However, such studies employing living pathogens on intact host plants remain challenging due to the asynchrony of the infection process at various cellular sites within the tissue.</p><p>Nevertheless, using conservative criteria for selecting differentially expressed genes in <italic>wrky33</italic> mutants compared to WT plants after <italic>B. cinerea</italic> 2100 infection, about 2600 genes were identified that showed transcriptional up- or down-regulation.

The receptors for ABA are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miyakawa et al., 2013</xref>), but the molecular mechanisms linking downstream ABA signaling to the other hormonal pathways require further investigation. It is conceivable that the increased ABA levels in <italic>wrky33</italic> during <italic>Botrytis</italic> infection trigger the activation of currently unidentified downstream ABA-response factors that bind to the ABA response elements (ABRE, ACGTGG/T) or G-boxes (CACGTG) present in some gene promoters, resulting in transcriptional activation.

In addition, the elevated levels of SA in <italic>wrky33</italic> during <italic>Botrytis</italic> infection may in part be responsible for the strong expression of the glutaredoxin gene <italic>GRX480/ROXY19</italic> observed in this mutant (RNA-seq data in this study; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birkenbihl et al., 2012</xref>).

The simplest hypothesis would be that WRKY33 is recruited to distinct repressor and activator complexes at defined promoter sites. For instance, several WRKY33-interacting proteins containing a VQ motif have been discovered that influence defense gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pecher et al., 2014</xref>). VQ proteins appear to act as suppressors of defense-related genes via their interaction with WRKY factors. Indeed, the protein VQ4/MVQ1 appears to function as a negative regulator of WRKY-type transcriptional activators including WRKY33. In a transient <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplast assay, stimulation by MAMPs resulted in degradation of VQ4/MVQ1 following MAPK-mediated phosphorylation enabling WRKY33 to activate transcription of a defense-related reporter gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pecher et al., 2014</xref>). Two other proteins, SIB1 and SIB2, have been reported to interact with WRKY33 via their VQ motifs. This interaction was required to stimulate WRKY33 DNA-binding activity and very likely to positively regulate WRKY33-mediated resistance to necrotrophic fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lai et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, four VQ protein genes (<italic>VQ8, VQ22/JAV1, VQ28, VQ33</italic>) are also direct targets of WRKY33 and show altered expression upon <italic>Botrytis</italic> infection in <italic>wrky33</italic> compared to WT. VQ22/JAV1 functions as a negative regulator of JA-mediated defenses, and transgenic VQ22/JAV1 RNAi lines showed enhanced resistance to <italic>B. cinerea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, elevated levels of these VQ proteins in <italic>wrky33</italic> may contribute to the suppression of JA signaling and susceptibility to this fungus.</p><p>Finally, many members of the WRKY TF gene family, including <italic>WRKY33</italic> itself, are also targets of WRKY33. The majority of <italic>WRKY</italic> genes are transcriptionally activated during immune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pandey and Somssich, 2009</xref>). Experimental and bioinformatics analyses have revealed that WRKY factors form a complex and highly interconnected regulatory sub-network that is positively and negatively affected by auto- and cross-regulation by various WRKY factors. This WRKY web appears to be deeply interconnected to various hormonal pathways at multiple levels, probably to ensure rapid and efficient signal amplification while allowing for tighter control in limiting the extent of the host immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eulgem, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Llorca et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In summary, genome-wide binding analysis and transcriptional profiling have identified potential targets of WRKY33, a key transcription factor involved in mediating resistance towards the necrotroph <italic>B. cinerea</italic> 2100. This study revealed that genes involved in ABA biosynthesis and directly regulated by WRKY33 act at crucial nodes in this signaling cascade. Due to the complexity of the highly interconnected hormonal signaling networks targeted by WRKY33, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance remain to be fully elucidated. In this respect, global transcriptional profiling of infected <italic>wrky33 nced3 nced5</italic> plants should prove extremely valuable to further narrow down key genes and sub-signaling pathways required to re-establish WT-like levels of resistance in this mutant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>For all experiments, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> ecotype Columbia (Col-0) was used.

To analyze differential gene expression between genotypes (WT, <italic>wrky33</italic>) and treatments (mock treated, <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infected), we fitted a linear model with the explanatory variable ‘genotype_treatment’ (i.e., including both genotype and treatment) using the function lmFit (R package limma). Subsequently, we performed moderated t-tests over the four contrasts of interest. Two contrasts compare <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infected vs mock treated samples within each genotype and the other two contrasts compare <italic>wrky33</italic> vs WT Col-0 plants within each treatment. In all cases, the resulting p values were adjusted for false discoveries due to multiple hypothesis testing via the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. For each contrast, we extracted a set of significantly differentially expressed genes between the tested conditions (adj. p value ≤ 0.05, |log2FCΙ ≥ 1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Gene ontology analysis</title><p>GO term enrichment analysis on the gene sets of interest was performed using the R package goseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Young et al., 2010</xref>) with custom GO term mappings obtained from org.At.tairGO2ALLTAIRS within the R package org.At.tair.db (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Carlson, 2010</xref>). To identify enriched GO terms, the Wallenius distribution was used to approximate the null distribution and a probability weighting function was applied to correct for potential count biases in the analyzed gene sets. The resulting p values were adjusted for false discoveries due to multiple hypothesis testing via the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and for each subset the significantly over-represented GO terms were extracted (adj. p value &lt; 0.05). For the set of all WRKY33-regulated targets, the R package topGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Alexa and Rahnenführer, 2010</xref>) was used to visualize the GO sub-graphs induced by the 10 most significantly enriched GO terms in the category ‘Biological Process’ and the five most significantly enriched GO terms in the category ‘Molecular Function’, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>qRT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from leaves at 8, 14, 24, and 48 hpi with <italic>B. cinerea</italic> spores as described above and reverse transcribed with oligo(dT) primer to produce cDNA using the SuperScript First-Strand System for Reverse-Transcription PCR following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). cDNAs corresponding to 2.5 ng of total RNA were subjected to qPCR with gene-specific primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 8</xref>) using the SYBR Green reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).

Your article has been in principle favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that your work identifying new WRKY33 targets during <italic>Botrytis</italic> infection is very interesting. The work nicely showed that you pinpointed new players in WRKY33-mediated resistance. Specifically, you reported that ABA (not SA) is a major player in WRKY33-activated resistance. While we are in principle supportive, there are some specific issues that need to be addressed to strengthen the work and acceptable for publication.</p><p>1) 1684 WRKY33 binding sites from genomic regions were associated with 1567 genes using ChIP-seq. Of them, 76% were W-box motifs which were consistent with previously reported WRKY family TF-binding sites. Moreover, you identified a new motif not previously known to bind WRKY factors, T/GTTGAAT. We think this is one of the major novelties of this study, but additional evidence needs to be provided to determine whether this is mediated by direct binding, or by other factors. If this motif is functionally as important as the W-box motif, the genomic regions containing such motifs should be undergoing evolutionary selection and their sequences should be conserved. We suggest that you compare the genomic regions containing W-box motif and/or T/GTTGAAT motif with the reported conserved DNA elements as described in Haudry et al. (2013)(PubMed ID: 23817568). Important WRKY33 target genes, such as <italic>NCED</italic> genes, would be expected to be associated evolutionarily conserved DNA elements.</p><p>2) For at least a couple of evolutionarily conserved T/GTTGAAT motifs, it is desirable to use a method like EMSA to test for direct binding. Alternatively, the authors might design artificial reporters with multiple tandem motif repeats alone or in combination with W boxes to test their regulatory activities (using constructs with single or double tandem motif repeats or truncated motifs as a control). This could be done as shown in a recent study (Li et al. Plant Cell 2015; PubMed ID: 25691733).</p><p>3) It has been known that TF-binding sites have dosage effects. For the TF-binding sites with positive regulation activities, multiple copies of motifs or binding signals on promoter regions are often associated with higher transcriptional induction levels. We suggest the authors to carry out a genome-wide correlation analysis between the binding signals/motif numbers and expression fold-changes for all the WRKY33 positively regulated target genes. This is feasible since the authors already have the ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets in hand.</p><p>4) Please clarify whether you normalized the gene expression levels on the basis of Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads (FPKM). Were exon-intron structures considered? If so, please describe this in the Materials and methods section. Otherwise, such expression level analysis may have bias on the genes with longer exons, which may further result in false positive detection during GO enrichment analysis. We suggest the authors use CuffDiff and/or DESeq2 to calculate Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads (FPKM) for all the TAIR0 genes and normalize their expression levels as described by Trapnell et al. 2012 (PubMed ID: 22383036).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07295.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) 1684 WRKY33 binding sites from genomic regions were associated with 1567 genes using ChIP-seq.

(2013) (PubMed ID: 23817568). The W-box motif has already been reported to be a conserved DNA element in that previous publication. Our analysis found that both the W-box and the T/GTTGAAT motifs that are located within our WRKY33 ChIP peak regions tend to be associated more strongly with CNS than the corresponding motifs outside of WRKY33 ChIP peaks. Still, overall the T/GTTGAAT motif is less common in the At genome, seems to be less enriched in CNS in general and also the association with CNS observed for motifs within WRKY33 ChIP peaks is clearly less pronounced than for the W-box. Taken together, we think that our exploratory analyses do not sufficiently support that this T/GTTGAAT motifs is strongly conserved and therefore undergoing evolutionary selection (if requested by the reviewers we can also supply the detailed results of our analyses). Thus, we feel at this stage we should not speculate too much on this point and therefore also are reluctant to include it in our manuscript.</p><p>In the course of re-analyzing our data realized there was an error in our previous Venn diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1D</xref>). This error has no impact on our earlier conclusions but rather affect only absolute number of overlapping peaks.</p><p><italic>2) For at least a couple of evolutionarily conserved T/GTTGAAT motifs, it is desirable to use a method like EMSA to test for direct binding. Alternatively, the authors might design artificial reporters with multiple tandem motif repeats alone or in combination with W boxes to test their regulatory activities (using constructs with single or double tandem motif repeats or truncated motifs as a control). This could be done as shown in a recent study (Li et al. Plant Cell 2015; PubMed ID: 25691733)</italic>.</p><p>We performed EMSA to address whether the newly identified element could be bound by WRKY33. For this we used as a positive control an oligonucleotide (designated W-box) containing 3 W-box motifs that has previously been shown by Mao et al. (Plant Cell 23, 1639-1653, 2011) to be bound by WRKY33 in EMSA, and as a negative control for binding specificity a similar oligonucleotide (designated W-boxmut), in which the TGAC core motif of the three W-boxes was mutated to TGAA. We synthesized two oligonucleotides containing the new motif (T/GTTGAAT) that were derived from two promoter sequences that we identified as WRKY33 targets in our ChIP-seq studies, and that resided within WRKY33 binding regions. One 45 bp oligonucleotide (designated M-3) was deduced from the <italic>PROPEP3</italic> gene promoter (At5g64905) and contained three copies of this new motif, and a second 40 bp oligonucleotide (designated M-7) derived from the <italic>WAKL7</italic> gene promoter (At1g16090), which contained one copy. WAKL7 was included because this promoter contains no W-box motifs within its entire promoter but still showed strong enrichment of WRKY33 in our ChIPseq and ChIP-qPCR assays. The results of this study are now included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>, and they clearly show that WRKY33 does not directly bind to the new motif. Moreover, this motif is also not capable of competing for W-box binding. Mention of these results was also added to the text (subsection headed “Genome-wide detection of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> WRKY33 binding sites in response to <italic>B. cinerea</italic> 2100”) and description of the experiment was added to the Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>3) It has been known that TF-binding sites have dosage effects. For the TF-binding sites with positive regulation activities, multiple copies of motifs or binding signals on promoter regions are often associated with higher transcriptional induction levels. We suggest the authors to carry out a genome-wide correlation analysis between the binding signals/motif numbers and expression fold-changes for all the WRKY33 positively regulated target genes. This is feasible since the authors already have the ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets in hand</italic>.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers we have performed genome-wide correlation analysis to test whether the number of the motifs (W-box, new motif, both motifs) present in a peak is correlated to the observed expression fold-changes of WRK33-induced target genes. This analysis did not reveal a clear positive correlation between motif number and gene induction (Spearman's rho between 0.071 and 0.273).</p><p>However, we are aware that only one <italic>B. cinerea</italic> induced time-point (14hpi) was selected for RNA-seq analysis. Thus, it is conceivable that the expression of various WRKY33 induced target genes have not yet reached or have already passed their expression maxima. We believe that without performing temporal expression studies no clear statement related to this point can be made.</p><p><italic>4) Please clarify whether you normalized the gene expression levels on the basis of Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads (FPKM). Were exon-intron structures considered? If so, please describe this in the Materials and methods section. Otherwise, such expression level analysis may have bias on the genes with longer exons, which may further result in false positive detection during GO enrichment analysis. We suggest the authors use CuffDiff and/or DESeq2 to calculate Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads (FPKM) for all the TAIR0 genes and normalize their expression levels as described by Trapnell et al. 2012 (PubMed ID: 22383036)</italic>.</p><p>As the reviewers note, in RNA-seq analysis it is important to consider exon-intron structures. We have done so by using Tophat for the read alignment, which is a read-mapping tool that can map across and also identify splice junctions. And we also considered exon-intron structures when extracting the read counts per gene by using coverageBed with the option–split. As suggested by the reviewers we have now slightly rephrased the corresponding paragraphs in the Material and methods section to better clarify this.</p><p>In our subsequent differential expression analysis we have applied another accepted normalization approach, the so-called TMM (weighted trimmed mean of M-values [i.e. log fold changes]) normalization as proposed by Robinson and Oshlack (2010) (PubMed ID: 20196867). This normalization approach has been shown before e.g. by Dillies at al., 2012 (PubMed ID: 22988256) to be more efficient than the classic RPKM/FPKM normalization (at least when used without application of further scaling as done e.g. in newer versions of CuffDiff) and comparable to the normalization method used in DESeq/DESeq2. This TMM normalization was combined with a log2 transform to yield log2-counts per million (log2cpm) using the function ‘voom’ in the R package limma, which additionally estimates the mean-variance relationship for the log-counts and assigns a weight to each observation based on its predicted variance. These weights are then used in the subsequent linear modeling process to adjust for heteroscedasticity as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Law et al., 2014</xref> (PubMed ID: 24485249). This normalization procedure and subsequent linear modeling in limma (voom-limma) have been shown previously e.g. by Rapaport et al., 2013 (PubMed ID: 24020486) and Seyednasrollah et al., 2013 (PubMed ID: 24300110) to perform well at detecting differentially expressed genes on different datasets with respect to both sensitivity and specificity (also when compared with CuffDiff), and to be among the best tools when the number of replicates is relatively low, like with the three replicates we are analyzing.</p><p>We are aware that this approach also has its limitations, for example it considers expression at the gene level without regard to the potential isoform diversity and there might be certain specific cases where this gene-level analysis might not be able to correctly identify differential expression (for genes with both up-regulated and down-regulated isoforms). The suggested tool CuffDiff addresses this problem by combining the differential expression analysis with isoform deconvolution and is a reasonable and thus widely used alternative. However, we believe that the estimation of isoform-specific expression is a very difficult task, especially for genes with strongly overlapping isoforms and at moderate sequencing depths, and accordingly any isoform-specific expression estimates inevitably are associated with a certain degree of uncertainty. Overall, we think both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses, and, at least for the analysis of gene-level expression differences we are focusing on in this study, our workflow is just as much a reasonable approach as the suggested CuffDiff.</p><p>Nevertheless, to further verify the reliability of our results, we re-analyzed our RNA-seq data with both suggested alternative tools (DESeq2 and CuffDiff). A comparison of the gene sets identified with each tool as significantly differentially expressed (absolute log2FC ≥ 1, p &lt; 0.05) for the four analyzed contrasts showed a large overlap between the gene sets. The vast majority of differentially expressed (DE) genes identified with our workflow (limma) were also identified as DE with DESeq2, and, to a slightly lesser extent, also with CuffDiff, with a major fraction of genes being consistently identified with all three tools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>). Similarly, also comparisons of the observed log2 fold changes between the tools showed an extremely high correlation between our workflow (limma) and DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 2</xref>) and still also a strong correlation between our workflow and CuffDiff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 3</xref>) in spite of the conceptual differences between the tools. This strong agreement between the three tools in our view confirms the overall reliability of our results and supports our judgment that the workflow we used in our analysis is also a valid alternative to identify differentially expressed genes. As suggested by the reviewers, we have now rephrased the corresponding section in the Material and methods to describe the used approach in a bit more detail.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07295.034</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Venn diagrams showing the overlap between the sets of genes identified as significantly differentially expressed (abs(log2FC) ≥ 1, p adj &lt; 0.05) with the three different tools limma (used in our study), DESeq2 and Cuffdiff for the four analysed comparisons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07295.034">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07295.034</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07295-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07295.035</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>Plots show the correlation between the log2 fold changes obtained for each gene with limma (used in our study) and the alternative tool DESeq2.

We also agree with the reviewers that the potential existence of such a bias would in turn result in a bias in the downstream GO term enrichment analysis. Thus, we explicitly checked our DE sets for the presence of such a bias, and an analysis of the gene length distributions did not reveal any evidence for a bias toward longer genes in our DE gene sets, also when compared to the DE gene sets obtained with the suggested alternative tool CuffDiff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 4</xref>). However, the observed read counts in an RNA-seq experiment can be biased not only by differences in transcript length, but also by further factors like differences in sequence composition or secondary structure. Moreover, the gene set on which we actually performed the GO enrichment analysis contained only the subset of DE genes (wrky33 “regulated”) that were also found to be bound in our ChIP-seq (wrky33 “targets”), and it has been shown that also the identification of ChIP-seq targets can have a bias on more highly expressed genes. Thus, we additionally checked our specific gene sets of interest (“regulated”, “targets”, “regulated targets”) for the presence of an expression bias in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 5</xref>). As the ChIP-seq targets did indeed seem to have a certain bias towards higher expressed genes, we re-did the GO term enrichment analysis with a different tool (goseq) that can account for this potential expression bias in the analyzed gene set through the integration of a probability weighting function. In this way we can, within the GOterm analysis itself, correct for any expression bias in the analyzed gene set and thus reduce the chance of false positive detections. We have updated the corresponding text and figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>) in our manuscript to now represent the results of this new GO term analysis with expression bias correction (which overall agree quite well with the previous analysis) and also adjusted the methods description accordingly.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07295.037</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><p>Boxplots represent the gene length distributions among the set of all analyzed genes and the subsets of genes identified as significantly differentially expressed (with abs(log2FC) ≥ 1, p adj &lt; 0.05) in the four analyzed pairwise comparison with the voom-limma workflow used in our study (A) or the alterantive tool Cuffdiff (B).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07295.037">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07295.037</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07295-resp-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07295.038</object-id><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><p>Boxplots represent the distributions of total read counts (over all samples together) per gene among the set of all analysed genes and the subsets of wrky33-regulated genes (from RNA-seq), wrky33 targets (from ChIP-seq) and wrky33-regulated wrky33 targets.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07295.038">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07295.038</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07295-resp-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig></p></body></sub-article></article>
