This has been controversially interpreted as evidence that speech sounds are processed as articulatory gestures. However, it is unclear what information is actually encoded by such neural activity. We used high-density direct human cortical recordings while participants spoke and listened to speech sounds. Motor cortex neural patterns during listening were substantially different than during articulation of the same sounds. During listening, we observed neural activity in the superior and inferior regions of ventral motor cortex. During speaking, responses were distributed throughout somatotopic representations of speech articulators in motor cortex. The structure of responses in motor cortex during listening was organized along acoustic features similar to auditory cortex, rather than along articulatory features as during speaking. Motor cortex does not contain articulatory representations of perceived actions in speech, but rather, represents auditory vocal information.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12577.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12577.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12577.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When we speak, we force air out of our lungs so that it passes over the vocal cords and causes them to vibrate. Movements of the jaw, lips and tongue can then shape the resulting sound wave into speech sounds. The brain’s outer layer, which is called the cortex, controls this process. More precisely, neighboring areas in the so-called motor cortex trigger the movements in a specific order to produce different sounds.</p><p>Brain imaging experiments have also shown that the motor cortex is active when we listen to speech, as well as when we produce it. One theory is that when we hear a sound, such as the consonant ‘b’, the sound activates the same areas of motor cortex as those involved in producing that sound. This could help us to recognize and understand the sounds we hear.</p><p>To test this theory, Cheung, Hamilton et al. studied how speech sounds activate the motor cortex by recording electrical signals directly from the brain’s surface in nine human volunteers who were undergoing a clinical evaluation for epilepsy surgery. This revealed that speaking activates many different areas of motor cortex. However, listening to the same sounds activates only a small subset of these areas. Contrary to what was thought, brain activity patterns in motor cortex during listening do not match those during speaking. Instead, they depend on the properties of the sounds. Thus, sounds that have similar acoustic properties but which require different movements to produce them, such as ‘b’ and ‘d’, activate the motor cortex in similar ways during listening, but not during speaking.</p><p>Further research is now needed to work out why the motor cortex behaves differently when we hear as opposed to when we speak. Previous work has suggested that the region increases its activity during listening when the sounds heard are unclear, for example because of background noise. One testable idea therefore is that the motor cortex helps to enhance the processing of degraded sounds.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12577.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12577.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>speech</kwd><kwd>motor cortex</kwd><kwd>auditory</kwd><kwd>motor theory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F32DC014192-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hamilton</surname><given-names>Liberty S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OD00862</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Edward F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005270</institution-id><institution>McKnight Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Edward F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DC012379</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Edward F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00-NS065120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Edward F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Brain activity patterns in motor cortex differ when we listen to speech as opposed to produce it.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our motor and sensory cortices are traditionally thought to be functionally separate systems. However, an accumulating number of studies has revealed their roles in action and perception to be highly integrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pulvermüller and Fadiga, 2010</xref>). For example, a number of studies have demonstrated that both sensory and motor cortices are engaged during perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallese et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tkach et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cogan et al., 2014</xref>). In humans, this phenomenon has been observed in the context of speech, where listening to speech sounds evokes robust neural activity in the motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pulvermüller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edwards et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cogan et al., 2014</xref>). This observation has re-ignited an intense scientific debate over the role of the motor system in speech perception over the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lotto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scott et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pulvermüller and Fadiga, 2010</xref>).</p><p>One interpretation of the observed motor activity during speech perception is that “the objects of speech perception are the intended phonetic gestures of the speaker”- as posited by Liberman’s motor theory of speech perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liberman et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liberman and Mattingly, 1985</xref>). The motor theory is a venerable and well-differentiated exemplar of a set of speech perception theories that we could call 'production-referencing' theories. Unlike motor theory, more modern production referencing theories do not assume that sensorimotor circuits are necessarily referenced in order for speech to be recognized, but they allow for motor involvement in perception in certain phonetic modes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lindblom, 1996</xref> suggested that a direct link between spectrotemporal analysis and word recognition is the normal mode of speech perception (the 'what' mode of perception), but in some cases listeners do use a route through sensorimotor circuits (the 'how' mode of perception) if, for example, the listener is attempting to imitate a new sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lindblom, 1996</xref>).</p><p>While demonstrations of evoked motor cortex activity by speech sounds strengthen production-referencing theories, it remains unclear what information is actually <italic>represented</italic> by such activity. Determining what phonetic properties are encoded in the motor cortex has significant implications for elucidating the role it may play in speech perception. To address this, we recorded direct neural activity from the peri-Sylvian speech cortex in nine human participants undergoing clinical monitoring for epilepsy surgery. This includes but is not limited to two relevant areas comprising the supra-Sylvian ventral half of the lateral sensorimotor cortex (vSMC) for the motor control of articulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Penfield and Boldrey, 1937</xref>) and the infra-Sylvian superior temporal gyrus (STG) for the auditory processing of speech sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ojemann et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boatman et al., 1995</xref>). Since cortical processing of speech sounds is spatially discrete and temporally fast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Formisano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Steinschneider et al., 2011</xref>), we used customized high-density electrode grids (a four-fold increase over conventional recordings) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouchard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mesgarani et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, these recordings have simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution in order to study the detailed speech representations in the vSMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crone et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edwards et al., 2009</xref>). With this approach, we seek to address unanswered questions about the representation of speech sounds in motor cortex, including how the spatiotemporal patterns compare when speaking and listening and whether auditory representations in motor cortex are organized along articulatory or acoustic dimensions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Participants first listened passively to consonant-vowel (CV) syllables (8 consonants followed by the /a/ vowel). In a separate trial block, they spoke aloud these same CV syllables. We measured the average evoked cortical activity during these listening and speaking CV tasks. We focused our analysis on high gamma (70–150 Hz) cortical surface local field potentials, which strongly correlate with extracellular multi-unit neuronal spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Steinschneider et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ray and Maunsell, 2011</xref>). We aligned neural responses to the onset of speech acoustics (t = 0) in listening and speaking tasks to provide a common reference point across speech sounds.</p><p>We first determined which peri-Sylvian cortical areas were activated during passive listening to speech sounds. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref> shows the locations of cortical areas that demonstrated cortical evoked responses in a single representative subject during listening and speaking respectively. During listening, evoked responses spanned middle and posterior STG as expected, with weaker responses in middle temporal gyrus (MTG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In the vSMC, (composed of the pre- and post- central gyri) we found electrodes in the superior-most and inferior-most aspects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>) that demonstrated reliable and robust single-trial responses to speech sounds during passive listening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Neural responses were also found at a few sites scattered across supramarginal, inferior-, and middle- frontal gyri—though these were not consistent across subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). By performing spatial clustering analysis on the electrode positions in each subject, we found that 3/5 subjects showed significant clustering of regions responsive to auditory stimuli (Hartigan’s Dip statistic, p&lt;0.05 (see Materials and methods); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Out of these 3 subjects, k-means clustering revealed two subjects with k=2 electrode clusters (subjects 1 and 4, clusters in inferior and superior vSMC), and one subject with k=5 clusters. When participants spoke the same CV syllables, in contrast, articulatory movement-related cortical activity was well distributed throughout vSMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), with auditory feedback cortical activity seen in the STG.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12577.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Speech sounds evoke responses in the human motor cortex.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Magnetic resonance image surface reconstruction of one representative subject’s cerebrum (subject 1: S1).

When speaking, in contrast, a total of 362 electrodes in vSMC were found to be significantly active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, p&lt;0.01, t-test, compared to pre-stimulus silent rest period). We compared the relative proportions of electrodes that were found in different supra-Sylvian anatomical regions. Critically, only a subset of sites in vSMC (98 out of 362, ~27%) was active during both listening and speaking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). These sites were primarily localized to the pre-central gyrus, whereas speaking evoked activity across both pre- and post-central gyri sites. Neural responses in the vSMC during listening were found in the superior (S in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) pre-central gyrus and inferior, anterior aspect of the sub-central gyrus of the vSMC (I in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><p>We next compared the patterns of cortical activity to specific speech sounds during listening and speaking. During speaking, specific articulator representations have been identified in the somatotopically-organized vSMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouchard et al., 2013</xref>). For example, the plosive consonants /b/, /d/, and /g/ are produced by the closure of the vocal tract at the lips, front tongue, and back tongue, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for all syllable tokens) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ladefoged and Johnson, 2010</xref>). The cortical representations for these articulators are laid out along a superior-to-inferior (medial-to-lateral) sequence in the vSMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Penfield and Boldrey, 1937</xref>). We first examined average cortical activity at single electrode sites distributed along the vSMC axis for articulating individual speech sounds. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> shows single electrode activity from a single representative subject (the same from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) for speaking (blue lines) and listening (red lines) for three CV syllables, which have different place of articulation (/ba/, /da/, and /ga/). The exact location of these electrodes on the vSMC is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>. The production of labial consonants (/b/) is associated with activity in lip cortical representations as evidenced by strong responses to the bilabial /ba/ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, electrodes 5–6, blue lines). These are located superior to the tongue representations associated with the /d/ and /g/ consonants, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouchard et al., 2013</xref>). Those tongue sites were sub-specified by ‘coronal’ (i.e. anterior-based) tongue position for /d/ (electrodes 8–10, blue lines) superiorly, and ‘dorsal’ (i.e. posterior-based) tongue position for /g/ inferiorly (electrode 13, blue line).

In previous studies, we demonstrated that the structure of evoked responses are primarily organized by different feature sensitivities: place of articulation in the vSMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouchard et al., 2013</xref>), and manner of articulation in the STG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mesgarani et al., 2014</xref>). We visualized the similarity of population activity evoked by different consonants using unsupervised multidimensional scaling (MDS), where the 2-dimensional Euclidean distances between stimuli correspond to the similarity of their neural responses. Visual inspection of MDS plots shows that, during speaking, evoked activity in vSMC clustered into place of articulation features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>): labials (/b/, /p/), alveolars (/s/, /sh/, /t/, /d/), and velars (/g/, /k/) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). In contrast, neural responses during listening did not cluster into the same features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). To quantify the degree to which the evoked activity clustered into place of articulation features, we used unsupervised K-means clustering to assign the neural responses to clusters (k=3), and the adjusted Rand Index (RI<sub>adj</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rand, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hubert and Arabie, 1985</xref>) to measure the degree to which the neural clustering agreed with linguistically defined place of articulation consonant clusters. The RI<sub>adj</sub> quantifies the degree of agreement between two clustering patterns, where RI<sub>adj</sub> = 1 denotes identical clustering patterns and RI<sub>adj</sub> = 0 denotes independent clustering patterns.

STG has an acoustic sensory representation of speech that best discriminates speech sounds by manner of articulation features with salient acoustic differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mesgarani et al., 2014</xref>). Using multidimensional scaling, STG spatial patterns during listening showed clustering according to three high-order acoustic features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>): voiced plosives (/b/, /d/, /g/), unvoiced plosives (/p/, /t/, /k/), and fricatives (/s/, /sh/) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ladefoged and Johnson, 2010</xref>). This is consistent with the relational organization derived by analysis of structure in the stimulus acoustics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3a</xref>), and the structure of STG during speaking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3b</xref>). With the same analyses, we observed that activity in motor cortex clustered into the same three acoustic features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, note this panel is identical to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> simply re-colored). Unsupervised K-means clustering analysis confirmed that vSMC activity, during listening, organized into these linguistically defined acoustic feature groups, but was significantly weaker than the organization of STG (p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Importantly, however, clustering by acoustic manner features was significantly stronger than clustering by place features in vSMC electrodes during listening (p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). This organization suggests that motor cortex activity during speech perception reflects an acoustic sensory representation of speech in the vSMC that mirrors acoustic representations of speech in auditory cortex.</p><p>To further define the acoustic selectivity and tuning of vSMC motor electrodes, participants listened to natural, continuous speech samples from a corpus with a range of American English speakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garofolo et al., 1993</xref>). We fit spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF) models for each vSMC electrode using normalized reverse correlation (see Materials and methods), which describes the spectrotemporal properties of speech acoustics that predict the activity of a single site in motor cortex. To compute the STRF, we calculate the correlation between the neural response at an electrode and the stimulus spectrogram at multiple time lags. The result is then normalized by the auto-correlation in the stimulus. This results in a linear filter for each electrode (the STRF), which, when convolved with the stimulus spectrogram, produces a predicted neural response to that stimulus. The prediction performance of each STRF was determined by calculating the correlation between the activity predicted by the STRF and the actual response on held out data. A fraction of vSMC sites (16/98 sites total) were reasonably well-predicted with a linear STRF (r&gt;=0.10 and p&lt;0.01, permutation test) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Theunissen et al., 2001</xref>). STRFs with significant correlation coefficients were localized to superior and inferior vSMC (primarily precentral gyrus) in addition to STG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Still, the prediction performance of STRFs in vSMC was generally lower than that of the STG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Furthermore, the majority of STRFs in both regions showed strong low frequency tuning (100–200 Hz) properties related to voicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), though some also showed high frequency tuning consistent with selectivity for fricatives and stop consonants by visual inspection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mesgarani et al., 2014</xref>). We also estimated the mean cortical response at each motor site to every phoneme in English and found a diverse set of responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>) that were notably weaker in magnitude compared to STG responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Weak selectivity to phonetic features measured by the Phoneme Selectivity Index (PSI) was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mesgarani et al., 2014</xref>). These findings reveal that individual sites in motor cortex reflect sensory responses to definable spectrotemporal features speech acoustics, including voicing attributes. Presumably, this tuning gives rise to the acoustic organization found in the previous analysis of distributed spatial patterns of neural activity.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12577.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Acoustic spectrotemporal tuning in vSMC.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) All STRF correlations and locations are plotted with opacity signifying the strength of the correlation.

We used high-resolution cortical recordings and a wide array of speech sounds to determine how the vSMC structure of speech sounds compared to the structure of motor commands in vSMC and sensory processing in STG. We found evidence for both spatially local and distributed activity correlated to speech acoustics, which suggests an auditory representation of speech in motor cortex.</p><p>The proposal that the motor cortex critically integrates observations with motor commands largely stems from the discovery of mirror neurons (in area F5 of macaques) that fire both when a monkey produced an action and observed a similar action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">di Pellegrino et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pulvermüller and Fadiga, 2010</xref>). This 'integrative' view is reminiscent of linguistic production-referencing theories, including the motor theory of speech perception, which propose that motor circuits are involved in speech perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liberman et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liberman and Mattingly, 1985</xref>). In line with these theories, human neuroimaging studies have showed mirror activity in ventral premotor cortex during listening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pulvermüller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edwards et al., 2010</xref>), and modulated premotor activity in phoneme categorization tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chevillet et al., 2013</xref>). Our results extend these findings by detailing the representational selectivity and encoding of vSMC in perception. Consistent with previous findings, we demonstrated local ‘audiomotor’ responses to speech sounds in vSMC. When the responses were further examined for phonetic structure, we found major motor articulatory place features, such as labial, alveolar, and velar, were not represented with single site activity or distributed spatial activity. This observation is in direct contrast with structural predictions made by the original motor theory of speech perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liberman et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liberman and Mattingly, 1985</xref>), while confirming that motor cortex plays a role in perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lindblom, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hickok and Poeppel, 2007</xref>).</p><p>We localized activity during speech perception to regions of the vSMC that have been implicated in phonation and laryngeal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Penfield and Boldrey, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2008</xref>). When listening to speech, we observed these regions reflected acoustic sensory properties of speech, with individual sites tuned for spectrotemporal acoustic properties. The tuning properties of responsive sites in vSMC are similar to properties observed in STG during listening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mesgarani et al., 2014</xref>) and appear to give rise to an acoustic sensory organization of speech sounds (rather than purely motor organization) in motor cortex during listening.</p><p>There is an emerging consensus that frontal and motor regions are recruited during effortful listening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Du et al., 2014</xref>). For example, previous studies have demonstrated that frontal areas come online to process degraded speech for the attentional enhancement of auditory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wild et al., 2012</xref>). Our results may complement this interpretation in that the audiomotor cortex enhancement is specific to an auditory representation, without transforming information to a motor articulatory representation. That being said, the auditory encoding that we observed in the motor cortex did not appear to be as strong as that as that observed in the STG, and exhibited comparatively weaker activity and weaker phoneme selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b and c</xref>, and see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mesgarani et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition to having implications for perceptual models, we speculate that these results have strong implications for speech production, as auditory feedback is potentially processed directly in the vSMC in addition to the canonical auditory cortex. Speech production models currently propose a complex role for sensory feedback, where pathways exist for the activation of auditory cortex from vSMC activation (the forward prediction of production consequences), and the activation of vSMC from auditory and somatosensory input (the error correction signal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guenther et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Houde and Nagarajan, 2011</xref>). In the current study, it appears that the motor cortex contains both sensory and motor representations, where the sensory representations are active during passive listening, whereas motor representations dominate during speech production.</p><p>Analysis of the time course of vSMC and STG responses revealed a heterogeneous population of both short- and longer-latencies in the inferior and superior vSMC that are generally slower than the STG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–c</xref>). Early responses in vSMC may reflect bidirectional connections from STG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zatorre et al., 2007</xref>), primary auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>) or auditory thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henschke et al., 2014</xref>), whereas later responses might reflect indirect connectivity in areas downstream from the STG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rauschecker and Scott, 2009</xref>). Indeed, our cross-correlation analysis revealed bidirectional dynamical relationships between vSMC and STG responses, in which STG responses led vSMC responses and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–f</xref>). Still, this analysis was independent of the diverse tuning properties in the vSMC and STG electrode sets, so longer latency responses likely reflect the later responses to vowels relative to consonants. Even so, we found a wide variety of tuning and dynamical profiles in the vSMC electrodes that responded during listening. Given these proposed functional connections, activity in vSMC from speech sounds may be a consequence of sounds activating the sensory feedback circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hickok et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, evoked responses in the motor cortex during passive listening may directly reflect auditory inputs arising from aggregated activity picked up by the electrode. We believe the latter scenario to be less likely, however, given that auditory responses were observed in dorsal vSMC on electrode contacts several centimeters away from auditory inputs in the STG. In addition, the spatial spread of neural signals in the high gamma range is substantially smaller than this difference – high gamma signal correlations at &lt;2 mm spacing are only around r=0.5, and at distances of 1 cm reach a noise floor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang, 2015</xref>); Muller et al, unpublished findings). Given the observed acoustic rather than place selectivity observed during listening in the vSMC, our results suggest that motor theories of speech perception may need to be revised to incorporate a novel sensorimotor representation of sound in the vSMC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Nine human participants were implanted with high-density multi-electrode cortical surface arrays as part of their clinical evaluation for epilepsy surgery.

First, participants listened to eight consonant-vowel (CV) syllables (/ba/, /da/, /ga/, /pa/, /ta/, /ka/, /∫a/, /sa/) produced by a male speaker unknown to the participant. Stimuli were presented randomly, with 4–21 repetitions of each CV syllable for 5 out of the 9 subjects included in all subsequent analyses, and one repetition of each CV syllable for 4 subjects shown only in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. To remain alert, participants were asked to identify the syllable they heard by selecting from a multiple-choice question on a computer with their ipsilateral (left) hand. In the second task, participants spoke aloud the same CV syllables prompted by a visual cue on the laptop computer display. In the third task, participants passively listened to natural speech samples from a phonemically transcribed continuous speech corpus (TIMIT). We chose 499 unique sentences from 400 different male and female speakers. Each sentence was repeated two times. For the phoneme selectivity analysis, we chose a subset of TIMIT phonemes that occurred more than 30 times. This resulted in an analysis of 33 phonemes. For spectrotemporal receptive field analysis (see below), data from all sentences were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data acquisition and preprocessing</title><p>Electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals were recorded with a multichannel PZ2 amplifier connected to an RZ2 digital signal acquisition system (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL, USA) sampling at 3,052 Hz. The produced speech was recorded with a microphone, digitized, and simultaneously recorded. The speech sound signals were presented monaurally from loudspeakers at a comfortable level, digitized, and also simultaneously recorded with the ECoG signals.</p><p>Line noise (60 Hz and harmonics at 120 and 180 Hz) was next removed from the signal with a notch filter. Each time series was visually and quantitatively inspected for excessive noise, and was subsequently removed from further analyses if its periodogram deviated more than two standard deviations away from the average periodogram of all other time series. The remaining time series were then common-average referenced (CAR) and used for analyses. The CAR was taken across 16 channel banks in order to remove non-neural electrical noise from shared inputs to the PZ2. We find that this method of CAR significantly reduces movement-related and other non-neural artifacts while not adversely affecting our signals of interest. The analytic amplitude of each time series was extracted using eight bandpass filters (Gaussian filters, logarithmically increasing center frequencies (70–150 Hz) with semi-logarithmically increasing bandwidths) with the Hilbert transform. The high-gamma power was calculated by averaging the analytic amplitude across these eight bands, and downsampling the signal to 100 Hz. The signal was finally z-scored relative to the mean and standard deviation of baseline rest data for each channel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrode selection</title><p>Supra-Sylvian cortical sites with robust evoked responses to both speech sounds and speech production were selected for this analysis. To identify if a site was responsive to speech sounds, we implemented a bootstrap t-test comparing a site's responses randomly sampled over time during speech sound presentations to responses randomly sampled over time during pre-stimulus silent intervals (p&lt;0.01). This resulted in 10, 22, 29, 27, and 27 sites for the five participants (n=115). Next we implemented a bootstrap t-test comparing neural responses during speech production and pre-stimulus silence (p&lt;0.01), resulting in 25, 74, 87, 92, and 84 sites (n=362).

Importantly, unlike the silhouette index, this allows us to distinguish between k=1 and k&gt;1 clusters. For each subject, the pairwise distances between the spatial locations of all electrodes in a single subject were computed. Using each electrode in turn as a 'viewer' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalogeratos and Likas, 2012</xref>), we tested to see whether the distribution of distances to that electrode significantly deviated from unimodality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hartigan and Hartigan, 1985</xref>). If one or more electrodes showed a signficantly non-unimodal pairwise distance histogram, then the data were considered to be clustered.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Nicholas Hatsopoulos, and the evaluation has been overseen by Barbara Shinn-Cunningham as the Reviewing Editor and David Van Essen as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examines evoked activity in speech motor cortex due to passive listening of consonant-vowel (CV) syllables to determine the nature of these representations. High-density ECoG grids recorded local field potentials from the surface of motor and auditory cortices of epileptic patients who either produced CVs or passively listened to them. During speaking, evoked neural activity in ventral sensorimotor cortex (vSMC) was somatotopically organized according to place of articulation whereas during listening, the organized seemed to be based on acoustic features. Both reviewers and the reviewing editor believe that the study could shed light on the important question of whether or not speech perception depends upon encoding spoken language in a motor-based neural code. The innovative experimental and analytical techniques add to our enthusiasm for the work. While the data suggest that language perception is encoded in acoustic features rather than speech-motor production features, all of us felt that there were some major issues, especially with the data analysis, that need to be addressed before the full impact of the study can be evaluated.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The methods state that the data were analyzed using a common-average reference. Following this, to estimate the high-γ power relative to baseline, the power (extracted using the Hilbert transform) in 8 bandpass frequency regions was computed and averaged, and then turned into a z score. Given this processing stream, the number and locations of the electrodes across which the common-average reference was computed might bias the findings, especially since oscillation power was ultimately analyzed (i.e., very strong high-γ power that was synchronous across a small number of nearby sites would end up looking like weak high-γ power across all sites). This issue needs to be discussed; perhaps some bootstrap analysis or other control could demonstrate that such artifacts are not an issue.</p><p>2) The authors argue that during listening &quot;the tuning properties of responsive sites in vSMC.… appear to give rise to an acoustic sensory organization of speech sounds (rather than purely motor organization) in motor cortex during listening.&quot; The impact of the work rests on this claim, that the responses in vSMC during listening are organized by acoustic rather than motor properties of sound. However, proving this claim requires showing that statistically, the listening response in vSMC is quantitatively better described as &quot;auditory&quot; rather than &quot;motor&quot; (i.e., by a direct statistical comparison of results plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and f</xref>). Without this proof, the impact of this paper may be less than claimed. This should be addressed by a statistical comparison of the two fits of the vSMC<sub>listening</sub> results.</p><p>3) In the analyses that are provided, the authors select different electrodes when evaluating vSMC<sub>listening</sub> (98 electrodes) and vSMC<sub>speaking</sub> (362 electrodes). The electrodes evaluated in the vSMC<sub>speaking</sub> condition are not all active during listening. To allow direct comparison of results for speaking vs. listening, it makes more sense to select identical subsets for both analyses. This in turn means limiting the analysis to those sites that are active for both vSMC<sub>speaking</sub> and vSMC<sub>listening</sub> conditions. It seems problematic to claim that activity patterns are different across conditions when those patterns are being examined in different sets of electrodes. This can best be addressed by a reanalysis that directly compares vSMC<sub>speaking</sub> and vSMC<sub>listening</sub> responses in the more limited set of electrodes that respond in both cases.</p><p>4) Related to item 3, the MDS plots for vSMC<sub>listening</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and f</xref>) are less clearly clustered than vSMC<sub>speaking</sub>. This may be an artifact of the 3x difference in sample sizes. Depending on how the authors decide to deal with item 2, this may not remain a problem; however, if there is a comparison of clustering results using different sample sizes, the authors need to verify that the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d and g</xref> are not an artifact of this difference (e.g., by showing that the same effect holds if the vSMC<sub>speaking</sub> and STG<sub>listening</sub> datasets are subsampled to equalize the sample size).</p><p>5) It may be that the evoked responses in motor cortex during passive listening reflect auditory inputs. While high-γ LFPs strongly correlate with multi-unit spiking (as the authors state), high-γ LFPs may also reflect the aggregate synaptic potentials near the electrode. The authors should discuss this possibility.</p><p>6) A motor representation in vSMC during listening may be present in a subset of the vSMC sites. The authors show that response in some vSMC sites lead STG sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d-f</xref>). If the MDS analysis was restricted to sites that lead STG (i.e., vSMC signals with very short latencies), would these sites reveal a motor representation? Some vSMC may be generating motor-like responses that are triggered by the auditory stimulus, but that reflect motor, not sensory properties. Analysis of the short-latency vSMC responses would address this concern.</p><p>7) The authors report that 16 total sites in vSMC have activity that was &quot;strongly&quot; predicted by a linear STRF, with &quot;strong&quot; defined as r&gt;0.10. The authors need to make clear where the subset of 16 electrodes with significant STRFs were located, and also whether or not this fraction of locations (16/X) is significantly above chance (e.g., correcting for false discovery rate). Most likely, X should include all auditory-responsive vSMC sites, but this is not stated clearly. In addition, the authors should explain by what criterion r&gt;0.10 (i.e., a correlation in which 1% of the variance is explained by the strf) is a good criterion for a &quot;strong&quot; prediction. For instance, how does this correlation strength compare to STRF predictions in STG?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12577.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The methods state that the data were analyzed using a common-average reference.

We do not find that the CAR reduces the high-γ power, but rather serves to remove large artifacts across wide sensory and non-sensory areas that are likely non-neural in origin. In our study, the CAR was applied across 16 channel blocks running in columns across the ECoG grid before segmenting data into speech responsive or non-responsive. Blocks of 16 channels were used because when the ECoG grids are plugged into the amplifier, the 256 channels are separated into 16 channel sets, each of which is plugged into a separate bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tdt.com/files/specs/PZ2.pdf">http://www.tdt.com/files/specs/PZ2.pdf</ext-link>). The grids are designed such that the 16 channel sets correspond to columns on the grid – for example, channels 1–16 share a common plug, 17-32 share the next plug, 33-48 the next, etc. Thus, when we subtract the CAR in these 16-channel banks, it removes noise that is shared across a group of wires plugged into the same bank on the amplifier. In practice, we find that this significantly reduces the amount of 60 Hz noise and removes some artifacts due to movement, but does not adversely affect signals in the high γ band. Because of the orientation of the grids, the columns of the grid generally run ventrodorsally and include electrodes over speech-selective and non-selective areas (STG and parietal cortex, or STG and motor cortex, for example). Thus, subtracting signals shared across this wide region do not generally affect the high-γ band power in this way (that is, we do not find that strong high-γ power is weakened by the CAR). As a quantitative comparison, we compared the phoneme aligned high γ matrices with and without the CAR (shown for one subject in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>). There is no significant difference between the high γ data with and without the CAR (Wilcoxon sign rank test, p=1).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12577.015</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12577.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12577.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-12577-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>However, because of its ability to remove artifacts due to non-neural electrical noise (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref> power spectrum showing power in different neural frequency bands with and without the CAR—error indicates standard deviation across channels), we chose to leave the results in the paper as is, using the CAR as described. We added the following sentences to the Methods section to clarify the use of the CAR: &quot;The CAR was taken across 16 channel banks in order to remove non-neural electrical noise from shared inputs to the PZ2. We find that this method of CAR significantly reduces movement-related and other non-neural artifacts while not adversely affecting our signals of interest.&quot;<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12577.016</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12577.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12577.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-12577-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) The authors argue that during listening &quot;the tuning properties of responsive sites in vSMC</italic>.… <italic>appear to give rise to an acoustic sensory organization of speech sounds (rather than purely motor organization) in motor cortex during listening.&quot; The impact of the work rests on this claim, that the responses in vSMC during listening are organized by acoustic rather than motor properties of sound. However, proving this claim requires showing that statistically, the listening response in vSMC is quantitatively better described as &quot;auditory&quot; rather than &quot;motor&quot; (i.e., by a direct statistical comparison of results plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and f</xref>). Without this proof, the impact of this paper may be less than claimed. This should be addressed by a statistical comparison of the two fits of the vSMC<sub>listening</sub> results.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this direct statistical comparison is important for interpretation of our results and thank the reviewers for the suggestion. To this end, we have performed the statistical comparison of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> and 3F (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and f</xref>) for vSMC electrodes during listening and found a significantly higher RI<sub>adj</sub> for acoustic (manner) features compared to place of articulation features (p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test). We now show quantitatively that the listening responses in vSMC are indeed better characterized as &quot;auditory&quot; rather than &quot;motor&quot;. This comparison is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref> and described in the figure legend. In addition, we have added the following text to the Results section: &quot;Importantly, however, clustering by acoustic manner features was significantly better than clustering by place features in vSMC electrodes during listening (p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>).&quot;</p><p><italic>3) In the analyses that are provided, the authors select different electrodes when evaluating vSMC<sub>listening</sub> (98 electrodes) and vSMC<sub>speaking</sub> (362 electrodes). The electrodes evaluated in the vSMC<sub>speaking</sub> condition are not all active during listening. To allow direct comparison of results for speaking vs. listening, it makes more sense to select identical subsets for both analyses. This in turn means limiting the analysis to those sites that are active for both vSMC<sub>speaking</sub> and vSMC<sub>listening</sub> conditions. It seems problematic to claim that activity patterns are different across conditions when those patterns are being examined in different sets of electrodes. This can best be addressed by a reanalysis that directly compares vSMC<sub>speaking</sub> and vSMC<sub>listening</sub> responses in the more limited set of electrodes that respond in both cases.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that our claim that areas of vSMC show an acoustic representation while listening and a place of articulation representation while speaking would be stronger by analyzing the same subset of electrodes for both speaking and listening. We repeated the clustering analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> using only the 98 electrode subset during speaking and listening, and found that our results still hold in this more limited set. Thus, we opted to replace panel b in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> with the results from the 98 electrode subset, and placed the former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, panel c. When only the 98 electrode subset is analyzed, responses still appear to be similar for similar place of articulation – for example, /b/ and /p/, the bilabials, are close to one another in MDS space, as are the velars /k/ and /g/, and the alveolars /∫/, /s/, /t/, and /d/.</p><p>The clustering trajectory analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> has also been replaced using the same electrodes for speaking and listening. Responses are aligned according to the acoustic onset of the CV syllable (at t=0 s). Significant ∆RI<sub>adj</sub> values are indicated by the blue and red windows (FDR-corrected p&lt;0.05, permutation test). Here it is clear that, just prior to and during speaking, vSMC responses cluster according to place of articulation. During listening, however, those same responses exhibit selectivity according to manner of articulation, reflecting an acoustic representation.</p><p><italic>4) Related to item 3, the MDS plots for vSMC<sub>listening</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and f</xref>) are less clearly clustered than vSMC<sub>speaking</sub>. This may be an artifact of the 3x difference in sample sizes. Depending on how the authors decide to deal with item 2, this may not remain a problem; however, if there is a comparison of clustering results using different sample sizes, the authors need to verify that the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d and g</xref> are not an artifact of this difference (e.g., by showing that the same effect holds if the vSMC<sub>speaking</sub> and STG<sub>listening</sub> datasets are subsampled to equalize the sample size).</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the strong clustering observed in the vSMC speaking data may be due to the larger sample size, however, in reanalyzing the speaking data as described in the response to point (3), we found that clustering according to place of articulation was still observed when the speaking data was limited to the same set of electrodes used in the vSMC listening analysis. Thus, we have chosen to present the clustering data using the same sample size for vSMC listening and speaking, and present for reference the original analysis with speaking data for all active electrodes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2c</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) It may be that the evoked responses in motor cortex during passive listening reflect auditory inputs. While high-</italic>γ <italic>LFPs strongly correlate with multi-unit spiking (as the authors state), high-</italic>γ <italic>LFPs may also reflect the aggregate synaptic potentials near the electrode. The authors should discuss this possibility.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion, and have added to the last paragraph of the Discussion section additional details on where such auditory signals may arise. While it is possible that some inferior vSMC electrodes are picking up on auditory inputs, we believe it to be unlikely based on other analyses we have performed in the lab on spatial correlations across the ECoG grid at different neural frequency bands. We have added the following text:</p><p>&quot;Alternatively, evoked responses in the motor cortex during passive listening may directly reflect auditory inputs arising from aggregated activity picked up by the electrode. We believe the latter scenario to be less likely, however, given that auditory responses were observed in dorsal vSMC on electrode contacts several centimeters away from auditory inputs in the STG. In addition, the spatial spread of neural signals in the high γ range is substantially smaller than this difference – high γ signal correlations at &lt;2 mm spacing are only around r=0.5, and at distances of 1 cm reach a noise floor (Chang EF, Neuron 2015; Muller et al., in revision). Given the observed acoustic rather than place selectivity observed during listening in the vSMC, our results suggest that motor theories of speech perception may need to be revised to incorporate a novel sensorimotor representation of sound in the vSMC.&quot;</p><p><italic>6) A motor representation in vSMC during listening may be present in a subset of the vSMC sites. The authors show that response in some vSMC sites lead STG sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-F</xref>). If the MDS analysis was restricted to sites that lead STG (i.e., vSMC signals with very short latencies), would these sites reveal a motor representation? Some vSMC may be generating motor-like responses that are triggered by the auditory stimulus, but that reflect motor, not sensory properties. Analysis of the short-latency vSMC responses would address this concern.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is an interesting additional analysis to determine whether the short-latency sites in the vSMC show differences in their motor vs. sensory responses. We performed the MDS analysis as suggested by restricting the analysis to sites that lead the STG as evidenced by a positive asymmetry index (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref> and Methods section– Cross Correlation analysis). This analysis yielded 50 vSMC electrodes. We found that even in this subset of short-latency responders, responses during listening appeared to cluster according to acoustic rather than articulatory features. This suggests that vSMC does not generate motor-like responses during listening. These results are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>7) The authors report that 16 total sites in vSMC have activity that was &quot;strongly&quot; predicted by a linear STRF, with &quot;strong&quot; defined as r&gt;0.10. The authors need to make clear where the subset of 16 electrodes with significant STRFs were located, and also whether or not this fraction of locations (16/X) is significantly above chance (e.g., correcting for false discovery rate). Most likely, X should include all auditory-responsive vSMC sites, but this is not stated clearly. In addition, the authors should explain by what criterion r&gt;0.10 (i.e., a correlation in which 1% of the variance is explained by the strf) is a good criterion for a &quot;strong&quot; prediction. For instance, how does this correlation strength compare to STRF predictions in STG?</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comments and have attempted to clarify the results of the STRF analysis in the new manuscript, as well as address the issue of correction for multiple comparisons. We recalculated our STRF correlations using a shuffled permutation test in which we take the predicted response from the STRF and shuffle it in time, using 500 ms chunks to maintain some of the temporal correlations inherent in the ECoG signal. We then calculate the correlation between the shuffled predictions and the actual response to get a sense of the magnitude of STRF correlations that would be observed due to chance. We perform this shuffling procedure 1000 times and calculate the p-value as the percentage of times that the shuffled time series correlations are higher than the correlations from our STRF prediction. We then perform FDR correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. As it turns out, there are many STRF correlations with r-values less than 0.1 that are still significantly higher than what would be expected due to chance. Still, we believe r = 0.1 to be a reasonable cutoff and have opted not to include more sites with lower correlation values. We have toned down the claim that these sites are &quot;strongly&quot; predicted by a linear STRF, instead writing “A fraction of vSMC sites (16/98 sites total) were reasonably well-predicted with a linear STRF (r&gt;=0.10, p&lt;0.01) (Theunissen et al., 2001).” Although this fraction is relatively small, these sites may encode auditory-related features that are not spectrotemporal in nature, or may respond nonlinearly to auditory features, and thus would not be captured appropriately by the STRF. In addition, more typical auditory areas including the anterior STG can show significant auditory responses that are not adequately captured by a linear STRF. The electrodes described here were located in both superior and inferior vSMC, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which includes STRFs from all 5 subjects plotted as a function of the rostral-caudal distance from the central sulcus and the dorsal distance from the Sylvian fissure in millimeters.</p><p>On average, the correlation strength in the vSMC electrodes is lower than the correlation strength in STG electrodes, as shown by the new panel b added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and additional text in the Results section: “Still, the prediction performance of STRFs in vSMC was generally lower than that of the STG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
