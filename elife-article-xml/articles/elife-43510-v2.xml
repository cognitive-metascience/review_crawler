challenges to malaria elimination and are difficult to measure using traditional surveillance data. To address this challenge, we systematically collected parasite genetic data and travel history from thousands of malaria cases across northeastern Namibia and estimated human mobility from mobile phone data. We observed strong fine-scale spatial structure in local parasite populations, providing positive evidence that the majority of cases were due to local transmission. This result was largely consistent with estimates from mobile phone and travel history data. However, genetic data identified more detailed and extensive evidence of parasite connectivity over hundreds of kilometers than the other data, within Namibia and across the Angolan and Zambian borders. Our results provide a framework for incorporating genetic data into malaria surveillance and provide evidence that both strengthening of local interventions and regional coordination are likely necessary to eliminate malaria in this region of Southern Africa.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43510.002</object-id><title>eLife digest :</title><p>The number of malaria cases has dropped in some Southern Africa countries, but others still remain seriously affected. When people travel within and between countries, they can bring the parasites that cause the disease to different areas. This can fuel local transmission or even lead to outbreaks in a malaria-free area.</p><p>When new malaria patients are diagnosed, they are often asked to report their recent travel history, so that the origin of their infection can be tracked. In theory, this would help to spot regions where the disease is imported from, and design targeted interventions.</p><p>However, it is difficult to know exactly where the parasites come from based on self-disclosed travel history. At best, this history can provide information about that persons infection but nothing further in the past; at worst this history can be completely incorrect. Parasite DNA, on the other hand, has the potential to bring with it an indelible record of the past. To address the problem of determining where malaria infections came from, Tessema, Wesolowski et al. focused on Northern Namibia, a region where malaria persists despite being practically absent from the rest of the country. Patients movements were assessed using mobile phone call records as well as self-reported travel history In addition, samples a single drop of blood were taken so that the genetic information of the parasites could be examined.</p><p>Combining genetic data with travel history and phone records, Tessema, Wesolowski et al. found that, in Northern Namibia, most people had gotten infected by malaria locally. However, the genetic analyses also revealed that certain infections came from places across the Angolan and Zambian borders, information that was much more difficult to obtain using self-report or mobile phone data. A new, separate study by Chang et al. also supports these results, showing that, in Bangladesh, combining genetic data with travel history and mobile phone records helps to track how malaria spreads.</p><p>Overall, the work by Tessema, Wesolowski et al. indicate that, in Northern Namibia, it will be necessary to strengthen local interventions to eliminate malaria. However, different countries in the region may also need to coordinate to decrease malaria nearby and reduce the number of cases coming into the country. While genetic data can help to monitor how new malaria cases are imported, this knowledge will be most valuable if it is routinely collected across countries. New tools will also be required to translate genetic data into information that can easily be used for control and elimination programs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>parasite genomics</kwd><kwd>mobility</kwd><kwd>genetic epidemiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tessema</surname><given-names>Sofonias</given-names></name><name><surname>Greenhouse</surname><given-names>Bryan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wesolowski</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wesolowski</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Biohub</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenhouse</surname><given-names>Bryan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combining parasite genetic and human mobility data can provide detailed information on local and cross-border connectivity, allowing programs to strengthen local and regional coordination for successful elimination of malaria.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Renewed efforts against malaria have resulted in substantial gains in malaria control, with active plans to eliminate malaria from 35 countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Newby et al., 2016</xref>). Malaria elimination requires that national and regional strategies consider the impact of local and cross-border importation on local transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cotter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Marshall et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wangdi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">WHO, 2017</xref>). This is particularly important for eliminating countries that share porous borders with areas of higher transmission, where importation can play a major role in sustaining or reestablishing local transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sturrock et al., 2015</xref>). Identifying within-country and cross-border blocks of high parasite connectivity and coordinating elimination strategies accordingly will likely be required for national and regional success.</p><p>Coordinating the optimal interventions to deploy when and where depends on understanding the impact of imported malaria infections on local transmission. If transmission is self-sustained locally, local control measures such as vector control will be necessary. If importation strongly connects the local parasite population to an external one, then interventions aimed at reducing malaria in these sources of importation or otherwise reducing vulnerability to importation may additionally be needed or even take precedence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cotter et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Currently, the extent of importation is estimated primarily by taking recent travel histories of malaria cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sturrock et al., 2015</xref>) and, less commonly, from more general estimates of human mobility. However, routine collection of travel data is not universal, even in areas nearing elimination, and requires a robust surveillance system. When these data are collected, they are often incomplete (e.g. only the most recent travel is reported), or are otherwise inaccurate (e.g. due to disincentives such as reduced access to free healthcare when a patient reports foreign nationality) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Marshall et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pindolia et al., 2012</xref>). Even with an accurate travel history, it can be difficult to tell with confidence whether malaria parasites were acquired locally or during travel. Beyond these factors, obtaining travel history only from those presenting with symptomatic malaria does not address the contribution of asymptomatic carriers, which may be the population primarily responsible for importation. Thus, travel data alone are often unable to accurately capture the relative contribution of malaria importation to local transmission. Since travel data are often limited, approaches based on movement of the overall human population using anonymized mobile phone data have been developed to create a generalizable and scalable framework for estimating movement of malaria parasites. However, these methods rely heavily on modeling assumptions, assume that the movement patterns of mobile phone owners and the at risk population are similar, and have not been used to measure international travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pindolia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ruktanonchai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tatem, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tatem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wesolowski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Since travel history and other data on human movement are limited in their ability to provide reliable information on malaria parasite connectivity, it may be valuable for control programs to additionally collect data on parasite genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wesolowski et al., 2018</xref>). In principle, data on the genetics of malaria parasites have the potential to provide the most direct measure of parasite connectivity and to identify relevant sources and sinks of parasite movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auburn and Barry, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Escalante et al., 2015</xref>). However, there have been few efforts to systematically collect and genotype malaria infected individuals at sufficient spatial and temporal scale or density to be useful in this regard. In addition, it has been difficult to detect relevant spatial signals in parasite genetic data using existing population genetic methods, particularly in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa that have high levels of population diversity and polyclonal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mobegi et al., 2012</xref>). Ideally, multiple complementary sources of human and parasite data would be compared and integrated to better understand the movement of malaria parasites and contribution to transmission at various spatial scales.</p><p>As part of the Elimination 8 (E8) initiative, a regional effort to eliminate malaria from Southern Africa, Namibia has been successful in decreasing malarial morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Elimination 8, 2015</xref>). However, this success has recently stalled, with the number of reported cases increasing in the last few years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nghipumbwa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">WHO, 2017</xref>). To achieve the national malaria elimination target of 2020, it will be critical to reassess the elimination strategy in northern Namibia, where nearly all cases in the country are reported. Of particular concern is determining the contribution and spatial scale of local transmission to malaria within northern Namibia, which should guide the geographic coverage and relative timing of local interventions, and the contribution of importation from neighboring Angola and Zambia, which should guide cross-border strategies. To address these concerns, we systematically collected parasite genetic data and human mobility data – travel history from confirmed malaria cases and national mobile phone call data records – from the region in 2015–16. From these data, we aimed to determine the importance of local transmission and imported malaria, and to compare estimates of parasite connectivity at various spatial scales obtained from the different data sources. Our results demonstrate strong evidence for local transmission in northern Namibia, provide insight into patterns of parasite connectivity within Namibia and across national borders, and demonstrate the feasibility of efficiently generating actionable information for malaria control by augmenting traditional surveillance data with a direct evaluation of the parasite population.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 4643 RDT confirmed, symptomatic malaria cases were enrolled from 29 health facilities in northeastern Namibia; 23 from Kavango East and six from Zambezi regions.

When stratified by health facilities, the patterns of within host and population diversity showed variability within districts, providing supporting evidence of fine-scale heterogeneity of malaria transmission in the study area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). For example, infections detected at Rundu district hospital had the highest within-host diversity, which may be due to the larger proportion of patients who traveled to or resided in Angola (reported by 13% of patients). Infections from Rundu also had the highest population diversity, which may be attributable to the large catchment area of this facility (48% came from beyond the study region). Cases were then classified as local or imported based on recent travel history and the location of residence. Infections from individuals with a history consistent with importation had higher within-host diversity than those without, despite having similar population-level diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). These data suggest a lower rate of superinfection and thus less local transmission in northeastern Namibia compared to the international source populations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43510.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Within-host diversity, heterozygosity and genetic relatedness.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Multiplicity of infection (MOI); (<bold>B</bold>) within-host diversity index (1-F<sub>WS</sub>) and (<bold>C</bold>) population level genetic diversity (heterozygosity, H<sub>E</sub>) compared between potentially imported samples (black) and those without any evidence of being imported (gray).

Infections with malaria parasites from Namibia and northern Angola were not closely related (mean proportion of highly related infections = 0.00004 [Range = 0–0.00015]). However, parasites between health districts of Namibia; between Namibia and southern Angola; and between Namibia and Western and Southern provinces of Zambia were more closely related (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Overall, infections from Namibia were on average 142 times more likely to be genetically related to those from southern Angola and 191 times to Zambia than to those from northern Angola, indicating substantial parasite mixing within the geographically connected Namibia-Angola-Zambia regional block. In contrast, this finding suggests limited parasite connectivity between northern and southern Angola, though limited, non-contemporaneous sampling within Angola makes it difficult to make more detailed conclusions about transmission in this country. Within Namibia, infections from Andara and Nyangana were 3 and 4 times more likely to be genetically related to Zambezi than infections sampled from nearby Rundu, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>When evaluating specific connections between the nine locations, we estimated the direction of parasite flow in addition to the degree of connectivity between areas by weighting the pairwise proportion of highly related infections by malaria incidence to account for the differential risk of infections in different areas. Results from this analysis provided substantially more information on regional connectivity than using travel history data alone. The four studied health districts within Namibia were connected to each other but had stronger connections to nearby cross-border locations than to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). The most important source populations were Calai and Dirico (border towns in southern Angola), followed by Western and Southern provinces of Zambia. Although there was evidence of importation into both Kavango East and Zambezi regions from other countries, based on these data the Zambezi region was estimated to receive high rates of importation from a larger number of sources (i.e., it was a dominant sink population).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is clear that achieving elimination of malaria will require strategic coordination of local and regional interventions guided by accurate intelligence on parasite movement; what has not been clear is how to best obtain this information. In this study, we demonstrated that augmentation of traditional malaria surveillance with parasite genetic data added substantially to the understanding of transmission epidemiology in a critical region of Southern Africa straddling the border between Namibia, Angola, and Zambia. First, parasite genetics provided positive evidence that the majority of malaria cases observed in northeastern Namibia were due to local transmission, evidenced by the strong fine-scale spatial structure in the genetic data. It would be difficult to explain such consistent spatial clustering of highly related parasites and the observed decay with distance if local transmission did not predominate. This is a key piece of programmatically relevant information that would have been difficult to confirm with negative evidence, that is merely based on a lack of history consistent with importation, especially given potential disincentives for individuals to report living outside of Namibia. Second, the addition of genetic data to travel histories provided more detailed and extensive evidence of parasite connectivity over hundreds of kilometers, both within Namibia and across borders from Angola and Zambia. Conclusions regarding the origins and relative magnitude of malaria importation from genetic data were distinct from those obtained from travel history alone, which were likely limited by sparsity and bias, and from mobility from the mobile phone data, which were unable to inform cross-border movement in this study and appeared to underestimate the importance of long-distance connections within Namibia. Although cross-border movement is possible to obtain from mobile phone calling data, for example if the handset ID was used instead as an anonymized ID, data available for this study were limited to national travel patterns.</p><p>Malaria programs will require targeted interventions at sub-national scales to effectively achieve and sustain elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">WHO, 2017</xref>). The success of such programs, for example targeted vector control, focal screening and treatment, and mass drug administration will largely be dependent on tailoring interventions to drivers of ongoing transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">WHO, 2014</xref>). Using a novel analytic framework, we found that despite a signal of predominantly local transmission (within tens of kilometers), parasite populations in Namibia remain highly connected at longer scales within and between the two administrative regions (over hundreds of kilometers). In this context, restricting interventions to a relatively small area, such as a region, may result in improved malaria control but is unlikely to achieve elimination unless any malaria transmission from imported parasites is completely prevented. Indeed, limiting elimination efforts to national boundaries may be doomed to fail for the same reasons, for example it may be necessary for Namibia to coordinate efforts with Angola and Zambia to eliminate transmission within its own boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khadka et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that parasite populations within Namibia were in many cases more closely connected to those across the border than to other parasites from the same country. At a more nuanced level, variations in the degree of genetic connectivity between areas we observed could be used to optimize the order in which interventions may be most efficiently implemented. For example, all else being equal, targeting interventions to locations with greater genetic connectivity than those with lower connectivity may be more effective in fragmenting the parasite population and reducing the influx of malaria from pockets of transmission. This finding is consistent with the previous observation that malaria cases were clustered in northeastern Namibia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tatem et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, enhancing malaria surveillance and access to care, for example through additional clinics or border posts, may be effective in reducing the extent of cross-border importation if deployed in areas with high measured importation rates.</p><p>We estimated malaria parasite connectivity from mobile phone data, travel history, and parasite genetics, allowing us to compare estimates based on human population movement to more direct estimates of the connectivity of parasite populations. In principle, anonymized mobile phone data can provide a continuous and inexpensive source of human mobility data. Within Namibia, connectivity estimates derived from vast amounts of mobile phone data roughly mirrored those derived from genetics, though they were predominated by small scale movements and did not capture the extent of longer distance connections revealed by the genetic data. This difference could be due to differential patterns of movement of people with access to mobile phone and those who potentially transmit malaria, limitations in the accuracy of malaria incidence estimates used as inputs in the model, or the temporal difference between the two data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ruktanonchai et al., 2016</xref>). An important current limitation of call data records analyzed was the inability to provide any information on movement beyond national boundaries.</p><p>In contrast to mobile phone data, travel data collected from symptomatic cases were sparser, estimated less travel, and were collected at a coarser spatial scale, limiting agreement with the genetic data within Namibia. However, travel data were able to provide low-resolution information and demonstrated evidence of cross-border importation by infected individuals, albeit possibly biased by patient omission on international travel or residence. Estimates derived from genetics are likely to be more comprehensive, as even with perfect accuracy travel history only captures movements of the interviewed patient while genetics can record evidence of movement through multiple generations of transmission. Importantly, information on travel allowed us to greatly extend the utility of genetic data, providing a means of ‘sampling’ parasites from beyond the study site in those with a definitive history of international travel. Travel history remains a critical part of routine surveillance, and when collected reliably and ideally at finer spatial scale than done here will likely provide important information on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tejedor-Garavito et al., 2017</xref>) and in conjunction with genetic data.</p><p>The genetic data used in this study were generated via traditional methods – a panel of 26 microsatellites – but were well-suited for the intended application and captured strong spatial signal over local and regional scales. Particular strengths of these data were the ability to capture information from polyclonal infections (77% of the study population) given the multiallelic nature of the loci, and to obtain robust results from easily collected field samples (dried blood spots and used rapid diagnostic tests). Targeted deep sequencing of short, multiallelic haplotypes may provide similarly rich data from polyclonal infections, allowing greater flexibility in the number and location of loci, facilitating easier comparisons across data sets, and taking advantage of continual advances and cost savings in sequencing technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aydemir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lerch et al., 2017</xref>). Generating <italic>P. falciparum</italic> whole genome sequence data from Southern Africa would facilitate rational selection of the most informative sequence targets for local and regional parasite movement.</p><p>Advances in analytical methods would likewise improve the quality of information obtained from parasite genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wesolowski et al., 2018</xref>). Our methods for computing genetic relatedness, like the genetic data themselves, were relatively simple but provided useful information on relative connectivity between geographic areas. In this study site, classical methods for measuring or visualizing genetic differentiation (e.g., Gst, STRUCTURE, or phylogenetic trees) had limited utility due to the marginal differences in allele frequencies between geographically proximal locations in this relatively compact study site and the inability to utilize all information from polyclonal infections. Currently, there are few established analytical approaches to quantify fine-scale genetic connectivity between locations with predominantly polyclonal infections. Estimation of pairwise genetic relatedness between all infections in this study allowed the incorporation of data from all parasites detected in infections and extraction of useful signals of recent transmission created by recombination and cotransmission of multiple parasites. However, more sophisticated bioinformatics, statistical, and modeling tools that are designed to take advantage of genetic data from polyclonal infections and map these onto quantitative, calibrated estimates of migration rates would transform the utility of genetic data for understanding operationally relevant transmission patterns. The availability of such tools would provide a strong rationale for coordinated collection of regional data on parasite genetics, allowing for more systematic evaluation of malaria transmission and generalized utility.</p><p>The incorporation of parasite genetics added an important dimension to the understanding of local and cross-border malaria transmission epidemiology and connectivity in this area of the Elimination 8 region of Africa. Our results, showing strong connectivity between malaria parasite populations over hundreds of kilometers within Namibia and across national borders, calls for strengthening the simultaneous coordination of efforts between the Elimination eight countries. Furthermore, our data demonstrate the feasibility and added value of systematically integrating genetic data into national and regional surveillance efforts, particularly when the goal is elimination and movement of malaria parasites may threaten this goal or influence interventions. A combination of human mobility and parasite genetic data is proposed to mitigate limitations of each individual data source in isolation and to provide the most robust intelligence to guide local and regional strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Namibia and the University of California, San Francisco (Identification numbers 15–17422 and 14–14576).

In Kavango East, 3871 symptomatic cases from 23 health facilities were enrolled and used RDTs were collected from March to June 2016. In the Zambezi region, 772 symptomatic cases from six health facilities were enrolled between February 2015 and June 2016 and dried blood spots (DBS) were collected at the time of diagnosis. In both locations, additional patient information such as age, residence, local and international travel history were collected.

In the Kavango travel survey, individuals were asked if there was any travel to a select number of locations including neighboring towns, other districts/provinces in Namibia and Angola, and other neighboring countries. In the Zambezi travel survey, individuals were able to provide information about travel to any location. These free-response questions were geocoded to the village and regional levels and included both national and international destinations. Individuals were also asked to provide information on the duration of the trip (in days). When analyzing travel survey data, each individual’s time over the prior 30 days was allocated based on their location of residence and the reported time spent away from their residence. To compare with the genetic data, health facility catchments were aggregated to the corresponding travel survey location based on the location of the catchment centroid.</p><p>Mobile phone call data records were obtained from October 2010 to September 2011.

Trips to other mobile phone tower catchments were inferred if their primary daily location was recorded at another tower and was not limited to only night time use. All other time was assumed to be spent at their primary mobile phone tower. Individuals were aggregated to a single primary tower location, and mobility per mobile phone tower catchment was calculated as a distribution of time spent at each one of the other mobile phone tower catchments, including the time spent at the primary tower location. Mobile phone tower catchments and health facility catchments, although covering the same geographic area, did not correspond to a one-to-one match.

For all samples extracted from DBS, parasite density was quantified using <italic>var</italic>-ATS ultra-sensitive qPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hofmann et al., 2015</xref>) and samples with more than 10 parasites/µL of blood were genotyped. Given the large number of RDT samples collected, a subset was selected for extraction and genotyping as follows. If less than 100 RDTs were collected from a given clinic, all were genotyped. If more than 100 RDTs were collected from a given clinic, any cases with travel history and 100 cases without travel history were genotyped. In addition, all samples were genotyped from one hospital (Nyangana Hospital) to validate subsampling. For samples extracted from RDTs, parasite density was quantified on a subset. When positive, parasite density was almost always above the genotyping threshold (n = 320, median = 13612 parasites/µL of blood). A total of 2990 samples were genotyped using 26 microsatellite markers as described previously (Liu et al., under preparation). Briefly, two-rounds of PCR protocol were used to amplify the 26 microsatellite loci. The multiplex primary PCR was performed in 4 groups using two different PCR conditions. 1 µL of the amplified product was then used as a template for the individual PCR for each marker. PCR products were then diluted and sized by denaturing capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3730XL analyzer with GeneScan 400HD ROX size standard (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The resulting electropherograms were analyzed using microSPAT software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Murphy, 2018</xref>) to automate identification of true alleles and differentiate real peaks from artifacts.

In order to determine pairs of infections which were more related than expected by chance, we used genotyping data with a similar MOI distribution from countries in West, Central and East Africa (n = 432, data from Liu et al., under preparation). These countries are not geographically connected to the study area, thus there is likely limited direct parasite connectivity. The distribution of pairwise genetic relatedness between these and Namibia samples was estimated and used as the expected distribution of relatedness in the absence of a direct transmission link and/or a recent importation event (i.e., a null distribution). For each pair of locations and the null distribution, IBS values were binned into 20 bins. For each bin, the difference in the proportion of observed and expected pairs under the null distribution was computed. The last bin at which the observed proportion was greater than the null distribution, starting from 1 to 0, was used as a cut-off to determine the proportion of highly related infections. To investigate spatial connectivity between locations, the proportions of highly related infections above the cut-off were compared. The median of the cut-off was an IBS of 0.55. The overall proportion of highly related infections was calculated as the sum of the proportions of observed pairs above the estimated cut-off minus the proportion in the null distribution.

The relative importation estimate between pair of locations was calculated as:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> are importation estimates based on genetic data from location A to location B and vice versa;

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Using parasite genetic and human mobility data to infer local and cross-border malaria connectivity in Southern Africa&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Neil Ferguson as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Samir Bhatt (Reviewer #1) and Thomas S Churcher (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, it was felt there is a need for this type of work, the methods are appropriate and the results are clear, though it was felt a little more detail on the methods and rationale for some of the statements given in the Discussion was needed.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The problem of local and cross-border malaria importation is at the forefront of the malaria elimination efforts and previous methods for quantifying this have severe limitations. In this paper the authors develop a framework for incorporating genetic data into malaria surveillance. The authors make use of parasite genetic data combined with estimated patterns of human mobility from mobile phone data in northeastern Namibia. The fine-scale spatial structure in the genetic data indicated that most cases resulted from local transmission. However, combining the genetic data with travel histories provided evidence of parasite connectivity over hundreds of kilometers, both within Namibia and across the borders with Angola and Zambia.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Discussion starts by saying that &quot;in this study, we demonstrated that augmentation of traditional malaria surveillance with parasite genetics provided positive, empirical data that the majority of malaria cases observed in northeastern Namibia were due to local transmission&quot;. The paper presents lots of data that gives this impression but the authors should state in a following sentence which results specifically gives them this strong conclusion. This would help the reader isolate what is the key information and this is especially needed given the lack of genetic samples from just north of the border. Though the reviewers agree with the statement, some of the language could be tapered.</p><p>2) The authors first use published methods to look for a geographical gradient in parasite genetics and both came out negative for substantial geographical clustering so they derive another method. The conclusions should describe why more conventional methods of clustering failed to find a significant result and why the method they develop should be used in future (if that is the authors opinion).</p><p>3) Subsection “Evidence of cross-border connectivity between Namibia, Angola and Zambia”, second paragraph. Much is made that the genetics are more similar to southern Angola than the north, though it should be stressed that geographically south Angola and Namibia are much closer geographically. Saying that there is a breakpoint within Angola (as the legend states) seems to be an over-extrapolation of the results, especially give the relatively low sampling in the sites outside of Namibia. Northern Angola data were also collected up to 2 years before, and this should be mentioned.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43510.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Discussion starts by saying that &quot;in this study, we demonstrated that augmentation of traditional malaria surveillance with parasite genetics provided positive, empirical data that the majority of malaria cases observed in northeastern Namibia were due to local transmission&quot;.

The distinction we were trying to make was between positive evidence versus negative evidence, i.e. a lack of travel history, and did not mean to imply that we were “positive” this is what the data showed. We have edited language to better explain what aspects of the genetic data support this conclusion and to make the language more clear as a comparison with the (also supportive) information being provided by travel history:</p><p><italic>“</italic>First, parasite genetics provided positive evidence that the majority of malaria cases observed in northeastern Namibia were due to local transmission, evidenced by the strong fine-scale spatial structure in the genetic data. […] This is a key piece of programmatically relevant information that would have been difficult to confirm with negative evidence, i.e. merely based on a lack of history consistent with importation, especially given potential disincentives for individuals to report living outside of Namibia.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors first use published methods to look for a geographical gradient in parasite genetics and both came out negative for substantial geographical clustering so they derive another method. The conclusions should describe why more conventional methods of clustering failed to find a significant result and why the method they develop should be used in future (if that is the authors opinion).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting the need to clarify why conventional measures were limited in this study. We have amended the Discussion section to clarify the limitations of classical measures in this study and emphasize the need to develop novel tools to estimate genetic relatedness and importation from genetic data at a fine-scale level:</p><p>“In this study site, classical methods for measuring or visualizing genetic differentiation (e.g., Gst, STRUCTURE, or phylogenetic trees) had limited utility due to the marginal differences in allele frequencies between geographically proximal locations in this relatively compact study site and the inability to utilize all information from polyclonal infections. […] Estimation of pairwise genetic relatedness between all infections in this study allowed the incorporation of data from all parasites detected in infections and extraction of useful signals of recent transmission created by recombination and cotransmission of multiple parasites.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Evidence of cross-border connectivity between Namibia, Angola and Zambia”, second paragraph. Much is made that the genetics are more similar to southern Angola than the north, though it should be stressed that geographically south Angola and Namibia are much closer geographically. Saying that there is a breakpoint within Angola (as the legend states) seems to be an over-extrapolation of the results, especially give the relatively low sampling in the sites outside of Namibia. Northern Angola data were also collected up to 2 years before, and this should be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers make a good point. The Results section and Figure 5 legend have been updated to highlight the lack of extensive sampling in Angola and the geographic proximity of northern Namibia and southern Angola, including removing the word “breakpoint” as follows:</p><p>“Overall, infections from Namibia were on average 142 times more likely to be genetically related to those from southern Angola and 191 times to Zambia than to those from northern Angola, indicating substantial parasite mixing within the geographically connected Namibia-Angola-Zambia regional block. […] Within Namibia, infections from Andara and Nyangana were 3 and 4 times more likely to be genetically related to Zambezi than infections sampled from nearby Rundu, respectively (Figure 5B).”</p><p>Figure 5 legend (updated section):</p><p>“Northern Angola was not strongly related to samples in the study area and corresponding cross-border region, suggesting that parasite flow between southern and northern Angola is less than that between (more geographically proximate) cross-border regions of northern Namibia and southern Angola.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
