While dengue virus (DENV) remains the most important arbovirus worldwide, the recent emergence of Chikungunya and Zika virus have exacerbated the impact of <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted diseases. The mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is the principal vector of DENV. Successful transmission of the virus requires completion of its infection cycle in the mosquito, beginning in the midgut tissue and eventually ending up in the saliva, through which it can be introduced into a new host.</p><p>The mosquito acquires the virus through a blood meal from an infected vertebrate host. The blood is digested in the insect’s midgut through the enzymatic action of a variety of proteolytic enzymes and provides the necessary nutrients for egg production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Noriega and Wells, 1999</xref>). The proteolytic activity of the midgut impairs DENV infection, and specific trypsins are associated with this modulation of susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brackney et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Molina-Cruz et al., 2005</xref>). In the midgut lumen, the virus also encounters a variety of microorganism, which constitutes the vector midgut microbiota. Studies have shown that some bacterial species can inhibit DENV infection and other human pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dennison et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ramirez et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2014</xref>). However, the midgut microbiota also comprises fungi, but little is yet known about the mosquito’s mycobiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angleró-Rodríguez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">da Costa and de Oliveira, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">da S Pereira et al., 2009</xref>).

After surface sterilization of mosquitoes, the midguts were dissected and plated on agar for fungal growth. Among the isolated fungi, we identified a <italic>Talaromyces</italic> species fungus and characterized at the microscopic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and molecular levels.

Seven days after DENV infection, midguts were dissected, and DENV titers were enumerated. Spore ingestion by Rockefeller and Orlando strains females resulted in a significant (p&lt;0.001) increased DENV infection.

Several studies have shown that the mosquito gut microbiota plays a critical role in determining the outcome of pathogen infection and that different species of gut-associated bacteria can inhibit DENV and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection in <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pumpuni et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ramirez et al., 2012</xref>). Studies of the mosquito microbiota have mainly focused on bacteria, whereas the influence of fungi on mosquito physiology and pathogen infection remains largely understudied. Most studies concerning the mosquito mycobiota have explored the biology of entomopathogenic fungi, such as <italic>Metarhizium anisopliae</italic> and <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic>, for use in mosquito control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Darbro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scholte et al., 2007</xref>). The association of diverse fungi, with different developmental stages of mosquitoes in the field is reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">da Costa and de Oliveira, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">da S Pereira et al., 2009</xref>), and fungi, including <italic>Talaromyces</italic> sp., have also been isolated from the midgut of other arthropods such as ticks, sandflies, and kissing bugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhoundi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marti et al., 2007</xref>). Their presence is not surprising, since mosquitoes and many other insect vectors of disease are constantly exposed to a fungus-rich environment, including the larval breeding habitat, the plant nectars on which the adults feed, and the sites on which they rest.</p><p>We have shown that the presence of <italic>Tsp_PR</italic> spores or fungus secreted-molecules in the midgut tissue of the mosquito results in higher DENV infections in two different <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> strains. However, modulation of infection does not seem to be a general property of a closely related <italic>Penicillium</italic> species, since exposure of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to whole spores or the secretome of another mosquito-associated species, <italic>Penicillium chrysogenum,</italic> did not affect DENV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angleró-Rodríguez et al., 2016</xref>). Our study suggests that <italic>Tsp_PR</italic> produces a factor(s) that is a likely a heat-sensitive protein or metabolite that alters the mosquito’s susceptibility to DENV. Mosquitoes treated with the fungus secretome did not display differences in bacterial load in their midguts, indicating that the fungus-secreted factor(s) does not compromise the ability of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to control its intestinal microbiota.</p><p>Our transcriptomic analysis of how the <italic>Tsp_PR</italic> influences mosquito physiology pointed to a profound regulation of genes principally related to metabolism and digestion. Among the top up-regulated genes were ornithine decarboxylase, which is associated with polyamine biosynthesis; glucosyl/glucuronosyl transferases, which play an important role in the detoxification of xenobiotics and the regulation of endobiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2012</xref>); and cytochrome P450, which is involved in detoxification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Strode et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, a considerable number of up-regulated genes were associated with detoxification, suggesting that the fungus imposes a certain level of toxicity. However, <italic>Tsp_PR</italic> exposure did not seem to affect mosquito longevity. Perhaps the up-regulation of the detoxification machinery effectively reverses a detrimental effect.</p><p>Among the up-regulated genes, only glucosyl/glucuronosyl transferase (AAEL003099) modulates DENV infection in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sim et al., 2013</xref>). An earlier study showed that this gene was expressed at a lower level in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> strains that are refractory to DENV and at a higher level in DENV-susceptible strains, suggesting that the AAEL003099 gene acts as a DENV host factor. These findings are in agreement with our study, in which <italic>Tsp_PR</italic> secretome-exposed mosquitoes showed an elevated expression of AAEL003099. It is therefore possible that a <italic>Tsp_PR-</italic>mediated up-regulation of AAEL003099 contributes to the elevated DENV infection levels. Another up-regulated gene associated with proviral effect is ornithine decarboxylase, a recent study showed that the polyamine biosynthesis is associated with an enhanced infection of Chikungunya and Zika viruses in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mounce et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The most striking expression signature that resulted from <italic>Tsp_PR</italic> secretome exposure was a profound overrepresentation of down-regulated proteolysis genes. Trypsin genes were highly represented in this category, and they play a crucial role in the blood-digesting process in the mosquito midgut. Two groups of trypsins are produced after the blood meal: early trypsins during the first 6 hr post-blood meal, and the late trypsins between 8 and 36 hr post-blood meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barillas-Mury et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Noriega and Wells, 1999</xref>). However, the early trypsin mRNA is produced prior to feeding and is stored in the midgut epithelial cells, remaining untranslated until blood ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Noriega and Wells, 1999</xref>). Our transcriptomic analysis revealed trypsin AAEL010196 to be the most down-regulated, followed by four other trypsin genes (AAEL013714, AAEL010203, AAEL013715, and AAEL013707). We confirmed the functional significance of trypsin transcript depletion on DENV infection using RNAi-mediated gene knock-down studies.</p><p>A phylogenetic analysis based on the trypsin gene nucleotide sequences revealed that the AAEL013715 and AAEL013707 cluster together and show a closer resemblance to the early trypsin EA1 gene, which has been associated with <italic>Aedes</italic> blood digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The trypsin genes AAEL013714, AAEL010203, and AAEL010196 have a close resemblance to two well-characterized late trypsins, 5G1 and LT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brackney et al., 2010</xref>). Studies of trypsin 5G1 have established a link between trypsin activity and permissiveness to DENV infection, since RNAi-mediated repression of this gene results in greater susceptibility to the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">da Costa and de Oliveira, 1998</xref>). This finding agrees with our studies showing that silencing of a closely related trypsin, the AAEL013714, also results in a greater susceptibility to DENV infection. QTL mapping of loci that determine permissiveness to DENV also indicated the likely involvement of trypsin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosio et al., 2000</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28844.017</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Trypsin phylogeny.</title><p>Phylogenetic tree of the nucleotide alignment of trypsins regulated by <italic>Tsp_PR</italic> and others associated with the <italic>Aedes</italic> midgut.

Whether the exposure of mosquitoes to <italic>Tsp_PR</italic> in the field results in a greater permissiveness to DENV is unknown and difficult to assess, but greater permissiveness is most likely dependent on the intensity of the fungal exposure and the success of the fungus in persisting in the gut of various mosquito populations.

However, the rest of the manuscript is based on fungal secretome. This is like comparing apples and oranges.

This effect is credited to a down-regulation of genes involved in blood digestion, resulting in a decrease of trypsin activity, impaired digestion and diminished oogenesis. Apparently, trypsin also represses microbiota proliferation, as flies treated with the <italic>Tsp_PR</italic> secretome also harbor about 2x the density of bacteria in their gut.</p><p>The results, although mostly correlative, are significant. The molecular bases of the fungus effect are not explored in detail, but the study is s still comprehensive and might in part explain why certain populations of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are more prolific vectors of dengue than are others.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One of the main criticisms of the previous version of the manuscript was that the study did not conclusively link the anti-dengue effect with the disruption of blood digestion.

The first observation of the study was that feeding on live fungi resulted in an enhanced DENV infection, next we show that the effect on infection is attributed to fungus secreted factors. Fungi are generally known for their production and secretion of a variety of bioactive secondary metabolites. We proceeded with the remaining experiments using the fungus secretome because it contains the bioactivity of interest and represented a less complex sample than the entire organism, and the effect was stronger (<italic>P</italic> &lt;0.0001). The probability that the effect on DENV infection exerted by the spores/conidia (which we have shown secreted the bioactive molecule(s) which we call “secretome”) when present the midgut is attributed to something different from that contained in the filtered spore/conidia culture (secretome) is so small, and difficult to address, that we don’t think it deserved further speculation. We have addressed the other concerns regarding spores persistence in the midgut by performing a new set of experiments where fungus persistence up to 25 days after ingestion was monitored. We now show the persistence of the conidia in the mosquito midgut, after a single feeding on conidia, throughout the entire time-course.</p><p>Regarding the title of the manuscript; we have now provided functional evidence, through genesilencing assays, linking decreased trypsin transcript abundance to enhanced DENV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, 7E, 7F</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Even should the assumption that spores develop as actively as on the fungal medium and secrete all factors, there is no direct evidence that trypsin inhibition underlies the observed susceptibility, there is no functional analyses of the causative effect of trypsin genes or trypsin activity.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript we presented functional assays showing that midguts treated with the fungus secretome display a significantly lower trypsin enzymatic activity (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>However, to further address the reviewer’s concern, we have now provided functional evidence, through gene-silencing assays, linking decreased trypsin transcript abundance to enhanced DENV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, 7E, 7F</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, as described below, the authors do not use appropriate statistical methods to evaluate the significance of their results, and they do not provide their raw data for confirmation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided a detailed raw data file outlining the statistical analyses.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One of the main criticisms of the previous version of the manuscript was that the study did not conclusively link the anti-dengue effect with the disruption of blood digestion.
