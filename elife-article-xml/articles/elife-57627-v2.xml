and activate the cyclase domain of the Cas10 subunit, generating cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) molecules that act as a second messenger to signal infection, activating nucleases that degrade the nucleic acid of both invader and host. This can lead to dormancy or cell death; to avoid this, cells need a way to remove cOA from the cell once a viral infection has been defeated. Enzymes specialised for this task are known as ring nucleases, but are limited in their distribution. Here, we demonstrate that the widespread CRISPR associated protein Csx3, previously described as an RNA deadenylase, is a ring nuclease that rapidly degrades cyclic tetra-adenylate (cA<sub>4</sub>). The enzyme has an unusual cooperative reaction mechanism involving an active site that spans the interface between two dimers, sandwiching the cA<sub>4</sub> substrate. We propose the name Crn3 (CRISPR associated ring nuclease 3) for the Csx3 family.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacteria protect themselves from infections using a system called CRISPR-Cas, which helps the cells to detect and destroy invading threats. The type III CRISPR-Cas system, in particular, is one of the most widespread and efficient at killing viruses.</p><p>When a bacterium is infected, the CRISPR-Cas system takes a fragment of the genetic material of the virus, and copies it into a molecule. These molecular ‘police mugshots’ are then loaded into a complex of Cas proteins that patrol the cell, looking for a match and destroying any virus that can be identified.</p><p>Some Cas proteins also produce alarm signals, called cyclic oligoadenylates (cOAs), which can trigger additional defences. However, this process can damage the genetic material of the bacterium, harming or even killing the cell.</p><p>Enzymes known as ring nucleases can promptly degrade cOAs and turn off this defence system before it causes harm. However, ring nucleases have only been found in a few species to date; how most bacteria deal with cOA toxicity has remained unknown. Here, Athukoralage et al. set out to determine whether a widespread enzyme known as Csx3, which is often associated with type III CRISPR-Cas systems, could be an alternative off switch for cOA triggered defences.</p><p>Initial ‘test tube’ experiments with purified Csx3 proteins confirmed that the enzyme could indeed break down cOAs. A careful dissection of Csx3’s molecular structure, using biochemical and biophysical techniques, revealed that it worked by ‘sandwiching’ a cOA molecule between two co-operating portions of the enzyme. As a final test, Csx3 was introduced into strains of bacteria genetically engineered to have a fully functional Type III CRISPR-Cas system. In these cells, Csx3 successfully turned off the Type III immune response.</p><p>These results reveal a new way that bacteria avoid the toxic side effects of their own immune defences. Ultimately, this could pave the way for the development of anti-bacterial drugs that work by blocking Csx3 or similar proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>archaeoglobus fulgidus</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>Csx3</kwd><kwd>cyclic tetra-adenylate</kwd><kwd>cooperative enzyme</kwd><kwd>CARF domain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S000313/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grüschow</surname><given-names>Sabine</given-names></name><name><surname>Graham</surname><given-names>Shirley</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Malcolm F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/T004789/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McQuarrie</surname><given-names>Stuart</given-names></name><name><surname>Grüschow</surname><given-names>Sabine</given-names></name><name><surname>Gloster</surname><given-names>Tracey M</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Malcolm F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust Institutional Strategic Support Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>204821/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McQuarrie</surname><given-names>Stuart</given-names></name><name><surname>Gloster</surname><given-names>Tracey M</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Malcolm F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A widespread ribonuclease is a CRISPR-associated ring nuclease with a highly unusual cooperative mechanism involving tetramerisation of the enzyme.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The CRISPR system provides adaptive immunity against viruses and other Mobile Genetic Elements (MGE) in bacteria and archaea (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wright et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koonin and Makarova, 2017</xref>). Type III CRISPR systems are widespread in archaea and found in many bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Makarova et al., 2011</xref>), including the human pathogen <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grüschow et al., 2019</xref>). Type III effectors utilise a Cas7 backbone subunit to bind CRISPR RNA (crRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rouillon et al., 2013</xref>). This allows detection of the RNA encoded by invading MGE via base-pairing to the crRNA. Binding of this ‘target RNA’ results in subtle conformational changes in the effector complex, activating the catalytic Cas10 subunit which uses its HD-nuclease domain to degrade DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Elmore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Estrella et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kazlauskiene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2017b</xref>) and its cyclase domain to synthesise cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) molecules by polymerisation of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kazlauskiene et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Niewoehner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rouillon et al., 2018</xref>). These cyclic molecules, which range from 3 to 6 AMP monomers in size (cA<sub>3</sub> to cA<sub>6</sub>), act as second messengers in the cell, signalling viral infection and activating cellular defences. cA<sub>4</sub> and cA<sub>6</sub> bind specifically to two subtypes of CRISPR Associated Rossman Fold (CARF) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Makarova et al., 2014</xref>). These domains are fused to a range of effector domains that carry out defensive duties. The best characterised is the Csx1/Csm6 family that utilises a C-terminal HEPN (Higher Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes, Nucleotide binding) domain to cleave RNA non-specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niewoehner and Jinek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sheppard et al., 2016</xref>). The Csx1/Csm6 ancillary ribonucleases are crucial for CRISPR-based immunity in vivo in several different organisms, emphasizing the importance of cOA signalling for type III CRISPR defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grüschow et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foster et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deng et al., 2013</xref>). A wide variety of alternative CARF-domain proteins associated with type III CRISPR loci have been identified but not yet described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shmakov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shah et al., 2019</xref>), and recent work has characterized the cA<sub>4</sub>-activated DNA nickase Can1, which is present in <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McMahon et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Thus, type III CRISPR systems are capable of directing a multi-faceted antiviral defence on detection of foreign RNA in the cell. However, activation of this anti-viral state is known to generate collateral damage to host nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rostøl and Marraffini, 2019</xref>) that could lead to dormancy or cell death. While this could be an acceptable outcome for an infected cell, if a viral infection can be cleared then the cOA-signalling pathway needs a mechanism to remove the cOA molecules and return the cell to a basal state. Some archaea encode a dedicated ring nuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Athukoralage et al., 2018</xref>), recently named as the Crn1 family (CRISPR-associated ring nuclease 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Athukoralage et al., 2020a</xref>). Crn1 is a specialised CARF domain protein that splits the cA<sub>4</sub> ring into two linear A<sub>2</sub> products to switch off the antiviral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Athukoralage et al., 2018</xref>). In other systems, the CARF domains of Csx1/Csm6 family nucleases slowly degrade cOA, thus acting as bi-functional, self-limiting nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Athukoralage et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia-Doval et al., 2020</xref>). Many archaeal viruses and some bacteriophage also encode a specialised ring nuclease as an anti-CRISPR (Acr). This enzyme, known as AcrIII-1, binds cA<sub>4</sub> by means of a distinct protein fold (DUF1874) unrelated to the CARF domain, and degrades cA<sub>4</sub> rapidly using conserved active site residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Athukoralage et al., 2020a</xref>). These viral ring nucleases can abrogate type III CRISPR immunity by rapidly destroying the cA<sub>4</sub> infection signal. This enzyme has been co-opted into some bacterial type III CRISPR systems, where it likely acts to degrade cA<sub>4</sub> following clearance of phage infection. In this context, it has been named as CRISPR-associated ring nuclease 2 (Crn2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Athukoralage et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Samolygo et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Ring nucleases thus appear to be an important constituent of virus:host conflict in the expanding arena of cyclic nucleotide signalling. Here, we focus on the Csx3 family of proteins, which is found associated with many type III CRISPR systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shah et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shmakov et al., 2018</xref>). Csx3 from <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic> has been described as an RNA deadenylation enzyme and crystallised in complex with a pseudo-symmetric RNA tetraloop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yan et al., 2015</xref>). Subsequent structural analysis suggested that the Csx3 protein may be a distantly related member of the CARF family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Topuzlu and Lawrence, 2016</xref>). Spurred by these observations, we undertook a detailed study of the Csx3 protein. We demonstrate that Csx3 is, in fact, a cA<sub>4</sub>-specific ring nuclease, for which we propose the name Crn3 (CRISPR-associated ring nuclease 3). The enzyme has an unusual cooperative reaction mechanism involving the association of two dimers, bridged by the cA<sub>4</sub> substrate, to complete the active site. This mechanism may allow the cell to respond appropriately to changing cA<sub>4</sub> and Csx3 levels during viral infection and preserve type III CRISPR immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Csx3 is a ring nuclease specific for binding and cleavage of cA<sub>4</sub></title><p>The Csx3 protein from <italic>A. fulgidus</italic> was originally crystallised in the absence and presence of a pseudo-symmetric RNA tetranucleotide, and shown to have RNA deadenylase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yan et al., 2015</xref>). Given what is now known about cA<sub>4</sub> ring nucleases, we re-assessed the structure and potential function of the Csx3 protein. It has previously been suggested that the binding site for the RNA tetranucleotide could be compatible with binding of a symmetric cyclic oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Topuzlu and Lawrence, 2016</xref>), similar to those observed in other CARF family proteins. Examination of the genomic context of Csx3 in selected archaeal and bacterial species confirmed its close association with type III-B CRISPR systems and with CARF family proteins such as the ribonuclease Csx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), implying a role in cyclic oligoadenylate signalling and providing further impetus to re-examine the function of Csx3. Csx3 is most commonly observed in the euryarchaea and cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore cloned, expressed and purified <italic>A. fulgidus</italic> Csx3, allowing biochemical analysis. Initial studies showed that Csx3 binds cyclic tetra-adenylate with an apparent dissociation constant &lt;0.1 µM. In contrast, an RNA oligonucleotide (49-9A) with a 9A poly-adenylate 3’ tail bound 100-fold less tightly, with an apparent dissociation constant around 10 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Csx3 is a type III CRISPR accessory protein that binds cA<sub>4</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome context of selected Csx3 orthologues.

The importance of D69 was not explored in previous studies, so we mutated D69 to an alanine to test for a role in catalysis. The D69A variant was completely catalytically inactive as a ring nuclease, confirming the importance of D69 in the catalytic mechanism and suggesting that catalysis requires residues on both faces of the dimer (henceforth denoted as the ‘D69 face’ and ‘H60 face’). A possible explanation for this was that Csx3 has a shared active site that is formed when two dimers come together, forming a tetramer. A diagnostic test for this, as first proposed for the shared active site of aspartate transcarbamoylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wente and Schachman, 1987</xref>), is to mix inactive single variants and look for recovery of activity, as a fraction of intact active sites can be formed in the quaternary structure. Accordingly, we took the two inactive variants of Csx3, H60A and D69A, and tested their ring nuclease activity when mixed together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Ring nuclease activity was recovered when the two inactive variants were combined.

The orientation of each monomer in the dimer means the interactions with cA<sub>4</sub> are symmetrical. The majority of interactions are made by the D69 face. The cA<sub>4</sub> hydrogen bonds with the main chain atoms of I22, S44, G45, and I49, and side chain atoms of S44, R46 and R71 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Despite the number of main chain interactions, these residues are either absolutely (G45, I49, and R71) or highly (I22, S44 and R46) conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The one interaction evident from the H60 face with cA<sub>4</sub> is a strong (2.4–2.5 Å) hydrogen bond between H80 and the 2’-OH of the ribose ring. H60, H80, and another histidine residue (H57) nearby on the H60 face are all absolutely conserved in the Csx3 family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The ribose of each AMP moiety of cA<sub>4</sub> adopts a relaxed 2’-endo conformation, with the four adenine bases each filling a pocket. Given the Csx3 structure in complex with an RNA fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yan et al., 2015</xref>) had two adenine, one uracil and one guanine bases in the same position as the four adenine bases described here, there is obviously some plasticity around these recognition sites.</p><p>We anticipated that the comparison of the structure of Csx3 with cA<sub>4</sub> with the apo structure published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yan et al., 2015</xref>, in conjunction with activity assays on Csx3 variants, might provide clues as to the key residues in catalysis. Interestingly, R71 moves around 3.3 Å in order to form bidentate hydrogen bonds with an oxygen atom of a phosphate group, which we predict is adjacent to the phosphodiester bond that is cleaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and text below). This movement of R71 brings it within hydrogen bonding distance of D69, which has been shown to be vital for activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The position of H80 also differs between the two structures; the residue moves around 3.3 Å in order to hydrogen bond with the cA<sub>4</sub>. However, there is the caveat that the packing arrangement differs in the apo Csx3 structure, where H80 does not interact with a ligand or the face of an adjacent dimer and thus has nothing to ‘anchor’ it in place.</p><p>There are a number of histidine residues in or near the active site which could be involved in coordinating one or more Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). H60 and H57 are the most likely candidates; they are both absolutely conserved, and the position of the alanine residue in the H60A variant structure suggests this residue does not move significantly upon tetramer formation. The position of H57 is identical in the apo and cA<sub>4</sub>-bound structures. H60 and H57 are at the symmetry plane for the monomers constituting a dimer, meaning there are four histidine residues in close proximity. It is therefore feasible that one or both H60 and/or H57 residues coordinate one or more metal ions, and there is the possibility that just one metal ion bridges the two monomers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Predicted mechanism of Csx3</title><p>The structure of the Csx3:cA<sub>4</sub> complex reveals further details of the catalytic mechanism employed by the enzyme. The other ring nucleases characterised to date are metal independent enzymes that are predicted to work by catalysing in-line nucleophilic attack by a 2’-hydroxyl group of the cA<sub>4</sub> substrate on an adjacent phosphodiester bond. In this regard, the best candidate for cleavage is the P-O bond of the phosphate (labelled *), as the angle formed between the 2’-OH, P and O moieties is 152° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), which although lower to that seen for the ring nuclease AcrIII-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Athukoralage et al., 2020a</xref>), is still significantly higher than the angle (129°) between the same atoms in both adjacent adenine moieties. The absolutely conserved residue R71 interacts with this phosphate group via a bidentate hydrogen bond and may participate in stabilisation of the transition state or oxyanion leaving group. The conserved catalytic residue D69 in turn makes polar contacts with R71. These two residues may serve to position each other correctly (and/or perturb their respective p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub>’s) to enhance catalysis. The conserved H80 residue forms a hydrogen bond with the cA<sub>4</sub>. As it is one of only two residues from the H60 face that interacts with cA<sub>4</sub>, H80 may play a ‘pinning’ role to ensure engagement of the H60 face in catalysis. Csx3 variants R71A and H80A both displayed highly reduced ring nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>), consistent with important roles in cA<sub>4</sub> binding and/or catalysis.</p><p>The observations that Mn<sup>2+</sup> is required for catalysis, and that the primary product of cA<sub>4</sub> cleavage is A<sub>2</sub>P rather than A<sub>2</sub>&gt;P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) are suggestive (but not diagnostic) of a mechanism whereby a metal-activated hydroxyl ion initiates nucleophilic attack on the phosphodiester bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang, 2011</xref>). Uncertainty arises from the observation that the metal independent ring nuclease AcrIII-1 also largely generates A<sub>2</sub>P, presumably due to the rapid hydrolysis of the cyclic phosphate following phosphodiester bond cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Athukoralage et al., 2020a</xref>). The conserved histidine residues H57 and H60 are in appropriate positions to contribute to catalysis by coordination of the essential catalytic Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion(s). We see no evidence for the ion in our crystal structure, which may be due to the deletion of the H60 side chain. However, we note that the five Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions modelled in the Csx3 structure by Yan et al. have ambiguous electron density, hampered by the lower resolution data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yan et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the coordination distances for a Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion with a nitrogen atom (of the histidine residues) are longer than expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). It remains possible that H80 participates in binding a second metal ion in addition to its observed interaction with cA<sub>4</sub>.</p><p>The crystal structure of the Csx3:cA<sub>4</sub> complex neatly explains the observation of two distant active site regions, which come together in the complex. During the catalytic cycle, cA<sub>4</sub> binding and dimer:dimer sandwiching would lead to rapid cA<sub>4</sub> degradation that presumably in turn results in dissociation of the tetrameric active form. In support of this model, we observed that the inactive H60A variant of Csx3 had a milky, colloidal property on addition of cA<sub>4</sub>, which we interpreted as being due to the formation of long Csx3 fibres bridged by multiple cA<sub>4</sub> molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The wild-type protein did not show this behaviour, presumably because cA<sub>4</sub> was rapidly cleaved. We confirmed the propensity of Csx3 to oligomerise upon cA<sub>4</sub> addition by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements in buffer devoid of metal ions. Under these conditions, the addition of cA<sub>4</sub> resulted in mixed oligomeric species with significantly increased particle size and molecular weight, whereas the molecular weight of particles formed in the absence of cA<sub>4</sub> were consistent with homodimers of Csx3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>The discovery that two dimers of Csx3 must associate to sandwich the cA<sub>4</sub> substrate to effect cleavage opens the possibility of cooperative kinetic control in the Csx3 reaction cycle. To investigate this, we measured the initial reaction velocity of Csx3 ring nuclease activity under conditions of saturating cA<sub>4</sub> at a range of enzyme concentrations. A plot of initial velocity against [E] revealed a sigmoidal relationship that could be fitted to the Hill equation with a Hill coefficient of 1.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), consistent with obligate dimerization (of Csx3 dimers) in the reaction cycle. Practically, this cooperativity may be important to modulate the ring nuclease activity of Csx3 appropriately in the cell, particularly if the concentration of Csx3 changes in response to viral infection. The maximal multiple turnover rate constant observed under these conditions was 0.075 min<sup>−1 </sup>at 70°C, about 50-fold lower than the rate for the chemical step of catalysis measured under single turnover conditions at 50°C. Thus, the association of Csx3 dimers sandwiching cA<sub>4</sub>, or the dissociation of the complex following product formation, limits the turnover number of the enzyme significantly.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Sigmoidal response of ring nuclease activity as a function of Csx3 concentration.</title><p>Plot visualising initial reaction rates of cA<sub>4</sub> cleavage across increasing Csx3 concentrations.

Csx3 was originally described as a manganese dependent RNA deadenylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yan et al., 2015</xref>). The enzyme was co-crystallised with an RNA tetranucleotide, revealing a pseudo-symmetrical binding mode, and site directed mutagenesis revealed a crucial role for residues including H60 in catalysis – a residue that was situated on the opposite face of the protein from the RNA binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yan et al., 2015</xref>). This prompted the authors to make the reasonable speculation that RNA is bound on one side and wraps around the protein to be cleaved on the opposite side. Subsequently, Csx3 was identified as a divergent member of the CARF domain protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Topuzlu and Lawrence, 2016</xref>) that bind cyclic oligoadenylates generated by the Cas10 subunit of type III CRISPR systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Niewoehner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kazlauskiene et al., 2017</xref>).

While we confirmed the main experimental observations of the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yan et al., 2015</xref>), our analyses have revealed that Csx3 binds much more tightly to cA<sub>4</sub> than to RNA, is considerably more active as a cA<sub>4</sub>-specific ring nuclease than an RNA deadenylase, and has properties consistent with a function as a ring nuclease in vivo. These data indicate that Csx3 functions as a cA<sub>4</sub>-specific ring nuclease in type III CRISPR systems. The default ‘Csx’ nomenclature was designed for proteins of unknown function lacking a clear association with a specific CRISPR subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haft et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore propose the family name Crn3 (CRISPR-associated ring nuclease 3) for the Csx3 protein family.</p><p>The Crn1 family of ring nucleases, based on the CARF domain fold, was originally identified in the <italic>Sulfolobales</italic> and related crenarchaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Athukoralage et al., 2018</xref>), where their function is thought to be to remove cA<sub>4</sub> from the cell once a viral infection has been cleared. The anti-CRISPR ring nuclease AcrIII-1 appears in many archaeal virus and some bacteriophage genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Athukoralage et al., 2020a</xref>). Homologues of AcrIII-1 are also found associated with some bacterial type III CRISPR systems, and in this context have been named as CRISPR associated ring nuclease 2 (Crn2) enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Athukoralage et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Samolygo et al., 2020</xref>). Ring nuclease activity has also been identified associated with the CARF domains of some Csx1/Csm6 family ribonucleases, which are therefore bifunctional, self-limiting CRISPR ancillary defence enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Athukoralage et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia-Doval et al., 2020</xref>). Overall, the emerging picture is becoming clearer for the specific ring nucleases as they are identified in different archaeal and bacterial genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It appears to be an emerging paradigm that cells with a type III CRISPR defence require a mechanism to remove the cOA signal, either once viral infection is cleared, or when the system ‘fires’ inappropriately due to self-targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Athukoralage et al., 2020b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The ring nucleases.</title><p>The Crn1 family (represented here by Sso1393, PDB code 3QYF) is restricted to the crenarchaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Athukoralage et al., 2018</xref>).

One Csm6 enzyme (PDB code 6TUG) has been shown to degrade cA<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia-Doval et al., 2020</xref>). The Crn3 family is present in type III CRISPR systems in euryarchaeal and cyanobacteria. In contrast, the DUF1874 (Crn2/AcrIII-1) family uses a different protein fold to bind cA<sub>4</sub>. The Crn2 family of ring nucleases is quite widespread in bacterial type III CRISPR systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Samolygo et al., 2020</xref>). The same fold is used by the anti-CRISPR AcrIII-1 in archaeal viruses and bacteriophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Athukoralage et al., 2020a</xref>).

The single turnover reaction rate for cA<sub>4</sub> cleavage of 3.6 min<sup>−1</sup> is closer to that of the AcrIII-1 family, which utilises a distinct active site architecture, employing a conserved histidine residue as a general acid to stabilise the oxyanion leaving group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Athukoralage et al., 2020a</xref>). This raises an important question: why does Crn3/Csx3 degrade cA<sub>4</sub> so quickly when it plays a role in cellular defence rather than viral offense? Clearly, removing a crucial signal of viral infection that mobilises cellular defences is not something that should be undertaken precipitously. A key observation is that Crn3/Csx3 functions via a highly unusual cooperative mechanism where two enzyme dimers associate to sandwich a cA<sub>4</sub> substrate molecule. The active site is thus composed of two half-sites that are present on opposite faces of each dimeric moiety, with enzyme tetramers formed transiently to complete the catalytic cycle. There are many examples of allosteric control of enzyme quaternary structure and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Selwood and Jaffe, 2012</xref>) and of active sites shared across subunit interfaces. However, the substrate-induced, non-allosteric, dimerization of Csx3 appears unprecedented in the literature – a partial exception being the example of the Arginine Finger of AAA+ ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nagy et al., 2016</xref>), where interdomain interactions with ATP can influence quaternary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>This results in cooperative kinetics where low concentrations of Crn3/Csx3 provide very low levels of ring nuclease activity that rapidly increases with increasing enzyme concentrations. Furthermore, the rate of cA<sub>4</sub> turnover is limited by the formation of protein:cA<sub>4</sub> complexes or dissociation of the products, rather than the catalytic step, which is significantly faster. Together, these factors may provide a means to control ring nuclease activity in an appropriate manner thus ensuring that cA<sub>4</sub> activation of ancillary ribonucleases is allowed to proceed and provide immunity. Thus, alterations in the gene expression levels of Csx3 would have a large effect on the overall rate of catalysis.</p><p>Finally, the observed specificity of Crn3/Csx3 for cA<sub>4</sub> implicates the corresponding type III CRISPR systems as functioning via a cA<sub>4</sub> second messenger. This conforms to the paradigm established from studies of the Crn1 and Crn2/AcrIII-1 family as well as analysis of the specificity of the Csx1/Csm6 ribonucleases, which are most often activated by cA<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grüschow et al., 2019</xref>). Although this conclusion may be influenced by a sampling bias, it appears that cA<sub>4</sub> is the default cyclic nucleotide employed to signal infection and activate defences in type III CRISPR systems. It is possible that the pressure applied by cA<sub>4</sub>-specific anti-CRISPRs has resulted in the utilization of cA<sub>3</sub> and cA<sub>6</sub> second messengers in some bacterial defence systems. Given the pace of discovery in this area, new cellular and viral enzymes implicated in cyclic nucleotide signalling are anticipated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">SsoCsm complex (eight subunits)</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24119402">24119402</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">virus expression construct</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Csx3/Crn3</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26106927">26106927</ext-link></td><td valign="top">UniProtKB – O28415</td><td valign="top">plasmid expression construct</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MmCsx3</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">UniProtKB - A0A0F8HGG9</td><td valign="top">plasmid expression construct</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MtbCsm complex (five subunits)</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31392987">31392987</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">plasmid expression construct</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Thioalkalivibrio sulfidiphilus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">TsuCsx1</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31392987">31392987</ext-link></td><td valign="top">UniProtKB – B8GSI1</td><td valign="top">plasmid expression construct</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (Thermoanaerobacterium <break/><italic>phage THSA-485A</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AcrIII-1</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31942067">31942067</ext-link></td><td valign="top">UniProtKB - I3VYU1</td><td valign="top">plasmid expression construct</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning</title><p>For cloning, synthetic genes (g-blocks) encoding <italic>A. fulgidus</italic> or <italic>M. mazei</italic> Csx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), codon optimised for expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), Coralville, USA, and cloned into the pEhisV5spacerTev vector between the NcoI and BamHI restriction sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rouillon et al., 2019</xref>).

Your article has been favorably reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Joe Wade as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. All the reviewers have agreed to reveal their identity: Philip Kranzusch (Reviewer #2); Dipali Sashital (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus, the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Prokaryotic type III CRISPR systems rely on cyclic oligonucleotide second messengers such as cA<sub>4</sub> to coordinate antiviral defense. Here, Athukoralage et al. biochemically and structurally characterize Csx3, a new class of cA<sub>4</sub> nuclease. Unexpectedly, the Csx3 active site is formed between a sandwich of two Csx3 dimers, with the opposite face of each dimer contributing essential catalytic residues. Thus, the enzyme displays a highly unusual cooperative cleavage mechanism, which is expected to allow for tight regulatory control.</p><p>The reviewers were uniformly positive about the paper. The work is of high quality and the conclusions are well supported by the data throughout, and the reviewers were excited about the novel enzyme mechanism involving a pair of Csx3 dimers. No major changes are required. There are just a few comments, listed below, that should be straightforward to address.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The authors mention comparing the apo structure with the cA<sub>4</sub>-bound structure in the third paragraph of the subsection “The structure of Csx3 reveals a head-to-tail filament stabilised by cA<sub>4</sub>”, but there is not a figure depicting the description. An overlay of the two structures would help the reader to visualize the movement of R71 that is described in the text.</p><p>– It seems that the Kd of Csx3 for cA<sub>4</sub> (Figure 1, ~50 nM) is much lower than the half-maximal concentration for cleavage under multiple turnover conditions (Figure 6, ~2000 nM). This may suggest that Csx3 binds cA<sub>4</sub> with much higher affinity on one face than on the other. If this is the case, is it possible that Csx3 competes with other CARF proteins for binding to cA<sub>4</sub> even when cellular Csx3 concentrations are too low to allow tetramerization and catalysis?</p><p>– In the legend for Figure 1, the authors state an apparent Kd of ~50 nM for cA<sub>4</sub>. Is this based on the observation that there is little binding at 10 nM and nearly complete binding at 100 nM Csx3? Or have the authors performed a binding experiment with a finer range of concentrations between 10-100 nM Csx3? If the former, it may be better to set an upper bound for the Kd at 100 nM (e.g. Kd &lt;100 nM) than to estimate it as the middle of these two values. If the latter, it would be helpful to show an example image of such a binding experiment as a figure supplement.</p><p>– It would be helpful if Csx3 structure were shown from the same angle in all figures (Figures 4A, 5A and 7). Similarly, would it be possible to make the structures in Figure 7 the same size with respect to one another, to give the reader a better idea of the relative size/cA<sub>4</sub> binding sites for each ring nuclease? It would also be helpful to use the same coloring for the cA<sub>4</sub> and show it in the same orientation for all cA<sub>4</sub>-bound proteins.</p><p>– Future reference to the seminal work in this paper will be clearer if the name Crn3 appears in the manuscript title. Consider using Crn3 or both Crn3 / Csx3 in the title of the manuscript.</p><p>– The authors describe that cA<sub>4</sub> was soaked into pre-formed Crn3 crystals. The ability of cA<sub>4</sub> to diffuse into the pre-formed filamentous crystal packing is surprising and may have important implications for the mechanism of cA<sub>4</sub> recognition or product release. Did the authors collect X-ray data for apo Crn3 crystals that did not undergo cA<sub>4</sub> soaking? While these data are not essential for publication, they would be very interesting to help compare movement of residues in the cA<sub>4</sub> binding pocket related to analysis for Figure 5.</p><p>– In the experiments presented in Figure 3, does expression of the ring nuclease alone affect transformation efficiency? This experiment is not required for publication, but it would be useful if the authors can comment if this has been tested.</p><p>– Does Csx3 cleave other cyclic oligoadenylate molecules like cA3 or cA6? This experiment is not required for publication, but it would be useful if the authors can comment if this has been tested.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57627.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The authors mention comparing the apo structure with the cA<sub>4</sub>-bound structure in the third paragraph of the subsection “The structure of Csx3 reveals a head-to-tail filament stabilised by cA<sub>4</sub>”, but there is not a figure depicting the description.

Given we don’t know the concentration of Csx3 in the cell, it would be speculative to suggest a potential role as a cA<sub>4</sub> “sink”. Recent calculations of the concentration of cA<sub>4</sub> generated in infected cells (Athukoralage et al., 2020) make this unlikely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the legend for Figure 1, the authors state an apparent Kd of ~50 nM for cA<sub>4</sub>.
