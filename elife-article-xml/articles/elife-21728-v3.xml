Using an approach to map DNA replication at high resolution in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we show that replication origins are marked with specific histone modifications that define gene enhancers. We demonstrate that the level of enhancer associated modifications scale with the efficiency at which the origin is utilized. By mapping replication origins at different developmental stages, we show that the positions and activity of origins is largely invariant through embryogenesis. Contrary to expectation, we find that replication origins are specified prior to the broad onset of zygotic transcription, yet when transcription initiates it does so in close proximity to the pre-defined replication origins. Transcription and DNA replication origins are correlated, but the association breaks down when embryonic cell division ceases. Collectively, our data indicate that replication origins are fundamental organizers and regulators of gene activity through embryonic development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21728.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21728.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>gene organization</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM102253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whitehouse</surname><given-names>Iestyn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whitehouse</surname><given-names>Iestyn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>128073-RSG-15-041-01-DMC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whitehouse</surname><given-names>Iestyn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Replication origins are fundamental organizers and regulators of gene activity through embryonic development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In many developing organisms, early rounds of DNA replication occur in the absence of zygotic gene transcription: in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, the rapid genome duplication in early cycles is facilitated by the use of many, closely spaced, replication initiation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blumenthal et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callan, 1974</xref>). Within <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Xenopus</italic>, the onset of zygotic transcription is accompanied by a marked increase in S phase length, caused by a reduction in the number of replication initiation events, rather than changes in the rate of replication fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blumenthal et al., 1974</xref>). Numerous studies in metazoa have found particular chromatin signatures that typify transcriptionally active chromatin are enriched at replication initiation sites and also influence the relative time in S phase that origins are active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">MacAlpine and Almouzni, 2013</xref>). Yet a specific signature within chromatin that marks distinct sites in a genome where replication initiates has not been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Urban et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We chose to investigate DNA replication within developing <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, with the goal of characterizing signatures of replication origins and understanding replication patterns through early development. Our approach relies on transient depletion of DNA ligase I, which results in the accumulation of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Smith and Whitehouse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McGuffee et al., 2013</xref>). By sequencing Okazaki fragments we, and others, have provided high-resolution maps of DNA replication across budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McGuffee et al., 2013</xref>) and human genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Petryk et al., 2016</xref>). One advantage of sequencing Okazaki fragments is that replication signatures can be deduced from a population of cells growing at steady state. Thus, providing that Okazaki fragments can be harvested in sufficient quantity, DNA replication can be mapped in cells, tissues or organisms without need for synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Smith and Whitehouse, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Okazaki fragments were purified from mixed early embryos (ME) following RNAi depletion of <italic>lig-1,</italic> which is the sole <italic>C. elegans</italic> DNA ligase responsible for ligating Okazaki fragments.

Mapping to the worm WS220 reference genome, we find a clear strand bias, which matches the expected distribution of Okazaki fragments synthesized on the lagging strand: replication origins are at sites of transition from Watson to Crick strand reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McGuffee et al., 2013</xref>). While the data is noisier than budding yeast â in part due to the high A:T content of the genome, residual DNA ligase activity and the complexity of the sample preparation â we identifiedÂ &gt;2000 replication origins using a modified mapping protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McGuffee et al., 2013</xref>). Median spacing between origins is 40 kb, and 96% of origins are within 100 kb of another origin; the median efficiency â that is, the likelihood that a given origin is utilized during S phase, isÂ ~50%, although we note that numerous origins are fired in most cells in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2AÂ andÂ B</xref>). In contrast to budding yeast, in which initiation is confined to a narrow range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McGuffee et al., 2013</xref>), replication in <italic>C. elegans</italic> apparently initiates within broad zones at most origins, similar to human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Petryk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dijkwel et al., 1991</xref>). Replication origins potentially influence gene organization: genes near origins tend to be shorter and genes flanking origins show a pronounced bias to ensure that replication fork progression and transcription are co-directional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4AÂ andÂ B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Petryk et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Having generated a high-resolution map of replication origins, we next considered whether particular chromatin signatures are enriched near origins. Thus, we analyzed the abundance of several histone modifications that were mapped in embryos at similar stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerstein et al., 2010</xref>). As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows, there is a remarkable concordance between the location of replication origins and acetylation of histone H3 and methylation of H3 at lysine 4 (K4). Analyzing H3 K27ac (H3 K4me2 is near identical), we find that 75% of efficient origins (&gt;30% efficiency) are within 1 kb of the histone mark and most H3 K27ac peaks overlap origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Further, the most efficient replication origins are associated with sites with the most H3K27 acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). By surveying the abundance of various modifications present at replication origins, we tested whether other modifications behaved similarly to H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>); this revealed that acetylation of H3 at K18, K23, K27 and dimethylation of H3 at K4 are not only present at origins, but the level of modification increases according to origin efficiency. Significantly the histone modifications, we find most strongly associated with origins are those that define gene enhancers in metazoan genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ho et al., 2014</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21728.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Correlation of select histone modifications with replication origins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative ChIP signal for select histone modifications are shown for aÂ ~1 Mb region of Chromosome X.

In this scenario, replication origins become defined once zygotic transcription has initiated; DNA replication in pre-gastrula embryos (PG), where transcription is limited and non essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Robertson and Lin, 2015</xref>), would presumably initiate from many, seemingly random sites â much like the apparent situation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos prior to the Mid Blastula Transition (MBT). To investigate this, we harvested pre-gastrula embryos from a hyperactive egg laying strain (PG: median 9, mean 13 cells/embryo, nÂ =Â 50; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and late embryos from wild-type worms (L:Â ~200â558 cells/embryo), which represent different levels and extent of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We compared origin location and efficiency for each population and found that the patterns of replication were highly similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) â especially for the most efficient origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Evidently, even though gene transcription is fundamentally altered through this time course, replication origin usage is globally similar through early development. Thus, the establishment of specific replication origins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> occurs prior to the broad onset of zygotic transcription â meaning that the replication origins we define are unlikely to be dependent upon transcription. This finding is in keeping with data showing that isolated embryonic cells treated with Î±-amanitin divide normally up to approximately 100 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edgar et al., 1994</xref>). Indeed, S phase length, lineage-specific cell cycle timing, asymmetric cell division and cleavage patterns all proceed normally in the absence of transcription in pre-gastrula early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Robertson and Lin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edgar and McGhee, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edgar et al., 1994</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21728.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Mapping replication origins through early embryogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Box plot showing the number of cells/embryo for a representative sample of pre-gastrula (PG) embryos, whiskers indicate the range of values.

S phase in pre-gastrula embryonic cells ranges fromÂ ~10Â toÂ 25 min, depending on the lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edgar and McGhee, 1988</xref>). In an ideal system, where all origins fire in each S phase (100% efficiency), complete genome duplication could be achieved inÂ ~15 min if origins are uniformly spaced everyÂ ~75 kb and replication forks progress at 2.5 kb/min. We find that the median origin spacing isÂ ~40 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), which reflects that not all origins are fired within each S phase. Given that DNA replication appears to initiate at enhancers, the requirement for closely spaced origins to achieve timely genome duplication would seemingly constrain the positions of enhancers across the genome. Thus, enhancers, and the genes they regulate, may be organized to facilitate the execution of the DNA replication and transcription programs in rapidly dividing embryonic cells. To investigate this, we first performed a gene ontology analysis of genes at varying distances from replication origins: this revealed that genes whose products are involved growth, embryonic development, cell cycle, gene expression, and chromatin are clustered near replication origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we compared origins with the whole embryo transcriptome time series derived from individual embryos from the one-cell stage through hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hashimshony et al., 2015</xref>). For each of the 50 time points, we removed maternally derived transcripts and plotted the sum of normalized transcript levels for each gene relative to the midpoint of replication origins. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>, transcript abundance accumulates through the early time points with no apparent trends in the data; but, beginning at time pointÂ ~9 and coincident with gastrulation, there is an apparent clustering of actively transcribed genes near replication origins. The association of transcription with origins spans to time pointÂ ~25 and broadly scales according with origin efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Beyond time point 25, the association breaks down; yet, as gene expression changes, the pattern evolves such that from time point 40 onwards, sites of active transcription now appear anti-correlated with replication origins. As we have shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, replication origins are defined prior to the onset of global zygotic gene activation, yet <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> reveals that when the genome becomes broadly transcriptionally active, transcription generally occurs in close proximity to the pre-defined origins. At time point 25, which isÂ ~300 min into embryogenesis, transcription begins to shift away from the origins, and by 500 min, peak transcription occurs some 15â25 kb from the origin. Since the median spacing between origins is 40 kb, the shift in transcription late in embryogenesis ensures that gene transcription is as far removed as possible from sites of replication initiation. The alteration in transcription that occurs afterÂ ~300 min is coincident with ventral enclosure and has been shown previously to underlie a developmental milestone wherein the âmorphogenesisâ transcriptome is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Levin et al., 2012</xref>). Given the close association between replication origins and expressed genes, we considered whether global alterations in the transcriptome may be related to origin activity. Thus, we compared the origin/transcript profiles with a time course that measured living nuclei per embryo during embryogenesis from Sulston et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Significantly, the shift of transcription from origins that begins atÂ ~300 min is coincident with the completion of the last wave of cell division that occurs within the embryo â indicating that the inactivation of replication origins may be coupled with the restructuring of the transcriptome to facilitate post replicative development.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21728.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Gene transcription is coupled with replication origin use.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gene ontology analysis for genes at varying distances from the midpoint of a replication origin.

However, early development in <italic>C. elegans</italic> differs from these organisms: initial cell divisions are asynchronous, and the cell cycle does not slow abruptly near gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the rapid establishment of the defined replication landscape in <italic>C. elegans</italic> may be related to the very early stage at which cell lineages are specified. Indeed, several histone modifications, including H3K27ac and H3K4me2, are potentially passaged with the maternal genome and are known to be present in two cell embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arico et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Samson et al., 2014</xref>). Replication origins appear to be tied with gene expression: in general terms, origin proximal genes experience the first wave of zygotic transcription and are expressed in replicating cells; origin distal regions encode genes whose transcription is delayed until later in development when DNA replication has ceased. Our results indicate that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome has evolved to couple embryonic transcription with replication; yet, such coupling would appear to impose constraints on a system that needs not only to transcribe a diverse array of genes, but also replicate theÂ ~100 mb genome inÂ ~15 min. <italic>C. elegans</italic> seemingly resolves this issue as follows: first, replication origins appear to be co-localized with gene enhancers which can activate transcription of genes at a distance; second, genes required for cell division and early development are clustered near replication origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Such association is likely to be functionally important in rapidly cycling cells with limited gap phases: most obviously, genes near to origins such as histones, will be replicated at the start of S phase and have a higher effective copy number than those further away. Relatedly, the passage of the replication fork may trigger genes to be reactivated that were presumably repressed during mitosis; thus ensuring replication-transcription conflicts do not occur. Finally, the inactivation of replication origins may serve as a trigger to relieve the gene expression program from replication origin-associated spatial constraints â allowing the expression of genes whose products are required for the many aspects of development that occur in the absence of cell division. The spatiotemporal coupling and uncoupling of gene expression with replication may be a general principal underlying the profound transcriptional and morphological changes that occur during embryogenesis across species: genes expressed early are characterized by proteins involved in proliferation, while those expressed late are typically involved in differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levin et al., 2016</xref>). Separating early and late genes is a comparatively short phase termed the âmid-developmental transitionâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levin et al., 2016</xref>); in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> we find that this transition is coincident with the uncoupling of transcription from replication origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). It will be of great interest to learn whether this is a ubiquitous feature of the mid-developmental transition across species.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> maintenance and strains</title><p>All <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were maintained at 20Â°C on NGM plates with OP50 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Michael R Botchan (Reviewer 1) is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The Whitehouse lab had previously developed a strategy for mapping eukaryotic DNA replication origins based on the position of Okazaki fragment strand switching, which they used to successfully map replication origins as well as replication termination sites in budding yeast. In this paper, they further develop this technique to map origins in C.elegans. This is an important step forward, and, together with a paper from the Hyrien lab earlier this year using a related approach, represents the first time this technique has been applied to a metazoan. This has great value because this technique has been shown to accurately and sensitively identify origins in budding yeast. For this reason alone the reviewers believe this a significant paper. The authors go on to show that most of the origins used before gastrula are also used later in development. This is in contrast to the well-studied situation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> development where initiation sites before the mid-blastula transition are dense and poorly defined, perhaps truly random (although random is perhaps a poorly defined concept in this context), and then becomes restricted to specific sites only thereafter. They show that origins co-localise with the potential enhancers of genes expressed through the proliferative stages of development. They show that the position of these replication origins correlates with specific histone marks, and that these origins are active before significant levels of transcription are seen. Finally, they show that the cessation of transcription potentially associated with these cis acting enhancers correlates with the cessation of proliferation. The reviewers all felt that certain key points needed to be addressed before publication and these are listed.</p><p>1) The sites defined as &quot;enhancers&quot; seem to be assigned simply by the histone modification patterns. The reviewers are of course aware of the literature in higher eukaryotes that certain combinations of histone marks are predictive of enhancers but not for the worm. For example: it is not proven that sites of H3K27ac in worms are actually marking enhancers. The authors should either show that some of these sites are indeed transcription enhancers by mutation and effect transcription or nuance their discussion accordingly. If genome wide enhancers have been mapped perhaps they can be identified in a figure. In a related issue is #2.</p><p>2) The separation between transcription and replication regulation is important but perhaps difficult to prove at this point. Proteins that are binding to the &quot;enhancer sites&quot; may be critical for both functions and mutation of these cis sites could have effects on both processes. If the authors want to establish this as a strong conclusion perhaps they should use inhibitors of transcription (or approaches such as SiRNA to knock-down protein levels for factors essential for that process) and show that early in development replication patterns do not change. Otherwise the discussion should be modified.</p><p>3) Have the authors investigated potential phenotypes for ligase depletion at various times in development- such as fecundity or fertility?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21728.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[â¦]</italic></p><p><italic>1) The sites defined as &quot;enhancers&quot; seem to be assigned simply by the histone modification patterns.

To our knowledge there is no published study to systematically and functionally define enhancers in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Our definition is based on a large body of data that clearly links enhancers with select histone modifications in other eukaryotes, but we agree with the reviewers comment and have rephrased our discussion accordingly. More descriptive terms such as âenhancer associated chromatin modificationsâ are now used throughout the manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) The separation between transcription and replication regulation is important but perhaps difficult to prove at this point.

Otherwise the discussion should be modified.</italic> </p><p>This is a very important point, we agree that it is necessary to functionally separate transcription and replication in early developing embryos. Zygotic activation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> has been studied intensively and experiments similar to those suggested by the reviewers have been done previously. Importantly, inhibiting transcription with Î±-amanitin in isolated early embryonic cells was found not to affect timing of cell division, the asymmetric pattern of early divisions, or the pattern of cleavage. Lois G Edgar, Nurit Wolf and William B. Wood, Development 120, 443-451 (1994). To our knowledge, all previous studies indicate that zygotic transcription is inessential in early rounds of division. Due to technical limitations we cannot inhibit transcription by RNAi against Pol II as it will lead to complete sterility. Upon the refereeâs suggestion we have emphasized these points in the text.</p><p><italic>3) Have the authors investigated potential phenotypes for ligase depletion at various times in development- such as fecundity or fertility?</italic> </p><p>Knocking down <italic>LIG-1</italic> using 100% RNAi leads to rapid and complete sterility, therefore, we have optimized partial depletion of <italic>lig-1</italic> to achieve maximal viability whilst also enriching for fragments. Knocking down <italic>lig-1</italic> with 10% RNAi results in a loss of 30% of viable progeny (i.e. number of hatched embryos).
