overexpressed antibody light chain (LC) forms fibrils which deposit in organs and cause their failure. While it is well-established that mutations in the LC’s V<sub>L</sub> domain are important prerequisites, the mechanisms which render a patient LC amyloidogenic are ill-defined. In this study, we performed an in-depth analysis of the factors and mutations responsible for the pathogenic transformation of a patient-derived λ LC, by recombinantly expressing variants in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We show that proteolytic cleavage of the patient LC resulting in an isolated V<sub>L</sub> domain is essential for fibril formation. Out of 11 mutations in the patient V<sub>L</sub>, only one, a leucine to valine mutation, is responsible for fibril formation. It disrupts a hydrophobic network rendering the C-terminal segment of V<sub>L</sub> more dynamic and decreasing domain stability. Thus, the combination of proteolytic cleavage and the destabilizing mutation trigger conformational changes that turn the LC pathogenic.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Amyloid light chain amyloidosis, shortened to AL amyloidosis, is a rare and often fatal disease. It is caused by a disorder of the bone marrow. Usually, cells in the bone marrow produce Y-shaped proteins called antibodies to fight infections. In AL amyloidosis, these cells release too much of the short arm of the antibody, known as its light chain, and the light chains also carry mutations. The antibodies are no longer able to assemble properly, and instead misfold and form structures, known as amyloid fibrils. The fibrils build up outside the cells, gradually causing damage to tissues and organs that can lead to life-threatening organ failure.</p><p>Due to the rareness of the disease, diagnosis is often overlooked and delayed. People experience widely varying symptoms, depending on the organs affected. Also, given the diversity of antibodies people make, every person with AL amyloidosis has a variety of mutations implicated in their disease. It is thought that mutations in the antibody light chain make it unstable and prone to misfolding, but it remains unclear which specific mutations trigger a cascade of amyloid fibril formation.</p><p>Now, Kazman et al. have pinpointed the exact mechanism in one case of the disease. First, tissue biopsies from a woman with advanced AL amyloidosis were analyzed, and the defunct antibody light chain was isolated. Eleven mutations were identified in the antibody light chain, only one of which was found to be responsible for the formation of the harmful fibrils. The next step was to determine how this one small change was so damaging. The experiments showed that after the antibody light chain was cut in two, a process that happens naturally in the body, this single mutation transforms it into a protein capable of causing disease.</p><p>In this ‘bedside to lab bench’ study, Kazman et al. have succeeded in determining the molecular origin of one case of AL amyloidosis. The results have also shown that the instability of antibodies due to mutation does not alone explain the formation of amyloid fibrils in this disease and that the cutting of this protein in two is also important. It is hoped that, in the long run, this work will lead to new diagnostics and treatment options for people with AL amyloidosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein stability</kwd><kwd>antibody light chain</kwd><kwd>AL amyloidosis</kwd><kwd>hydrophobic interactions</kwd><kwd>protein dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR 2969</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buchner</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name><name><surname>Kazman</surname><given-names>Pamina</given-names></name><name><surname>Vielberg</surname><given-names>Marie-Theres</given-names></name><name><surname>Pulido Cendales</surname><given-names>María Daniela</given-names></name><name><surname>Hunziger</surname><given-names>Lioba</given-names></name><name><surname>Weber</surname><given-names>Benedikt</given-names></name><name><surname>Hegenbart</surname><given-names>Ute</given-names></name><name><surname>Zacharias</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Köhler</surname><given-names>Rolf</given-names></name><name><surname>Schönland</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><name><surname>Groll</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identifying the patient-specific mutation that shifted the antibody light chain to the deadly fibrillar species provides new insight in the molecular pathogenesis of AL amyloidosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis is the most common form of systemic amyloidosis. It is the result of an anomalous monoclonal plasma B cell proliferation in the bone marrow which leads to a subsequent overproduction of immunoglobulin light chains (LC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gertz, 2016</xref>). Normally, immunoglobulins (Igs) are secreted as disulfide-bonded complexes comprising two heavy chains (HCs) and two LCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feige et al., 2010</xref>). In AL patients, free LCs excessively escape cellular protein quality control and are secreted into the blood stream. From there, the amyloid precursor LCs can be taken up by cells or deposit extracellularly in organs or tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Falk et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feige et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gertz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kastritis and Dimopoulos, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marin-Argany et al., 2016</xref>). The LCs are composed of an N-terminal variable (V<sub>L</sub>) and a constant domain (C<sub>L</sub>). The V<sub>L</sub> sequence is the result of DNA rearrangements involving a variable (V), a diversity (D) and a joining (J) gene segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernard et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hozumi and Tonegawa, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maki et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tonegawa, 1983</xref>). At later stages of differentiation, directed hypermutation of the V region exon further increases the natural diversity of V<sub>L</sub> domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feige et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jung and Alt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wilson et al., 1998</xref>). As a result, each AL amyloidosis patient possesses a different set of somatic mutations and hence a unique disease-responsible LC sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blancas-Mejía et al., 2015</xref>). These mutations often destabilize patient LCs compared to non-amyloidogenic LCs. The destabilization was linked to amyloid fibril formation propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blancas-Mejía et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hurle et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Raffen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ramirez-Alvarado, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wall et al., 1999</xref>). Even though full length LCs and other proteins have recently been found as part of fibrils, patient biopsies predominantly revealed V<sub>L</sub> domains that result from proteolytic cleavage of the LC as the main constituent of amyloid deposits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blancas-Mejía et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buxbaum, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Enqvist et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gallo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glenner et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hurle et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nokwe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pepys, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Simpson et al., 2009</xref>). Partial unfolding of the pathogenic V<sub>L</sub>s leads to exposed residue segments that entail the stacking capability of the domain, leading to the tightly packed, dehydrated cross-β amyloid fibril structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Annamalai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brumshtein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kelly, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Merlini and Bellotti, 2003</xref>). However, changes in stability alone cannot explain the differences in fibril formation propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nokwe et al., 2014</xref>). Since every patient suffers from a unique LC, it is generally not clear which of the mutated residues trigger the disease. Thus, the underlying reason for V<sub>L</sub> variants in AL patients is still largely enigmatic and the mechanistic principles need to be defined.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed a patient-derived amyloidogenic LC truncation of the λ subtype with a view to determine the mechanism that renders it pathogenic. The patient variant (referred to as Pat-1) contains 11 mutations in the V<sub>L</sub> domain compared to the corresponding germline sequence (referred to as WT-1). A comparison of mutant and germline V<sub>L</sub> regarding their structure, stability and amyloid formation propensity allowed us to identify the key mutation responsible for amyloidogenicity and to elucidate its effects on conformational dynamics that result in fibril formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Origin and sequence of the patient-derived pathological LC</title><p>The LC variant studied here was identified in a female patient who was diagnosed with a smoldering myeloma and AL amyloidosis at the age of 50 years at the Amyloidosis Center of the University of Heidelberg. The LC responsible for the disease was of λ subtype. The levels of the free λ LCs were highly elevated with 7572 mg/l in serum, compared to κ which was normal with 8 mg/l. The clonal plasma cell infiltration of the bone marrow was also high reaching 80%. Heart, kidney, lung, and soft tissue were positive for amyloid deposits and also clinically involved. More specifically, the cardiac stage was IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>) or III b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wechalekar et al., 2013</xref>) and the renal stage was 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Palladini et al., 2015</xref>) indicating that the patient was suffering from advanced AL amyloidosis with poor prognosis. Indeed, 4 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy, the patient died of cardiac arrest.</p><p>The primary structure of the pathogenic LC, named Pat-1, was deduced from the sequence of the complementary DNA (cDNA) of the plasma cell clone that caused AL amyloidosis. The corresponding germline LC sequence, named WT-1, was identified by database-assisted (abYsis, IgBLAST) primary structure alignments searching for the germline LC with the lowest number of residue changes with respect to the Pat-1 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The two sequences differ in 11 point mutations, all located in the V<sub>L</sub> domain. Five of these are located in the constant framework regions (FR) and six are in the hypervariable complementarity determining regions (CDR). We were interested in how frequently the mutant amino acids occur at the respective positions in the antibody repertoire. To this end, we used the Kabat classification system which provides quantitative information on the relative abundance of each amino acid at each position within antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson and Wu, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu and Kabat, 1970</xref>). For 9 of the 11 positions, the mutated residues in the Pat-1 V<sub>L</sub> are less abundant than the ones present in the WT-1 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) indicating potential negative effects on antibody structure and stability. The two mutated residues that show higher general frequency (S26 and D53) are located in the hypervariable CDRs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of the V<sub>L</sub> domain as predominant fragment for fibrillation in the patient.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence alignment of the patient-derived Pat-1 LC with the corresponding germline WT-1.

To determine which form is present in the case of Pat-1, we analyzed patient-derived abdominal fat tissue containing amyloid. These deposits were previously shown to be identical to organ-specific fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Annamalai et al., 2017</xref>). Extraction of the fibrils followed by SDS-PAGE, MALDI fingerprint analysis of the specific band (data not shown) and its mass revealed that in this patient predominantly the V<sub>L</sub> domain was deposited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. As the fibril load in organs correlates to the severity of the disease in AL patients, we studied fibril formation in vitro. To test whether proteolytic processing of the LC is a prerequisite for fibril formation, we produced the respective constructs recombinantly in <italic>E. coli</italic> and monitored amyloid formation of the purified proteins. Typically, fibril formation takes a long period of time. It involves unfolding, formation of partially folded intermediates and oligomers which then assemble into fibrils. It was shown earlier that small amounts of SDS presented during the incubation accelerate the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kihara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nokwe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamamoto et al., 2004</xref>). In this study, we use SDS in concentrations that do not affect the native secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In these assays, monitored by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, full length Pat-1 and WT-1 LCs did not form fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, incubation of the V<sub>L</sub> domain of Pat-1 revealed the presence of fibrils after a lag phase, while the WT-1 V<sub>L</sub> stayed soluble. We thus conclude that the Pat-1 V<sub>L</sub> but not Pat-1 LC is the disease-relevant amyloidogenic species.

All fibril forming variants showed an even lower halftime (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of fibril formation than Pat-1. The maximal ThT intensity, which seems to correlate to the amount of fibrils present, was in most cases equal to Pat-1. The only exception is the F30V variant which showed an increased maximum ThT fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Valine and leucine are closely related amino acids; both exhibit hydrophobic characteristics and differ in only a methylene moiety. Since isoleucine is identical to leucine concerning the constituent atoms, we substituted V81 by isoleucine and analyzed this mutant regarding stability and amyloid formation propensity. Intriguingly, V81I did not exhibit a significant increase in thermal stability compared to Pat-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, we found that V81I, unlike V81L, readily forms fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the protective effect observed for the V81L variant is highly specific to leucine. While the experiments so far suggest that the V81L mutation can rescue the Pat-1 V<sub>L</sub> from amyloid formation, it was an open question whether vice versa replacement of leucine by valine in the context of WT-1 would be sufficient to induce fibril formation. We therefore cloned WT-1 L81V and analyzed its properties. The thermal stability of WT-1 L81V decreased by 5.5°C compared to WT-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and the c<sub>M</sub> value for chemical unfolding, is reduced by 0.42 M GdmCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Hence, the introduction of valine at position 81 shifts WT-1 toward the stability of Pat-1. In the same line, upon incubation the WT-1 L81V mutant showed an increase of ThT fluorescence indicating fibril formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Together, these results show that it is possible to reconstitute the properties of the AL patient mutant by exchanging only one amino acid in the wild-type protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Valine 81 is located in a surface-exposed hydrophobic spot crucial for stability and amyloidogenicity</title><p>The crystal structure of Pat-1 showed that V81 is in close proximity to L15 and L82 opposite of the antigen-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Focusing on the surface properties in this region, we found that these three amino acids form a hydrophobic surface patch which is not present in the WT-1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). To determine the combined effect of the mutations at position 15, 81 and 82 (L15P, V81L and L82Q), we designed additional double and triple mutants carrying all possible combinations of these substitutions in Pat-1 and determined their stabilities against thermal and chemical denaturation. The combination of the substitutions at position 81 and 82 enhanced the increase in stability slightly, whereas mutating leucine at position 15 to proline in combination with the other point mutations led to a decrease in stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Fibril formation kinetics monitored by ThT fluorescence showed that the stability changes of the analyzed V<sub>L</sub> variants correlate with the amyloid propensity. The anti-amyloidogenic effect of V81L could be preserved in combination with the L82Q mutation. The presence of L15P in the mutants increased fibril formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). From these results, we conclude that the hydrophobic surface spot in Pat-1 plays a key role in pathogenesis.

We found that the mutations at position 15, 81 and 82 result in a change in hydrophobic interactions between Pat-1 and WT-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). P15 is located in FR1, in a region that shows a conspicuous change in deuterium exchange. In WT-1, this proline is not involved in a hydrophobic interaction network. In contrast, in the patient mutant L15 interacts with three amino acids located in FR3, including the two other point mutations in the hydrophobic surface spot, and two residues in the C-terminal region (V111 and L112). Thus, the contact of L15 to the very dynamic C-terminal segment, as indicated by the HD/X rate, induces the enhanced conformational dynamics of the respective loop region in FR1. V81 in Pat-1 forms six hydrophobic interactions with residues in FR2 and FR3, two of them, the L15 and L82 point mutations, are located within this hydrophobic surface area. However, V81 contacts only one amino acid in the C-terminal segment (V111). The hydrophobic interaction pattern of the WT-1 L81 misses one interaction each in FR2 and in FR3 but two more interactions to the C-terminal region appear. Overall, this leads to three hydrophobic interactions of L81 to the C-terminal region (V109, V111 and L112). For the mutation at position 82, the biggest effect comes from the change of the nature of interaction from hydrophobic to hydrophilic and the resulting decrease of hydrophobic surface area. L82 can form five hydrophobic interactions with FR2-4. Q82 however forms hydrophilic interactions to four residues, all located in FR3: R64, E84, D85 and E86.

By Umbrella Sampling (US) simulations, the dissociation of the C-terminal segment (residues beyond 102) was induced during MD-simulations for WT-1, Pat-1, Pat-1 V81L and the double mutant Pat-1 V81L L15P and the associated change in free energy was calculated. The free energy of dissociating this part of the structure from the otherwise folded protein can be taken as a relative estimate for the influence of the mutation on the stability of the protein fold.

The free energy simulations exhibit similar dissociation free energies for the WT-1 and the single back mutation V81L, which were higher (by ~1 kcal·mol<sup>−1</sup>) in comparison to Pat-1 and the double back mutation V81L L15P. This indicates an increased protein stability for WT-1 and the back mutation of Pat-1 V81L. The effect of the V81L mutation is mainly due to a small cavity that is present in the case of V81 and that is filled if V81 is replaced by a slightly larger residue (V81L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, a destabilizing effect due to the additional back mutation L15P could be observed. Here, the double back mutation exhibited an opposite effect compared to the single back mutation, by producing a significant reduction of the dissociation free energy (by ~1 kcal·mol<sup>−1</sup>) relative to the patient mutant. This effect can be explained by a change in the local protein backbone structure (due to the L15P) that changes the local packing geometry and offsets the effect of the V81L mutation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Potential of mean force (PMF) for the dissociation of the C-terminal segment.</title><p>The free energy along the reaction coordinate was calculated by means of umbrella sampling simulations (see Materials and methods section).

However, the mechanism of toxicity remains unknown. In general, there are different hypotheses on the nature of the toxic species in amyloid diseases. Besides fibrils, Oligomers formed on the pathway to highly organized amyloid structures are considered toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Merlini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Riek and Eisenberg, 2016</xref>). In this study, we focused on analyzing fibril formation as their presence is directly correlated to pathogenicity in AL.</p><p>The results of the in vitro fibril formation assays are in line with the predominant deposition of V<sub>L</sub> species in the patient: neither the Pat-1 LC nor the WT-1 LC formed fibrils; also the WT-1 V<sub>L</sub> was resistant to amyloid formation. Only the Pat-1 V<sub>L</sub> readily formed fibrils. When viewed together, these findings suggest a strong effect of the LC context on the Pat-1 V<sub>L</sub> domain; the point mutations present in the V<sub>L</sub> domain only become effective when the C<sub>L</sub> domain has been removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weber et al., 2018</xref>). The current view holds that the overall destabilization of the V<sub>L</sub> domain is a major indicator for fibril formation propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blancas-Mejía et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morgan and Kelly, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nokwe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ramirez-Alvarado, 2012</xref>). The patient-derived mutant Pat-1 fits this general picture. However, a global destabilization alone is not sufficient to provide hints on the underlying processes leading to fibril formation. Furthermore, also V<sub>L</sub> domains with wildtype-like stability were found to form fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nokwe et al., 2016</xref>). For a mechanistic understanding of the disease, it is important to identify which of the sequence differences between germline and patient mutant are causative. The V<sub>L</sub> domains Pat-1 and WT-1 differ in 11 point mutations resulting in a general sequence identity of ~90%. By serially substituting each of the point mutations in Pat-1 with the corresponding amino acid present in WT-1, we identified one specific substitution, valine to leucine mutation at position 81, as the key modification responsible for reversing the pathogenic properties of Pat-1 and enhancing the overall stability of the V<sub>L</sub> domain. Amino acid frequencies in antibody sequences hint toward a negative effect of valine at position 81 (13 % compared to 77% for leucine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson and Wu, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu and Kabat, 1970</xref>). That this substitution at position 81 is indeed sufficient to also render the germline V<sub>L</sub> domain amyloidogenic was demonstrated by introducing the V81 residue into the sequence of WT-1. The effect on the stability and fibril formation was very specific for the leucine residue, for example a substitution with the highly similar isoleucine residue did not yield comparable effects. Residue 81 was found to be part of a surface-exposed hydrophobic area in Pat-1 together with the two other mutated residues L15 and L82. Since surface-exposed hydrophobic areas are known to be energetically unfavorable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eisenhaber and Argos, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moelbert et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Young et al., 1994</xref>), we investigated these amino acids regarding their stability and amyloidogenic properties. Especially the L82Q substitution seemed to be a promising candidate since this mutation changed the nature of the amino acid side chain and of possible interactions. Besides, the amino acid frequency at this position decreases from 68% for glutamine to 1% for leucine in Pat-1, supporting the idea that this substitution could have a severe effect on domain architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu and Kabat, 1970</xref>). Against our expectations, the single L82Q substitution did not affect the stability of Pat-1 and the mutant still formed fibrils. However, a combination of L81 and Q82 increased the stabilizing effect observed for L81 and the variant remained soluble. This stresses the important role of the expanded hydrophobic surface area for amyloidogenesis that is reduced by the L82Q back mutation.</p><p>Surprisingly, substituting L15 with the germline residue P15 resulted in lower thermal and chemical stabilities than the ones observed for the patient mutant. The L15P mutation was also disadvantageous in combinations with L81 and/or Q82. All the P15-containing V<sub>L</sub> variants readily formed fibrils with an even earlier onset than the patient V<sub>L</sub> itself, stressing the negative effect of P15. This does not fit our expectations since according to the amino acid frequency a leucine at this position occurs in only 12% of the cases, while proline is present in the germline with a frequency of 61%.</p><p>Even though these results clearly show that stability changes are a major element affecting fibril formation, for a mechanistic explanation the structural consequences of the mutations need to be considered. In the crystal structure of Pat-1, V81 exhibits six hydrophobic interactions spread over FR2-4. These include interactions with the other two residues of the surface-exposed hydrophobic area, L15 and L82. Likewise, L81, present in WT-1, exhibits six hydrophobic interactions. However, the difference is that L81 reaches three amino acids in the C-terminal region (V109, V111 and L112), whereas V81 only extends its interactions to one residue (V111). This fits the analysis of the conformational dynamics of the two V<sub>L</sub>s by HD/X which demonstrates a highly increased flexibility of the C-terminal segment in the patient-derived mutant as the underlying cause for destabilization and amyloid formation. A leucine at this position leads to a tighter packing of the domain than a valine residue. Therefore, neighboring residues are in closer proximity and form more hydrophobic interactions leading to a stabilization of the C-terminal region.</p><p>Changed hydrophobic interactions and thereby changed conformational dynamics can also explain the negative effect of P15. The leucine of Pat-1 at position 15 is tightly imbedded into a network of hydrophobic interactions. It facilitates five hydrophobic interactions to V81, L82 and A83 in FR3 and to V111 and L112 in the C-Terminal region. Even though these interactions increase the dynamics of the loop region around residue 15, the additional interactions to the C-terminal segment positively affect the overall stabilization of the domain. A proline residue, on the other hand, induces a local change of the protein backbone structure and packing geometry abrogating hydrophobic interactions. This in turn affects a large segment of the protein although the V<sub>L</sub> variant still exhibits secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure comparable to the WT-1, indicating increased local dynamics. Thus, our results demonstrate a complex interplay of interactions that is responsible for the patient variant’s pathogenicity. Our results further show that small and seemingly insignificant changes of a side chain can lead to a fatal change in intramolecular interactions, which are in the case of Pat-1 of hydrophobic nature.</p><p>The assays in this study were performed under simplified conditions in vitro compared to the environment the LCs experience in the human body. In the human body, many parameter including proteolysis, interactions with plasma factors and shear forces contribute to fibril formation and complicate the understanding of the pathogenicity. Furthermore, it is well-known that amyloid deposits consist not only of the disease-causing LC but also contain many other factors like glycosaminoglycans, lipids, apolipoprotein E or other proteins. Many of these factors have already been shown to influence fibril formation in the context of amyloid diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gellermann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wyatt et al., 2012</xref>). In the future their mechanistic influences on amyloid formation need to be determined to obtain a molecular understanding of disease progression, This may also offer new perspectives for potential treatment options.</p><p>In summary, our study presents a general strategy how to investigate LCs associated with AL amyloidosis. An important starting point is the determination of the patient LC sequence and the nature of the LC truncation present in the fibrils in vivo. The identification and classification of the mutated residues requires a comparison with the most homologous germline sequence and with the Kabat frequency database. This is the basis for a mutational analysis required to distinguish between active and silent mutations. The combination of structural and dynamic analyses of mutants together with fibril assays allows identifying the disease-causing residues and their contributions to stability and propensity for fibril formation. For defining the underlying molecular mechanism, analyses of the structural changes and dynamic consequences induced by the identified mutations are required. This information will contribute to better diagnosis and even treatment options.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>WT-1</td><td>Uniprot IGLV2-14</td><td>Uniprot: P01704</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Pat-1</td><td>This paper</td><td>GenBank: MK962887</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21-codon+ (DE3)-RIL</td><td>Stratagene</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>XL1blue</td><td>Stratagene</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>abdominal fat tissue</td><td>University hospital Heidelberg</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pet28b-WT-1</td><td>invitrogen</td><td/><td>Point mutants obtained by site directed mutagenesis using NEBasechanger</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pet28b-Pat-1</td><td>invitrogen</td><td/><td>Point mutants obtained by site directed mutagenesis using NEBasechanger</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant protein</td><td>Pat-1 LC, Pat-1 V<sub>L</sub>, WT-1 LC, WT-1 V<sub>L</sub>, Pat-1 V<sub>L</sub> and WT-1 V<sub>L</sub>point mutants</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Expression plasmids obtained from invitrogen (see: recombinant DNA reagent).

In order to analyse the stability of the V<sub>L</sub> domain under specific mutations, Umbrella sampling (US) simulations were carried out with the pmemd.cuda module of the Amber16 package. The simulated constructs were the wild type WT-1, the patient mutant Pat-1, the single back mutation of the patient mutant Pat-1 V81L and the double back mutation of the patient mutant Pat-1 V81L L15P. For this purpose, the Amber ff14SB force field and the TIP3P solvent model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>) were used. Each construct was solvated in water in a periodic solvent octahedron box with a minimum distance of 10.0 Å between each atom of the protein and the edge of the periodic box. Apart from that, a neutralization of the solution was achieved by adding Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions. Relaxation of the structure was carried out with an energy minimization of maximum 1500 minimization cycles. Each system was then heated up in steps of 100K, for 10ps each, until a temperature of 300 K was reached, whereby the system was harmonically restraint to the start structure with a restraint force constant of 25.0 kcal/molÅ². Afterwards, the system was equilibrated by gradually reducing the restraint force, in five steps of 10ps each, to a restraint force constant of 0.5 kcal/molÅ².

It possible to extract the free energy along the reaction coordinate of interest in which the configurations vary energetically and the system overcomes possible energy barrier. For the purpose of obtaining information about the folding stability of the protein, we simulated the system along a path in which the C-terminus dissociates from the protein. For this, we divided the dissociation path in 19 umbrella windows, which vary in the used harmonic restraining potentials, that is the restraining force constant (K) and the reference value around which the system is forced to stay close to (dref). These penalty potentials were then selected in such a manner that the distribution of states was shifted along the reaction coordinate, the distribution of states converged around the desired reference value for each umbrella window and allowing for sufficient overlap between neighboring distributions. The reaction coordinate was in this case the distance between the center of mass of the C-terminal (residues 103 to 109) and the remaining residues of the protein (1 to 102). The sets of umbrella windows generated were the following: i) 11 consecutive simulations with dref varying between 12.0 Å and 22.0 Å with a step of 1.0 Å and a force constant of K = 2.5 kcal / Å<sup>2</sup> mol, ii) eight consecutive simulations with dref varying between 14.0 Å and 17.5 Å with a step of 0.5 Å and a force constant of K = 4.0 kcal / Å<sup>2</sup> mol.

levels of immunoglobulin light chains (LCs) into a patient's circulation. The LCs are often aggregation prone, leading to sometimes lethal amyloid deposits in patient tissues. LCs are highly variable in sequence, and hence, it had been difficult to delineate the causative events of amyloid formation. This paper provides important insight into the processes that lead to amyloidosis by using a patient-derived LC sequence and determining precisely which mutations cause the protein aggregation thought to result in disease. By engineering LC variants carrying select mutations, they show that disease-linked changes in the protein sequence create a dynamic hydrophobic network that is more prone to aggregation. This work, therefore, helps us understand how mutations can destabilize protein folds and promote aggregation, and it provides a roadmap to identifying disease-causative mutations in complex diseases.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Fatal amyloid formation in a patient's antibody light chain is caused by a single point mutation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ulrich Brinkmann (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Systemic AL amyloidosis is caused by the aberrant proliferation of B cells that secrete high levels of immunoglobulin light chains (LC) into a patient's circulation. The LCs are often aggregation prone, leading to sometimes lethal amyloid deposits in patient tissues. LCs are highly variable in sequence, and hence, it had been difficult to delineate the causative events of amyloid formation.</p><p>In this manuscript, Kazman and coworkers investigated in detail the biophysical characteristics of an LC driving AL amyloidosis from a patient that shortly after initiation of chemotherapy had passed away. By comparing the patient sequence to LC databases, they conclude that the patient clone contained 11 mutations. Crystal structures, however, did not reveal any significant changes between the patient and wildtype LCs. Through mutations, they find a particular role of a single L81V mutation in destabilizing the LC fold and driving amyloid formation. Modeling and molecular dynamics simulations suggested that V81 is embedded in a hydrophobic network that is more dynamic in the patient than in the wildtype sequence. The higher dynamics in this hydrophobic surface might contribute to aggregation.</p><p>This manuscript is well done, address important issues relevant to aggregation diseases, and would be interesting for readers. This includes the careful analysis of mutations on stability and aggregation, including back mutation that could prevent, at least partially, amyloid formation. Their findings allows the authors to provide a reasonable rationale for how a critical mutation can drive disease.</p><p>There are no additional experiments that we request. However, we ask that the authors improve their discussion by including the issues raised below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) For many protein misfolding diseases, oligomers on the pathway to amyloid-fibril formation have been shown to be responsible for pathogenicity and not the fibrils per se. The assumption within the paper is that pathogenicity is directly to fibril formation. As a result of this, there are no studies attempting to identify/quantify oligomer formation. Some further discussion of this is desirable as it is different from much of the work done in the field of protein misfolding particularly with respect to neurodegeneration.</p><p>2) The ThT assays that assess fibril formation contained small amounts of SDS, a detergent certainly not present in patients. The reason for this addition was not stated. Please explain the reason for adding that reagent and confirm that presence of it does not interfere with the experimental results. The analysis of the ThT aggregation data is also qualitative rather than quantitative, i.e., mutations increase or decrease the propensity to form fibrils. Is there no more quantitative way of calculating propensity, similar to the calculation of t<sub>1/2</sub> or lag time for sigmoidal kinetics observed in other systems?</p><p>3) Fibril formation in the patient occurs in an environment much more complex (dense) than in the experimental setting. In an ideal world, one would be able to assess under the same conditions, possibly in full serum. I realize that available technologies are not (yet?) compatible with such experimental approaches. The authors should, however, add a discussion of this topic including (potentially expected?) differences and similarities.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52300.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) For many protein misfolding diseases, oligomers on the pathway to amyloid-fibril formation have been shown to be responsible for pathogenicity and not the fibrils per se.

Many researchers in this field assume that the oligomers are the actual toxic species. This is one major open question in the field of amyloidosis. In the case of AL, fibrils represent the end product of the pathway and are the species that can be detected in patient tissue and organs. It is assumed that they cause mechanical damage in the affected organs. Therefore, in this case, it is well justified to study fibril formation as it is tightly linked to pathogenicity. As suggested, we mentioned this aspect now in the Results section and we added a more detailed explanation in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The ThT assays that assess fibril formation contained small amounts of SDS, a detergent certainly not present in patients.

We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The rationale is now mentioned in the Results section before the first fibril formation assay. We added citations from the literature on the use of SDS to accelerate fibril formation. Furthermore, we added another supplementary figure showing that SDS doesn’t change the initial native secondary structure, as proven by CD-spectroscopy.</p><p>As suggested, we also quantitated the changes during the kinetics of the fibril formation.
