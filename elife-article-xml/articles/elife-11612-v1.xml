How polarizing signals coordinate metabolic and functional reprogramming, and the potential implications for control of macrophage activation, remains poorly understood. Here we show that IL-4 signaling co-opts the Akt-mTORC1 pathway to regulate Acly, a key enzyme in Ac-CoA synthesis, leading to increased histone acetylation and M2 gene induction. Only a subset of M2 genes is controlled in this way, including those regulating cellular proliferation and chemokine production. Moreover, metabolic signals impinge on the Akt-mTORC1 axis for such control of M2 activation. We propose that Akt-mTORC1 signaling calibrates metabolic state to energetically demanding aspects of M2 activation, which may define a new role for metabolism in supporting macrophage activation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11612.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11612.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11612.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Macrophages are immune cells that are found in most of the tissues of the body. Exactly what the macrophages do depends on which tissue they are in, and the state of the tissue. For example, M2 macrophages can multiply in numbers, heal wounds or help to fight off parasites depending on the signals they receive from their environment. Conversely, when macrophages sense pathogens such as bacteria they can also become M1 macrophages, which produce inflammatory molecules that help kill the invading bacteria.</p><p>As a macrophage transforms into a more specialized state, its metabolism â the set of chemical reactions the cell performs in order to survive and thrive â also changes. This shift appears to play an important role in activating the macrophages and determining how theyâll specialize. However, little is known about how metabolism exerts this control.</p><p>The metabolism of a cell can be investigated in part by studying the molecules, or âmetabolitesâ, that the cell produces. Covarrubias et al. studied what happens when unspecialized macrophages from mice were activated by a signaling molecule called IL-4. This signaling molecule causes the cells to become M2 macrophages, and the experiments revealed that IL-4 signaling controls the amount of a metabolite called acetyl-CoA in the cells.</p><p>Acetyl-CoA can influence how the DNA of a gene is packaged in a cell, and thus affect whether a gene is switched on and âexpressedâ or not. Covarrubias et al. therefore also analyzed a major metabolic sensing pathway â the Akt-mTORC1 pathway â and showed how this pathway was able to act as a nutrient sensor for the macrophage and control the enzyme responsible for making acetyl-CoA. Therefore, the Akt-mTORC1 pathway can control the level of gene expression changes in the macrophages as a result of IL-4 signaling.</p><p>The analysis showed that the increase in acetyl-CoA levels increases the expression of some of the genes that cause the M2 macrophages to change state and develop their specialist behaviors. However, only a subset of these genes â those that encode metabolically demanding activities such as immune cell trafficking â have their expression controlled in this way. Further studies are now needed to investigate whether other macrophage types use the same pathways to control their responses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11612.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11612.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>macrophage metabolism</kwd><kwd>macrophage activation</kwd><kwd>immunometabolism</kwd><kwd>akt</kwd><kwd>acly</kwd><kwd>mTORC1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI102964</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horng</surname><given-names>Tiffany</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000010</institution-id><institution>Ford Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Fellowship</award-id> <principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Covarrubias</surname><given-names>Anthony J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35CA197459</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manning</surname><given-names>Brendan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Commonwealth Universal Research Enhancement</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pennsylvania Department of Health grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Snyder</surname><given-names>Nathaniel W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG041765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laming</surname><given-names>Dudley</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interleukin 4 signaling co-opts the Akt-mTORC1-Acly pathway to couple metabolic input to the control of energetically demanding processes during macrophage M2 activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macrophages are pleiotropic cells that assume a variety of functions depending on tissue of residence and tissue state. Their ability to acquire diverse, context-dependent activities requires activation (or polarization) to distinct functional states, triggered by various factors including microbial products, cytokines, and growth factorsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murray and Wynn, 2011</xref>). M1 or classical activation is triggered during infection by microbial products including LPS, leading to the transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding antimicrobial activities and inflammatory cytokines. M2 or alternative activation is triggered by IL-4 and IL-13 produced during parasite infections, and activates the transcription factor Stat6 to induce a transcriptional program that coordinates fibrosis, tissue remodeling, and Type 2 inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murray and Wynn, 2011</xref>). Therefore, the induction of multi-component transcriptional programs underpins macrophage activation.</p><p>While macrophage activation is relatively well-understood at the level of signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and acquisition of new effector activities, the metabolic underpinnings remain less clear. An emerging view is that macrophage activation to particular states is associated with distinct metabolic shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pearce and Everts, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">GalvÃ¡n-PeÃ±a and O'Neill, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biswas and Mantovani, 2012</xref>). For example, M1 macrophages upregulate glucose and glutamine utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tannahill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cramer et al., 2003</xref>), while M2 macrophages augment Î²-oxidation and glutamine consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vats et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jha et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, such metabolic shifts critically support macrophage activation. Increased glycolytic flux in M1 macrophages is coupled to de novo lipogenesis, which enables ER and Golgi expansion and production of high levels of inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Everts et al., 2014</xref>). Another consequence of enhanced glycolysis is accumulation of the TCA cycle metabolite succinate, leading to stabilization of the transcription factor HIF-1Î± and transcriptional induction of <italic>Il1b</italic> and other target genes in the M1 macrophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tannahill et al., 2013</xref>). How oxidative metabolism boosts M2 activation is not clear, but glutamine metabolism fuels production of UDP-GlcNAC, an important modification of multiple M2 markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jha et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the idea that macrophage activation is supported by metabolic shifts, recent studies indicate that macrophage polarizing signals impinge on metabolic signaling pathways. Polarizing signals like LPS and IL-4 regulate the activity of Akt, mTORC1, and AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Everts et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weichhart et al., 2008</xref>), presumably to coordinate metabolic processes that critically underlie macrophage polarization. Limited studies indicate that perturbing the activity of these metabolic regulators impairs macrophage metabolism and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Everts et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). For example, Akt mediates enhanced glycolysis to support lipid synthesis and inflammatory cytokine secretion in M1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Everts et al., 2014</xref>). Akt similarly stimulates glucose-fueled lipid synthesis in growing and proliferating cells, where lipids are used to build cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Robey and Hay, 2009</xref>). Therefore, M1 macrophages co-opt a metabolic process (Akt-dependent lipogenesis) in order to coordinate a macrophage-specific function (inflammatory cytokine secretion). In general, however, how polarizing signals control metabolic shifts, and the full implications of this for control of macrophage activation, remains poorly understood.</p><p>Here we show that integration of the Akt-mTORC1 pathway into IL-4 signaling allows for selective control of some M2 responses. Control is exerted at the level of Acly, a key enzyme in Ac-CoA production, thereby modulating histone acetylation and transcriptional induction of a subset of M2 genes. Consistent with its role as an important metabolic sensor, the Akt-mTORC1 pathway couples metabolic input to such gene-specific control. Our findings also reveal subsets of the M2 response, including chemokine production and cellular proliferation, that are linked to metabolic state by Akt-mTORC1 signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Akt regulates increased glucose metabolism in M2 macrophages</title><p>Akt is a major metabolic regulator implicated in M2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ruckerl et al., 2012</xref>), but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly characterized. To begin to address this question, we employed unbiased metabolic profiling of M2 macrophages, using LC/MS-based metabolomics and a platform that measures ~290 small metabolites representative of all major pathways of intermediary metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Sahra et al., 2013</xref>). Top enriched pathways include urea cycle and arginine and proline metabolism, consistent with previous studies indicating upregulation of arginine metabolism in M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Van Dyken and Locksley, 2013</xref>), as well as amino acid utilization and metabolism and nucleotide metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We found that BMDMs increased glucose uptake in a time-dependent manner in response to IL-4 treatment. Such increase was reduced by cotreatment with the Akt inhibitor MK2206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating control by Akt and consistent with a role for Akt in regulating glycolysis in many settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Robey and Hay, 2009</xref>). Moreover, enhanced glucose consumption in M2 macrophages was associated with an Akt-dependent increase in both glycolysis and oxidative metabolism, as indicated by extracellular flux assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, glycolytic flux was needed for optimal implementation of the M2 program. Similar to the Î²-oxidation inhibitor etomoxir, the glycolysis inhibitor 2-DG reduced IL-4-mediated induction of some M2 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Therefore, Akt mediates enhanced glucose consumption in M2 macrophages, and this contributes to induction of M2 gene expression. Such glucose consumption may also fuel production of UDP-Glc-NAc, the substrate for glycosylation of some M2 markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jha et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, Akt does not control Î²-oxidation in M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>IL-4 signaling activates Akt to allow for selective control of M2 gene induction</title><p>Because the increase in glucose utilization was relatively modest, we considered that Akt could play additional roles in control of M2 activation and turned to an analysis of M2 gene regulation.

Importantly and as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ruckerl et al., 2012</xref>), Akt activity controlled the induction of a subset of M2 genes.

A seminal study from Wellen and colleagues indicated that in cancer cells and differentiating adipocytes, metabolic state is linked to gene expression via effects on histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wellen et al., 2009</xref>), thus we hypothesized that Akt may control histone acetylation to regulate M2 gene expression. Indeed, IL-4-treatment of BMDMs enhanced global acetylation of H3 and H4 histones, as indicated by western blot of whole cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A,B</xref>).

Consistently, metabolic processes underlying cellular proliferation were among the top enriched pathways in our metabolomics analysis, including nucleotide metabolism and protein biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In the context of cellular proliferation, for example, Akt-mTORC1 activity couples growth factor signaling and nutrient availability to the synthesis of proteins, lipids, and nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dibble and Manning, 2013</xref>). In contrast, the role of the Akt-mTORC1 pathway in macrophages is much less intuitive. What is the teleological rationale for control of macrophage activation by Akt-mTORC1 signaling (and metabolism more generally)?</p><p>Here we propose that IL-4 signaling <italic>co-opted</italic> the Akt-mTORC1 pathway to couple metabolic input to regulation of certain components of the M2 response, including chemokines and cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). This is supported by our findings that IL-4 signaling leads to parallel and independent activation of the Akt-mTORC1 pathway and the canonical Jak-Stat pathway, allowing the Akt-mTORC1 axis to regulate a subset of M2 genes through control of Acly activity/expression, Ac-CoA production, and histone acetylation. Why should some but not other components of the M2 response be regulated in this way? Control of cellular proliferation is intuitive, since Akt-mTORC1 signaling acts as a metabolic checkpoint in the context of cellular division to allow growth and proliferation only when nutrients are abundant. What about chemokines? We propose that chemokines may be controlled by the Akt-mTORC1 pathway because of their key role in amplifying energetically costly immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hotamisligil and Erbay, 2008</xref>). This allows metabolic status to calibrate immune responses such that inflammation is amplified and sustained only under metabolically favorable conditions. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that a critical role for Akt-mTORC1 signaling in activated CD8âT cells is to support their migration to sites of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finlay and Cantrell, 2011</xref>). Therefore, Akt-mTORC1 signaling regulates both facets of immune response amplification, i.e., the ability of tissue-resident sentinel cells to mobilize activated leukocytes and of activated T cells to be recruited. Together these findings add another dimension to our emerging understanding of how metabolism supports leukocyte activation and immune responses.</p><p>As discussed above, the Akt/Acly-dependent rise in Ac-CoA production is necessary but not sufficient for stimulating gene-specific increases in histone acetylation. Such specificity is most likely conferred by HATs with distinct K<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pietrocola et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, our analysis suggests that p300 may preferentially regulate at least a subset of the Akt-dependent M2 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Its high K<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MariÃ±o et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pietrocola et al., 2015</xref>) may allow p300 to link metabolic status and Akt/mTORC1 activity, in the form of Ac-CoA levels, to histone acetylation and transcriptional induction at some M2 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, HATs at Akt-independent M2 genes may have a low K<sub>m</sub> and are thus insensitive to such modulation of Ac-CoA levels. Presumably, differential HAT recruitment is mediated by distinct transcription factors at Akt-dependent and independent M2 genes, which would be important to address in future studies.</p><p>Although Akt activity has been linked to M2 activation, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ruckerl et al., 2012</xref>), the role of mTORC1 remained unclear. Here, we use <italic>Raptor</italic>â³/â³ BMDMs to show that mTORC1 activity stimulates M2 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, amino acids modulate mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) to potentiate M2 gene induction in a Raptor-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Together these findings indicate that the Akt-mTORC1 signaling module supports M2 activation. Acly appears to be a key target, with its expression levels and activating phosphorylation controlled by mTORC1 and Akt respectively. In seeming contrast to these data indicating that mTORC1 supports M2 activation, we and others have shown that aberrantly increased mTORC1 activity in <italic>Tsc1</italic>-deficient BMDMs attenuates M2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). We hypothesize that the difference between the two models reflects divergent control of M2 activation by physiological and pathophysiological mTORC1 activity respectively. Downstream of the insulin receptor, such context-dependent roles of mTORC1 are well-established. In lean/healthy animals, mTORC1 critically mediates insulin signaling in metabolic tissues (to coordinate postprandial nutrient storage), but in obesity, chronic nutrient excess leads to an aberrant increase in mTORC1 activity that contributes directly to insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulationÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>). Similarly, while physiological mTORC1 activity couples metabolic input to M2 activation, pathophysiological mTORC1 activation during chronic nutrient excess may impair M2 activation. It would be interesting to see if the latter is true in adipose tissue macrophages in the context of diet-induced obesity, and if so, the consequences for tissue inflammation and metabolic homeostasis.</p><p>Interestingly, while inducible Akt phosphorylation occurred within minutes of IL-4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), inducible Acly phosphorylation was detected with slightly delayed kinetics (~2âh, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and data not shown). Such delay may reflect a need for other inputs that facilitate Akt-mediated Acly phosphorylation, or the reduced sensitivity and dynamic range of the pAcly antibody compared to the pAkt antibodies. Once pAcly is detectable at ~2âh, Akt and Acly phosphorylation nicely parallel and steadily increase up to (and perhaps beyond) 8âhr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). As expected, inducible Akt and Acly phosphorylation precede increases in global histone acetylation, which is observed starting only at 4âhr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, Ac-CoA levels increase only 8âhr after IL-4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). One possibility, supported by the increase in global histone acetylation at 4âh, is that diversion of Ac-CoA into acetylated histones diminishes the free Ac-CoA pool. Another possibility is that because the LC-MS analysis measures bulk Ac-CoA rather than the nuclear-cytoplasmic pool relevant for histone acetylation, changes in mitochondrial Ac-CoA levels could be confounding. Again, global histone acetylation, which may more accurately reflect nuclear-cytoplasmic pools of Ac-CoA, increases 4âhr after IL-4 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), as does gene-specific increases in histone acetylation at Akt-dependent M2 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Therefore, we believe that the preponderance of the data support our model that IL-4 triggers Ac-CoA production and histone acetylation as a consequence of Akt-mediated Acly activation.</p><p>Metabolic status has long been proposed to modulate epigenetic control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Teperino et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaelin and McKnight, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gut and Verdin, 2013</xref>), but only recently have a handful of studies linked physiological changes in metabolite levels to chromatin regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wellen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shimazu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carey et al., 2015</xref>). Here we show how the Akt-mTORC1 axis couples metabolic input in the form of Ac-CoA levels to histone acetylation and gene regulation, and importantly, to control specific subsets of the M2 program. In addition to a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2014</xref>), this is only the second example of how Akt-Acly signaling controls gene regulation through histone acetylation. Other macrophage polarizing signals and common gamma chain cytokines (Î³<sub>c</sub>) (e.g. IL-2, IL-15) engage the Akt-mTORC1 axis, thus our findings may have implications for multiple programs of macrophage polarization and leukocyte activation. Canonical signaling downstream of the polarizing signal or Î³<sub>c</sub> specifies which genes are induced, while regulation of Ac-CoA levels and histone acetylation by the Akt-mTORC1-Acly pathway allows metabolic input to calibrate genes encoding energetically demanding processes; it would be informative in future studies to determine the nature of these processes. Alternatively, Ac-CoA can be synthesized independently of the Akt-mTORC1-Acly axis by AceCS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hallows et al., 2006</xref>) or nuclear pyruvate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sutendra et al., 2014</xref>) to mediate histone acetylation. AceCS1 activity is controlled by SIRT1, thus providing a means for Ac-CoA production and histone acetylation in conditions of low energy or nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hallows et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, future studies to determine how gene-specific histone acetylation is regulated during different macrophage activation programs are warranted. These studies could pave the way towards new therapeutic approaches of modulating macrophage function in diverse contexts, including Type 2 inflammation, metabolic homeostasis, and antimicrobial immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>BMDM culture and stimulations</title><p>BMDM cultures were established as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byles et al., 2013</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study shows that Act stimulation in macrophages by IL-4, a cytokine that dictates alternative (M2) activation of these cells, leads to activation of Acly, an enzyme that mediates Ac-CoA production, and thus enhances histone acetylation and induction of a subset of the M2 genes. It further shows that this Act effect is subject to modulation by metabolic signals, which probably serves to adjust the differentiation state and function of macrophages to nutrient availability.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major concern was raised on the timing by which various reported events occur and the implications of this for the overarching model. AKT phosphorylation increases within 15 min of IL-4 stimulation, histone acetylation increases by about 4 hours, while pACLY increases by 6 hours, and acetyl-CoA by 8 hours. This does not seem to be consistent with the proposed model, in which pACLY is directly downstream of AKT and should result in increased acetyl-CoA production proceeding or concurrent with increased histone acetylation. It is suggested that all of these parameters (or at least pAKT, pACLY, and histone acetylation) should be examined in the same experiment over the same time course to clarify whether the proposed model truly makes sense.</p><p>2) The contribution of mTORC1 here should be further clarified. Based on the data, it doesn't look like mTORC1 is a major contributor to the IL-4-driven pathway, since mTORC1 is implicated in regulating ACLY protein levels and ACLY protein levels do not increase with IL-4. Yet, mTORC1 is included as a major component of the paper's conclusions. Would authors agree that the data don't appear to support mTORC1 as a major physiological component of the mechanism?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11612.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) A major concern was raised on the timing by which various reported events occur and the implications of this for the overarching model.

Inducible pAKT is detected very rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>) while inducible pACLY is detected starting at ~2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and data not shown). The lag in ACLY activation relative to AKT activation may reflect a need for other inputs that facilitate AKT-mediated ACLY phosphorylation; alternatively, the large dynamic range of AKT phosphorylation (relative to ACLY phosphorylation), likely reflecting the extreme sensitivities of the pAKT antibodies, may enable earlier detection of pAKT. In any case, once pACLY is detectable at ~2h, AKT and ACLY phosphorylation nicely parallel and steadily increase up to (and perhaps beyond) 8 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The kinetics of Akt and Acly phosphorylation precede that of global histone acetylation, which is detectable starting at 4 h but not at 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These data support our model that IL-4 triggers Akt-mediated Acly activation and consequent histone acetylation. (Note that cells are lysed directly in 6x SDS buffer for the histone acetylation blots but NP-40 lysis buffer for the Akt and Acly blots so these are not the same experiments, but we have used the same time course to facilitate direct comparison of the two sets of data. Also, both the Akt/Acly activation and the histone acetylation experiments have been done multiple times over similar time courses with reproducible results, so we believe that experiment to experiment variability is unlikely.)</p><p>Not consistent with the Akt and Acly activation and histone acetylation, Ac-CoA levels increase at 8 h but not 4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). One possibility, supported by the increase in global histone acetylation at 4 h, is that diversion of Ac-CoA into acetylated histones lowers the Akt- and Acly-dependent increase in the free Ac-CoA pool. Another possibility is that because our LC-MS analysis measures bulk Ac-CoA rather than the nuclear-cytoplasmic pool that is relevant for histone acetylation, reduced mitochondrial Ac-CoA may offset an early elevation in the nuclear-cytosolic pool of Ac-CoA. Unfortunately, current technologies for Ac-CoA measurements are incompatible with subcellular fractionation, precluding a direct test of this hypothesis. In this regard, the global histone acetylation may be an important complementary analysis that more accurately reflects nuclear-cytoplasmic pools of Ac-CoA. As noted above, the global histone acetylation increases ~4 h after IL-4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), with similar kinetics to gene-specific increases in histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Taken together, we believe that the preponderance of the data including a careful kinetic analysis of pAkt, pAcly, and histone acetylation support our working model. An abbreviated version of this discussion is also included in the manuscript.</p><p>At this point we would also like to address the reliability of the histone acetylation blots. First, we would like to clarify that the histone acetylation blots are normalized to tubulin and are evenly loaded based on total protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). The H3 and H4 acetylation are then normalized to total H3 and H4 respectively, and then quantified by Image J densitometry. Using this protocol, the IL-4-inducible increase in global histone acetylation (normalized for the increase in total histones) is modest but very consistent and reproducible in several independent experiments (representatives of which are shown in the manuscript). We also tried acid extraction of histones as suggested by the reviewer (Epigentek, EpiQuik Total Histone Extraction Kit, Cat # OP-0006). For reasons not clear to us, multiple attempts with the acid extraction protocol indicate no IL-4-inducible increase in global histone acetylation (measured at 2 h intervals for up to 12 h following IL-4 stimulation; data not shown). We are inclined to believe the data obtained with the original protocol rather than the acid extraction for the following reasons: 1) The original protocol yielded extremely consistent/reproducible results over several independent experiments; 2) The correlation of increased histone acetylation with cellular proliferation seen in the original protocol is observed in many other contexts (e.g. PMID: 21596309); 3) Using the original protocol, addition of acetate or the HDAC inhibitor TSA led to the expected increases in global H3 and H4 acetylation (data not shown); and 4) That IL-4-inducible total histone acetylation is Akt-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A-B</xref>) and starts ~4 h is consistent with the other data that we have presented in the manuscript. Therefore, we have left the histone acetylation blots in the manuscript, but defer to the judgment of the reviewers and can remove these blots if needed. A final consideration for keeping the histone acetylation blots in the manuscript is that, as noted above, global histone acetylation may more accurately reflect nuclear-cytoplasmic pools of Ac-CoA than LC-MS measurements of bulk Ac-CoA.</p><p><italic>2) The contribution of mTORC1 here should be further clarified. Based on the data, it doesn't look like mTORC1 is a major contributor to the IL-4-driven pathway, since mTORC1 is implicated in regulating ACLY protein levels and ACLY protein levels do not increase with IL-4. Yet, mTORC1 is included as a major component of the paper's conclusions. Would authors agree that the data don't appear to support mTORC1 as a major physiological component of the mechanism?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out an opportunity for strengthening our manuscript. We believe that in addition to and together with Akt, mTORC1 regulates a subset of M2 genes and critically couples metabolic input to induction of these genes. We have now obtained Raptor-deficient BMDMs, and showed that loss of mTORC1 leads to reduced expression of the Akt-dependent M2 genes <italic>Arg1, Fizz1, Mgl2, but not Ym1, Fabp4,</italic> and <italic>Cd36</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This provides strong genetic evidence that physiological mTORC1 activity supports M2 activation. Moreover, the ability of amino acids to modulate Akt-dependent M2 genes is attenuated in Raptor-deficient BMDMs, indicating that mTORC1 is an important part of the mechanism by which amino acid availability calibrates this subset of M2 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, these findings implicate physiological mTORC1 activity in control of M2 activation and in linking metabolic input to a subset of M2 genes.</p><p>We believe that an important role of mTORC1 in its control of M2 activation is regulation of Acly protein levels. Raptor KO BMDMs lacking mTORC1 have clearly reduced levels of Acly protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Conversely, TSC KO BMDMs with constitutively elevated mTORC1 activity have elevated ACLY levels that are sensitive to inhibition with rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, amino acids dose dependently augment total ACLY levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), most likely through mTORC1. Although IL-4 only stimulates a very modest to negligible increase in Acly protein levels (as the reviewers point out), we believe that serum may be driving mTORC1-stimulated Acly protein levels at steady state thus confounding the ability to detect IL-4-inducible increases. In this regard it is interesting to note the clear reduction in the IL-4-inducible pAcly in Raptor-deficient BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). While the underlying mechanism remains to be clarified in future studies, this raises the possibility that in addition to Akt, mTORC1 could regulate Acly phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings strongly indicate an important role for mTORC1 in controlling Acly protein levels (and perhaps also phosphorylation) in M2 macrophages.</p><p>Taken together, we believe that our data indicates that mTORC1 couples metabolic input to M2 activation through Acly (and perhaps other mechanisms). We have elaborated on this in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
