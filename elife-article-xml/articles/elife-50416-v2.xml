LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases within their Switch-II motif controlling interaction with effectors. An siRNA screen of all human protein phosphatases revealed that a poorly studied protein phosphatase, PPM1H, counteracts LRRK2 signaling by specifically dephosphorylating Rab proteins. PPM1H knockout increased endogenous Rab phosphorylation and inhibited Rab dephosphorylation in human A549 cells. Overexpression of PPM1H suppressed LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation. PPM1H also efficiently and directly dephosphorylated Rab8A in biochemical studies. A “substrate-trapping” PPM1H mutant (Asp288Ala) binds with high affinity to endogenous, LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab proteins, thereby blocking dephosphorylation seen upon addition of LRRK2 inhibitors. PPM1H is localized to the Golgi and its knockdown suppresses primary cilia formation, similar to pathogenic LRRK2. Thus, PPM1H acts as a key modulator of LRRK2 signaling by controlling dephosphorylation of Rab proteins. PPM1H activity enhancers could offer a new therapeutic approach to prevent or treat Parkinson’s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein phosphatase</kwd><kwd>Rab GTPase</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>LRRK2</kwd><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>cell signalling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000864</institution-id><institution>Michael J.

Missense mutations within the GTPase domain (N1437H, R1441G/C, Y1699C) and kinase domains (G2019S, I2020T) hyper-activate LRRK2 protein kinase and cause Parkinson’s disease (PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zimprich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paisán-Ruíz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alessi and Sammler, 2018</xref>). Mutations in LRRK2 are one of the most common genetic causes of familial Parkinson’s comprising ~5% of familial Parkinson's, and ~1% of sporadic Parkinson's patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Healy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Domingo and Klein, 2018</xref>). In terms of clinical presentation and late age of onset, LRRK2 mediated Parkinson’s closely resembles the common sporadic form of the disease affecting the vast majority of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marras et al., 2011</xref>). The G2019S mutation, located within the magnesium binding motif of the kinase domain, is the most common LRRK2 mutation and activates LRRK2 kinase activity around 2-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">West et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greggio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jaleel et al., 2007</xref>). Penetrance of the G2019S and other pathogenic LRRK2 mutations is incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruiz-Martínez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldwurm et al., 2011</xref>). There is emerging evidence that the LRRK2 pathway is hyperactivated in some patients with idiopathic PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Maio et al., 2018</xref>). Pharmaceutical companies have developed LRRK2 inhibitors for treatment and prevention of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alessi and Sammler, 2018</xref>) and clinical trials have commenced and/or are planned (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link> NCT03976349 (BIIB094) and NCT03710707 (DNL201)).</p><p>Recent studies have revealed that LRRK2 phosphorylates a subgroup of Rab proteins (Rab3A/B/C/D, Rab8A/B, Rab10, Rab12, Rab29, Rab35, and Rab43) at a conserved Thr/Ser residue (Thr73 for Rab10), located at the center of the effector binding switch-II motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Steger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jeong et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with Rab proteins comprising disease-relevant substrates, all established pathogenic mutations enhance LRRK2 mediated Rab protein phosphorylation in a manner that is blocked by diverse LRRK2 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Steger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ito et al., 2016</xref>). LRRK2 phosphorylation of Rab proteins blocks the ability of Rab proteins to interact with cognate effectors such as GDI and guanine nucleotide exchange factors, thereby trapping the phosphorylated Rab protein in the GTP bound state on the membrane where it has been phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pfeffer, 2018</xref>). Recent work identified a novel group of effectors including RILPL1 and RILPL2 that bind preferentially to LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab8 and Rab10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Steger et al., 2017</xref>). LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab8A and Rab10, in complex with RILPL1/RILPL2, inhibit the formation of primary cilia that are implicated in controlling a Sonic hedgehog-driven neuroprotective pathway that could provide a mechanism by which LRRK2 is linked to PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhekne et al., 2018</xref>). Other research has revealed that components implicated in PD including Rab29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Purlyte et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) and VPS35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mir et al., 2018</xref>) also regulate phosphorylation of Rab proteins via LRRK2.</p><p>The protein phosphatase(s) that act on LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab proteins have not been identified, but appear to be highly active, as treatment of cell lines with LRRK2 inhibitors induce rapid dephosphorylation of Rab10 within 1-2 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ito et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, dephosphorylation of LRRK2 at a well-studied potential autophosphorylation site (Ser935) occurs much more slowly in response to LRRK2 inhibitor administration, requiring up to 90 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ito et al., 2016</xref>). Only a small proportion (around 1%) of the total cellular Rab proteins are phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ito et al., 2016</xref>).

Consistent with PP1 phosphatase regulating dephosphorylation of LRRK2 at Ser935 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lobbestael et al., 2013</xref>), calyculin-A stimulated Ser935 phosphorylation, particularly in the LRRK2[R1441C] MEF cells. It also prevented dephosphorylation of Ser935 following administration of MLi-2 (Figure 1). At 1 µM, Okadaic acid is likely to partially inhibit PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishihara et al., 1989</xref>); this concentration also blocked MLi-2 from inducing dephosphorylation of Ser935.

Two replicate screens were undertaken in which cells were treated with siRNA targeting each phosphatase component for 72 h before cell lysis (Screen 1 and 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). A third screen was also performed in which partial dephosphorylation of Rab10 was induced by adding MLi-2 inhibitor for 5 min prior to cell lysis (Screen 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). As a readout of LRRK2 kinase activity we monitored phosphorylation of endogenous Rab10 employing a previously developed specific phospho-antibody that robustly detects endogenously LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab10 by immunoblot analysis in whole cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lis et al., 2018</xref>). Due to the availability of this antibody and the relatively high abundance of Rab10 in most cells, monitoring Thr73 Rab10 phosphorylation is currently the most facile readout of LRRK2 kinase activity. Phospho-Thr73 Rab10 and total Rab10 were quantified in parallel employing a multiplex immunoblot assay.

Human PPM1H possesses 514 residues encompassing a PPM type phosphatase domain with no other known functional motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Repeat studies in multiple experiments confirmed that siRNA mediated depletion of PPM1H increased Rab10 phosphorylation, without affecting overall levels of Rab10 or LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>).

Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee-Hoeflich et al., 2011</xref>), we observed that endogenous PPM1H, detected by immunoblot, migrates as a doublet of ~55 kDa (reason for doublet unknown) with the top band migrating at the expected molecular weight for full length PPM1H. Expression of both forms of PPM1H was lowered by siRNA treatment. We also confirmed that siRNA knockdown of NT5DC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), DUSP3, DUSP18 and PLPP6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) enhanced Rab10 phosphorylation without impacting total Rab10 or LRRK2 levels, or LRRK2 Ser935 phosphorylation. However, knock-down of the tyrosine phosphatases PTPN6, PTPN22, PTPN23 and the possible inositol phosphatase MTMR9 significantly reduced Rab10 protein levels (without affecting total LRRK2) and therefore potentially increase the calculated phospho-Rab10/total Rab10 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). siRNA depletion of TAB1 enhanced Rab10 protein phosphorylation to a marginal extent in repeat experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

If Rab GTPase phosphorylation contributes to the regulation of cilia formation in wild-type cells, depletion of PPM1H should also increase Rab phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting cilia formation. To test this, MEF cells were infected with lentiviruses encoding 3 different shRNAs to deplete PPM1H protein. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, depletion of PPM1H decreased cilia formation compared with control (scrambled shRNA sequence) infected cells, by a process that required LRRK2, as it was not seen when cells were cultured in the presence of the MLi-2 LRRK2 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>).

Plants possess over 80 different PPM phosphatases that play important roles in hormone abscisic acid signaling and protection against stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schweighofer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2009</xref>). PPM phosphatases are evolutionarily unrelated to other serine/threonine protein phosphatases and there are 20 family members in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). These enzymes are characterized by their requirement for supplementation with millimolar concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions for activity in vitro and are also insensitive to inhibition by okadaic acid or calyculin-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shi, 2009</xref>). The structure of human PPM1A displays two tightly bound Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions in the active site and a small subdomain, termed the Flap, located adjacent to the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Das et al., 1996</xref>). Crystal structures of bacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellinzoni et al., 2007</xref>) and plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Melcher et al., 2009</xref>) PPM homologs are nearly identical to that of the human PPM1A phosphatase core domain. In addition, a third, loosely associated magnesium ion, termed M3, appears to be required for optimal catalysis of all PPM family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tanoue et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>PPM1H is a member of a group of 3 PPM phosphatases that have been termed the ‘PPM1H subfamily’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). This consists of PPM1H (URCC2, ARHCL1, NERPP-2C), PPM1J (PP2Cζ) and PPM1M (PP2Cη). PPM1H is most widely expressed in brain, but also found at varying levels in most other tissues including lung, kidney and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1A</xref> to 1B). In blood cells, PPM1H is expressed at high levels in basophils and lower levels in neutrophils and is very low or not detected in most other cells including monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Figure 12—figure supplement 2</xref>). PPM1M, which is also able to dephosphorylate LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab10, was undetectable in most tissues, and only observed at very low levels in the prostate gland and urinary bladder, despite mRNA levels being detected at similar levels to PPM1H in most tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1C</xref> to 1D). In the blood, PPM1M is most highly expressed in neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1C</xref> to 1D). Consistent with high expression in the brain, PPM1H was first discovered in a screen to identify protein phosphatases that are highly expressed in neuronal cell lines and in rat brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Labes et al., 1998</xref>). In future studies, it will be important to explore whether high levels of PPM1H, or low levels of LRRK2 expression in neuronal cells account for the relatively low levels of LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab10 in brain in comparison with other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The PPM1H subfamily phosphatases are conserved in animals from sponge to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>); invertebrates from sponge to ciona encode a single family member. The three copies found in mammals probably arose by two independent duplication events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Human PPM1H possesses 514 residues encompassing a PPM type phosphatase domain with no other known functional motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). In previous work PPM1H was also reported to be overexpressed in colon adenocarcinoma and co-immunoprecipitated with the CSE1L apoptosis regulator that was suggested to comprise a substrate for PPM1H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sugiura et al., 2008</xref>). Another study found PPM1H confers trastuzumab resistance by promoting the dephosphorylation of p27 CDK inhibitor at threonine 187 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee-Hoeflich et al., 2011</xref>). It has also been suggested that patients whose tumors express low levels of PPM1H have reduced survival from colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our data reveal that PPM1H specifically dephosphorylates a subset of Rab proteins phosphorylated at the effector-binding motif by LRRK2, namely Rab8A, Rab8B, Rab10 and Rab35. PPM1H fails to dephosphorylate Rab8A protein phosphorylated at the distinct Ser111 site regulated by the PINK1 kinase, also implicated in PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lai et al., 2015</xref>). The specificity of PPM1H for phosphorylated Rab proteins is also highlighted by the substrate trapping PPM1H[D288A] mutant that binds to endogenous LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab8A, Rab8B and Rab10 with sufficient affinity to permit co-immunoprecipitation and suppress dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We also observed that PPM1H efficiently dephosphorylated Rab8A complexed to either GDP or GTPγS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>), suggesting that it can recognize both these conformations. A priority for future work will be to elucidate the mechanism by which specificity of PPM1H for dephosphorylating LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab proteins is achieved. Structural analysis of the substrate-trapping mutant of PPM1H complexed to phosphorylated Rab8A will be highly informative. It will also be interesting to determine whether PPM1H possesses regulatory subunits that could control its activity, specificity and localization.</p><p>PPM1H is located both in cytosol and on the cis and medial Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) and further work is needed to elucidate how PPM1H localizes to the Golgi and how it might translocate to other membranes and vesicles where LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab proteins reside. It is interesting to note that there is a significant pool of Rab10 on the Golgi, and Rab8A on the Golgi and perinuclear compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhekne et al., 2018</xref>). Perhaps PPM1H’s Golgi localization serves to maintain those pools of Rab8A and Rab10 in functional forms to be able to perform functions other than cilia regulation. Another important goal will be to analyze the relationship between PPM1H localization and LRRK2 substrate selection in cells.</p><p>The PPM1H-related enzyme, PPM1M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) also dephosphorylated Rab10 and Rab8A when overexpressed in cells, albeit to a lower extent than PPM1H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In corresponding biochemical studies, we also found that PPM1M displayed weak activity towards phosphorylated Rab10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5D</xref>), but did not dephosphorylate Rab8A significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). In overexpression experiments PPM1J phosphatase displayed no activity towards dephosphorylating Rab10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) although weak activity was observed in in vitro biochemical analyzes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5C</xref>). Previous work revealed that at least 22 Rab proteins not regulated by LRRK2 are phosphorylated at their effector motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Steger et al., 2017</xref>), including Rab7A phosphorylated at Ser72 by TBK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heo et al., 2018</xref>) or LRRK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanafusa et al., 2019</xref>), and Rab1 that is phosphorylated at Thr75 by TAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levin et al., 2016</xref>). It will be interesting to probe whether PPM1M, PPM1J or indeed PPM1H might dephosphorylate other Rab proteins. Out of the other 11 PPM family phosphatases tested, only PHLPP1 (PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase) displayed weak ability to dephosphorylate Rab10 in an overexpression assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>As LRRK2 inhibitors still induce dephosphorylation of Rab10 in PPM1H knock-out A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>), other protein phosphatase(s), that could include PPM1M, must also control Rab10 dephosphorylation in vivo. Our analysis also revealed that knock-down of a number of other phosphatases (TAB1, PTPN6, PTPN22, PTPN23, MTMR9, NT5DC2, DUSP3, DUSP18, PLPP6) modestly increased Rab10 protein phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). These phosphatases include tyrosine phosphatases (PTPN6, PTPN22, PTPN23), dual specificity phosphatases (DUSP3, DUSP18), a lipid phosphatase (MTMR9), a catalytically inactive pseudophosphatase (TAB1), and metabolic phosphatases (NT5DC2 and PLPP6). None of these enzymes are known to dephosphorylate Ser/Thr residue phosphorylated proteins, and it is possible that the observed actions of these phosphatases are indirect; further analysis will be required to probe any physiological significance. Interestingly, we also found that knock-down of a small group of phosphatases (GAK, ALPI, PPEF2, MDP1, PUDP) reduced LRRK2 levels leading to an inhibition of Rab10 protein phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Mutations in GAK (also known as Auxilin-2) have been linked to PD, as revealed by gemone-wide association studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nalls et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it will be interesting to probe the mechanisms by which GAK, as well as the other phosphatases, impinge on the LRRK2 pathway.</p><p>In summary, our data provide compelling evidence that PPM1H acts to dephosphorylate Rab proteins in vivo and therefore counteracts LRRK2 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). This is supported by the findings that knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) as well as knock-out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) of PPM1H induce endogenous Rab10, Rab8A and Rab35 protein phosphorylation and PPM1H directly dephosphorylates phosphorylated Rab8A and Rab10 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Overexpression of PPM1H in cells abolishes phospho-Rab10 staining of wild-type MEF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We identify a substrate trapping mutant of PPM1H that binds to endogenous LRRK2 phosphorylated-Rab8A as well as Rab10 and also protects Rab10 from becoming dephosphorylated following inhibition of LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). LRRK2 has been reported to regulate many biological responses such as autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Plowey et al., 2008</xref>), immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moehle et al., 2012</xref>) as well as phagosome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Härtlova et al., 2018</xref>), and a key question is whether LRRK2 controls these effects by phosphorylating Rab proteins or via an independent pathway. This issue of whether Rab proteins are involved in mediating the actions of LRRK2 can be addressed in the future by probing the impact of manipulating PPM1H levels. Indeed, we have used this approach to demonstrate that knock-down of PPM1H blocks primary cilia formation in a manner analogous to pathogenic, activating LRRK2 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). This is consistent with our previous work demonstrating that the ability of LRRK2 to inhibit primary cilia formation is indeed dependent on Rab8A and Rab10 protein phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhekne et al., 2018</xref>). In future work it will be important to explore whether PPM1H contributes to PD risk. For example, pathogenic mutants of LRRK2 are incompletely penetrant and a majority of patients may not develop PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruiz-Martínez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldwurm et al., 2011</xref>). It would be critical to explore whether increased expression or activity of PPM enzymes protects patients with LRRK2 mutations from developing PD by enhancing Rab protein dephosphorylation. Conversely, reduced expression or activity of PPM1H phosphatase would be expected to promote Rab protein phosphorylation and enhance PD risk. Targeting PPM1H to increase its activity or expression in order to promote Rab protein dephosphorylation could be explored as a therapeutic strategy for preventing and/or treating LRRK2-mediated PD.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50416.028</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Model of how PPM1H counteracts LRRK2 signaling pathway by dephosphorylating Rab proteins.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50416-fig12-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig12s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50416.029</object-id><label>Figure 12—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>The abundance of PPM1H and PPM1M mRNA and protein in human tissues was analyzed using data downloaded from ProtemicsdB public repository database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteomicsdb.org/">https://www.proteomicsdb.org/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schmidt et al., 2018</xref>).</title><p>The median mRNA expression across the tissues studied is depicted as transcripts per million.

The LC-MS/MS analysis of phospho-Rab PRM samples were analyzed on QE-HFX mass spectrometer interfaced with EvoSep LC -system by selecting 21 min run method described above. The full scan and PRM method were designed as outlined above for full scan and MS2 PRM scans by providing the pRab inclusion list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The dynamic retention time was adjusted by enabling on-the-fly retention time correction using PRTC peptide mix to accurately target phospho-Rab peptides. As the six pRabs along with heavy and counterpart endogenous peptides elute between 6–8 min of the LC-gradient, on-the-fly RT correction is necessary to accumulate enough ions and to attain a minimum of 10 data points for accurate peptide identification and quantification. The MS2 spectra AGC target was set at 1E5 and 300 ms Ion injection times were set for the targets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Data analysis for stoichiometry of Rab10 phosphorylation analysis</title><p>The Rab10 Stoichiometry PPM1H-knock-out (±MLi2) and wild-type (±MLi2) raw mass spectrometry data was imported into Skyline software suite (version 19.1.0.193.

All three were made as unphosphorylated and phosphorylated proteins.</p><p>Rab8A 1–181 [Q67L] was produced in GTP-gamma-S as follows. The codon optimized coding sequence of Rab8A residues 1–181 [Q67L] subcloned into pET28b was kindly provided by Amir Khan (Trinity College Dublin) and expressed based on a protocol provided by the Khan lab. Briefly, the expression construct was transformed into BL21 DE3 and expressed in Lucia Broth medium (Merck, Darmstadt) supplemented with 50 µg/ml Kanamycin (Formedium, UK). Typically, 12 × 1L expressions were set up. When the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6, the culture temperature was dropped to 18°C and after 60 min, Rab8A expression was induced by addition of Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Formedium, UK) to 0.1 mM for incubation overnight.

Some mutations in LRRK2 promote phosphorylation of the Switch II region of several Rab proteins, including Rab10, but how hyper-phosphorylated Rabs are returned to the unphosphorylated state is unknown. Through a focused genetic screen, this paper identifies PPM1H as a phosphatase that can remove phosphate from a subset of Rabs that are targeted by LRRK2. Regulation of Rab phosphorylation status by PPM1H may have implications for trafficking pathways altered by mutant LRRK2. Interestingly, detailed analysis suggests that while PPM1H is a major phosphatase for these Rabs, there may be other redundant phosphatases for one or more of the Rab proteins. This study has major implications for understanding the regulation of Rab phosphorylation and may also suggest ways to reduce the levels of specific phospho-Rab proteins in cells with mutant LRRK2, for example, by elevating the activity of PPM1H.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;PPM1H phosphatase counteracts LRRK2 signaling by selectively dephosphorylating Rab proteins&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Wade Harper as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alexandra C Newton (Reviewer #2); Peter S McPherson (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper identifies PPM1H as a phosphatase for various Rabs that are phosphorylated on their Switch II region by LRRK2. Noting that Rab phosphorylation is rapidly reversed (within a couple of min) upon inhibition of LRRK2 by a small molecule inhibitor, the authors first demonstrated that PP1 or PP2A are not required for Rab dephosphorylation. They subsequently performed a focused siRNA screen (264 phosphatases) to identify the Rab phosphatase. From 3 screens, PPM1H, a metal dependent phosphatase emerged as the lead candidate. The authors performed a number of secondary assays that indicate that PPM1H is the primary Rab phosphatase for the LRRK2 phospho-site. Closely related family members J and M have very weak activity in vitro. The M isoform appeared to have some activity when overexpressed in cells but it also seems to slightly reduce LRRK2 levels. Using immunofluorescence, the authors demonstrated that PPM1H associates with cis and medial Golgi, as well as being localized to the cytosol. Overall, the reviews were very positive.</p><p>After discussion among the reviewer's, we suggest the following revisions:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>It remains somewhat unclear as to whether or not all of the Rab substrates of LRRK2 (3A-D, 8, 10, 12, 29, 35, 43) are physiologically relevant targets of PPM1H. The reviewer's feel it would be useful to examine the relevance of PPM1H on additional LRRK2-targeted Rabs, as performed in Figure 4. Of course this experiment will require appropriate high-quality phosphospecific antibodies, and these reagents may limit the number of Rabs that could be tested in this way. One could also envision couple a phos-tag gel assay to overexpression of WT and mutant (substrate trapping) PPM1H, were suitable antibodies not available for any of the additional p-Rabs.

Of course this experiment will require appropriate high-quality phosphospecific antibodies, and these reagents may limit the number of Rabs that could be tested in this way. One could also envision couple a phos-tag gel assay to overexpression of WT and mutant (substrate trapping) PPM1H, were suitable antibodies not available for any of the additional p-Rabs. Expansion of the PPM1H substrate repertoire for any additional LRRK2-targets Rabs would strengthen the idea that the phosphatase is acting broadly in opposition to LRRK2.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you-this is an important question. In order to assess the effect of PPM1H knock-out on the phosphorylation of additional endogenous Rab proteins in the A549 cells, we undertook an immunoprecipitation experiment using a pan- phospho-specific-Rab antibody that cross-reacts with LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab3, Rab8, Rab10, Rab35 and Rab43 (PMID 29127256). This approach has previously been exploited to demonstrate that this set of Rab proteins are phosphorylated by LRRK2 in vivo (Lis et al., 2018). Immunoblot analysis of the pan-phospho-specific-Rab immunoprecipitates revealed that in addition to Rab10, phosphorylated forms of Rab8A and to a lower extent Rab35 were enriched in the PPM1H knock-out cell lines in comparison to wild-type (revised Figure 6C). We were unable to detect Rab3A or Rab43 in these studies, suggesting that the levels of the LRRK2 phosphorylated forms of these substrates are perhaps too low to easily detect in A549 cells. We also immunoblotted cell extracts with a phospho-antibody that specifically detects LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab12, revealing that LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab12 levels were similar in wild type and PPM1H knock-out cell extracts (revised Figure 6C). This study suggests that Rab12 phosphorylation may not be regulated by PPM1H, at least in A549 cells.</p><p>In addition, we subjected the pan-specific phospho-Rab immunoprecipitates to mass spectrometry analysis that confirmed significantly higher levels of Rab8 and Rab10 and to a lower extent Rab35 in samples immunoprecipitated from wild type compared to PPM1H knock-out cells (revised Figure 6D). We weakly detected Rab3A but its levels were very similar between wild type and PPM1H knock-out cells.</p><p>We have also expanded our analysis by which Rab proteins are dephosphorylated by LRRK2 in an overexpression analysis. We had previously shown that overexpressed PPM1H can dephosphorylate LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab3A, Rab8A, Rab10, Rab12, Rab35 and Rab43 but have now extended this panel to show that Rab3B, Rab3C, Rab3D and Rab8B are also dephosphorylated by overexpressed PPM1H (revised Figure 3B, Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A to 1H).</p></body></sub-article></article>
