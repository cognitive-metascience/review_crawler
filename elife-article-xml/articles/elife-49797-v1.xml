However, the factors that constitute these microtubule nucleation pathways and their mode of action still need to be identified. Using purified <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> proteins we biochemically reconstitute branching microtubule nucleation, which is critical for chromosome segregation. We found that besides the microtubule nucleator gamma-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), the branching effectors augmin and TPX2 are required to efficiently nucleate microtubules from pre-existing microtubules. TPX2 has the unexpected capacity to directly recruit γ-TuRC as well as augmin, which in turn targets more γ-TuRC along the microtubule lattice. TPX2 and augmin enable γ-TuRC-dependent microtubule nucleation at preferred branching angles of less than 90 degrees from regularly-spaced patches along microtubules. This work provides a blueprint for other microtubule nucleation pathways and helps explain how microtubules are generated in the spindle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>nucleation</kwd><kwd>branching</kwd><kwd>reconstitution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alfaro-Aco</surname><given-names>Raymundo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gilliam Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alfaro-Aco</surname><given-names>Raymundo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alfaro-Aco</surname><given-names>Raymundo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17PRE33660328</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thawani</surname><given-names>Akanksha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2GM123493-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petry</surname><given-names>Sabine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000008</institution-id><institution>David and Lucile Packard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-40376</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petry</surname><given-names>Sabine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The protein TPX2 and the protein complex augmin together recruit the microtubule nucleator γ-TuRC to a pre-existing microtubule where they initiate branching microtubule nucleation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microtubules are nucleated from specific locations in the cell, and several of these microtubule nucleation pathways converge to form a particular cytoskeletal architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kollman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lüders and Stearns, 2007</xref>). Importantly, microtubules in cells are nucleated by the microtubule nucleator γ-TuRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kollman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>) and its co-nucleation factor XMAP215 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Flor-Parra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gunzelmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thawani et al., 2018</xref>). At the same time, each microtubule nucleation pathway requires a unique set of nucleation effectors to recruit and regulate γ-TuRC at distinct cellular locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). The identity of most of these effectors remains elusive, along with a mechanistic understanding of how they constitute the different microtubule nucleation pathways that generate the cytoskeleton.</p><p>Microtubules can nucleate from pre-existing microtubules, termed branching microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Petry et al., 2013</xref>), which amplifies microtubule number while preserving their polarity, as is needed in the mitotic spindle and in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cunha-Ferreira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">David et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kamasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Petry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sánchez-Huertas et al., 2016</xref>). The eight-subunit protein complex augmin is required for branching microtubule nucleation in plant, human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, and meiotic Xenopus egg extract, where its depletion leads to reduced spindle microtubule density, less kinetochore fiber tension, metaphase arrest, and cytokinesis failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">David et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Decker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goshima et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayward et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kamasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lawo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nakaoka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Petry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Uehara et al., 2009</xref>). Augmin is necessary to recruit γ-TuRC to spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goshima et al., 2007</xref>), and following the recombinant expression of augmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hsia et al., 2014</xref>), this activity was confirmed using purified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Song et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In meiotic Xenopus egg extract, the Ran-regulated protein TPX2 is released near chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gruss et al., 2001</xref>), where it stimulates branching microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Petry et al., 2013</xref>), potentially by activating γ-TuRC via nucleation activator motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfaro-Aco et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, TPX2 was also observed to form a co-condensate with tubulin along the microtubule lattice, which enhances the kinetic efficiency of branching microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">King and Petry, 2019</xref>). In meiotic Xenopus egg extract, TPX2 needs to bind to microtubules before augmin/γ-TuRC to result in a successful nucleation event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Thawani et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, in mitotic <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells TPX2 is not required, and augmin can bind to microtubules before γ-TuRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Verma and Maresca, 2019</xref>). Despite these numerous studies to characterize each individual protein component, exactly how augmin, TPX2 and γ-TuRC together mediate branching microtubule nucleation, and whether they alone constitute a minimal system that nucleates branched microtubules, remains unclear. Here, we use biochemical reconstitution of its purified components to mechanistically dissect branching microtubule nucleation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Branching microtubule nucleation has been studied in Xenopus egg extract, where it is elicited by the constitutively active version of Ran (RanQ69L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Petry et al., 2013</xref>). In order to establish a controlled, minimal assay that furthers our mechanistic insight, we exposed a microtubule tethered to glass to sequential reaction mixtures of decreasing complexity and thereby regulated the availability of proteins necessary to stimulate branching microtubule nucleation. Using multicolor time-lapse total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy, we first confirmed that an endogenous, pre-existing microtubule can serve as a template for branching microtubule nucleation when exposed to Ran-supplemented extract that releases branching factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>).

To test this, Ran-regulated branching factors were allowed to bind to taxol-stabilized pre-existing microtubules in the presence of nocodazole, which inhibits new microtubule formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). When another extract reaction was subsequently added, new microtubules nucleated almost exclusively from pre-existing microtubules, indicating that Ran-regulated branching factors bind to microtubules independent of their successful nucleation reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, when RanQ69L was omitted and no branching factors were released in the second extract reaction, pre-existing microtubules simply elongated and branching microtubule nucleation was absent in the third reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>To further test whether these microtubule-bound branching factors are sufficient for generating branches, we reduced the complexity of our assay by introducing only purified tubulin and GTP in the third reaction step. Surprisingly, short branched microtubules nucleated from pre-existing microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), showing that upon binding of branching factors and γ-TuRC, tubulin is the only protein required to form new branched microtubules from the localized factors. Further addition of XMAP215 to the final tubulin reaction made the short branches grow longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This revealed that branched microtubules retained the polarity of the pre-existing microtubule, and new microtubules do not appear to nucleate from other branched microtubules, suggesting that the branching factors do not relocate between microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). Thus, solely the deposition of branching factors and γ-TuRC to the pre-existing microtubule determines branching architecture.</p><p>Because the key for branching microtubule nucleation is to target γ-TuRC along the length of a microtubule, we verified as a proof of concept that purified γ-TuRC, when tethered along the microtubule lattice via artificial linkers, can still nucleate microtubules, which indeed was the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Therefore, if all branching factors are known, it should be possible to reconstitute branching microtubule nucleation from a template microtubule using only purified components. To test this, we purified the essential proteins for branching microtubule nucleation in Xenopus egg extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Petry et al., 2013</xref>). The GFP-labeled eight-subunit <italic>X. laevis</italic> augmin holocomplex was co-expressed in insect cells and co-purified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Song et al., 2018</xref>), the native 2.2 MDa γ-TuRC was purified from Xenopus egg extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thawani et al., 2018</xref>), and GFP-TPX2 was expressed from <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">King and Petry, 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>).</p><p>First, we assessed how the nucleator γ-TuRC gets targeted along the microtubule lattice. Purified TPX2, augmin and γ-TuRC were added in various combinations to surface-bound, GMPCPP-stabilized microtubules and imaged via TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). γ-TuRC, visualized by a fluorescently-labeled antibody, bound along the length of microtubules in the presence of augmin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Song et al., 2018</xref>). Unexpectedly, TPX2 alone marginally increased the binding of γ-TuRC to microtubules compared to non-specific γ-TuRC binding. A higher amount of γ-TuRC was recruited all along the microtubule lattice in the presence of both TPX2 and augmin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Surprisingly, augmin and TPX2 formed distinct puncta on microtubules, where γ-TuRC was recruited. Using negative stain electron microscopy, we visualized this binding at higher resolution and indeed observed that γ-TuRC is recruited to regularly spaced patches, where it accumulates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Next, we tested whether the microtubule binding proteins augmin and TPX2 need to bind in a certain sequence. Surprisingly, microtubule-bound TPX2 increased the amount of augmin bound to the microtubule, whereas the presence of augmin did not change the level of bound TPX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). In sum, TPX2 has the unexpected capacity to directly recruit γ-TuRC as well as augmin, which in turn targets more γ-TuRC along the microtubule lattice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Binding of augmin, TPX2 and γ-TuRC to a template microtubule.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the experimental set-up.

New microtubules nucleate all along the template microtubule without any preference for the template’s plus- or minus-ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), likely because the template microtubule was fully available for simultaneous binding of branching factors in our assay set-up. Thus, there is no signature on the stabilized microtubule lattice that determines where a branch occurs, only that microtubule nucleation events occur from distinct TPX2/augmin puncta distributed along the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Multiple microtubules can be generated from the same puncta as resolved by light microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which presumably nucleate from neighboring γ-TuRCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Because both TPX2 and augmin were concurrently tagged with GFP, an unlabeled version of TPX2 was used to confirm that augmin was indeed present in the observed puncta on template microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>What does each protein contribute to branching microtubule nucleation? To test this, each purified factor was assessed alone for its nucleation potential from a template microtubule, combined in pairs and ultimately altogether. Notably, γ-TuRC is essential for branching microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). Despite the fact that TPX2 can recruit tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">King and Petry, 2019</xref>), it alone or together with augmin cannot nucleate branched microtubules. γ-TuRC can infrequently bind to the microtubule lattice on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), leading to rare nucleation events without TPX2 and augmin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). Not surprisingly, augmin and γ-TuRC can cause branching microtubule nucleation to a limited extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>), as augmin can directly recruit γ-TuRC to a pre-existing microtubule in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Song et al., 2018</xref>). Surprisingly, TPX2 and γ-TuRC can also cause branching microtubule nucleation to a similar extent as augmin and γ-TuRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). Although TPX2 only marginally recruits γ-TuRC to the microtubule lattice, its ability to form a co-condensate with tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">King and Petry, 2019</xref>), and to possibly activate γ-TuRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfaro-Aco et al., 2017</xref>), may facilitate γ-TuRC-dependent microtubule nucleation from a pre-existing microtubule.</p><p>Similar to the pattern observed when both TPX2 and augmin are present, augmin or TPX2 alone with γ-TuRC also form distinct puncta along the microtubule lattice, implying that augmin may have a similar mode of binding to the microtubule lattice as TPX2. However, fewer of these puncta actually nucleate branched microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). Importantly, only when augmin, TPX2 and γ-TuRC are present, branching microtubule nucleation occurs most often (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). Branched microtubules are preferentially formed in angles &lt; 90 degrees, with 0–15 degrees being the most common (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). This way, most branched microtubules maintain the same polarity as the mother microtubule, a hallmark of branching microtubule nucleation. The angle of microtubule branches did not drastically change when augmin or TPX2 were combined with γ-TuRC, only that augmin/γ-TuRC alone caused a higher proportion of shallow branch angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>).</p><p>A key question that we next addressed with this system is whether TPX2 and augmin merely act as localizing factors, or whether they indeed activate γ-TuRC at the branching nucleation sites. To test whether branching was specifically stimulated, we counted the number of non-branched microtubules nucleated in the reactions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. Reactions where γ-TuRC was present have approximately twice as many non-branched microtubules per field of view compared to the reactions where γ-TuRC was absent. Notably, the addition of TPX2 or augmin does not change the number of non-branched microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata4">Figure 3—source data 4</xref>). This suggests that the increase in branching microtubule nucleation by TPX2 and augmin is not just a result of increased microtubule nucleation overall, but specifically occurs from a pre-existing microtubule.</p><p>To more directly assess whether augmin or TPX2 increase the nucleation activity of γ-TuRC, we performed a microtubule nucleation assay in solution. Augmin did not enhance the nucleation activity of purified γ-TuRC in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Song et al., 2018</xref>). A low concentration of TPX2 (10 nM) did not enhance the nucleation activity of γ-TuRC either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). A higher concentration of TPX2 (50 nM) was also tested, but at this concentration and in the absence of pre-formed microtubules, TPX2 forms co-condensates with tubulin in solution that nucleate microtubules in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">King and Petry, 2019</xref>), which precludes the accurate assessment of γ-TuRC-mediated microtubule nucleation at higher concentrations. These nucleation experiments suggest that TPX2 and augmin do not activate γ-TuRC in solution. There remains the possibility that they increase the nucleation activity of γ-TuRC specifically when bound to a microtubule. To evaluate whether the increase in branching microtubule nucleation activity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> is larger than the increase in γ-TuRC binding in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> we calculated the ratio of branching to binding, and normalized it to the γ-TuRC only sample. Although the increase in branching when both TPX2 and augmin are present with γ-TuRC is marginally larger than what is expected from the increase in γ-TuRC localization alone, the difference is not statistically significant based on the current data.</p><p>Last, we tested whether branching microtubule nucleation is further enhanced by having XMAP215 present. Indeed, XMAP215 co-localizes to the template microtubule and appears to increase both microtubule nucleation rate and length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Exact quantification of this effect was not possible because branched microtubules were already formed before imaging was possible and microtubules quickly grew into each other, preventing the accurate identification of branching microtubule nucleation. Lastly, knowing that the binding sequence of TPX2 and augmin matters for maximum factor recruitment, does this have an effect on nucleation? Indeed, only when TPX2 was bound first and augmin/γ-TuRC second, a higher level of branching microtubule nucleation was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata5">Figure 3—source data 5</xref>).</p><p>Via an in vitro reconstitution, we demonstrate that the three factors TPX2, augmin and γ-TuRC are sufficient to cause branching microtubule nucleation and defined the roles of each protein. Although microtubule nucleation effectors alone, both as monomers or as phase-separated entities, can generate microtubules in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roostalu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Woodruff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">King and Petry, 2019</xref>), γ-TuRC is required for physiological microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kollman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thawani et al., 2018</xref>), and this reconstitution highlights the importance of including it when studying microtubule nucleation. Considered a poor nucleator, γ-TuRC that has been hypothesized to require activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lüders and Stearns, 2007</xref>). In our in vitro system, γ-TuRC’s activity could be tuned via the tubulin concentration and the presence of XMAP215. Assay conditions in which not all nucleation events occur at once were necessary in order to clearly identify and observe branching microtubule nucleation events and to differentiate them from microtubules growing over one another. Based on this, we could investigate the effect of TPX2 and augmin on the activity level of γ-TuRC. The microtubule nucleation capacity of γ-TuRC was not enhanced by TPX2 or augmin in solution, but these factors specifically enable γ-TuRC-dependent microtubule nucleation from a pre-existing microtubule. This can be explained if TPX2 and augmin act as localization factors, but there is also the possibility that they increase the nucleation activity of γ-TuRC specifically when bound to a microtubule. Our results do not conclusively support or rule our either of these models. In the future, single molecule and kinetic measurements along with structural studies are required to determine how exactly TPX2 and augmin interact with γ-TuRC, and whether they increase its activity to stimulate microtubule nucleation from a template microtubule.</p><p>Augmin can recruit γ-TuRC to the side of a pre-existing microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Song et al., 2018</xref>), which can subsequently nucleate branched microtubules. This may be reflective of cell types where TPX2 is not needed for branching microtubule nucleation, such as mitotic <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Verma and Maresca, 2019</xref>). Unexpectedly, TPX2 with γ-TuRC can also cause branching microtubule nucleation to a similar extent as augmin with γ-TuRC. This could be explained by our observation that TPX2 increases γ-TuRC localization to microtubules to a small extent. Additionally, it was recently shown that TPX2 can recruit tubulin to the lattice of a pre-existing microtubule by forming a co-condensate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">King and Petry, 2019</xref>), potentially making lattice-bound γ-TuRC more likely to nucleate branched microtubules. Finally, TPX2 contains γ-TuRC activator motifs that have been proposed to activate γ-TuRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfaro-Aco et al., 2017</xref>). All three of these functions may be the reason why TPX2, which recruited less γ-TuRC than augmin, subsequently caused γ-TuRC-dependent branching microtubule nucleation at a similar level as augmin. Besides operating via these three modes in the full reconstitution, TPX2 additionally recruits more augmin, which in turn can localize more γ-TuRC. Finally, TPX2 alone creates a slightly wider angle distribution of branches, than augmin alone and both factors together. Thus, by bridging the microtubule and γ-TuRC with a defined architecture based on its h-shaped structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hsia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Song et al., 2018</xref>), augmin may keep the angle variation in a more shallow range, which is critical for creating parallel structures that retain microtubule polarity as is necessary in the spindle and axons.</p><p>Although TPX2 + γ-TuRC or augmin + γ-TuRC can nucleate microtubules from a pre-existing microtubule in this purified system, both factors are required in Xenopus egg extract for branching microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Petry et al., 2013</xref>). This indicates that microtubule nucleation in a physiological environment is more stringently regulated. Another important difference is that while it is beneficial that TPX2 binds to microtubules before augmin in our in vitro reconstitution, TPX2 binding to microtubules is absolutely necessary for augmin/γ-TuRC binding and subsequent branching microtubule nucleation in Xenopus egg extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Thawani et al., 2019</xref>). This implies that TPX2 directly regulates augmin’s binding to microtubules in Xenopus egg extract, in a manner that still needs to be uncovered.</p><p>In summary, TPX2, augmin and γ-TuRC are required for efficient branching microtubule nucleation in vitro. Surprisingly, TPX2, despite being only a single protein amongst large multi-subunit complexes, lies at the very heart of controlling this reaction, as demonstrated in this purified in vitro system and in Xenopus egg extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Thawani et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, even though TPX2, augmin and γ-TuRC are sufficient to reconstitute the nucleation of branched microtubules in vitro, we cannot eliminate the possibility that other proteins are involved in additional regulation, such as the microtubule and augmin binding protein EML3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Mechanistic insight obtained from this work helps explain how microtubules are made within spindles to orchestrate chromosome segregation. It is analogous to the in vitro reconstitution of actin branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mullins et al., 1998</xref>), which paved the way to explain how the actin cytoskeleton supports cell locomotion. In this biochemical reconstitution, γ-TuRC was localized to a specific location, from which it nucleates a microtubule in vitro as it would occur in the cell. As such, this work serves as a platform to study how microtubule nucleation creates different microtubule architectures that support cell function. This approach presents a pioneering example for the biochemical reconstitution of other microtubule nucleation pathways or microtubule organizing centers. It also serves as a stepping-stone to reconstitute larger structures based on this microtubule nucleation pathway, such as the mitotic spindle.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cloning, expression and purification of proteins</title><p>DH5α <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (New England Biolabs, C2987I) were used for all cloning steps.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>All reviewers agree that the revisions have much improved the manuscript, but there are two remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance.</p><p>In the manuscript you argue that TPX2 and augmin are activation factors for γ-TuRC and not just localization factors. The evidence is that TPX2 and augmin do not activate γ-TuRC based nucleation away from the MT lattice, but do increase nucleation of branches from the MT lattice. However, this would actually be the definition of a localization factor, to give more nucleation from a specific location, without requiring activation. When comparing Figure 2C and 3E it seems that there is a stronger increase in branches (Figure 3E) than there is an increase in γ-TuRC on the lattice (Figure 2C). Given the size of the error and the spread of the data, is this a significant difference? At the very least it seems to be a small activation. We would like you to address this point more clearly in the paper. Also, if your conclusion is that the activation is indeed very small, you may want to consider changing the Abstract sentence &quot;TPX2 and augmin do not act as mere localization factors, but enable γ-TuRC-dependent microtubule nucleation at preferred branching angles of less than 90 degrees from regularly-spaced patches along microtubules.&quot; to &quot;TPX2 and augmin enable γ-TuRC-dependent microtubule nucleation at preferred branching angles of less than 90 degrees from regularly-spaced patches along microtubules.&quot;</p><p>We would also like to ask you to include the data shown in your rebuttal letter as part of Figure 3—figure supplement 2 (GFP-augmin, untagged TPX2 and γ-TuRC).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49797.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, this is a well written, timely manuscript that establishes the minimal molecular requirements for branching microtubule nucleation.

We addressed all of these comments and thereby generated an improved manuscript, as explained in more detail below. The new manuscript provides more insight into the mechanism of branching microtubule nucleation by addressing the activity level of γ-TuRC and the role of TPX2 and augmin in enabling microtubule nucleation from a pre-existing microtubule.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Validating the success of reconstitution requires knowing the efficiency of the reconstitution. If only a small fraction of the proteins is active, then the reconstitution may be incomplete.

We fully agree that this is an important issue that needs to be assessed and discussed.</p><p>First, the concentration of γ-TuRC added in each experiment along with the concentrations of the other proteins is now reported in each figure legend. In addition, a supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) was added, which displays SDS PAGE gels of the purified complexes and proteins, as well as a negative stain EM image of purified γ-TuRC that highlights the quality of the purified complexes.</p><p>Estimating the fraction of active γ-TuRC is a complex and challenging question that can be addressed at multiple levels.</p><p>i) The higher the tubulin concentration, the more γ-TuRCs will fire. However, when more γ-TuRCs fire, the smaller the time and “field of view” windows to observe that microtubules indeed branch as opposed to grow into/over a microtubule.</p><p>ii) Analogous to point (i), addition of XMAP215 visually increases the number of microtubule branches, suggesting that at least some of the γ-TuRCs that are not nucleating microtubules are in fact capable of doing so under more favourable conditions. However, this again makes the observation of true branches in space and time extremely difficult.</p><p>iii) In the negative stain EM images from Figure 2, we can see multiple γ-TuRCs recruited along the microtubule lattice and often to the same puncta on pre-existing microtubules. If we crudely compare the number of γ-TuRCs from these EM images with the number of microtubule branches in Figure 3, it is clear that most γ-TuRCs are not nucleating microtubules in our conditions. Again, these conditions are necessary to clearly observe branching microtubule nucleation take place and to differentiate it from other events.</p><p>iv) Last, because our native γ-TuRC purification cannot easily be equipped with a fluorescent tag, it is not possible to differentiate active versus non-active γ-TuRC using light microscopy. Even if that was possible, one could not exclude that the labeled γ-TuRC that did not fire is indeed fully intact and contains all subunits.</p><p>All of these points suggest that not all γ-TuRCs nucleate in these conditions. In fact, tuning the conditions so that microtubule nucleation by γ-TuRC, as well as spontaneous nucleation, is not happening all at once, e.g. by omitting XMAP215 and working at moderate tubulin concentrations, was necessary to make the findings reported in this manuscript. This is now clearly addressed both in the Results and in the Discussion section of the manuscript. We recognize that this comment is forming the basis of the next point (2), about whether TPX2 or augmin activate γ-TuRC, which we reply to below. Finally, it is possible that other proteins may be involved in increasing the efficiency of branching microtubule nucleation. We also better addressed this possibility in the discussion of the improved manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Do TPX2 and augmin merely function as recruitment factors or do they activate γ-TuRC at the branching nucleation sites? Figure 3 - video 1: It is evident that in the optimal branching nucleation mix with TPX2, augmin, and γ-TuRC, a large number of microtubules are nucleated spontaneously and not from the lattice of existing microtubules. Unfortunately, only branching events are quantified in Figure 3E. Is branching specifically stimulated or is there an overall increased nucleation activity, which may also explain more branches? γ-TuRC alone is generally considered a weak nucleator, so the obvious question is what activates γ-TuRC in these assays? This could also be tested in a regular nucleation assay (without preformed microtubules).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting these important questions. First, it is true that nonbranched microtubules form in the experiments described in Figure 3. Some of these microtubules are spontaneously generated in solution, as they grow from both ends and diffuse around. Others are nucleated by γ-TuRCs that are non-specifically bound to the glass surface, as these microtubules would not form without γ-TuRC, and they remain attached at the site of nucleation where only one end grows. We now quantified these non-branched microtubules and the graph is shown in a new Figure 3—figure supplement 3. The reactions that contain γ-TuRC have approximately twice as many non-branched microtubules, compared to the reactions where γ-TuRC is absent. This is expected if a significant proportion of the non-branched microtubules are nucleated by γ-TuRCs bound to the glass surface. Importantly, the addition of TPX2 or augmin does not change the number of non-branched microtubules. This means that the increase in branching microtubule nucleation by TPX2 and augmin is not a result of increased microtubule nucleation overall, but specifically by nucleating microtubules from pre-existing microtubules. This is now addressed in the Results section of Figure 3 in the manuscript and it represents a critical point that is also referred to in the Abstract and Discussion.</p><p>Second, to further address whether augmin or TPX2 increase the nucleation activity of γ-TuRC, we performed a microtubule nucleation assay in solution as suggested. The results are shown in a new Figure 3—figure supplement 3. Augmin did not enhance the nucleation activity of purified γ-TuRC in vitro consistent with a previous study (Song et al., 2018). We tested TPX2 at the same concentration (50 nM) that was used in the assays described in Figure 3. Unfortunately, at this concentration and in the absence of pre-formed microtubules, TPX2 forms co-condensates with tubulin and nucleates microtubules on its own (King and Petry, 2019). Because these microtubules grow close to each other and are subsequently fixed, it is not possible to count single microtubules. Additionally, quantifying tubulin intensity in this case is not useful because the TPX2 condensates recruit very high levels of tubulin (King and Petry, 2019). To circumvent this hurdle, we tested a lower TPX2 concentration (10 nM), at which TPX2 does not form co-condensates with tubulin. In this case, TPX2 alone did not enhance the nucleation activity of γ-TuRC.</p><p>Please note that we are in the process of developing a novel single molecules assay, in which individual γ-TuRCs are attached to the glass surface and can be observed nucleating microtubules live at the single molecule level (Thawani et al., in preparation). While this new assay belongs to its own story, and we could not include it in this <italic>eLife</italic> submission, we also find in this independent assay set-up that TPX2 in solution does not activate γ-TuRC.</p><p>These solution experiments, combined with the quantification of de novo microtubule nucleation, suggest that TPX2 and augmin are not mere localization factors and require a pre-existing microtubule to complete this reaction. We address this point in the Results section of these newly added experiments and come back to it in the edited Discussion, as well as the Abstract. Again, we thank you for pointing out this aspect that is critical for this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is hard to believe that TPX2 and γ-TuRC, without augmin, can induce branching nucleation, given that TPX2 has no ability to recruit γ-TuRC to existing microtubules (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). The authors show that the branch angle is slightly different from augmin-dependent nucleation (Figure 3F). Is this the only difference? The authors should investigate this peculiar phenomenon more thoroughly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. First, we repeated the experiment in Figure 2B-C more thoroughly with an important improvement. Before, the background fluorescence level was high, and we hypothesized that this could have masked the detection of γ-TuRC signal when only TPX2 was bound to the microtubule. Indeed, with an improved treatment of the glass surface, the background fluorescence could be reduced. Consequently, we could detect an increase in the level of γ-TuRC signal on microtubules when TPX2 was bound to the microtubule, compared to γ-TuRC alone. The difference is small, but statistically significant and reported in the updated Figure 2C and the respective Results section. This could contribute to the observed levels of branching microtubule nucleation with TPX2 and γ-TuRC alone. Additionally, it is known that TPX2 can recruit tubulin to the lattice of a pre-existing microtubule, potentially making the γ-TuRCs on the microtubule lattice more likely to nucleate new branched microtubules. Last, TPX2 contains γ-TuNA motifs, which have been proposed to activate γ-TuRC. All of these aspects are addressed in the Discussion section. Last, this also leads to a more concrete model of how TPX2 functions in the full reconstitution, which is now brought up in the discussion and nicely summarizes a model of branching microtubule nucleation.</p><p>Second, we do not see visual differences between the branched microtubules nucleated by TPX2 + γ-TuRC and by augmin + TPX2 + γ-TuRC, other than the angle distribution. We do see microtubule branches nucleated from distinct TPX2 puncta, similar to when both TPX2 and augmin are present together. This is now shown in the newly incorporated Figure 3—figure supplement 2. Also, we now address in the Discussion how augmin could contribute to a shallower angle distribution.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All reviewers agree that the revisions have much improved the manuscript, but there are two remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance.</p><p>In the manuscript you argue that TPX2 and augmin are activation factors for γ-TuRC and not just localization factors. The evidence is that TPX2 and augmin do not activate γ-TuRC based nucleation away from the MT lattice, but do increase nucleation of branches from the MT lattice. However, this would actually be the definition of a localization factor, to give more nucleation from a specific location, without requiring activation. When comparing Figure 2C and 3E it seems that there is a stronger increase in branches (Figure 3E) than there is an increase in γ-TuRC on the lattice (Figure 2C). Given the size of the error and the spread of the data, is this a significant difference? At the very least it seems to be a small activation. We would like you to address this point more clearly in the paper. Also, if your conclusion is that the activation is indeed very small, you may want to consider changing the Abstract sentence &quot;TPX2 and augmin do not act as mere localization factors, but enable γ-TuRC-dependent microtubule nucleation at preferred branching angles of less than 90 degrees from regularly-spaced patches along microtubules.&quot; to &quot;TPX2 and augmin enable γ-TuRC-dependent microtubule nucleation at preferred branching angles of less than 90 degrees from regularly-spaced patches along microtubules.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for prompting us to compare the binding of γ-TuRC versus the branching activity in order to assess whether this supports an activation mechanism or rather enhanced localization.</p><p>To evaluate whether the increase in branching microtubule nucleation activity in Figure 3E is larger than the increase in γ-TuRC binding in Figure 2C we calculated the ratio of branching to binding, and normalized it to the γ-TuRC only sample (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable1">Author response table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The increase in branching when both TPX2 and augmin are present with γ-TuRC is 4x higher than what is expected from the increase in γ-TuRC localization alone. This increase is 3x and 2x higher for TPX2 + γ-TuRC and augmin + γ-TuRC, respectively. However, the standard deviations associated with these ratios indicate relatively high variation in the data, particularly for γ-TuRC only, TPX2 γ-TuRC and augmin + γ-TuRC.</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="anchor"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Average Binding</th><th valign="top">Std Dev</th><th valign="top">Average Branching</th><th valign="top">Std Dev</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">gTuRC only</td><td valign="top">0.21294</td><td valign="top">0.14638</td><td valign="top">0.05715</td><td valign="top">0.04711</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">TPX2 + gTuRC</td><td valign="top">0.29349</td><td valign="top">0.18580</td><td valign="top">0.23863</td><td valign="top">0.09174</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">augmin + gTuRC</td><td valign="top">0.37321</td><td valign="top">0.22619</td><td valign="top">0.20415</td><td valign="top">0.14939</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">TPX2 + augmin + gTuRC</td><td valign="top">0.51905</td><td valign="top">0.26268</td><td valign="top">0.56789</td><td valign="top">0.14644</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Branching / Binding</td><td valign="top">Normalized Branching/Binding</td><td valign="top">Std Dev</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">gTuRC only</td><td valign="top">0.2684</td><td valign="top">1.0000</td><td valign="top">1.0733</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">TPX2 + gTuRC</td><td valign="top">0.8131</td><td valign="top">3.0293</td><td valign="top">2.2437</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">augmin + gTuRC</td><td valign="top">0.5470</td><td valign="top">2.0381</td><td valign="top">1.9365</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">TPX2 + augmin + gTuRC</td><td valign="top">1.0941</td><td valign="top">4.0763</td><td valign="top">2.3154</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49797-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We thoroughly looked into different tests to assess statistical significance, based on the instruction upon our inquiry on how to best address this issue. However, we could not identify one that would allow us to directly compare ratios of two means from entirely different distributions. This is because each mean, for binding and for branching, has an error associated with it, and the measurements are not paired. While we can propagate this error to get the standard deviation of the ratios, the ratio itself is a single value and there is no sample size associated with it. We inquired with multiple expert sources, including local quantitative and data experts, only to come back to this answer. If the reviewers can suggest a specific statistical test that would be appropriate for this scenario and would work on this sample size, we would very much appreciate it and would gladly calculate the significance.</p><p>The only way to apply statistical tests was by ignoring the error of one of the means.

A t-test using these values showed that the difference between γ-TuRC only and augmin + γ-TuRC is not significant at the 5% significance level. This would suggest that augmin does not increase branching microtubule nucleation beyond its increase in γ-TuRC recruitment. In contrast, the differences between γ-TuRC only and TPX2 + γ-TuRC, and γ-TuRC only and augmin + TPX2 + γ-TuRC, are significant at the 5% significance level.

Ignoring the other standard deviation yields that the differences are significant. In the case of γ-TuRC only vs augmin + γ-TuRC, ignoring either of the standard deviations yields that the difference are not significant. However, analogous to the t-test, because we are ignoring one of the standard deviations, we are not confident about making a conclusive statement regarding the ability of TPX2 or augmin to increase branching microtubule nucleation beyond their increase in γ-TuRC recruitment.</p><p>We believe that the question of whether TPX2 and/or augmin activate γ-TuRC on microtubules to initiate branching microtubule nucleation is very important, but taking into account the information presented above, we do not feel comfortable making a conclusive statement at this point. This is something that requires new experimentation at the single molecule level, and potentially structural insight of the branching factors bound to each other, which is outside the scope of this study. We made sure to clarify and explain our attempt to address this point in the Results section of the manuscript. We also comment on this again in the Discussion. As suggested, we also changed the language in the Abstract to avoid stating that TPX2 / augmin act as more than localization factors. We hope that these efforts adequately addressed your insightful suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We would also like to ask you to include the data shown in your rebuttal letter as part of Figure 3—figure supplement 2 (GFP-augmin, untagged TPX2 and γ-TuRC).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We agree that it is useful to include this data in the manuscript, and we created a new panel in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 to show this. To confirm, we had performed an additional experiment similar to the one described in Figure 3D with GFP-labeled augmin, but this time using an untagged version of TPX2. We see that augmin is present on the microtubule in puncta similar to the images where both augmin and TPX2 are concurrently labeled with GFP.</p></body></sub-article></article>
