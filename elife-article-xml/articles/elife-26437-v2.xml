Clonal sequencing and fluctuation tests have suggested that the influenza virus mutation rate is 2.7 × 10<sup>–6</sup> - 3.0 × 10<sup>–5</sup> substitutions per nucleotide per strand copied (s/n/r). However, sequencing assays are biased toward mutations with minimal fitness impacts and fluctuation tests typically investigate only a subset of all possible single nucleotide mutations. We developed a fluctuation test based on reversion to fluorescence in a set of virally encoded mutant green fluorescent proteins, which allowed us to measure the rates of selectively neutral mutations representative of the twelve different mutation types. We measured an overall mutation rate of 1.8 × 10<sup>–4</sup> s/n/r for PR8 (H1N1) and 2.5 × 10<sup>–4</sup> s/n/r for Hong Kong 2014 (H3N2) and a transitional bias of 2.7–3.6. Our data suggest that each replicated genome will have an average of 2–3 mutations and highlight the importance of mutational load in influenza virus evolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26437.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26437.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mutation rate</kwd><kwd>diversity</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI118886</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lauring</surname><given-names>Adam S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000862</institution-id><institution>Doris Duke Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSDA 2013105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lauring</surname><given-names>Adam S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007544</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pauly</surname><given-names>Matthew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new assay for specific mutational classes provides preciseestimates of the mutation rates and mutational bias for influenza A viruses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The rapid evolution of influenza virus has led to reduced vaccine efficacy, widespread drug resistance, and the annual emergence of novel strains. While complex ecological, environmental, and host demographic factors influence the evolutionary dynamics of influenza virus, the virus’ adaptability is driven in large part by its capacity to generate genetic diversity through mutation and reassortment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nelson and Holmes, 2007</xref>). Like other RNA viruses, influenza virus replicates with extremely low fidelity. The influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex, which includes the viral proteins PB1, PB2, PA, and NP, lacks proofreading and repair activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016</xref>). Its mutation rate has been reported to be approximately 10<sup>−5</sup> to 10<sup>−6</sup> mutations per nucleotide per cellular infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanjuán et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suárez-López and Ortín, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suárez et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nobusawa and Sato, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parvin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloom, 2014</xref>).</p><p>An accurate accounting of influenza virus’ mutation rate and mutational bias is essential for defining its evolutionary dynamics and for informing control efforts. The mutation rate will determine the probability that a mutation conferring drug resistance, antibody escape, or broadened host range will be generated within a given virus population. It will also define a virus’ sensitivity to drug-induced lethal mutagenesis, a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy that exploits the high mutation rate and low mutational tolerance of many RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bull et al., 2007</xref>). We have shown that the antiviral activity of three different nucleoside analogues is due to increased viral mutation rates, and a new anti-influenza drug, favipiravir, has been found to act through a similar mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pauly and Lauring, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baranovich et al., 2013</xref>). As in other RNA viruses, the mutational bias of the influenza polymerase complex is largely undefined. While viral mutation rates are typically reported as a single measurement, each of the 12 distinct nucleotide substitutions (for example, A to C, G to U) will have its own rate. The rates of these mutational classes will in turn determine the accessibility of various nucleotide and amino acid substitutions. Many RNA viruses appear to exhibit a pronounced bias toward transition mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanjuán et al., 2010</xref>). Because transitions are more likely to be synonymous than transversions, this bias can impact models of molecular evolution and inferences of natural selection based on dN/dS ratios.</p><p>Mutations are typically reported as either frequencies or rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanjuán et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belshaw et al., 2011</xref>). Mutation frequency is the number of mutations identified in a sample per nucleotide sequenced. Frequency measurements therefore quantify not only the rate at which a mutation is generated but also that mutation’s ability to persist in a population. In contrast, mutation rates measure how many mutations are made in a discrete unit of time (for example, per infection cycle or strand copied) and are a better representation of polymerase error. Viral mutation rates have often been measured by Sanger sequencing of randomly selected clones obtained through plaque purification or limiting dilutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tromas and Elena, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vignuzzi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eckerle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nobusawa and Sato, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parvin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloom, 2014</xref>). Mutation frequencies obtained in this manner can be converted to mutation rates by adjusting for the number of replication cycles prior to sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanjuán et al., 2010</xref>). With these adjustments, sequencing-based estimates of influenza virus mutation rates range from 7.1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> to 4.5 × 10<sup>−5</sup> substitutions per nucleotide per cell infection cycle. While sequencing approaches can potentially measure the rate of all mutational classes, they lack precision and have poor power for detecting differences across strains or conditions. They are also biased towards sampling of genomes with higher fitness. Next generation sequencing platforms have increased the throughput and power of clonal sequencing, but in many cases, the impact of reverse transcription error in library preparation has not been thoroughly investigated.</p><p>A more direct way to measure mutation rates is to use a Luria-Delbrück fluctuation test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luria and Delbrück, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koziol, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foster, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Furió et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Combe and Sanjuán, 2014</xref>). In this method, a large number of parallel cultures are infected with small inocula and assessed for a set of newly generated mutants exhibiting a scoreable phenotype after a period of exponential growth. Because the mutations are rare and random, they follow a Poisson distribution across cultures. Mutation rate estimates from a null class model are robust to the mode of replication, which may vary across viral species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foster, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Furió et al., 2005</xref>). Using resistance to monoclonal antibodies as a scoreable phenotype, influenza’s mutation rate has been estimated to be 2.7 × 10<sup>−6</sup> to 3.0 × 10<sup>−5</sup> substitutions per nucleotide per strand copied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suárez et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suárez-López and Ortín, 1994</xref>). While fluctuation tests are more precise than sequencing assays, most scoreable phenotypes sample just a few sites or mutational classes.</p><p>Here, we apply two new approaches for measuring the influenza virus mutation rate that overcome the drawbacks of sampling bias and low statistical power inherent to currently available methods. The first relies on measurements of the frequency of mutations to stop codons within a short segment of the influenza genome using PrimerID, an error-controlled next-generation sequencing approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jabara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Because these nonsense mutations are lethal and generally not propagated, their frequencies approximate the mutation rate in the prior replication cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cuevas et al., 2009</xref>). The second is a Luria-Delbrück fluctuation test that scores reversion to fluorescence in virally encoded green fluorescent protein (GFP) mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). The GFP method enabled interrogation of all 12 mutation classes independently and under distinct replication conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The vast majority of premature stop codons in RNA virus open reading frames are lethal and are therefore likely to have been generated during the previous replication cycle (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Visher et al., 2016</xref>]). Eighteen of the 61 sense codons are a single mutation away from a stop codon, and the frequency at which these nonsense mutational targets (NSMT) mutate to stop codons approximates the viral mutation rate. When combined with a highly accurate next generation sequencing approach, the NSMT method can provide rate estimates for eight mutational classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cuevas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cuevas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acevedo et al., 2014</xref>). We identified a 402 base fragment within the PA gene of A/Wisconsin/03/2007 H3N2 that contains a balanced distribution of 80 NSMT, and used the PrimerID method to sequence individual PA clones from an influenza population on the Illumina platform. PrimerID sequencing utilizes a library of barcoded reverse transcription primers to generate consensus sequences for each cDNA template, thereby controlling for the PCR or base-calling errors that plague many next generation sequencing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jabara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). The PrimerID method does not control for errors introduced during reverse transcription (RT), and the mutation rates of reverse transcriptases are similar to those of viral RNA dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanjuán et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In an attempt to distinguish RT errors from mutations introduced by the influenza RdRp, we compared PrimerID-NSMT estimates of the mutation rate for influenza virus to a control, in which the segment 3 (PA) RNA was expressed from a plasmid pol I promoter in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoffmann et al., 2000</xref>). Mutations identified in the viral genome are derived from either the influenza RdRp or RT, and the control establishes the background error rate of the assay due to pol I transcription and RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We obtained over 449,000 aligned PA fragment consensus sequences for each sample, representing approximately 75% of starting RNA templates. The frequencies of mutations to stop codons were similar for 5 of the 8 mutation classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The frequencies of the other three mutation classes (A to U, C to A, and U to G) were only slightly higher in the samples derived from RNA replicated by the influenza RdRp than those that were not. The G to A mutation rate was highest in both samples (1.3 × 10<sup>−4</sup> and 8.5 × 10<sup>−5 </sup>substitutions per nucleotide for cell-derived and viral-derived samples, respectively), and analyses of the RT mutational spectrum consistently show this to be the most common mutation, with rates of 1 × 10<sup>−4</sup> substitutions per nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gout et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mansky and Temin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holtz and Mansky, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cuevas et al., 2015</xref>). These data demonstrate that the background error rate of reverse transcriptase during sample preparation is equal to or higher than the rate of mutations introduced by the influenza RdRp.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26437.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Influenza mutation rates by PrimerID next generation sequencing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Segment 3 (PA) RNA was isolated from either cells transfected with pol I expression plasmids or cell-free supernatants of cells infected with influenza virus. These RNA were reverse transcribed with barcoded PrimerID primers and amplified by PCR for sequencing as described in the methods. We obtained 449,655 PrimerID consensus sequences for the plasmid-derived RNA sample and 481,286 consensus sequences for the virus-derived RNA sample. (<bold>B</bold>) The frequencies of mutations to stop codons in pol I transcribed RNA (open circles) and virus-derived RNA (filled circles) were determined by dividing the number of stop codon mutations across the consensus sequences by the total number of nonsense mutation target (NSMT) sites analyzed.

Mutations in the transfected control were evenly distributed across the PA fragment and no more common than the subset of mutations to stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, the frequency of mutations in the replicated viral RNA was higher than the subset of stop codon mutations. The accumulation of mutations to frequencies above those of the stop codon mutations and the background signal indicate the action of selection on newly generated mutations. Together, these data suggest that the high background error rate of reverse transcriptase and issues of selection bias may confound sequencing-based measurements of the basal mutation rate and mutational bias of riboviruses.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>A fluorescence-based fluctuation test</title><p>We developed a Luria-Delbrück fluctuation test for influenza virus mutation rates that scores reversion to fluorescence in a set of 12 virally-encoded mutant green fluorescent proteins (GFP). The fluorescent chromophore of enhanced GFP contains three essential amino acids (T65, Y66, and G67) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2010</xref>), and nonsynonymous substitution at any of these positions results in a GFP with either absent or altered fluorescent properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Timerghazin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakano et al., 2002</xref>). We used a plasmid that contains GFP instead of hemagglutinin on influenza A virus segment 4 (ΔHA-GFP, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martínez-Sobrido et al., 2010</xref>]), to generate a set of 12 derivatives that each encode a mutant GFP protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Each of these mutant GFP proteins has a single nucleotide mutation that, with reversion to fluorescence, will interrogate a specific mutational class introduced by the viral RdRp during viral replication. Influenza viruses expressing these mutant GFP proteins from a genomic context were rescued from cells co-transfected with each construct as well as 7 additional plasmids that express the remaining 7 genomic segments and the viral proteins encoded by each. Because these ΔHA-GFP viruses express GFP rather than HA, they were replicated in cells stably expressing the HA protein in trans.

We performed an in silico analysis of the ΔHA-GFP RNA to further exclude the possibility that reversion of mutations could be influenced by local RNA structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

For each of the 12 mutant ΔHA-GFP, we infected parallel cultures of MDCK-HA cells with mutant ΔHA-GFP viruses and transferred replicated virus to MDCK cells in a 96-well imaging plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The replication time and transfer volume were empirically determined for each mutation class, drug, temperature, and virus tested to yield approximately 10<sup>4</sup> infectious viruses in the transfer population. Because the ΔHA-GFP viruses do not express the HA protein, they only replicate in MDCK-HA cells, and there was no viral spread in the imaging plate. The kinetics and intensity of GFP expression are driven by the ability of the replicated viruses to infect cells on the imaging plate, replicate their RNA and express GFP protein. Expression is independent of whether a given genome coding for a green GFP was generated early or late in the replication plate. We used a null class model to calculate mutation rates based on the number of parallel cultures without a revertant in the imaging plate (green fluorescence) and the degree of viral replication (anti-GFP antibody staining of the inocula and replicated virus). Importantly, the null class model relies on the number of cultures with any revertant virus, as opposed to the absolute number of revertant viruses. Because the actual number of infectious cycles is irrelevant to the calculation of mutation rates, the null class model further removes any bias attributable to mutations generated early or late in the replication plate. The mutation rates we report using this method are in the coding (+) sense of the RNA, rather than the genomic (-) sense.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26437.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Fluorescent Luria-Delbruck fluctuation test.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) General workflow for measuring the mutation rate using mutant ΔHA-GFP viruses.

We cloned a circulating seasonal influenza virus, influenza A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 H3N2 (Hong Kong 2014), into the 8 plasmid reverse genetic system after limited passage in MDCK. After transfection, the rescued PR8 virus contained the ΔHA-GFP segment with seven PR8 genome segments. The rescued Hong Kong 2014 virus contained the ΔHA-GFP segment, the segments coding for the polymerase complex – PB2, PB1, PA, and NP – from A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 H3N2, and the segments encoding NA, M, and NS from PR8. This chimera was necessary to obtain high titer stocks.</p><p>The mutation rates of the PR8 and Hong Kong 2014 viruses were higher than previously reported for influenza A virus and generally biased toward transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parvin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nobusawa and Sato, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloom, 2014</xref>).

The rates for the other two transitions (C to U and G to A) were approximately six fold lower and similar to the rates of the more common transversion mutations. We note that this G to A mutation rate is much lower than the rate estimated using the PrimerID-NSMT assay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This discrepancy may reflect differences in mutational bias between the influenza RdRp and retroviral reverse transcriptases. The overall rate and spectrum of mutations for the PR8 and Hong Kong 2014 viruses are very similar, and given the base composition of each virus, we estimate that each replicated 13.5 kb genome contains, on average, 2 to 3 mutations. The transition to transversion ratio is 2.7 in PR8 and 3.6 in Hong Kong 2014.</p><p>We did identify differences between the two viruses in specific mutation classes. The rate of G to A mutations was two-fold higher in Hong Kong 2014 than in PR8 (7.2 × 10<sup>−5</sup> vs. 3.1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, p=0.0018, multiple t-test with Holm-Sidak correction), and the Hong Kong 2014 virus also exhibited a marginally increased rate of G to U mutations that was not statistically significant (6.0 × 10<sup>−5</sup> vs. 3.5 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, p=0.083). For both viruses, the rates of mutations away from A are symmetrical to the reciprocal mutations away from U. Interestingly, mutations away from C were much less common than the reciprocal mutations away from G. In PR8 G nucleotides are 3.8 times more likely to mutate than C nucleotides.

This assay can be easily adapted to any virus that tolerates the addition of the GFP open reading frame. While PR8 (H1N1) and Hong Kong 2014 (H3N2) viruses varied in their mutation rates for individual classes, the overall mutation rate was consistent across these evolutionarily divergent influenza polymerases at a range of temperatures. These mutation rates are considerably higher than previously reported, and given the impact of mutational load, suggest that the virus is replicating at the maximally tolerable mutation rates.</p><p>Sequencing assays for viral mutation rates are plagued by ascertainment and sampling biases. The mutations that are detected in plaque-derived populations represent only the viable fraction and those identified in passaged supernatants are often heavily biased toward mutations with less deleterious fitness effects. While Sanjuan and colleagues have appropriately adjusted for typical viral mutational fitness effects in sequence-based estimates of mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanjuán et al., 2010</xref>), these fitness effects may not be uniform across viruses or in the genes analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanjuán, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Visher et al., 2016</xref>). Next generation sequencing can minimize these biases by improving the detection of rarer, more deleterious mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geller et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cuevas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Combe et al., 2015</xref>). However, our data from PrimerID-controlled next generation sequencing suggest that reverse transcriptase error can be a significant confounder that needs to be considered in studies of RNA viruses. In our experiments, the high background RT error rate made it difficult to distinguish mutations introduced by the influenza polymerase complex from those generated during reverse transcription of the viral genomic RNA. The mutational bias of RT may also differ from that of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Guanine to adenine transitions are the most common mutation made by RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gout et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mansky and Temin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holtz and Mansky, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cuevas et al., 2015</xref>) and are the ones found most frequently in our study as well as many others that rely on RT-PCR amplification for sequencing (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crotty et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pauly and Lauring, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Presloid et al., 2016</xref>]). In contrast, our fluctuation test suggests that A to G and U to C mutations are the most common classes in influenza.</p><p>Fluctuation tests are sensitive for rare mutational events and avoid many of the issues with sequencing assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luria and Delbrück, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foster, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Furió et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Combe and Sanjuán, 2014</xref>). Our reversion to fluorescence assay has several additional advantages over ones that rely on phenotypic markers such as drug or antibody resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). First, the marker was selectively neutral, as the mutant GFP and revertant wild type GFP viruses had equal fitness. Second, we were able to measure all 12 mutational classes in a format that allowed for sufficient replicates. Third, we were able to control the number of cellular infection cycles by expressing the HA protein in trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martínez-Sobrido et al., 2010</xref>). Fourth, we used an anti-GFP antibody to measure the number of mutation targets directly. One shortcoming of all fluctuation tests is that genomic mutation rates are extrapolated from data at one specific site. While RNA structures are unlikely to play a major role in mutation rate variability in influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016</xref>), we cannot exclude that sequence context could modulate mutation rates across the genome. For example, influenza and other RNA viruses can exhibit bias in their dinucleotide content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belalov and Lukashev, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greenbaum et al., 2008</xref>), and it is not clear whether the bases preceding a site can influence local nucleotide misincorporation rates.</p><p>We found that the mutation rates of the lab adapted PR8 H1N1 strain are similar to those of a recently circulating H3N2 strain, and both sets of measurements are considerably higher than those obtained in previous sequence-based studies. While these earlier works estimated rates between 7.1 × 10<sup>−6 </sup>and 4.5 × 10<sup>−5</sup> mutations per nucleotide per cell infection, our composite mutation rates were 1.8 × 10<sup>−4</sup> and 2.5 × 10<sup>−4</sup> mutations per nucleotide per strand replicated for PR8 (H1N1) and Hong Kong/2014 (H3N2), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parvin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nobusawa and Sato, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloom, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanjuán et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with the biases detailed above, our measurements are closer to those obtained for specific classes in antibody-based fluctuation tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suárez et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suárez-López and Ortín, 1994</xref>). These very high mutation rates mean that each replicated genome has, on average, 2–3 mutations. We have found that 28–31% of randomly selected mutations in influenza virus are lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Visher et al., 2016</xref>). Using a 70% probability that a given mutation results in a viable virus, the likelihood of any given genome being able to replicate is only 34% to 49%. We suggest that mutational load accounts for a sizable portion of the 90–99% of genomes in influenza populations that are non-infectious (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baranovich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pauly and Lauring, 2015</xref>]). This mutation rate clearly places influenza close to a theoretical maximum rate, and we and others have shown that small increases in the virus’ mutation rate lead to considerable losses in genome infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baranovich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pauly and Lauring, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Cellular replication environments are often hypothesized to influence RNA virus mutation rates, and yet these effects have rarely been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pita and Roossinck, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diamond et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holtz and Mansky, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Combe and Sanjuán, 2014</xref>). Here, we found no significant differences in rates of the five most common mutational classes across a seven degree range of physiologic temperatures. Nucleotide pools could potentially influence the observed mutational biases. Intracellular concentrations of nucleotide triphosphates are much higher than those of deoxynucleotides, and cellular pools are typically biased towards ATP and GTP, which have other metabolic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Traut, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stridh, 1983</xref>). While it is tempting to speculate that pool bias could lead to the observed asymmetry in mutations away from guanine, this is unlikely to be the case in MDCK cells. The concentrations of all four NTP in MDCK cells are at least ten fold higher than the K<sub>m</sub> of the influenza polymerase for each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggarwal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stridh, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). We can’t exclude that biases in pools could play a role in primary cells where NTPs may be more limiting. However, Combe and Sanjuan found that VSV mutation rates were similar across a range of primary and immortalized cell lines that were cultured under a range of conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Combe and Sanjuán, 2014</xref>). It is also intriguing that A to G and U to C were the most common mutations, as these classes are characteristic of the host enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samuel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bass, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">tenOever et al., 2007</xref>). As ADAR-editing occurs almost exclusively on double stranded RNA, it is not clear that it would contribute to the mutation rates measured on our presumably unstructured GFP messages.</p><p>We expect that our data will lead to improved models of influenza evolution. For example, our estimates of the virus’ transition to transversion bias can inform null models for inference of selection in protein coding genes. The availability of a complete nucleotide substitution matrix will also enable studies of selection on codon usage and dinucleotide content. The nucleotide frequencies of both PR8 (H1N1) and Hong Kong 2014 (H3N2) are far from what would be predicted by the 12 mutation rates. This suggests either that selection is maintaining the virus’ nucleotide content away from the mutational equilibrium or that the virus has not had sufficient time to achieve it. Finally, our measurements for the rate of each mutation class, coupled with recent studies on mutational fitness effects in influenza will also greatly improve our ability to construct more accurate phylogenies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Viruses, plasmids, and cells</title><p>Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were provided by Arnold S.

Total cellular RNA was isolated using Trizol (Life Technologies 15596) from 293 T cells 48 hr after transfection with a plasmid expressing A/Wisconsin/03/2007 H3N2 segment 3 (PA). Virus RNA was isolated using Trizol from cell free supernatants of MDCK cells infected with A/Wisconsin/03/2007 H3N2 virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 for 24 hr. In both cases, the RNA was treated with DNase I (Roche 04716728001, Indianapolis, IN) to remove residual plasmid DNA. The copy number of segment 3 (PA) RNA in each sample was determined by reverse transcription with SuperScript III (Invitrogen 18080051, Waltham, MA) and primer 5’-AGCAAAAGCAGG-3’ followed by quantitative PCR on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA) with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems 4367659) and primers 5’-TCTCCCATTTGTGTGGTTCA-3’ and 5’-TGTGCAGCAATGGACGATTT-3’. A plasmid encoding PA was used to generate a standard curve to relate cycle threshold to copy number.

Because the RNA copy number was just one-fifth of the total number of barcode sequences, it is unlikely that the same barcode would prime multiple complementary DNA (cDNA) molecules. Three separate reverse transcription reactions were performed for RNA harvested from both transfected and infected cells to increase the total number of RNA templates in the experiment. The resulting PrimerID barcoded cDNA was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter A63881, Indianapolis, IN) to remove residual primers. The purified cDNA was amplified by PCR for 26 cycles (10 s at 98°C, 30 s at 69°C, and 30 s at 72°C) using Phusion high fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs M0530, Ipswich, MA) and primers 5’-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT &lt; i7 &gt; AGTCAGTCAGTATGGGGCTACGTCCTCTCCAA-3’ and 5’-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC &lt; i5 &gt; TATGGTAATTGGCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3’, where i5 and i7 are 8 base Illumina indexing sequences. These primers contain the Illumina flow cell adapters at their 5’-ends. Unique index primers were used in the PCR for each of the three RT replicates. Products were gel purified using a GeneJET Gel extraction kit (Thermo Scientific K0691, Waltham, MA) and replicates were pooled with each product at 1.5 ng/μL.

The imaging plates were maintained at 37°C for the 14 hr after the supernatant transfer.</p><p>The mutational transition to transversion ratio was calculated as sum of the rates of the 4 transition classes divided by the sum of the rates of the 8 transversion classes. This metric describes the relative likelihood of any new mutation being a transition as opposed to a tranversion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by a Clinician Scientist Development Award from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation (CSDA 2013105) and R01 AI118886, both to ASL.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Karla Kirkegaard (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Claus O Wilke (Reviewer #3).</p><p>There are many recent papers that discuss the mechanisms and consequences of the high error rates of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. This is one of the most thoughtful. The reported mutational frequencies and rates of mutation during RNA viral replication have been estimated previously by various methods, most fraught with assumptions that reduce the usefulness of the measurement.</p><p>Summary</p><p>In this manuscript, the error frequencies observed following plasmid-based expression with that of RNA replication-based expression were determined. Two approaches are described to determine and subsequently to remove any bias concerning fitness of mutated RNAs. In the first approach, only mutations that gave rise to stop codons by a single mutational event were assessed. Few differences were observed in the absence and presence of the function of the influenza virus polymerase. This attests to the well-known high error rate of reverse transcriptase, which confounds any analysis of previous mutational events. Here is where the authors should first mention the CirSeq approach of Acevado et al.,2014, which the present manuscripts cleverly illustrates is not sufficient for avoiding pressures of selection. Indeed, it is shown here that there is post-mutational selection for certain classes of mutations that are not dead-end mutations like the creation of a stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This illustrates the necessity of not only removing RT error from calculated misincorporation, but also any selection pressure, including ongoing RNA replication within the cell after the mutational event has occurred.</p><p>The second approach relies upon a gene which does not provide a fitness advantage or disadvantage to the virus – eGFP. Although previous work assessed the mutation rates of influenza A virus as between 3 x 10-6 and 3 x 10-5, the present study results in a revised mutation rate of about 2 x 10-4. Consequently replication of the eight-segment genome should result in approximately three mutations per cycle of replication. In these experiments, selection is controlled by monitoring the gain of GFP fluorescence from modified viral genomes that encode GFP proteins that are one nucleotide away from function. Care is taken in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> to ensure that none of the mutations adds a fitness cost to the survival of the viral construct. These great experiments form the heart of the paper. Unfortunately, the reader is not provided with enough information to understand them well. At least, a curious but non-specialized reader cannot, and needs more description of the virological methods, statements of assumptions, and tests to see if those assumptions are valid, as described below.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We hope you will be able to submit the revised version within two months. Please address the questions below in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers agree that there is insufficient evidence presented to distinguish between a 'stamping' model and others with a larger number of replicative events. The Discussion that begins in subsection “The mutation rates of influenza A virus” paragraph four is not backed up by data that the reviewer can access, and the conclusions of stamping vs. binary replication modes are sufficiently important that, unless more data are provided, this section should be deleted.</p><p>2) The virology presented here is complicated and well-designed. <italic>eLife</italic> has a wide audience that would benefit from more detailed explanation about the multiple-plasmid transfection to recover virus, the DeltaHA construct that then needs to be passaged in an HA-expressing line, etc. These details are in the Materials and methods, which is fine, but there are points that are relevant for the interpretation of the data. After transfection, for example, how long does it take for the first infectious cycle to complete? Is the 24-hour time point one such cycle?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, which mutant DeltaHA viruses are analyzed? Are the error bars because it is all mutant viruses, and is wild-type DeltaHA included? This experiment needs to be clarified.</p><p>4) Subsection “A fluorescence-based fluctuation test” The phrase &quot;high minimum free energy&quot; will confuse some non-physical chemists. Perhaps 'suggests that the mutations are not located in highly stable RNA secondary structures' would be more helpful for making the point.</p><p>5) Several improvements in clarity will improve the accessibility of the manuscript. For example, the 12 mutational classes are never defined. It would be good to do so in a few words (e.g., &quot;all possible different single-nucleotide mutations&quot;). The terminology of &quot;missense&quot; and &quot;nonsense&quot; mutations, while conventional, implies value statements. Greater clarity would be provided by &quot;non-synonymous&quot; and &quot;mutation to stop codon&quot;. Note that the manuscript is somewhat inconsistent and uses both.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26437.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) All reviewers agree that there is insufficient evidence presented to distinguish between a 'stamping' model and others with a larger number of replicative events.

We also feel that the novelty of the manuscript lies elsewhere. Therefore, we have deleted the section of the Results and Discussion that deal with this question.</p><p> <italic>2) The virology presented here is complicated and well-designed. eLife has a wide audience that would benefit from more detailed explanation about the multiple-plasmid transfection to recover virus, the DeltaHA construct that then needs to be passaged in an HA-expressing line, etc. These details are in the Materials and methods, which is fine, but there are points that are relevant for the interpretation of the data. After transfection, for example, how long does it take for the first infectious cycle to complete? Is the 24-hour time point one such cycle?</italic> </p><p>We have added additional text in the Results, subsection “A fluorescence-based fluctuation test” to clarify how we used the 8 plasmid reverse genetics system to rescue recombinant viruses expressing GFP from transfected cells. We also clarified how these GFP viruses are only propagated on MDCK cells expressing HA in trans and how the use of non-HA expressing MDCK in the imaging plate allowed for infection, but not subsequent spread of GFP viruses.</p><p>With respect to the timing of the infectious cycle, we should be clear that none of the fluctuation tests were initiated with transfection. We used transfection of plasmids to rescue recombinant virus. This recombinant virus is a passage 0 (P0) stock. We then used this to infect cells and make a passage 1 (P1) stock, which was used for experiments. We usually harvest our P0 stocks ~ 48 hours after transfection. There is likely some degree of viral replication that takes place in this time period, but we have never quantified it.</p><p>We know from one step growth curves that the infectious cycle of PR8 is approximately 12-14 hours. Not surprisingly, the GFP virus grows slower (~17 hours), see for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. As indicated in the text, the timing of transfer from the replication plate to the imaging plate was determined empirically for each GFP virus (17-24 hours at 37˚C) to ensure an adequate Nf population size (both for adequate fluorescent imaging and to target a P<sub>0</sub> in the 0.1-0.7 range). Importantly, the number of infectious cycles on the replication plate is irrelevant to calculation of mutation rates using the null class model for fluctuation tests. The key parameters with respect to growth are the starting population (Ni) and the post-replication population size (Nf).</p><p>The imaging plate was fixed at 14 hours post infection. This time point was chosen as it was sufficient to allow for infection and expression of GFP from the genome of the transferred viruses used to infect the plate.</p><p>We have clarified these elements of experimental design in the Results section as above and in subsection “The mutation rates of influenza A virus”.</p><p> <italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, which mutant DeltaHA viruses are analyzed? Are the error bars because it is all mutant viruses, and is wild-type DeltaHA included? This experiment needs to be clarified.</italic> </p><p>This experiment had 4 replicates of the C-U mutant ΔHA-GFP virus and 4 replicates of the U-A mutant ΔHA-GFP viruses virus in the PR8 genetic backbone. The error bars are standard deviation for 8 replicates. We have clarified this in the figure legend “Data shown are the cumulative mean and standard deviations for 4 measurements at each time point for each of two mutant ΔHA-GFP viruses (C to U and U to A viruses). Each point is the therefore the mean ± standard deviation for 8 values.” We note that the fitness values derived from competition assay for 6 mutant ΔHA-GFP viruses are a better measurement of growth relative to the “wild type” ΔHA-GFP virus.</p><p> <italic>4) Subsection “A fluorescence-based fluctuation test” The phrase &quot;high minimum free energy&quot; will confuse some non-physical chemists. Perhaps 'suggests that the mutations are not located in highly stable RNA secondary structures' would be more helpful for making the point.</italic> </p><p>This is a good point. We have changed the wording as suggested, subsection “A fluorescence-based fluctuation test”.</p><p> <italic>5) Several improvements in clarity will improve the accessibility of the manuscript. For example, the 12 mutational classes are never defined. It would be good to do so in a few words (e.g., &quot;all possible different single-nucleotide mutations&quot;). The terminology of &quot;missense&quot; and &quot;nonsense&quot; mutations, while conventional, implies value statements. Greater clarity would be provided by &quot;non-synonymous&quot; and &quot;mutation to stop codon&quot;. Note that the manuscript is somewhat inconsistent and uses both.</italic></p><p>We have changed “12 mutational classes” to “all possible single nucleotide mutations” and “the twelve different mutation types” in the Abstract. We then define mutational classes more clearly at the first instance in the Introduction.</p><p>We have changed most of the “nonsense” references to “stop codons.” We have kept the term “nonsense mutational targets (NSMT)” as it has been used in the mutation rate literature and is more concise than “codons that are one mutation away from a stop codon.”</p><p>We verified that we were similarly consistent with non-synonymous and avoided the use “missense” throughout.</p></body></sub-article></article>
