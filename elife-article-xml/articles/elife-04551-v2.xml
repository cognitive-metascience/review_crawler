Inputs to proximal dendrites usually produce large somatic EPSPs that efficiently trigger action potential (AP) output, whereas inputs to distal dendrites are greatly attenuated and may largely modulate AP output. In contrast to most other cortical and hippocampal neurons, hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons show unusually strong excitation by their distal dendritic inputs from entorhinal cortex (EC). In this study, we demonstrate that the ability of these EC inputs to drive CA2 AP output requires the firing of local dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes. Furthermore, we find that CA2 dendritic geometry contributes to the efficient coupling of dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes to AP output. These results provide a striking example of how dendritic spikes enable direct cortical inputs to overcome unfavorable distal synaptic locale to trigger axonal AP output and thereby enable efficient cortico-hippocampal information flow.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04551.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04551.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04551.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells called neurons carry information—in the form of electrical signals—around the brain. These cells connect to each other in complex networks and each neuron is able to form junctions, or synapses, with many neighbors. In a neuron, small electrical signals start from synapses at the tips of branched structures called dendrites. From there, these signals travel to the cell body of the neuron to activate a larger electrical signal—called an action potential—that travels along a long tail-like extension, called the axon, to reach synapses with other neurons.</p><p>In the dendrites, the small electrical signals can be amplified by rapid changes in the concentration of sodium ions, known as Na<sup>+</sup> spikes. Although they were first recorded over 40 years ago, it is not clear how important the Na<sup>+</sup> spikes are for triggering action potentials.</p><p>In this study, Sun et al. studied a type of neuron in the hippocampus called CA2 pyramidal neurons, which are involved in social memory and aggression. Unlike most other neurons in this region, CA2 neurons are strongly activated by signals from a neighboring region of the brain called the entorhinal cortex. The experiments show that Na<sup>+</sup> spikes are able to travel from the dendrites to the cell body of these neurons, where they are required to trigger action potentials. However, this is not the case for other neurons in the hippocampus, where the Na<sup>+</sup> spikes are very weak by the time they reach the cell body.</p><p>Sun et al. used a computational modeling technique to compare the different types of neurons in the hippocampus. The dendrites of these cells have different branching patterns and shapes, and the model suggests that this may explain the differences in how well the Na<sup>+</sup> spikes travel to the cell body. The next major challenge is to understand the role of the Na<sup>+</sup> spikes in social memory and other complex behaviors that are controlled by CA2 neurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04551.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04551.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>dendritic excitability</kwd><kwd>action potential</kwd><kwd>dendritic spike</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siegelbaum</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH104602-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siegelbaum</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the hippocampus, dendritic Na <sup>+</sup> spikes are required for signals from the entorhinal cortex to drive action potentials in CA2-but not CA1 or CA3-pyramidal neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The active properties of neuronal dendrites are important for integrating and processing excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnston et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">London and Hausser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnston and Narayanan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Major et al., 2013</xref>). Over the past few decades, dendritically generated Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and NMDA spikes have been identified in many types of neurons, both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Llinas et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wong et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stuart and Sakmann, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schiller et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stuart et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamondi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larkum et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waters et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larkum et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). One proposed function of dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes is to amplify synaptic potentials and facilitate somatic AP initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hausser et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">London and Hausser, 2005</xref>). However, in most instances, dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes propagate poorly to the soma and so fail to act as reliable triggers of somatic APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stuart and Sakmann, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stuart et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Golding and Spruston, 1998</xref>). Indeed, under physiological conditions, the APs in most principal neurons, including neocortical layer 5 and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs), are usually initiated at the axonal initial segment (AIS) before back-propagating to the dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stuart and Sakmann, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stuart et al., 1997a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Golding and Spruston, 1998</xref>). Thus, whereas dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes can fine-tune neuronal output and regulate synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Golding et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ariav et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jarsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Remy and Spruston, 2007</xref>), it is less certain whether these spikes may serve as necessary events to allow synaptic input to trigger AP output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hausser et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spruston, 2008</xref>). In this study, we report that dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes play an important role in the ability of hippocampal CA2 PNs to generate axonal AP output in response to synaptic input from the direct entorhinal cortical (EC) projections that terminate on CA2 PN distal dendrites.</p><p>Hippocampal CA2 PNs represent a relatively small population of cells interspersed between CA3 and CA1. Nonetheless, these neurons have recently been shown to be crucial for social memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stevenson and Caldwell, 2014</xref>) and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pagani et al., 2014</xref>). CA2 PNs also have unique synaptic properties that distinguish them from their CA1 and CA3 neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeVito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simons et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones and McHugh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caruana et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>). Thus, whereas the perforant path (PP) inputs from the EC form weak excitatory synaptic connections at the distal dendrites of CA1 PNs located in stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM), PP inputs to CA2 PNs provide a much stronger excitatory drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</xref>). In contrast the Schaffer collateral (SC) inputs to CA2 are relatively weak and dominated by powerful feed-forward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</xref>). Finally, individual CA2 PNs provide stronger excitatory drive to CA1 compared to the weaker influence of single CA3 SC inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</xref>). Such properties enable the CA2 region to function as the nexus of a powerful disynaptic circuit (EC → CA2 → CA1), directly linking EC input to hippocampal CA1 output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones and McHugh, 2011</xref>). How do the EC inputs trigger CA2 AP output, given that synaptic responses at distal dendrites are normally severely attenuated by the cable properties of the dendrites? In this study, we report the PP inputs to distal dendrites in CA2 reliably initiate dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes that are necessary to trigger axonal AP output in response to a single or a burst of PP stimuli. Furthermore, these spikes can overcome strong inhibition to elicit AP output. In contrast, activation of PP inputs to distal dendrites of CA1 PNs with a single stimulus fail to elicit dendritic spikes or somatic APs. Through computational modeling based on morphological reconstructions of CA2 and CA1 PNs, we find that the distinct dendritic geometry of CA2 PNs contributes to the ability of CA2 neurons to efficiently couple dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes to AP output. Thus our data provide a striking example of how dendritic structure and functional properties control the ability of dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes to couple synaptic input at distal dendrites to axonal AP initiation. In this manner, CA2 PN dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes ensure the efficient propagation of cortical information through the EC → CA2 → CA1 disynaptic pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A single PP stimulus is capable of evoking APs in CA2, but not CA1 or CA3, PNs</title><p>Our laboratory found that CA2 PNs receive strong excitatory inputs from EC and fire APs with high probability in response to a brief burst of stimuli delivered to the EC PP axons (5 pulses at 100 Hz). In contrast, the same PP stimuli generate a smaller synaptic response in CA1 PNs that is usually insufficient to elicit spike output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</xref>). In this study, we first re-investigated the input–output relation between distal synaptic stimulation strength and sub-threshold EPSP size recorded in the soma of CA2 PNs. In these experiments the stimulation electrode was placed in SLM of the CA1 region as before but was closer to the CA1/CA2 border (∼50 µm) than in our previous study (∼200 µm). Consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</xref>), the sub-threshold EPSP amplitude in CA2 PNs evoked by PP stimulation was 5–6 times larger than that observed in CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Moreover, the EPSP in CA2 PNs was slightly larger than that seen in our previous study, most likely due to the closer proximity to CA2 of the stimulation electrode.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04551.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A single stimulus delivered to the perforant path (PP) evokes APs in CA2 PNs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram illustrating the configuration for the experiment.

However, recent studies indicate that CA2 PNs receive input largely from EC LII neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohara et al., 2014</xref>). We investigated whether our focal stimulating electrode in SLM of CA1 might also activate EC LII axons by recording from dentate gyrus granule cells, which receive exclusive innervation from EC LII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Witter, 2007</xref>). Indeed, we find that stimulation in SLM of CA1 evokes EPSPs in the granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with a tracing study that reported the presence of EC LII axons in SLM of CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tamamaki and Nojyo, 1993</xref>). Thus we conclude that the EPSPs recorded in CA2 PNs in response to distal stimulation in SLM of CA1 likely results from the activation of inputs from EC LII.</p><p>In the vast majority of CA2 PNs tested (35/42 cells), a single electrical stimulus (up to 48 V) delivered to the PP was sufficient to elicit a large, fast AP that was &gt;80 mV in amplitude when recorded in the CA2 soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). The cumulative distribution of spike threshold was well fit by a sigmoidal function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

By contrast, CA1 PNs never fired a spike in response to a single PP stimulus, even at strengths up to 60 V (with the stimulating electrode located within 50 μm of the CA1 PN as in our CA2 recordings), but required a burst of high-frequency PP stimuli to fire APs (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jarsky et al., 2005</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04551.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Voltage threshold of APs evoked by PP stimulation in CA2, but not CA1, PNs is lower than threshold of APs evoked by somatic current injection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sample traces of somatic voltage responses in response to somatic current injection (I) and a single PP stimulus (PP) from a CA2 PN.

Consistent with the whole-cell recordings, a prominent PS was elicited by a single stimulus in the CA2 region. Moreover the CA2 PS input–output curve was fit by a sigmoidal function that closely matched that seen with whole-cell recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). By contrast, we failed to detect a measurable PS in the cell body layer of the CA1 or CA3b region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The electrically evoked APs were eliminated by blockade of fast glutamatergic synaptic transmission, using bath application of NBQX (20 μM) and D-APV (50 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, n = 4). Thus, the spikes were driven by synaptic excitation, not by direct electrical stimulation of CA2 dendrites.</p><p>The efficient triggering of action potential output from CA2 PNs in response to PP stimulation is surprising given that the largest EPSP observed in the CA2 PN soma was ∼11 mV below the voltage threshold of AP output in response to somatic current injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, even though the PP EPSP is fivefold larger in CA2 than CA1 PNs, the mechanism coupling synaptic input to AP output is unclear. In the remainder of this study, we address the hypothesis that dendritic spikes are critical for enabling the distal synaptic inputs to trigger this output.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Single PP stimuli trigger dendritic spikes in CA2, but not CA1, PNs</title><p>Initial evidence for the triggering of dendritic spikes came from inspection of CA2 PN voltage responses to PP stimuli that were just sub-threshold for eliciting somatic action potentials. Nearly all CA2 PNs fired APs in response to a PP stimulus that was strong enough to induce a somatic EPSP greater than 15.6 ± 0.6 mV (ranging from 7.7–20.3 mV, n = 27, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). In a subset of CA2 PNs (n = 9/42 cells), PP stimuli that were just below threshold for eliciting an AP evoked a somatic voltage response with a rapidly rising phase of depolarization not seen in voltage responses evoked by weaker PP stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In cells that displayed this rapid voltage response, a small increase in stimulus strength usually evoked a full-blown AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This rapidly rising depolarization is similar to the somatic spikelets associated with dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes reported in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Losonczy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Remy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muller et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To further characterize the components of the voltage response, we analyzed their maximal rate-of-rise (dV/dt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Although dV/dt initially increased linearly with peak EPSP amplitude, as the EPSP reached values around 15–20 mV, dV/dt increased sharply in a non-linear manner. This suggests that large EPSPs are sufficient to trigger a non-linear membrane response that likely reflects the firing of a dendritic spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Consistent with this view, the 20–80% rise time of the EPSP also decreased non-linearly as the peak EPSP amplitude reached values above ∼15 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>As the rapidly rising spikelets were observed in only a subset of our recordings, we wondered whether they were a consistent feature of CA2 responses to PP stimuli but were normally masked by the much larger somatic AP (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In agreement with this idea, a phase-plane plot of dV/dt vs membrane voltage showed that APs induced by PP stimulation in CA2 PNs consistently exhibited an initial rapid dV/dt signal at potentials sub-threshold to the main spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Such an early rapid phase of depolarization was not observed when APs were elicited by somatic current injection, suggesting that they do indeed represent dendritic spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Furthermore, we compared the threshold to fire APs induced by PP stimulation with that induced by somatic current injection. The AP threshold (defined as the somatic voltage at which dV/dt reached 50 V/s) was significantly lower in response to PP stimulation (−51.6 ± 1.0 mV) compared to somatic current injection (−44.3 ± 0.8 mV, n = 17, p &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that dendritic spikes may indeed be required for PP input to trigger somatic APs.</p><p>We next asked whether dendritic spikes were also a feature of PP-evoked action potentials in CA1 PNs. As a single PP stimulus was ineffective in triggering a somatic action potential in CA1 PNs, we used a 50-Hz burst of 5 strong PP stimuli to evoke somatic spiking. In marked contrast with our results with CA2 PNs, neither our somatic voltage recordings nor phase-plane plots showed evidence of a spikelet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Moreover, individual spikes, phase-plane plots, and voltage threshold of somatic APs induced by PP stimulation were identical with those induced by somatic current injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). These results suggest that in CA1 PNs, somatic depolarization resulting from temporal summation of PP-evoked EPSPs, rather than dendritic spikes, drives AP output.</p><p>To examine more directly whether dendritic spikes consistently underlie the CA2 PN somatic AP, we prevented AP firing by injecting negative current to hyperpolarize the somatic membrane to −82.5 ± 2.8 mV (n = 10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Strikingly, this revealed that PP stimulation consistently evoked a rapidly rising spikelets (dV/dt of 20.6 ± 2.6 V/s; n = 10) in response to PP stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). When we applied repeated single PP stimuli of a constant strength near the threshold for eliciting somatic APs, the CA2 PN membrane response often fluctuated between a full-blown AP response and a spikelet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Overlaying these responses showed that the spikelets preceded the full-blown APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that the dendritic spikes triggered the full-blown APs. This was particularly evident in plots of dV/dt, where the spikelet waveform observed in isolation could be identified in traces associated with full-blown APs immediately prior to the AP response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In marked contrast, we failed to observe spikelets in CA1 soma upon membrane hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, n = 9).</p><p>As a second means of recording spikelets in the absence of somatic APs, we locally applied tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 µM) to the soma of CA1 or CA2 PNs while maintaining the neurons at their initial resting potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In CA2 PNs, this manipulation revealed the consistent presence of spikelets (dV/dt = 36.4 ± 3.0 V/s, n = 8) in response to PP stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–I</xref>). These spikelets provide a substantial somatic depolarization (33.6 ± 2.8 mV, n = 8) that would normally trigger a somatic action potential in the absence of TTX. Overlaying dV/dt in phase-plane plots in the absence and the presence of TTX again showed that the spikelets preceded the full-blown APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, we failed to observe spikelets with TTX applied to the soma of CA1 PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, n = 4). Taken together, we conclude that single PP stimuli are sufficient to evoke prominent dendritic spikes, which result in high-amplitude somatic spikelets in CA2 but not CA1 PNs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PP-evoked dendritic spikes are necessary to generate AP output in CA2 PNs in response to PP stimulation</title><p>Next, we asked whether PP-driven dendritic spikes are necessary to generate AP output in CA2 PNs. As discussed above, one indication for the necessity of dendritic spikes is our finding that the threshold to fire a somatic AP with PP stimulation is negative to the threshold with somatic current injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). To directly determine whether dendritic spikes are required for eliciting a CA2 PN somatic action potential under the conditions of our experiments, we applied TTX locally to the proximal dendrites of CA2 PNs, which should block dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes. Indeed, this manipulation fully blocked the ability of single PP stimuli to elicit somatic APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>, n = 6). After blockade of dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes, the EPSP evoked by strong PP stimulation maximally depolarized the soma by ∼20 mV positive to the resting potential (−70 to −73 mV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), below the threshold for driving AP output by somatic current injection. Importantly, the local TTX application exerted a selective effect on dendritic excitability and did not alter PP synaptic transmission or somatic excitability. Thus, there was no change in the sub-threshold PP EPSP or AP firing in response to somatic current injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>). These results strongly suggest that dendritic spikes in CA2 PNs are mediated by TTX-sensitive voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels (see below for additional evidence) and are necessary for somatic AP initiation with a single PP stimulus.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04551.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Cortically driven dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes are necessary to fire APs in CA2 PNs in response to a single PP stimulus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram illustrating the configuration of the experiment.

To address whether dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes affect the timing of AP output, we measured population spikes in the CA1 and CA2 stratum pyramidale (SP) cell body layers in response to a burst of PP stimuli (5 pulses at 50 Hz). In CA1, a measurable PS was never observed following the first PP stimulus and was only detected during the later stimuli in a burst, resulting in a latency to firing of 20 ms or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, the PS amplitude in CA2 was largest in response to the first stimulus of a burst and gradually diminished with successive stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The decrease in PS response was not due to synaptic depression because the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of PP synapses in CA2 PNs exhibited facilitation rather than depression (PPR = 1.39 ± 0.06, n = 17). Thus, CA2 PNs fired precisely and immediately in response to PP stimulation (latency of the first PS = 4.4 ± 0.1 ms, n = 5), suggesting that dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes enable CA2 PNs to respond rapidly to EC burst firing with a high degree of temporal fidelity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>CA2 dendrites generate Na<sup>+</sup> spikes in response to PP stimulation</title><p>To examine dendritic spike firing in response to PP stimulation more directly, we measured the local field responses simultaneously from two extracellular recording electrodes placed near the middle of the axial axis of the apical dendrites in the stratum radiatum layer (SR) and in the SP layer of CA1, CA2, or CA3 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). CA2 dendrites generated an active excitatory current response to PP stimulation, manifested as a negative field voltage response in recordings from SR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). In contrast, PP stimuli never evoked an active response in SR of CA1 or CA3. As the excitatory synaptic response is local to the site of PP input in SLM, the negative field response in SR must be generated by voltage-gated excitatory conductances.

The multiple independent spikes in the dendritic branches were each subject to considerable attenuation as they propagated from the distal region of the dendrites to the primary branch point.

One set of mechanisms, which remains to be identified, increases the magnitude of the sub-threshold somatic EPSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</xref>). However, despite its larger amplitude, the EPSP generated by the EC inputs is still below the threshold for action potential firing (using somatic current pulses). Given a mean CA2 PN resting potential of −75 mV and an AP threshold of −44 mV, a &gt;30 mV somatic depolarization is required for CA2 PNs to reach the threshold to fire an AP. Yet we find that, in the absence of dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes, the EPSP reaches a peak value of around 15–20 mV with strong PP stimulation, far negative to the threshold for eliciting a somatic spike. This is consistent with our finding that dendritic spikes are necessary to trigger an action potential output in response to EC input in the CA2 PNs.</p><p>Recent results show that CA2 PNs also receive direct input from DG granule cells through the mossy fiber pathway, although the CA2 PNs lack the thorny excrescences characteristic of CA3 mossy fiber synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohara et al., 2014</xref>). However, the DG inputs provide relatively weak synaptic drive onto CA2 PN apical dendrites, evoking small PSPs whose peak amplitude of 5–10 mV is far below the threshold for eliciting spikes with somatic current injection. Nonetheless, the DG inputs can drive CA2 spike output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohara et al., 2014</xref>). To explain the discrepancy between EPSP size and CA2 PN threshold, we suggest that dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes may also enable AP output through this additional route of information transfer.</p><p>Dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes have been suggested to contribute to temporal coding in neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ariav et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gasparini and Magee, 2006</xref>). Consistent with this idea, we find that CA2 neurons fire precisely and immediately in response to a single PP stimulus. This is in contrast with CA1, where temporal summation of synaptic potentials is required for generating APs. With a burst of PP stimuli, CA2 fires with the highest probability in response to the first PP stimulus. In contrast, the probability of CA1 firing increases during successive stimuli in the burst. We speculate that this mechanism may exert an influence on the temporal structure of information flow through the cortico-hippocampal circuit. Consistent with our in vitro findings, in vivo extracellular recording demonstrated that CA2 neurons fire APs earlier than CA1 or CA3 neurons in response to EC stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartesaghi and Gessi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartesaghi et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes have been observed in vivo in some types of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamondi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waters et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). Although it is not known whether dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes occur in vivo in CA2 PNs, an active response in the CA2 dendritic field has been observed in response to an electrical stimulus to the PP using extracellular field recording in anesthetized guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartesaghi and Gessi, 2004</xref>). Importantly, this active dendritic response precedes that in the cell body layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartesaghi and Gessi, 2004</xref>), which is consistent with our observations in acute hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This suggests that dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes in CA2 PNs may similarly influence AP initiation in vivo. Whether cortically driven dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes in CA2 PNs occur in awake-behaving animals and whether they are important for specific behaviors, including social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeVito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pagani et al., 2014</xref>), remain open questions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Hippocampal slice preparation</title><p>Transverse hippocampal slices were prepared from 5- to 8-week old C57BL/6J male mice from the Jackson Laboratory, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</xref>). In brief, animals were anesthetized and killed by decapitation in accordance with institutional regulations.

To build active models of CA1 and CA2 PNs, we used a similar approach as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jarsky et al., 2005</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, there are no available experimental data regarding distributions or biophysical properties of dendritic voltage-gated conductances from mouse hippocampal CA1 or CA2 PNs. Thus the parameters used in our models were derived from the experimental data obtained from rat hippocampal CA1 PNs. The models incorporated passive membrane properties (R<sub>m</sub> = 40,000 Ω cm<sup>2</sup>, C<sub>m</sub> = 0.75 μF/cm<sup>2</sup>, R<sub>i</sub> = 150 Ω cm). To account for spines, C<sub>m</sub> of the dendritic compartments was multiplied by a spine scale factor and their R<sub>m</sub> was divided by the same factor. In the CA1 PN model, we used a spine scale factor of 2 in compartments 150 μm beyond the soma, whereas in the CA2 PN model we used spine scale factors of 2 or 3 for compartments below or beyond 150 μm from the soma, respectively. These spine scale factor values were chosen to match the membrane time constant and input resistance values of the models to our experimental values.</p><p>The models also included four active conductances: a Na<sup>+</sup> conductance (G<sub>Na</sub>), a delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> conductance (G<sub>Kdr</sub>), an A-type K<sup>+</sup> conductance (G<sub>KA</sub>), and a hyperpolarization-activated cation conductance (G<sub>h</sub>). The biophysical parameters of G<sub>Na</sub>, G<sub>Kdr</sub>, G<sub>KA</sub>, and G<sub>h</sub> were implemented, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Magee, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jarsky et al., 2005</xref>). These conductances were inserted in all compartments of the models. The distribution of G<sub>Na</sub> and G<sub>Kdr</sub> is uniform throughout the somato-dendritic axis in both CA1 and CA2 models with a conductance value of 0.022 S/cm<sup>2</sup> and 0.035 S/cm<sup>2</sup> respectively. G<sub>KA</sub> was modeled with sixfold increase in conductance along the somato-dendrtic axis as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoffman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jarsky et al., 2005</xref>), with conductance values of 0.035 S/cm<sup>2</sup> at the soma in both models. G<sub>h</sub> was modeled with a sevenfold increase in conductance along the somato-dendritic axis as described previously for CA1 PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Magee, 1998</xref>), whereas in CA2 PNs its distribution was uniform based on our inspection of immunocytochemistry results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Santoro et al., 2004</xref>). All simulations were performed at a resting potential of −70 mV.</p><p>All excitatory synapses were modeled using two exponential functions to describe the conductance time course (τ<sub>rise</sub> of 0.2 ms and τ<sub>decay</sub> of 2 ms) with a reversal potential of 0 mV with specific synaptic conductance values described below. For distal synaptic activation, excitatory synapses (0.0002 µS per synapse) were distributed randomly onto the distal dendritic arbor (&gt;400 µm from the soma). Weak synaptic stimulation was performed by activating ∼75 synapses randomly, whereas in strong synaptic stimulation ∼1000 synapses were activated randomly in both models. For the branch model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>), each branch (∼300 µm from the soma) was activated by ∼150 synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data acquisition and analysis</title><p>Data were digitized with a Digidata 1440A interface (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and were acquired using AxoGraph X software (AxoGraph, Berkeley, CA). Data analysis was performed using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), AxoGraph X, and Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Phase-plane plot and dV/dt values were obtained with the build-in programs in AxoGraph X. AP threshold was defined as the somatic voltage at which dV/dt exceeded 10 V/s or 50 V/s. To determine the EPSP amplitude when dendritic spikes were present (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), EPSP amplitude was determined at the peak depolarization of the EPSP waveform (the latency of peak EPSP is typically &gt;8 ms) following the dendritic spike (dendritic spike latency is usually &lt;5 ms). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, EPSP data were excluded if a cell started to fire somatic APs in response to increasing stimulation intensity. In a subset of CA2 PNs, PP stimulation with constant high-intensity stimuli variably triggered full-blown APs, dendritic spikes without APs, or PSPs in the presence of inhibition (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). In those cases, the PSP values were used to generate the input–output relation of PSP and stimulating intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), Gary Westbrook (Reviewing editor), and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached a decision, and assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers found the experiments to be convincing and the findings to be very significant, demonstrating a pyramidal neuron with reliably propagating D spikes. However, both reviewers had concerns about the conclusions regarding morphology and aspects of the modeling that require your attention.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) Modeling. The current work leaves little doubt that distal PP stimulation results in dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spiking that can facilitate somatic action potential initiation including in physiological-like conditions (even in the presence of GABA-mediated inhibition). However, the authors' conjecture that morphology alone seems sufficient to explain efficiently propagation of dendritic spikes in CA2 PCs is rather simplistic and relatively untested. Although the authors attribute the differences between CA1 and CA2 cells to morphology, they actually have differences in the conductances in the two models as well. The smaller A-type K conductance in the CA2 model could be a major factor contributing to differences in D spike propagation between the models of the two cell types. To test this idea rigorously, the authors should put the CA1 conductances into the CA2 cell, and vice versa. If morphology is truly the main difference, as the authors claim, it should still be true that the chimeric model shows better D spike propagation in CA2 than in CA1, despite the reversal of the conductances in the two models.</p><p>2) The authors do not show convincingly that the morphological differences between CA1 and CA2 that are apparent in the model are truly representative. To make this conclusion, quantitative data on the morphological properties of the dendritic trees of these two cell types are needed, as opposed to the anecdotal data shown here (one reconstructed neuron of each type). These data, on their own, could bolster the case that morphological differences are real and therefore could account for the differences in D spike propagation. Using modeling to explore more deeply how quantitative morphological differences contribute to D spike initiation/propagation would also strengthen the paper.</p><p>3) The authors' simulations indicate that distributed synaptic input across multiple secondary branches of the CA2 dendrite (the proposed “unique morphological feature” of CA2 PCs) allows for independent Na<sup>+</sup> spikes to be generated in these processes, resulting in a large summated response at the primary dendrite which can then effectively propagate to the soma and initiate action potential firing. However, a more detailed analysis is needed. Specifically, in the simulations, are D spikes generated more readily in the distal dendrites of CA2 compared to CA1, or do they propagate better? One possibility is that the major branch point of the main apical dendrite is closer to the soma in CA2. If this is where D spikes fail, they could be larger in CA2 simply because that location is closer to the soma. Is that what's happening or is there some other explanation?</p><p>4) The paragraph discussing the previous work in CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jarsky et al. 2005</xref>) misses an important point. The fact that only a small minority of CA1 cells exhibit somatically recorded spikelets likely reflects the fact that D spikes fail so far from the soma that a spikelet is not visible in somatic recordings, rather than reflecting the absence of a D spike in response to PP stimulation. The 2005 study used modeling to predict this result. Those authors also predicted that coincident stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals could facilitate forward propagation of D spikes generated in the tuft. They then tested this prediction experimentally and found that it was indeed the case. Thus, there is no need to invoke a difference between rats and mice to explain the lack of spikelet observed in CA1 in the present study. Rather, it is likely the D spikes are also generated in CA1 tuft dendrites, but their failure to propagate reliably results in so much attenuation that the D spikes are completely invisible in the soma. This point should be discussed.</p><p>5) The authors imply that dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes are a requirement for PP-mediated somatic spiking as, following dendrite-targeted TTX application, PP stimulation no longer evoked somatic action potentials. In a few places, the authors claim that D spikes are “necessary” for firing in response to stimulation of the PP. However, this seems like a rather sweeping conclusion given the limited conditions used to stimulate PP inputs. Other conditions not tested in the experiments (e.g. in vivo) could lead to PP-mediated action potentials even in the absence of D spikes. This is easily corrected with some wording changes. For example, rather than saying, “Thus, cortically-driven dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes are necessary for AP output in CA2 PNs to either single or bursts of PP input.”, they should say, “Thus, cortically-driven dendritic Na+ spikes were necessary for AP output in CA2 PNs to either single or bursts of PP input.” The difference is subtle. The latter sentence refers only to the experiments the authors did, while the former suggests that it would always be true. Additional discussion could also clarify this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04551.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Modeling.

Based on the reviewers’ comment, we asked whether it is possible to explain differences in CA2 versus CA1 excitability without postulating a difference in A-type conductance. We now find that, with slight adjustments in the models’ voltage-gated conductance parameters, we can reproduce our experimental results based solely on morphological differences, using an identical value of A-type conductance – as well as identical Na<sup>+</sup> and delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> conductances – in the CA2 and CA1 PNs. We present these new results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The authors do not show convincingly that the morphological differences between CA1 and CA2 that are apparent in the model are truly representative.

Specifically, Sholl analysis demonstrated CA2 PNs have significantly more second and tertiary dendritic branches extending toward SLM than do CA1 PNs. Furthermore, we have performed a second set of computational modeling using the same voltage-gated conductance parameters used in the original pair of reconstructed CA1 and CA2 PNs in two different newly reconstructed CA1 and CA2 PNs and we obtained similar results as in our original models (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10–figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, we believe that our new data significantly strengthen one of our main conclusions that dendritic geometry of CA2 PNs contributes to the efficient coupling of dendritic spikes to AP output.</p><p><italic>3) The authors' simulations indicate that distributed synaptic input across multiple secondary branches of the CA2 dendrite (the proposed “unique morphological feature” of CA2 PCs) allows for independent Na</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>spikes to be generated in these processes, resulting in a large summated response at the primary dendrite which can then effectively propagate to the soma and initiate action potential firing.

If this is where D spikes fail, they could be larger in CA2 simply because that location is closer to the soma. Is that what's happening or is there some other explanation?</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewers raising this issue. Our data suggest that, compared to CA1, the better propagation due to dendritic geometry of CA2, rather than more excitable dendrites, are important for coupling dendritic spikes to AP output. Our experimental dendritic whole cell current-clamp recordings show the current threshold to generate local spikes is comparable between CA1 and CA2 (CA1: 1.6 ± 0.2 nA versus CA2: 1.7 ± 0.2 nA), indicating that the excitability of CA2 dendrites is comparable to CA1. This point is further supported by our models, in which CA1 distal dendrites can readily generate local spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10–figure supplement 2</xref>). To allow direct visualization of dendritic spike propagation, we now have performed further analyses in both CA1 and CA2 models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10–figure supplement 2</xref>, see the model session in Results for details). In summary, prominent dendritic spikes (&gt;30 mV in amplitude) are visible at the main branch point of the apical dendrite in CA2 PNs in response to EC inputs. Due to the proximity of this branch point to the soma, the dendritic spikes are subject to very little additional attenuation such that large spikelets can be readily detected at the soma in our experimental conditions. Thus, our models support the idea that the main branch point of CA2 PNs acts as a “hot spot” zone to initiate dendritic spikes and trigger axonal AP output. We now have discussed this point in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) The paragraph discussing the previous work in CA1 neurons (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20"><italic>Jarsky et al. 2005</italic></xref><italic>) misses an important point.
