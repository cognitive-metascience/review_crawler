Developmental mechanisms underlying somatic muscle development have mostly been studied in vertebrates and fly where multiple signals and hierarchic genetic regulatory cascades selectively specify myoblasts from a pool of naive mesodermal progenitors. However, due to the increased organismic complexity and distant phylogenetic position of the two systems, a general mechanistic understanding of myogenesis is still lacking. In this study, we propose a gene regulatory network (GRN) model that promotes myogenesis in the sea urchin embryo, an early branching deuterostome. A fibroblast growth factor signaling and four Forkhead transcription factors consist the central part of our model and appear to orchestrate the myogenic process. The topological properties of the network reveal dense gene interwiring and a multilevel transcriptional regulation of conserved and novel myogenic genes. Finally, the comparison of the myogenic network architecture among different animal groups highlights the evolutionary plasticity of developmental GRNs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07343.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07343.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07343.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Muscles, bones, and blood vessels all develop from a tissue called the mesoderm, which forms early on in the development of an embryo. Networks of genes control which parts of the mesoderm transform into different cell types. The gene networks that control the development of muscle cells from the mesoderm have so far been investigated in flies and several species of animals with backbones. However, these species are complex, which makes it difficult to work out the general principles that control muscle cell development.</p><p>Sea urchins are often studied in developmental biology as they have many of the same genes as more complex animals, but are much simpler and easier to study in the laboratory. Andrikou et al. therefore investigated the ‘gene regulatory network’ that controls muscle development in sea urchins. This revealed that proteins called Forkhead transcription factors and a process called FGF signaling are crucial for controlling muscle development in sea urchins. These are also important factors for developing muscles in other animals.</p><p>Andrikou et al. then produced models that show the interactions between the genes that control muscle formation at three different stages of embryonic development. These models reveal several important features of the muscle development gene regulatory network. For example, the network is robust: if one gene fails, the network is connected in a way that allows it to still make muscle. This also allows the network to adapt and evolve without losing the ability to perform any of its existing roles.</p><p>Comparing the gene regulatory network that controls muscle development in sea urchins with the networks found in other animals showed that many of the same genes are used across different species, but are connected into different network structures. Investigating the similarities and differences of the regulatory networks in different species could help us to understand how muscles have evolved and could ultimately lead to a better understanding of the causes of developmental diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07343.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07343.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>gene regulatory network</kwd><kwd>myogenesis</kwd><kwd>sea urchin</kwd><kwd>FGF</kwd><kwd>Forkhead</kwd><kwd>specification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission (EC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Curie ITN project 215781</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrikou</surname><given-names>Carmen</given-names></name><name><surname>Arnone</surname><given-names>Maria Ina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>POR Campania FSE 2007-2013, Italy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>project MODO</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrikou</surname><given-names>Carmen</given-names></name><name><surname>Arnone</surname><given-names>Maria Ina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101-2923-B-001-004-MY2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Yi-Hsien</given-names></name><name><surname>Arnone</surname><given-names>Maria Ina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>103-2311-B-001-020-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Yi-Hsien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>103-2627-B-001-001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Yi-Hsien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A gene regulatory network model provides a simplified explanation of the molecular interactions that orchestrate muscle development in the sea urchin embryo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Muscle cells are present in most animals with the characteristic of containing protein filaments that slide and produce contractions. In bilaterians, muscles develop usually from mesodermal cells in a process called myogenesis, during which the naive mesodermal progenitors are selectively specified as myoblasts and later differentiate into muscle cells. In vertebrate embryos, the mesoderm is subdivided into several regions from which different muscle types originated. For example, the axial skeletal muscles originate in the segmented paraxial mesoderm called somites, whereas the cardiac muscles develop from the lateral plate mesoderm. The subdivisions of different mesoderm regions require differential expression of the Forkhead (Fox) family of transcription factors, such as FoxC1 and FoxC2 for the paraxial mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wilm et al., 2004</xref>) and FoxF1 for the lateral plate mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mahlapuu et al., 2001</xref>). Analyses of molecular mechanisms underlying myogenesis in various parts of the somites further lead to a series of complex gene regulatory networks (GRNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bryson-Richardson and Currie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yokoyama and Asahara, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bentzinger et al., 2012</xref>). These networks are composed of multiple signals that drive the expression of the genes encoding basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain-containing myogenic regulatory factors, which include myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD), myogenic factor 5 (Myf5), Myf6, and myogenin (Myog). Other factors, including the myocyte enhancer binding factor 2 (MEF2) family of MADS-box proteins, transcription factors Pitx2, Pitx3, sine oculis-related homeobox (six) family members and their cofactors eyes-absent homologs (Eya), are also involved in specification and migration of the myogenic precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Molkentin and Olson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yokoyama and Asahara, 2011</xref>). These myogenic transcriptional regulators then in turn initiate the transcription of muscle differentiation markers, such as myosin heavy chain proteins (MHC), that determine the morphological and functional identity of the differentiated muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bryson-Richardson and Currie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bentzinger et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the transcription factors mentioned above, myogenesis in different parts of the vertebrate somites depends on several signals including Notch, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), Wnts, bone morphogenetic factor 4 (BMP4), and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) that are secreted from adjacent tissues, such as neural tube, notochord, dorsal, and lateral ectoderms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marcelle et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vasyutina et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Delfini et al., 2009</xref>). Among these signals, FGF-signaling pathway is of particular interest because it has a crucial and conserved role in mesoderm patterning and muscle development in various animal models. In vertebrates, FGF induces the expression of myogenic genes in the primary myotome, controls the timing of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition of the dermomyotome, which triggers the emergence of muscle progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Delfini et al., 2009</xref>) and positively regulates muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marics et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Groves et al., 2005</xref>). In flies, an FGFR ortholog (<italic>Heartless</italic>)-mediated pathway is essential for cell migration and fate induction of the visceral mesoderm, heart, and the somatic muscle lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beiman et al., 1996</xref>). In ascidians, FGF signaling is required for the specification of the heart progenitor cells and secondary muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tokuoka et al., 2007</xref>). In the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the crosstalk between FGF and Wnt signals is involved in larval sex myoblast specification and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burdine et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lo et al., 2008</xref>). In the amphioxus <italic>Brachiostoma lanceolatum</italic>, FGF signaling is necessary for the formation of the anterior somites that will generate the musculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bertrand et al., 2011</xref>) and in the hemichordate <italic>Saccoglossus kowalevskii</italic>, FGF signaling is necessary for all types of mesoderm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Green et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The overall genetic regulatory cascade that drives myogenesis appears to be highly conserved between ecdysozoans (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>) and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ciglar and Furlong, 2009</xref>). However, due to the high complexity that characterizes the vertebrate organogenesis and the distant phylogenetic position between ecdysozoans and vertebrates, the logics behind the genomic regulatory interactions that drive muscle development remain unclear. Therefore, elucidating the properties of the key genetic interconnections that orchestrate myogenesis in a larger set of model organisms is necessary to reveal the core myogenic circuits. Moreover, given the fact that the common origin of musculature is a highly debated topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seipel and Schmid, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Burton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Steinmetz et al., 2012</xref>), a larger interspecies comparison of the transcriptional myogenic networks would provide new insights into the evolution of muscle and the kernel driven hypothesis.</p><p>Echinoderms occupy a key phylogenetic position since they are early branching deuterostomes, therefore, are more closely related to vertebrates compared to the other two most studied invertebrate model systems (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>). Sea urchin is a powerful model system for studying regulatory events that take place during development due to their advantageous properties for GRN analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Oliveri and Davidson, 2004</xref>). GRNs provide causal explanations of the molecular interactions occurring during dynamic developmental processes such as cell specification and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davidson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ben-Tabou de-Leon and Davidson, 2006</xref>). In the last decade, the extensive amount of data collected by perturbation analyses has led to the assembly of the largest so far known endomesodermal GRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davidson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peter and Davidson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Materna et al., 2013</xref>) representing most of the transcriptional interactions that take place during endomesoderm formation in the sea urchin embryo. These properties make echinoderms an excellent model to study molecular developmental mechanisms and address aspects in evolution of organogenesis.</p><p>Sea urchin larvae possess a muscular apparatus that surrounds their esophagus and produces contractile force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burke, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burke and Alvarez, 1988</xref>). These muscle cells originate from mesoderm and adapt the myogenic fate by segregating from the other three non-skeletogenic mesodermal (NSM) lineages at the early gastrula stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ruffins and Ettensohn, 1996</xref>). The first appearance of myoblasts is seen at the late gastrula stage as a few cells in the oral vegetal domain of each coelomic sac at the tip of the archenteron and they express a number of muscle-specific transcription regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrikou et al., 2013</xref>). Few hours later, at the prism stage, these cells extend pseudopods towards the midline of the esophagus, increase in number and diameter, fuse to each other, and finally form the circumesophagael contractile bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burke and Alvarez, 1988</xref>).</p><p>Despite the existence of large amount of data concerning the mechanisms patterning the early endomesoderm segregation, little is known about the regulatory landscape of the later NSM specification. Parts of the regulatory events that underlie the specification of the three NSM mesodermal lineages (blastocoelar, pigment, and coelomic pouch cell lineages) were recently revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luo and Su, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ransick and Davidson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Materna et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Solek et al., 2013</xref>), and only scattered information regarding the molecular interplay that establish the muscle lineage is available in the literature. In particular, transcription factors such as Twist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wu et al., 2008</xref>) and a sea urchin lineage-specific Fox family factor, FoxY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Materna et al., 2013</xref>), and signaling pathways such as Delta/Notch (D/N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sherwood and McClay, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sweet et al., 2002</xref>) and Hedgehog (Hh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Walton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Warner et al., 2014</xref>) seem to be involved in muscle development, but the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood.</p><p>In our previous work, we identified several homologues of myogenic regulators in the sea urchin embryo and revealed the regulatory state of the myoblasts and their precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrikou et al., 2013</xref>). Further functional analyses are needed to confirm the myogenic function of these transcription factors and to unravel the regulatory architecture of the muscle GRN. This study provides an explanatory mechanism on how the sea urchin muscle lineage is specified using a perturbation approach accompanied by a combination of temporal and spatial gene expression analyses. We show that FGF signaling is necessary for specifying naive NSM cells to myoblast precursors at the very early gastrula stage. The four Fox family factors FoxY, FoxC, FoxF, and FoxL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tu et al., 2006</xref>) constitute the central part of our myogenic GRN model and are activated sequentially. Other conserved key factors that occupy different hierarchical levels in the myogenic GRN are members of the T-box (Tbx6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Howard-Ashby et al., 2006</xref>), bHLH (MyoD2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrikou et al., 2013</xref>), SRY (Sox) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Howard-Ashby et al., 2006</xref>), Scratch (ScratchX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Materna et al., 2013</xref>), and Six (Six1/2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Poustka et al., 2007</xref>) family genes. These findings imply an overall high level of functional conservation of both key myogenic transcriptional regulators and signaling components but not of the myogenic GRN architecture per se. Also, they explain in a rational way the logics and properties of the regulatory interactions that drive myogenesis in the sea urchin embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genes encoding FGF-signaling components are expressed in the putative myoblast precursors</title><p>As shown in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrikou et al., 2013</xref>), the myogenic lineage seems to segregate as early as the very early gastrula stage (30 hr post fertilization). The relative position of these cells is not precise at the earlier stages but they seem to be located at the oral/lateral periphery of the vegetal plate, at the border between the blastocoelar and pigment cell precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ruffins and Ettensohn, 1996</xref>]). To reveal the cause of myoblast emergence at the early gastrula stage, we searched for putative candidate signaling components that are expressed at that time in the myoblast precursors. As elsewhere demonstrated, a mesodermal Delta/Notch signal activates <italic>FoxY,</italic> which is required for the specification of the two mesoderm derivatives, coelomic pouches and muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Materna and Davidson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Materna et al., 2013</xref>). The segregation of these two derivatives should thus specifically rely on another signal that triggers myoblast specification at that particular developmental time.</p><p>There are one FGF ligand, FGFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and two FGF Receptors (FGFRs), FGFR1, and FGFR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), annotated in the sea urchin genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McCoon et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lapraz et al., 2006</xref>). A previous study showed that inhibition of FGFR2 affects morphogenesis of the embryonic skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rottinger et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore focused on characterizing the expression patterns of genes encoding FGFR1 and FGFA ligand in the sea urchin <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus.</italic> The expression profile of both genes matches with the one already described in another sea urchin species, <italic>Paracentrotus lividus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rottinger et al., 2008</xref>). To better resolve the expression patterns of these two genes relatively to the myoblast precursors, double fluorescent in situ hybridizations (FISHs) with <italic>FoxC</italic>, the earliest myoblast precursor marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrikou et al., 2013</xref>), were performed. At the very early gastrula stage, <italic>FGFR1</italic> was expressed in all <italic>FoxC-</italic>positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) whilst at the late gastrula stage (48 hr), only a number of <italic>FGFR1</italic> transcripts overlap with <italic>FoxC-</italic>positive cells at the tip of the archenteron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Moreover, <italic>FGFA</italic> transcripts were observed in the ventrolateral ectodermal regions in the vicinity of <italic>FoxC</italic>-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The MO toxicity and efficacy were examined by using a control MO and a GFP fusion construct, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although in 90% of the morphant larvae, a malformation of coelomic pouches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and a severe down-regulation of the MHC protein level were evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>), two different phenotypes concerning the compartmentalization of the archenteron were observed. 70% of the larvae displayed a fully elongated gut, with the cardiac and anal sphincters well formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), while in the rest cases both sphincters were absent or partly formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In addition, an abnormal extension of cilia in the apical ectoderm was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> insert) that provides a putative additional role of FGFR1 in patterning the apical organ (Paola Oliveri, personal communication) consistent with the expression of <italic>FGFR1</italic> in the apical domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). An evident reduction of the cilia in the gut lumen is also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), which may be related to the FGFR1 expression seen in the endoderm during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Moreover, the larval skeleton and the formation of pigment cells were not affected, confirming that FGFR1 is not involved either in PMC patterning and subsequent skeleton formation or in pigment cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). An even more severe phenotype was obtained by injecting the embryos with the mRNA encoding FGFR1 Dn with the cardiac and anal sphincters being absent in 60% of the cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). As expected, MHC levels were greatly reduced whilst the same abnormal extension of cilia in the apical ectoderm and the reduction of the cilia in the gut lumen were observed. Taking together, these experiments not only demonstrate clearly an essential role of FGF signaling through FGFR1 in sea urchin myogenesis but also suggest its possible involvement in the formation of the ciliated gut epithelium and the ciliary ectoderm.</p><p>We then tested the expression of the myoblast marker genes <italic>FoxY, FoxC</italic>, and <italic>FoxF</italic> in the FGF signaling-perturbed embryos at the very early gastrula (28 hr), mid gastrula (36 hr), and late gastrula (48 hr) stages, respectively.

FGF-signaling cascade is reported to trigger the emergence and/or promote the expansion of muscle lineage progenitors in different organisms and probably possessed an ancestral role in mesoderm patterning (at least in deuterostomes), along with other developmental processes. Genes encoding FGF and FGFR were already present in the last common ancestor of all metazoans, but the origin of the FGF/FGFR couple appears to be an innovation specific to the Eumetazoa, potentially linked to the increase of animal complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bertrand et al., 2014</xref>). The acquisition of diverse roles and functions of FGF signaling occurred with the expansion of FGF and FGFR families during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Itoh and Ornitz, 2011</xref>). For example, vertebrates are known to have the largest number of FGF-signaling components due to the two whole-genome duplication events (22 ligands and four receptors). FGF signals are involved in various developmental contexts (e.g., somitogenesis, cancer, gastrulation, metabolism, neural induction, etc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dorey and Amaya, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Naiche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Neugebauer and Yost, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sandhu et al., 2014</xref>).

In echinoderms, the two paralogues FGFR1 and FGFR2 are involved in two distinct developmental processes: myoblast specification (this study) and PMC migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rottinger et al., 2008</xref>), respectively. Diverse functions of FGF signaling seen among different animal taxa suggest that this signaling system is redeployed at different levels of GRN hierarchy and acquire new functions in developmental and physiological processes. Moreover, the hierarchical position of FGF signaling seems to depend on the level of complexity of the developmental process placing it as a ‘checkpoint’ in a non-conserved way regarding its downstream targets, a known property of GRN ‘plug-in’ devices defined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davidson, 2010</xref>). The functional importance of being attachable onto any kind of circuitry reflects the need of developmental GRNs to adopt factors that act as turn on/off apparatuses, resulting in change of the undefined cell regulatory state to their specific cell lineage.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The multilevel transcriptional regulation</title><p>An interesting finding of this analysis is the hierarchical organization of the regulatory interactions in the network topology. <italic>FoxY</italic>, a sea urchin-specific Fox family factor, lies on the top of the GRN architecture and is the key upstream regulator of sea urchin myogenesis and coelomic pouch formation. As shown elsewhere, <italic>FoxY</italic> is a direct target of the D/N signal, produced in the adjacent NSM. D/N signaling is known to be effective in cells being in direct contact with the ligand-producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang, 2011</xref>). Therefore, the positive autoregulation of <italic>FoxY</italic> maintains its own expression during gastrulation when cells invaginate into the blastocoel and may be away from the signaling source.</p><p><italic>FoxY</italic> then promotes the expression of downstream positive regulators necessary for the execution of the myogenic lineage fate. The next tier of the myogenic GRN includes <italic>FoxC, SoxE, ScratchX</italic>, and <italic>Six1/2</italic> factors and may be regarded as the core level of GRN. <italic>FoxC</italic> initially needs both positive inputs from FGF signaling and <italic>FoxY</italic> to be activated but then acts as an autorepressor in order to stabilize its number of transcripts. All factors belonging to this group are highly interconnected and provide multiple inputs to their downstream targets. On the same level of the GRN, immediately adjacent to the core, stands the intermediate layer of the network composed of the <italic>FoxF</italic> and <italic>FoxL1</italic> transcriptional effectors. Finally, the last level of the network includes the differentiation driver and repressor <italic>Tbx6</italic> that triggers the terminal myoblast differentiation. <italic>Tbx6</italic> seems to cooperate redundantly with other factors in an OR logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davidson, 2010</xref>), which also explains the mild phenotype seen in the Tbx6 perturbations. The differentiation drivers, such as <italic>MyoD</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrikou et al., 2013</xref>), are seen in the bottom of the GRN and probably activate the differentiation gene battery set, composed of a number of structural genes (e.g., <italic>MHC</italic>) that account for the specific function of the muscle cell.</p><p>This highly multilevel transcriptional regulation seen in myogenesis can be interpreted as an example of ‘correlated evolution’ where the increase of complex processes is accompanied by the expansion of the relevant regulatory systems whilst in less complex systems a shallower regulatory system can be provided.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Recruitment of the Fox factors in the myogenic GRN</title><p>Another important outcome that arose from this analysis is the sequential inter-regulatory mechanism observed among the four Fox family members FoxY, FoxC, FoxF, and FoxL1. The Fox family of transcription factors is an ancient gene family and it has been proposed that its evolutionary origin occurred in a clade of unicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baldauf, 1999</xref>). This family has expanded over time through multiple duplication events, and sometimes through gene loss, and resulted in over 40 members in vertebrates, grouped in 23 subclasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hannenhalli and Kaestner, 2009</xref>). Among them, FoxC, FoxF, and FoxL subfamilies are of particular interest because they are clustered in most metazoan genomes and usually involved in mesoderm specification/differentiation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mazet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shimeld et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, a linked activation or an overlapping expression has been reported in some cases, as in vertebrates, where FoxC specifies the dorsal mesoderm and derivatives, while FoxF patterns the lateral mesoderm and derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zinzen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fritzenwanker et al., 2014</xref>). In the sea urchin, where a cluster of <italic>FoxC</italic>, <italic>FoxF</italic>, and <italic>FoxL1</italic> genes is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrikou et al., 2013</xref>), we witness a similar regulatory logic where the different Fox factors pattern in an overlapping fashion in different compartments of the coelomic pouches. This cluster was probably expressed initially in developing mesodermal tissues and further evolved in regulating the specification and compartmentalization of mesodermal derivatives. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of the hierarchical position of the Fox family factors in the GRN. The expression patterns and sequential activation of <italic>FoxC, FoxF</italic>, and <italic>FoxL1</italic> genes in time reflect the linkage properties of the retained cluster: among the three genes, <italic>FoxC</italic> is the first to be turned on in the myogenic lineage and is necessary for the activation of the downstream factors <italic>FoxF</italic> and <italic>FoxL1,</italic> which are inter-regulated. The outcome of such complex inter-wiring GRN may contribute to the establishment of a more robust output, able to mask putative perturbations of single nodes, as recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Macneil and Walhout, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Exclusion of alternative NSM fates</title><p>This study provides additional insights into understanding the logic of the exclusive mechanisms that occur in the sea urchin embryo during myoblast specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davidson, 2009</xref>). By 24 hr post fertilization, the separation of the different NSM regulatory states is defined. The vegetal plate of the embryo consists of four distinct NSM cell populations: the aboral part that occupies about two-thirds of the total cells will differentiate into the pigment cells; the oral part that consists of the remaining one-third of the total cells will become the blastocoelar cells; the four SMs in the center are primordial germ cells; approximately 2–3 cells in the oral/lateral domain of the periphery of the vegetal plate will give rise to the myoblast precursors. As showed elsewhere, the specification of the distinct NSM domains depends on D/N and Nodal signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sherwood and McClay, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ransick and Davidson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duboc et al., 2010</xref>). At 9 hr post fertilization, Delta ligand produced by the skeletogenic mesoderm activates a D/N cascade, which subsequently initiates <italic>Gcm</italic> and <italic>GataE</italic> transcription in all NSM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ransick and Davidson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). Later, at 24 hr, the NSM GRN becomes regionalized into distinct oral and aboral NSM GRNs in consequence of Nodal signaling through the immediate expression of a Nodal target, <italic>Not</italic>, in the oral NSM. This causes the repression of the aboral GRN in the oral NSM cells, and the aboral NSM cells still express <italic>Gcm</italic> and <italic>Gat</italic>aE as part of the regulatory state of the pigment cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Materna et al., 2013</xref>). In the oral NSM, the expression of a new suite of regulatory genes is taking place that belong to the blastocoelar lineage GRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Solek et al., 2013</xref>). Our study showed that in the periphery of the oral/lateral NSM, the appearance of 2–3 unspecified cells is evident. These cells will soon get specified, at 28/30 hr, by receiving an inductive FGF signaling at the moment of gastrulation. FGF signal reception together with the double-negative gate caused by the repressive action of factor X on NSMR leads to the transcriptional activation of <italic>FoxY</italic> and <italic>FoxC</italic> expression. Positive inputs from <italic>FoxY</italic> and <italic>FoxC</italic> genes into downstream effectors promote the recruitment of the myogenic genes and lock down the myoblast regulatory state. Genes such as <italic>Scl, Dachs, Pitx2</italic>, and <italic>Not</italic> that belong to different NSM regulatory states are excluded from the myogenic domain leaving only the muscle GRN operating. Finally, spatial repression circuits generate regulatory transitions in the expression of key genes such as <italic>FoxY, Nanos, SoxE</italic>, and <italic>Six1/2,</italic> which now are established only in the other NSM GRNs. The sea urchin myogenic GRN is a nice example of how dynamic developmental processes can be encoded in the genome and shows clearly that understanding in depth the wiring properties of a developmental GRN model can provide a comprehensive view on the relationship between the regulatory architecture and gene expression dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Rewiring the myogenic GRN over evolutionary time</title><p>The nature of the evolutionary alterations that arise from regulatory changes depends on the hierarchical positions of these changes within a GRN. One of the most striking findings of this study concerns the paradox that genes are constantly re-used in the same context, but are rewired in different networks. Despite the conserved regulatory modules found in the system, the myogenic GRN structure has diverged extensively among animal groups. As a consequence, the level of the functional importance of the homologous transcriptional regulators (e.g., <italic>Six1/2</italic> in sea urchin and <italic>Ceh-34</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> or MyoD in vertebrates and <italic>Nautilus</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) (this study, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Olson and Klein, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balagopalan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amin et al., 2009</xref>]), as reflected from the position within the GRN, is often diversified. New, lineage-specific genes are recruited (<italic>FoxY</italic> in sea urchin), and ‘master regulatory genes’ either have been lost completely (e.g., the absence of <italic>Pax3/7</italic> ortholog in the sea urchin) or lose their hierarchical position within the network (e.g., <italic>Nautilus</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>MyoD</italic> in vertebrates), with the level of complexity to be reflected in the wiring density and in the GRN organization. However, the fact that the same factors are used over and over again in such different animal systems indicates that the modular components are somehow required for keeping their myogenic activity during evolutionary time. It seems that as transcription factor families expanded and functionally diversified during evolution, the ancestral myogenic function may have been preserved in a more distant family member, rather than the homologous gene, providing the system with several regulatory alternatives, and explaining the high degree of evolutionary plasticity of developmental GRN architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrikou and Arnone, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this large scale GRN analysis demonstrated a necessary hierarchical role for a large number of transcriptional regulators in muscle development and explained in a rational way the core gene network that is orchestrating the specification of the myogenic lineage. Moreover, it revealed the key signaling events involved in the activation of the muscle gene battery and underlined their crucial role in transforming an unspecified cell into a specific cell type with a characteristic molecular signature. Finally, this study reinforces the importance of GRN-based approach in understanding in detail complex developmental processes by assessing the causality of the regulatory mechanisms that accompany each step of the process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal husbandry and embryo cultures</title><p>Adult <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> were obtained from Patrick Leahy (Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA) and housed in circulating seawater aquaria in the Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn of Naples.

(subject to the approval of the authors). An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Logics and properties of a genetic regulatory program that drives embryonic muscle development in an echinoderm” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two peer reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before reaching their decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>To be acceptable for publication the manuscript requires substantial revision. We recognise that it represents a large amount of work and appreciate the new insights that it provides into the GRN underlying entry into myogeneis in the sea urchin model. However, the results are over-interpreted and parts of the data are not sufficiently validated for inclusion in the GRN, which requires at least one repeat experiment and preferably by an independent test. This is particularly the case for Hh and SFRP/Wnt signaling as well as Pitx2 and other factors. The FGF data are also unsatisfactory since it is not clear which Ets factor mediates the signal. It is also not clear why, based on the authors criteria for inclusion, some genes are excluded. Why for example is FoxC included and FoxF excluded. A detailed list of data points to be re-examined is given at the end of this letter.</p><p>Another concern of the reviewers is the morpholino data and the controls. It would be more convincing if more than one morpholino was shown to give the same phenotype. Knockdown of a GFP expressing construct, containing a sequence recognised by the morpholino is not sufficient and the use of a control morpholino simply shows that toxicity is not a problem for a batch of embryos.</p><p>Overall the key nodal points should be presented based on solid validation and everything else should be eliminated, with a discussion that now focusses on the key points instead of an extensive and confusing discussion of weak data. We hope that you can modify the manuscript along these lines.</p><p>The following concerns have to be dealt with:</p><p>1) If you apply the rule of more data points being necessary for inclusion, what else would fall out? Or, what might be included that is not currently included?</p><p>FoxY -&gt; SoxE which also is projected in one location where SoxE is located but not in the other, yet the RNA you obtain includes both regions.</p><p>FoxY -&gt;Gatae; FoxC -&gt;SoxE; FoxY-&gt;SoxE; Six1/2-|Not; FoxL1-|FoxY</p><p>FoxL1-&gt;Pitx2 which you don't include but it is significant by your rules. So, why is this one not included when the others above it are? By the rule of more than one it would be as it is, not included.</p><p>FoxL1-&gt;Srfp</p><p>FoxL1-&gt;MyoR is included though your data doesn't show significance by your rules, and only one data point is significant by the rule of more than 2 fold.</p><p>FoxF-|Not is included even though it doesn't reach significance by your rules and also doesn't reach significance by the rule of needing more than one data point.</p><p>FoxF-&gt;Pitx2 is not included even though by your rules it should be, but by the rule of more than one, it should not.</p><p>FoxC-&gt;FoxF is included even though it should not be by your rules, and the one data point you have is supplied by the in situ. If the in situ is to be accepted there should be an indication that what is shown is not simply “best case” but a consistent finding.</p><p>FoxY-&gt;FoxL1 is not included though by your rules it should be and it also should be by the rule of more than one.</p><p>FoxY-&gt;MyoR is not included yet is one of the strongest knockdown effects you see.</p><p>All told, you model 29 connections in the 44 hr GRN, yet there are 14 questionable connections due to only one data point without confirmation, or by not including a connection according to your rules when a point should be included by those rules.</p><p>2) Situations exist where a perturbation has a very strong effect in the above, or at least a consistent effect, yet you don't include that connection. For example FoxY knockdowns have a very strong effect on expression of FoxF at 44 hrs – even stronger, relatively, than on FoxC – yet FoxC is included and FoxF is not. You make the call that FoxC has an input into FoxF and could argue that it is through that connection that FoxF is knocked down in FoxY MO. Though you have a connection there, your FoxC knockdowns don't show significance in knocking down FoxF. Since we are looking for consistency in the calls, this doesn't make sense.</p><p>3) For the 48 hr GRN the following data points do not satisfy your rules, or fail if a requirement of more than one data point is included.</p><p>MyoD-|Pitx2</p><p>FoxF-|FoxY</p><p>FoxF-&gt;MyoD</p><p>FoxF-| Not is included though is not significant by your rules.</p><p>FoxY-&gt;FoxL1 is not included though by your rules it should be.</p><p>FoxY-&gt;MyoD is not included though by your rules it should be; by the rule of needing more than one data point it should not be.</p><p>FoxY-&gt;Scratch is not included though by your rules it should be.</p><p>FoxY-&gt;MyoR is not included though by your rules it should be.</p><p>FoxL1-|FoxY not included though should be by your rules.</p><p>FoxL1-&gt;Pitx2 not included though should be by your rules.</p><p>FoxL1-|Not is included though goes against your rules.</p><p>Six1/2-|Dach is not included though by your rules it should be; by the rule of more than one data point it should not be.</p><p>Six1/2-|FoxY is not included though by your rules it should be. By rule of more than one it should not be.</p><p>Six1/2-|Not not included though by your rules it should be. By rule of more than one it should not be.</p><p>Tbx6-&gt;Pitx2 is not included though by your rules it should be.</p><p>Tbx6-&gt;MyoR is not included though by your rules it should be.</p><p>FoxY-&gt;twist is included though only one data point.</p><p>In this 45-48 hr GRN model, of 26 connections modeled, 17 connections are in question. 11 of those 17 are connections not included though by your rules they should be. It appears that even though you include all the data, your model is selective by not adhering to a set of rules. You have to apply consistent rules, and we strongly suggest for confidence that you adhere to a rule where more than one data point must be necessary to have some confidence that a call is likely to be correct.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07343.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>To be acceptable for publication the manuscript requires substantial revision.

We have reinterpreted the data in a consistent way as suggested. We also rewrote the part about FGF/Ets and its downstream factors. Detailed explanation specific to each point is addressed below.</p><p><italic>Another concern of the reviewers is the morpholino data and the controls. It would be more convincing if more than one morpholino was shown to give the same phenotype. Knockdown of a GFP expressing construct, containing a sequence recognised by the morpholino is not sufficient and the use of a control morpholino simply shows that toxicity is not a problem for a batch of embryos</italic>.</p><p>We have used second anti translation morpholinos targeted to FoxC, FoxF, FoxL1, Six1/2, and Tbx6 to validate our results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1 fig4s4">Figure 4–figure supplement 1, 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The same phenotype (reduction of the muscle fibers) has been observed when the second morpholinos were injected into the embryos.</p><p><italic>Overall the key nodal points should be presented based on solid validation and everything else should be eliminated, with a discussion that now focusses on the key points instead of an extensive and confusing discussion of weak data. We hope that you can modify the manuscript along these lines</italic>.</p><p><italic>The following concerns have to be dealt with</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) If you apply the rule of more data points being necessary for inclusion, what else would fall out? Or, what might be included that is not currently included?</italic></p><p>We have applied a new rule in which at least two data points showed more than two-fold changes (&lt;0.5 or &gt;2 fold difference) would be included in the network. The data are obtained in three different ways, including Nanostring measurements, QPCR analyses, and in situ hybridization.</p><p><italic>FoxY -&gt; SoxE which also is projected in one location where SoxE is located but not in the other yet the RNA you obtain includes both regions</italic>.</p><p>According to the new rule, we have removed the link from FoxY to SoxE at 44 h but added such link in both domains at 48 h network.</p><p><italic>FoxY -&gt;Gatae</italic></p><p>The link has been removed.</p><p><italic>FoxC -&gt;SoxE</italic></p><p>The link has been removed.</p><p><italic>FoxY-&gt;SoxE</italic></p><p>The link has been removed.</p><p><italic>Six1/2-|Not</italic></p><p>The link has been removed.</p><p><italic>FoxL1-|FoxY</italic></p><p>We have removed the link at 44 h but added such link at 48 h network.</p><p><italic>FoxL1-&gt;Pitx2 which you don't include but it is significant by your rules. So, why is this one not included when the others above it are? By the rule of more than one it would be as it is, not included.</italic></p><p>We have removed the link based on the new rule.</p><p><italic>FoxL1-&gt;Srfp</italic></p><p>The link has been removed.</p><p><italic>FoxL1-&gt;MyoR is included though your data doesn't show significance by your rules, and only one data point is significant by the rule of more than 2 fold</italic>.</p><p>The link has been removed.</p><p><italic>FoxF-|Not is included even though it doesn't reach significance by your rules and also doesn't reach significance by the rule of needing more than one data point</italic>.</p><p>We have removed the link based on the new rule.</p><p><italic>FoxF-&gt;Pitx2 is not included even though by your rules it should be, but by the rule of more than one, it should not</italic>.</p><p>We have removed the link based on the new rule.</p><p><italic>FoxC-&gt;FoxF is included even though it should not be by your rules, and the one data point you have is supplied by the in situ. If the in situ is to be accepted there should be an indication that what is shown is not simply “best case” but a consistent finding</italic>.</p><p>We have performed new experiments using QPCR to confirm the link (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 6–source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, based on in situ data and QPCR, we have validated the link.</p><p><italic>FoxY-&gt;FoxL1 is not included though by your rules it should be and it also should be by the rule of more than one</italic>.</p><p>We have added the link in both 44 and 48 network.</p><p><italic>FoxY-&gt;MyoR is not included yet is one of the strongest knockdown effects you see</italic>.</p><p>We have added the link in both 44 and 48 network.</p><p><italic>2) Situations exist where a perturbation has a very strong effect in the above, or at least a consistent effect, yet you don't include that connection. For example FoxY knockdowns have a very strong effect on expression of FoxF at 44 hrs – even stronger, relatively, than on FoxC – yet FoxC is included and FoxF is not. You make the call that FoxC has an input into FoxF and could argue that it is through that connection that FoxF is knocked down in FoxY MO. Though you have a connection there, your FoxC knockdowns don't show significance in knocking down FoxF. Since we are looking for consistency in the calls, this doesn't make sense</italic>.</p><p>We have added the link from FoxY to FoxF at 44 h. The link from FoxC to FoxF at 44 h is retained because in addition to one supporting data from Nanostring measurement, two biological replicates analyzed by QPCR showed strong effects.</p><p><italic>3) For the 48 hr GRN the following data points do not satisfy your rules, or fail if a requirement of more than one data point is included</italic>.</p><p><italic>MyoD-|Pitx2</italic></p><p>The link has been removed.</p><p><italic>FoxF-|FoxY</italic></p><p>This link is retained because, in addition to one supporting data from Nanostring measurement, two biological replicates analyzed by QPCR showed strong effects.</p><p><italic>FoxF-&gt;MyoD</italic></p><p>The link has been removed.</p><p><italic>FoxF-| Not is included though is not significant by your rules</italic>.</p><p>The link has been removed.</p><p><italic>FoxY-&gt;FoxL1 is not included though by your rules it should be</italic>.</p><p>We have added the link.</p><p><italic>FoxY-&gt;MyoD is not included though by your rules it should be; by the rule of needing more than one data point it should not be</italic>.</p><p>The link has been removed because only one data point supported.</p><p><italic>FoxY-&gt;Scratch is not included though by your rules it should be</italic>.</p><p>We have added the link.</p><p><italic>FoxY-&gt;MyoR is not included though by your rules it should be</italic>.</p><p>We have added the link.</p><p><italic>FoxL1-|FoxY not included though should be by your rules</italic>.</p><p>We have added the link.</p><p><italic>FoxL1-&gt;Pitx2 not included though should be by your rules</italic>.</p><p>We have added the link.</p><p><italic>FoxL1-|Not is included though goes against your rules</italic>.</p><p>The link is retained because two of the three biological replicates measured by Nanostring showed strong effects.</p><p><italic>Six1/2-|Dach is not included though by your rules it should be; by the rule of more than one data point it should not be</italic>.</p><p>By the rule of more than one data point we decided not to include the link.</p><p><italic>Six1/2-|FoxY is not included though by your rules it should be.

It appears that even though you include all the data, your model is selective by not adhering to a set of rules. You have to apply consistent rules, and we strongly suggest for confidence that you adhere to a rule where more than one data point must be necessary to have some confidence that a call is likely to be correct</italic>.</p><p>We thank the editors and reviewers for the great suggestion. We have now adhered to the rule of at least two data points must be necessary to have the links being included in the network.</p></body></sub-article></article>
