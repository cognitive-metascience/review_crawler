phosphorylations are proposed to induce a reduction in PTEN’s plasma membrane recruitment. How these phosphorylations affect the structure and enzymatic function of PTEN is poorly understood. To gain insight into the mechanistic basis of PTEN regulation by phosphorylation, we generated semisynthetic site-specifically tetra-phosphorylated PTEN using expressed protein ligation. By employing a combination of biophysical and enzymatic approaches, we have found that purified tail-phosphorylated PTEN relative to its unphosphorylated counterpart shows reduced catalytic activity and membrane affinity and undergoes conformational compaction likely involving an intramolecular interaction between its C-tail and the C2 domain. Our results suggest that there is a competition between membrane phospholipids and PTEN phospho-tail for binding to the C2 domain. These findings reveal a key aspect of PTEN’s regulation and suggest pharmacologic approaches for direct PTEN activation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00691.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00691.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00691.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>PTEN is an enzyme that is found in almost every tissue in the body, and its job is to stop cells dividing. If it fails to perform this job, the uncontrolled proliferation of cells can lead to the growth of tumors. PTEN stops cells dividing by localizing at the plasma membrane of a cell and removing a phosphate group from a lipid called PIP<sub>3</sub>: this sends a signal, via the PI3K pathway, that suppresses the replication and survival of cells.</p><p>Three regions of PTEN are thought to be central to its biological functions: one of these regions, the phosphatase domain, is directly responsible for removing a phosphate group from the lipid PIP<sub>3</sub>; a second region, called the C2 domain, is known to be critical for PTEN binding to the cell membrane; however, the role of third region, called the C-terminal domain, is poorly understood.</p><p>Many proteins are regulated by the addition and removal of phosphate groups, and PTEN is no exception. In particular, it seems as if the addition of phosphate groups to four amino acid residues in the C-terminal domain can switch off the activity of PTEN, but the details of this process have been elusive.</p><p>Now, Bolduc et al. have employed a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques to explore this process, finding that the addition of the phosphate groups reduced PTEN’s affinity for the plasma membrane. At the same time, interactions between the C-terminal and C2 domains of the PTEN cause the shape of the enzyme to change in a way that ‘buries’ the residues to which the phosphate groups have been added.</p><p>In addition to offering new insights into PTEN, the work of Bolduc et al. could help efforts to identify compounds with clinical anti-cancer potential.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00691.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00691.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>lipid phosphatase</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cole</surname><given-names>Philip</given-names></name><name><surname>Devreotes</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4R37CA043460</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gabelli</surname><given-names>Sandra B</given-names></name><name><surname>Amzel</surname><given-names>L Mario</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>C-terminal phosphorylation of the lipid phosphatase PTEN drives a reduction in membrane affinity and leads to a more compact conformation that involves a C2 domain-tail interaction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) suppresses cell proliferation, migration and survival by dephosphorylating the lipid second messenger phosphatidyl inositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), thereby opposing phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling and preventing AKT protein kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maehama and Dixon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Myers et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iijima and Devreotes, 2002</xref>). PTEN is one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer, with inactivating mutations found in many solid tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Steck et al., 1997</xref>).

Germline mutations in PTEN predispose people to spontaneous tumor formation as seen in Cowden syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nelen et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>PTEN is a 47 kDa (403 aa) protein composed of a ‘dual-specificity’ phosphatase domain, a C2 domain that mediates membrane association, and a 52 aa C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). An X-ray structure of PTEN, lacking the apparently flexible N-terminus (aa 1–13), internal D-loop (aa 286–309) and C-tail (aa 353–403), shows tight-knit interactions between the catalytic and C2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 1999</xref>). The PTEN protein is believed to be regulated by a variety of mechanisms including post-translational modifications, protein–protein interactions, and protein–lipid interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campbell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iijima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Walker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vazquez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Denning et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chagpar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shenoy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Song et al., 2012</xref>). Previously mapped PTEN post-translational modifications include phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vazquez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Torres and Pulido, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Kouri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cordier et al., 2012</xref>), acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okumura et al., 2006</xref>), ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2007</xref>), and sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Phosphorylation of a cluster of Ser/Thr residues (Ser380, Thr382, Thr383, and Ser385) on PTEN’s C-terminal tail have received considerable attention in studies on PTEN regulation and appears to be a major modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vazquez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Odriozola et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rahdar et al., 2009</xref>).

While the molecular mechanism of how this is achieved is uncertain, altered protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vazquez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sumitomo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takahashi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Diepen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2012</xref>) as well as conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Odriozola et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rahdar et al., 2009</xref>) in PTEN have been suggested to be induced by phosphorylation. It has been unclear if phosphorylation of PTEN has a direct effect on membrane association or is indirectly mediated through other macromolecular interactions. Most PTEN phosphorylation analyses have relied on cellular transfection experiments in which replacement of the Ser and Thr residues with Ala have been indirect indicators of phosphorylation function. However, Ser and Thr have different properties from Ala and such mutations may be misleading in deducing the action of a phosphoSer/phosphoThr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vazquez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Torres and Pulido, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Khouri et al., 2005</xref>). What has been lacking thus far is a biochemical analysis of purified phosphorylated PTEN in which the phosphorylation sites are well-defined in position and stoichiometry. Inherent challenges in obtaining this material include the difficulty in using kinases for introducing phosphates site-specifically into PTEN and the proposed potential for PTEN autodephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). To circumvent these issues, we employ here expressed protein ligation, a method for protein semisynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwarzer and Cole, 2005</xref>), for generating 380,382,383,385-tetraphosphorylated-PTEN (4p-PTEN). Expressed protein ligation involves the production of a recombinant protein carrying a C-terminal thioester by exploiting the action of an intein, and its chemoselective ligation to an N-Cys containing synthetic peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Muir et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vila-Perelló and Muir, 2010</xref>). Within the synthetic peptide, phosphoSer/phosphoThr can be installed using standard chemical techniques at specific locations. We show here that, relative to the unphosphorylated form, 4p-PTEN adopts a more compact conformation in which the C-tail appears to interact with the C2 domain in a fashion that reduces its affinity for lipid membranes and diminishes its catalytic activity.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00691.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of semisynthetic PTEN proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PTEN is composed of phosphatase domain, a C2 domain, and a C-terminal tail that is phosphorylated multiple times within a cluster of Ser and Thr residues (S380/T382/T383/S385).

Semisynthetic proteins were &gt;90% pure using Coomassie staining and their structural integrity confirmed by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). Western blot with commercial anti-phospho-PTEN Ab showed that 4p-PTEN, and not n-PTEN, was appropriately phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). It should also be noted that baculovirus systems have rarely been used for intein expression vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pradhan et al., 1999</xref>), possibly in part because of the expression of chitinase in these hosts which interferes with the standard chitin affinity purification scheme. Nevertheless, we found the presence of chitinase to be a surmountable issue by a chromatographic pre-clearing step with a bed of fibrous cellulose. We also found that High Five insect cells rather than the more typical SF9 insect cells were critical for robust expression. Despite the theoretical concern about autodephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), 4p-PTEN prepared in the presence of a PTEN phosphatase vanadate-based inhibitor was equally phosphorylated to that prepared in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Further experiments showed that 4p-PTEN did not undergo spontaneous pSer/pThr hydrolysis over 24 hr as monitored by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Enzymatic characterization of 4p-PTEN</title><p>Initial analysis of 4p-PTEN catalytic activity was carried out with a soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate containing hexanoyl rather than the more physiological palmitoyl chains using a phosphate release detection assay with malachite green (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Van Veldhoven and Mannaert, 1987</xref>).

In the course of purification of our semisynthetic PTENs by anion exchange chromatography, we made the paradoxical observation that the tetraphosphorylated PTEN reproducibly eluted at an earlier elution volume (∼70 ml and lower salt concentration, 90 mM NaCl) and more sharply relative to the unphosphorylated protein (∼100 ml, 140 mM NaCl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Elution of n-PTEN as one large peak followed by multiple small peaks was attributed to minor heterogeneous insect cell-mediated phosphorylation in the recombinant tail moiety on and near Thr366 and Ser370 as detected with a site-specific Ab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). A similar elution pattern was observed with t-PTEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This heterogeneity is presumably collapsed under one peak in 4p-PTEN. Since 4p-PTEN has a nominal eight negative charge increase relative to n-PTEN, we were surprised that 4p-PTEN showed decreased affinity to cationic resin. One explanation for this result is that, relative to n-PTEN, 4p-PTEN undergoes a conformational change which buries its negatively charged C-tail, reducing its availability for interacting with cationic resin.

Semisynthetic phospho- and unphosphorylated PTEN containing four mutations K13A, R14A, R15A, and R161A (‘N-mutant’) was constructed to test the possibility that these basic residues in the N-terminus, co-localized in the crystal structure and implicated in phospholipid binding, might be critical in stabilizing the closed 4p-PTEN conformation.

With respect to anion exchange chromatography, D5 mutant 4p-PTEN eluted broadly with much of the protein eluting at higher NaCl concentrations than the unphosphorylated D5 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Later elution is the expected profile for a typical phosphorylated protein relative to an unphosphorylated protein compared with the paradoxical pattern for n- and 4p- semisynthetic PTENs. In addition, D5 mutant 4p-PTEN was dephosphorylated about eightfold faster than the native wt 4p-PTEN and only threefold slower than denatured wt 4p-PTEN, implying that the tail phosphate cluster is dramatically more exposed in the D5 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure Supplement 3</xref>). We considered the possibility that Asp substitutions of the Lys residues in the D5 mutant led to overall protein destabilization and denaturation. However, D5- mutant 4p-PTEN readily processed soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate, ∼threefold faster than wt and A5-mutant 4p-PTENs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Moreover, the D5-mutant 4p-PTEN phosphatase activity showed saturation with soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), with catalytic parameters approaching those of n-PTEN, consistent with a more open conformation than that of wt 4p-PTEN. Taken together, these results make clear that the penta-Asp substitutions in the CBRIII loop are non-denaturing but can significantly disrupt the closed conformation of 4p-PTEN, presumably by electrostatic repulsion of the anionic tail. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campbell et al., 2003</xref>), the activity of the N-mutant which contains mutations of K13, R14, and R15 to alanine, is reduced compared to wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Intermolecular interactions between t-PTEN and C-tail phosphopeptide</title><p>We investigated the possibility that the synthetic C-tail tetraphosphorylated peptide (aa 379–403, 4p-25mer) used in ligation could modulate the activity of truncated (t-PTEN, aa 1–378) in an intermolecular fashion using the soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate phosphatase assay. In this assay, t-PTEN showed similar behavior to n-PTEN, with saturable kinetics as a function of soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig7">Figures 7B and 2A</xref>). Of note, the C-tail phosphopeptide 4p-25mer, but not the unphosphorylated peptide n-25mer, was a potent inhibitor of t-PTEN soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> phosphatase activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> ∼ 1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Analogous to its effects on t-PTEN phosphatase activity, 4p-25mer but not n-25mer inhibited t-PTEN binding to PIP<sub>2</sub> vesicles, although less potently presumably because of competition for binding surfaces on the body of PTEN between the vesicle lipids and the 4p-25mer tail peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

The combined structural data including ion exchange chromatographic behavior, trypsin protease susceptibility, alkaline phosphatase sensitivity, and SAXS analysis point to a more compact 4p-PTEN relative to n-PTEN in which the phosphates on the tail are concealed.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00691.025</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of PTEN regulation by phosphorylation.</title><p>Upon phosphorylation, PTEN adopts a more compact conformation with the phosphorylated tail condensing around the CBRIII loop and membrane binding surface of the C2 domain, preventing it from binding to the plasma membrane.

The SAXS results suggest that phospho-tail is in close proximity to the C2 domain. Replacement of the PTEN Lys cluster of the CBRIII loop with Asp residues (5D mutant) but not Ala residues (5A mutant) in 4p-PTEN renders the phospho-tail more susceptible to alkaline phosphatase hydrolysis, presumably because the anionic phosphate tail clashes with the Asp carboxylate negative charges. The intermolecular effects of the 4p-25mer C-tail on the t-PTEN body and their reduced sensitivity conferred by CBRIII loop mutation further corroborate the phospho-tail–C2 interaction. Prior studies suggest that the five clustered Lys residues of the CBRIII loop are found on the membrane binding surface of the C2 domain, and their mutation decreases PTEN binding to lipid vesicles in vitro and plasma membranes in cell transfection experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McConnachie et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>It is within the realm of possibility that 4p-PTEN can bind to membrane in its closed conformation, albeit with significantly reduced affinity. Our best evidence against the possibility that conformationally closed 4p-PTEN binds membrane is that the interfacial K<sub>m</sub>s (i<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>s) for 4p-PTEN, n-PTEN, and t-PTEN are all the same, within error, in dephosphorylating vesicle-bound PIP<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Since the K<sub>m</sub>s for soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> dephosphorylation are different for 4p-PTEN and n-PTEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), it would be surprising that the i<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>s would be the same if the conformation of 4p-PTEN were closed when bound to vesicle. It is plausible, however, that some closed 4p-PTEN with reduced membrane affinity is interacting with vesicle while in a catalytically impaired state, which would contribute only in a minor way to the i<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>. Nevertheless, we also know how important the CBRIII loop is for membrane binding which, as discussed above, is likely abutting the phospho-tail in the closed conformation. Thus, the information available strongly supports the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><p>We observed here that C-terminal phosphorylation of PTEN significantly reduces the enzyme’s lipid bilayer affinity and also its catalytic efficiency with soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate and at low (&lt;1 mol%) PIP<sub>3</sub> surface concentrations in vesicles. Since physiologic membrane surface concentrations of PIP<sub>3</sub> are in the range of 0.001 mol% or less, C-terminal phosphorylation of PTEN should confer an important reduction in enzymatic activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rahdar et al., 2009</xref>). It is interesting that the soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> K<sub>m</sub> for 4p-PTEN vs n-PTEN is elevated whereas the interfacial K<sub>m</sub> (i<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) with vesicles containing PIP<sub>3</sub> is the same for both enzyme forms. Both the trypsin protease pattern and SAXS analysis of 4p-PTEN vs n-PTEN reveal apparent structural/dynamic changes within the catalytic domain upon phosphorylation that may account for the altered phosphatase properties. Such conformational changes in the catalytic domain upon phosphorylation may come from direct interactions with the tail, though they could also be transmitted allosterically through tail-C2 binding since the C2 domain makes intimate contacts with the catalytic domain. It should be noted that the CBRIII loop, while critical for vesicle interaction, is dispensable for soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate processing, as shown here and previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McConnachie et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, there are at least some differences between interactions of PTEN with soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> and membrane-embedded PIP<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>Results from previous experiments involving co-immunoprecipitation of the co-transfected PTEN tail and body as separate pieces hinted at the potential of a conformational change induced by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rahdar et al., 2009</xref>). However, in contrast to the findings here, the co-immunoprecipitation of the PTEN tail and body was disrupted by the altered residues in the N-mutant and A5-mutant PTENs. Since the N-mutant and A5-mutant 4p-PTENs showed the same apparent closed equilibrium constant as wt 4p-PTEN, this suggests that there may be differences in this trans interaction identified in mammalian cell extracts vs the closed conformation of the intact 4p-PTEN molecule analyzed in the current study. Indeed, we found higher than expected apparent affinity between the 4p-25mer and the t-PTEN body (IC<sub>50</sub> 1 μM) and more complete inhibition (&gt;95%) of the lipid phosphatase activity of t-PTEN by the 4p-25mer with soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate than would be predicted based on results with 4p-PTEN (4p-PTEN:n-PTEN activity was ∼6:1). The ∼25:1 equilibrium favoring the closed conformation of 4p-PTEN based on alkaline phosphatase susceptibility seems relatively small compared with an apparent K<sub>d</sub> of ∼1 μM for the 4p-25mer-t-PTEN intermolecular interaction. Such results may suggest structural differences in the intermolecular complex vs the intramolecular conformational change. While there are several plausible explanations for this, one interesting possibility is that there may be energetic strain associated with achieving conformational closure in the intramolecular case of 4p-PTEN not associated with a phospho-tail–t-PTEN intermolecular interaction.</p><p>Long-range intramolecular protein conformational switching induced by phosphorylation has been observed in several well-established cases including CrkL, Src, and SHP-1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rosen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sicheri et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). Each of these examples involves an SH2 domain interacting with a phosphotyrosine. We propose a Src-like model for PTEN, in which a cluster of pSer/pThr drives an apparently long distance intramolecular binding interaction to deactivate the enzyme. How 4p-PTEN may be reactivated in vivo remains an important question. There are presumably cellular phosphatase enzymes that can dephosphorylate phospho-PTEN or ligands which can bind allosterically to phospho-PTEN that may promote conformational opening. In contrast to prior suggestions based on trans experiments, we see no evidence of the autodephosphorylation of 4p-PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). As we are reliant on western blots with an antibody that may recognize states of depleted phosphorylation of the tail, partial autodephosphorylation cannot be completely ruled out by our experiments. However, the stability of the closed conformation of 4p-PTEN over the dozens of hours of expressed protein ligation points to resistance of the tail phosphates to PTEN enzymatic removal. Because of the structural concealment of the 380–5 phosphoSer/Thr residues in the closed 4p-PTEN conformation, such autodephosphorylation may be especially disfavored.</p><p>There are several biomedical implications of the findings here. Altered protein–protein interactions or efficiency of ubiquitylation may be influenced by phosphorylation-mediated conformational closure of phospho-PTEN. While PTEN is a tumor suppressor and can be mutated in cancer, it is often wild type but expressed at low levels. Direct stimulation of cellular phospho-PTEN by pharmacologic agents could prove to be effective as an anti-cancer therapy. A related approach has been explored to activate the tumor suppressor p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foster et al., 1999</xref>) and the apoptotic protein procaspase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gray et al., 2010</xref>). It may be possible to find small molecules that bind specifically to the phospho-tail and prevent its intramolecular engagement with the C2 domain or bind somewhere on the PTEN body and stabilize the open PTEN conformation allosterically. The soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate dephosphorylation assay with 4p-PTEN should provide a means for screening for such activators. Alternatively, inhibitors of CK2 and/or GSK3β protein kinase, the enzymes responsible for PTEN C-tail phosphorylation, may be effective in targeting PIP<sub>3</sub>/Akt-driven tumors.</p><p>This investigation also highlights the use of intein-mediated protein thioester formation in an insect cell expression system for investigation of post-translational modifications.

C-terminally truncated PTEN (t-PTEN) was generated by DTT cleavage of the fusion protein, producing t-PTEN at yields of ∼8–10 mg per liter of cell culture. Full length semisynthetic PTEN was then generated on the chitin column by adding 400 mM MESNA and 2 mM of C-terminal peptide buffered with 3 ml of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl. Based on the post ligation yield of PTEN protein it is estimated that there is a maximum PTEN-thioester concentration of ∼80 μM in the ligation reaction. The ligation reactions were carried out for 48–72 hr at room temperature and monitored by SDS PAGE. Upon completion of the ligation reaction the ligation mixture was eluted from the chromatography column with 15 ml of dialysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT) and subsequently dialyzed into 4 l of dialysis buffer for a period of 48 hr with multiple buffer exchanges in a dialysis cassette (Slidealyzer) with a 12K MWCO in order to remove excess unreacted peptide. Proteins were then concentrated following dialysis to &gt;5 mg/ml (&gt;100 μM). We estimate that there is &lt;10 μM of residual unligated peptides at this stage. Due to large dilutions (&gt;1000-fold) of the semisynthetic enzyme for enzymatic and other biochemical assays, small amounts of residual contaminating peptide remaining after dialysis would not be expected to interfere with any assays. Semisynthetic PTEN proteins produced in this way yields 8–10 mg of protein per liter of insect cell culture with the desired modifications on the C-terminus at purities of &gt;90% based on Coomassie stained SDSPAGE. The semisynthetic protein was further purified for SAXS and soluble substrate assays by anion exchange chromatography (monoQ) using an AKTA FPLC from GE Healthcare. Proteins were purified with a gradient of 0–50% Buffer B over 250 ml at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min (Buffer A: 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM DTT; Buffer B: 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1.0 M NaCl, 10 mM DTT). After FPLC purification by anion exchange chromatography and concentration the final yield of semisynthetic PTEN protein was 2–3 mg per liter of cell culture with estimated purity &gt;95% by coomassie stained SDS-PAGE. Size-exclusion chromatography was carried out with a Superdex 200 column in the following buffer: 50 mM Tris pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Generation of radiolabed PIP<sub>3</sub></title><p>Radiolabeled PIP<sub>3</sub> was generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McConnache et al., 2003</xref>). Briefly, PIP<sub>3</sub> labeled with <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> at the three position of the inositol ring was generated by incubating PI3K (Echleon) and PIP<sub>2</sub>:PS (1:1) vesicles in the presence of 250 mCi <sup>32</sup>P-ATP, 1 mM ATP and 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in PI3K assay buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 120 mM NaCl and 1 mM EGTA).

Lipids were sonicated in 100 μl volumes in glass test tubes at room temperature until the solution clarified. Vesicles made in this way are 30–50 nm in diameter. Vesicles were used in assays within 15 min of being made. In assay reactions, the ratio of the number of vesicles to the number of PTEN molecules was maintained at 4:1 or greater. Ovalbumin (0.05 mg/ml) was used to stabilize the PTEN protein in the assays. 25 μl reactions were initiated by the addition of vesicle substrate and incubated at 30°C for 3 min. The reaction was quenched with 3 M perchloric acid. Hydrolyzed <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> was then separated from <sup>32</sup>P-PIP<sub>3</sub> by a Bligh–Dyer extraction. The aqueous phase was then treated with 1% ammonium molybdate and the resulting phosphate–molybdate complex was extracted with toluene:isobutanol (1:1). This organic phase was then counted using a Beckman scintillation counter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Interfacial kinetic analysis</title><p>Analysis of the kinetic parameters of the semisynthetic PTEN proteins were determined in accordance with the procedures pioneered by Dennis and coworkers and previously performed for recombinant PTEN produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deems et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hendrickson and Dennis, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McConnachie et al., 2003</xref>).

Your article has now been peer reviewed and we regret to inform you that the current submission will not be considered further for publication at this time. Your submission has been evaluated by 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and a Senior editor, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers.</p><p>As you will see below, all three reviewers were enthusiastic about the application of protein semisynthesis towards studies on the role of phosphorylation in the regulation of PTEN structure and localization. However, specific concerns were raised in two of the reviews that make the manuscript unsuitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at the current time. We believe that the reviewers’ comments and the post-review discussion with Reviewer 3 provide useful information as to how the manuscript could be revised to address the concerns that have been raised and we would invite you to consider whether it would be possible for you to revise the manuscript to address these comments in a reasonable period of time.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript presents studies that seek to gain insight into the mechanistic basis of phosphorylation-mediated PTEN regulation. The approach centers on the development and biochemical and biophysical analysis of a semisynthetic PTEN variant that is uniformly and uniquely modified with four phosphorylated serine and threonine residues in the C-terminal tail.</p><p>I find this to be a significant contribution for the following reasons:</p><p>1) The research specifically addresses the physical basis for the effects of PTEN phosphorylation with respect to whether the modifications directly alter the membrane association properties of the protein or whether they cause a change in inter- or intramolecular interactions, which result in changes membrane association.</p><p>2) The uniquely phosphorylated proteins provide information that is not readily accessible via mutational analysis with encoded amino acids or via enzyme-catalyzed phosphorylation since one cannot readily achieve uniquely phosphorylated materials.</p><p>3) Multiple lines of evidence are presented for a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) in which the tail-phosphorylated PTEN (4p-PTEN) more favorably adopts a compact structure, which may feature the negatively-charged tail in a buried state that reduces plasma-membrane binding. In contrast the non-phosphorylated n-PTEN is preferentially in a more open state making the membrane-associating face of PTEN more available for binding to membrane.</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>1) The authors should include the protein concentration in the ligation reaction – the yields are impressive so it is useful to know this detail.</p><p>2) It is noted in the methods that the PTEN-intein-cbd is produced in HighFive insect cells at a concentration of 10 mg/L culture – and then further noted that the final ligated semisynthetic proteins are produced in yields of ∼ 10 mg/L insect cell culture (at &gt;90% purity). It is not clear how this is possible what with the loss of mass from intein-cbd cleavage and the subsequent manipulations related to the thioester exchange, ligation, and purification. This needs to be clarified as it speaks to the next issue that concerns the purity of the semisynthetic protein products. Additionally, there is no detail provided on how the semisynthetic material is purified after the ligation and how are the unligated protein and excess peptide removed?</p><p>3) It is noted that western blot analysis with the “anti-phospho-PTEN” Ab confirms that the final material is appropriately phosphorylated. Is it certain that this anti-P Ab only recognizes the fully tetra-phosphorylated C-terminus? One might imagine that constructs with reduced phosphorylation might also be recognized. This question also comes up in the context of studies on auto-dephosphorylation. Perhaps, some erosion of the total phosphorylation is acceptable – but the authors should definitely comment here.</p><p>4) The authors should state on the yield after anion exchange chromatography that affords extra pure material for SAXS. This would provide information on the purity of the material directly from the ligation reaction. This issue is particularly important when considering and comparing the catalytic parameters and vesicle binding of 4p-PTEN.</p><p>5) It would be useful to contrast the current work with the Muir study on the type I TGF-beta receptor soluble domain wherein a hyperphosphorylated N-terminal tail is attached to the protein via semisynthesis and Smad2 activation is studied. The authors do cite reviews in which theses studies are highlighted, but it would be appropriate to highlight these particular examples wherein hyperphosphorylated sequences are incorporated into proteins to study structure and function.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is a superb study of the biophysical properties of the protein phosphatase PTEN. I really could find no issues with the report.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The protein ligation technique is very useful for studies on site specific phosphorylation, and the Cole lab has used this method cleverly to interrogate the function of PTEN phosphorylation. The methods used are appropriate and described thoroughly and the data collection is sound.</p><p>1) The main weakness is that while phosphorylation leads to protein compaction, reduced catalysis and reduced lipid affinity, the study lacks evidence that the inhibitory effects on activity and/or binding are necessarily caused by the conformational changes reflected by SAXS and proteolysis. Without this evidence, the autoinhibitory model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is speculative, which reduces the impact of the study.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> suggests that 4p-PTEN might reduce k<sub>cat</sub>, as well as k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>. More evidence is needed proving that the effect of phosphorylation on catalysis can be explained only by reduced phospholipid binding. If possible, k<sub>cat</sub> should be measured with less error (e.g., using alternative substrates), in order to eliminate the possibility that phosphorylation affects turnover rate as well as binding constants, which would indicate mechanisms beyond simple steric interference with the active site.</p><p>Additional comments from Reviewer 3 based on the discussion between the reviewers:</p><p>Discussion on comment 1: With respect to the presented “autoinhibitory model” it would be possible for the authors to indicate that the model that is put forward in the paper is one of many possibilities, and perhaps present hypotheses for alternate models that might be consistent with their observations.</p><p>Discussion on comment 2: The additional work that would be needed to demonstrate autoinhibition would require (1) showing similar kinetic parameters between t-PTEN and n-PTEN, and (2) showing that the phosphorylated C-terminal peptide inhibits t-PTEN in trans down to an activity comparable to 4p-PTEN. In order to argue that autoinhibition works by interfering with lipid binding, evidence would be needed showing that (3) the phospho-C-terminal peptide interacts with the lipid-binding interface, and (4) that conservative mutations at the lipid-binding interface interfere with peptide binding and relieve autoinhibition of 4p-PTEN. Other strategies might also be suitable, but these are among the experiments that I believe were used to demonstrate autoinhibition in Src kinases.</p><p>The question about k<sub>cat</sub> could readily be addressed using p-nitrophenylphosphate or perhaps another short chain acyl PI3,4,5P3 (e.g., C2, C3, C4) with greater solubility in aqueous solution.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00691.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Although we were heartened by the positive statements, we appreciate the seriousness of the critiques that necessitated our revisions to better explain and bolster the evidence for the linkage of structural and functional change in our phospho-PTEN model of old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> in the revised manuscript). We understood that the major missing piece from the reviewers’ perspective relates to whether the C-tail phosphopeptide of PTEN can act in trans to impact the lipid phosphatase activity of the body of PTEN (t-PTEN). We have now performed the key experiments that address this concern. In brief, the results are fully consistent with the (new) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> model. We have found that t-PTEN shows similar enzymatic activity to n-PTEN with the soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate. C-tail phosphopeptide potently inhibited t-PTEN lipid phosphatase activity with soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> and t-PTEN binding activity to PIP<sub>2</sub> containing-lipid vesicles, whereas the unphosphorylated C-tail had no effect in the same concentration range. Moreover, the C2 domain mutant form of t-PTEN (D5 t-PTEN, which contains mutations on the membrane binding CBRIII loop) was resistant to the catalytic inhibition effects of C-tail phosphopeptide, consistent with the model that a principal functional interaction between the body and phospho-tail involves the lipid binding interface of the C2 domain. In addition, we have also performed a more complete analysis of the substrate concentration dependence of the 5D mutant of 4p-PTEN lipid phosphatase activity, and these results fortify the interpretation of the regulatory implications of this mutant. These data and a related discussion are now added to the revised manuscript (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We think the inclusion of these results significantly strengthens the manuscript and establishes a modular structural interaction for phospho-PTEN. Below we delineate our point-by-point responses to the reviewers’ comments and describe the accompanying changes in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) The authors should include the protein concentration in the ligation reaction – the yields are impressive so it is useful to know this detail</italic>.</p><p>The expressed protein ligation reaction was carried out in a one-pot procedure in which the cell extracts were loaded on to a chitin-resin affinity column, and washed to remove impurities. This resin-bound PTEN-intein-CBD fusion protein was ligated with 2 mM N-Cys peptide and the solution phase protein contents were separated from the chitin-resin. We have added to the revised methods the approximate ratio of resin volume used to cell lysate volume as well as the reaction vessel that was employed. We never isolate the thioester species in this procedure, to minimize manipulations and to reduce losses from thioester hydrolysis, so we do not know the precise PTEN thioester fragment protein concentration present at the moment of ligation. We can, however, estimate that there is a maximum of 80 μM of protein thioester in the reaction mixture based on the recovered product.</p><p><italic>2) It is noted in the methods that the PTEN-intein-cbd is produced in HighFive insect cells at a concentration of 10 mg/L culture – and then further noted that the final ligated semisynthetic proteins are produced in yields of ∼ 10 mg/L insect cell culture (at &gt;90% purity). It is not clear how this is possible what with the loss of mass from intein-cbd cleavage and the subsequent manipulations related to the thioester exchange, ligation, and purification. This needs to be clarified as it speaks to the next issue that concerns the purity of the semisynthetic protein products. Additionally, there is no detail provided on how the semisynthetic material is purified after the ligation and how are the unligated protein and excess peptide removed</italic>?</p><p>We regret that the discussion of yield was presented in a confusing fashion. As noted above, we never isolate/characterize the PTEN-intein-CBD fusion protein (CBD-chitin binding domain) or quantify its yield. The 10 mg/L of PTEN protein from HighFive cell culture is based on DTT cleavage from this resin to liberate the thioester protein, but is somewhat variable from run to run so we have changed the revised text to reflect that the yield is in the range of 8–10 mg/L. The protein purity of semisynthetic PTEN is routinely greater than 90% based on SDSPAGE after dialysis and concentration by ultrafiltration. Excess synthetic peptide (MW 3 kDa) was removed by extensive dialysis (1:400 vol:vol) over 24–48 hours with at least 3 buffer exchanges using 12 kDa MW cutoff pre- moistened dialysis membrane (Slidealyzer), as well as during concentration with a 10 kDa MW cutoff concentrator to &gt;5 mg/ml (&gt;100 μM) semisynthetic PTEN.</p><p>We estimate based on these procedures and appearance of SDSPAGE that less than 10 μM peptide remained in stored semisynthetic PTEN protein samples. Since vesicle binding and interfacial enzymatic assays were routinely carried out with &gt;1000-fold dilution of the stock concentration of semisynthetic PTEN, possible impact of contaminating trace peptide is assumed to be negligible. As discussed below, the IC50 of phosphopeptide with t-PTEN is ∼1 μM and the contaminating phosphopeptide final concentration in 4p-PTEN- containing assays is estimated to be less than 10 nM. For both SAXS and soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> phosphatase assays where concentrations of semisynthetic PTENs were greater than 500 nM, anion exchange chromatography was also used to further purify the protein and eliminate trace unligated peptide. Further details are added to the revised manuscript to include this information.</p><p><italic>3) It is noted that western blot analysis with the “anti-phospho-PTEN” Ab confirms that the final material is appropriately phosphorylated. Is it certain that this anti-P Ab only recognizes the fully tetra-phosphorylated C-terminus? One might imagine that constructs with reduced phosphorylation might also be recognized. This question also comes up in the context of studies on auto-dephosphorylation. Perhaps, some erosion of the total phosphorylation is acceptable – but the authors should definitely comment here</italic>.</p><p>These are astute points. As Reviewer 1 suspects, the anti-phospho-PTEN Ab is unlikely to be specific for the tetraphosphate form, although this has not been systematically investigated. The antibody was raised against phospho S380/T382/T383. It certainly appears to recognize tetraphosphorylated PTEN. It is unknown if it will recognize phosphorylation states less than the three it was generated against. We have revised the manuscript to include this point, and also now state that we cannot rule out that some auto-dephosphorylation of the tail is formally possible because of the limitations of the western blot method.</p><p>However, it should be emphasized that the conformation of 4p-PTEN appears stable over dozens of hours (during ligation at room temperature) so that partial auto-dephosphorylation, if it is occurring, is non-disruptive. Furthermore, as noted in the manuscript, mass spectra of the intact 4p-PTEN and n-PTEN are consistent with a full complement of four phosphates in the former, based on the mass increase of 320 Da in 4p-PTEN relative to n-PTEN, although admittedly this is only semi-quantitative. However, in our experience phosphorylation of a peptide or protein tends to suppress MALDI ionization so that reduced phosphorylation state impurities would typically give larger mass spec signals.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should state on the yield after anion exchange chromatography that affords extra pure material for SAXS? This would provide information on the purity of the material directly from the ligation reaction. This issue is particularly important when considering and comparing the catalytic parameters and vesicle binding of 4p-PTEN</italic>.</p><p>We estimate that the purity of the semisynthetic PTEN protein after ligation is &gt;90% and after anion exchange chromatography is &gt;95%. The yield after anion exchange chromatography from 1 L of cell culture is estimated to be 2–3 mg/mL. We have made this clarification in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) It would be useful to contrast the current work with the Muir study on the type I TGF-beta receptor soluble domain wherein a hyperphosphorylated N-terminal tail is attached to the protein via semisynthesis and Smad2 activation is studied. The authors do cite reviews in which theses studies are highlighted, but it would be appropriate to highlight these particular examples wherein hyperphosphorylated sequences are incorporated into proteins to study structure and function</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the prior elegant work from Tom Muir’s group on TGF-beta kinase and Smad2 merits explicit discussion and citation in our manuscript, and we have added this to the Discussion in the revised manuscript. As Reviewer 1 notes, both the enzyme (TGF-beta kinase) and substrate (Smad2) were prepared in multi-phosphorylated forms using semisynthesis methods. One key technical difference between the TGF-beta/Smad2 studies and the current PTEN work is that insect cell expression with a fused intein was not required in the Muir experiments.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) The main weakness is that while phosphorylation leads to protein compaction, reduced catalysis and reduced lipid affinity, the study lacks evidence that the inhibitory effects on activity and/or binding are necessarily caused by the conformational changes reflected by SAXS and proteolysis. Without this evidence, the autoinhibitory model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is speculative, which reduces the impact of the study</italic>.</p><p>To summarize how we arrived at the (new) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> model in the manuscript, we delineate the key points here. 1) By comparing n-PTEN and 4p‐PTEN, we found that tail phosphorylation of PTEN reduces catalytic efficiency with a soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate, at least in part by elevating the K<sub>m</sub>; 2) n-PTEN, 4p‐PTEN (and t-PTEN) show similar interfacial K<sub>m</sub> values (i<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>s) with vesicle embedded PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate (suggesting similar conformations among these three forms of PTEN when bound to membrane) but 4p-PTEN shows relatively diminished vesicle affinity as judged by enzyme kinetic analysis as well as sedimentation experiments; 3) Relative to n-PTEN, 4p-PTEN shows a paradoxical weakened affinity for anionic chromatography resin, resistance to proteolysis, and more compact SAXS structure; 4) 4p-PTEN C-terminal phosphates are concealed in the native state based on susceptibility to alkaline phosphatase; 5) Relative to wt 4p-PTEN, the D5 (five clustered Lys residues of the membrane binding CBRIII loop replaced by Asp residues) 4p-PTEN mutant is conformationally partially open based on its enhanced susceptibility to alkaline phosphatase and more normal mobility in anion exchange chromatography; 6) The lipid phosphatase activity of the D5 4p-PTEN mutant with soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate is elevated relative to wt 4p-PTEN and is similar to the activity of wt n-PTEN, which has an open conformation (by SAXS, proteolysis, anion exchange chromatography); 7) The SAXS molecular envelopes calculated for 4p-PTEN, n-PTEN, and t-PTEN show the largest differences among the three proteins in the vicinity of the C2 domain; 8) Prior studies suggest that mutation of the five clustered Lys residues of the CBRIII loop (found on the membrane binding surface of the C2 domain) decreases lipid binding in <italic>in vitro</italic> vesicle binding and activity assays and signaling activity in cell transfection experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McConnachie et al. 2003</xref>). We believe that points 5,6, 7, and 8 are particularly compelling in defining the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> model as they indicate that the properties of a mutant that pops the 4p-PTEN open (based on alkaline phosphatase susceptibility and anion exchange chromatography mobility) also confer enzymatic activity with soluble substrate that is characteristic of the unphosphorylated n-PTEN. Since these CBRIII loop Lys residues mutated in the D5 4p-PTEN mutant are crucial for membrane binding, it seems likely that the structure and functional changes by mutation and phosphorylation are linked, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><p>To be clear, we agree that our data do not completely eliminate alternative, indirect mechanisms, such as the phosphorylated tail communicating less directly to the C2 domain by the phospho-tail binding elsewhere on the body of PTEN. In the absence of a high resolution X-ray structure, we think this remains a viable (though unlikely) hypothetical model that we have added to the Discussion. Such an indirect model would provide a rather convoluted explanation for points 1–8 above.</p><p>Moreover, it would not easily account for why the A5 (five clustered Lys residues of the CBRIII loop replaced by Ala residues) 4p-PTEN mutant remains in the closed conformation as discussed in the manuscript. It is simple to imagine that the D5 mutant Asp residues could show electrostatic repulsion with the highly negatively charged phospho-tail whereas the 5A mutant would lack this effect. If the phospho-tail were binding elsewhere on PTEN, we would not expect the A5 and D5 clustered mutations to induce distinct conformational effects that would result in differential alkaline phosphatase susceptibility of the tail phosphates.</p><p>Moreover, in contrast to the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> model, it is within the realm of possibility that 4p-PTEN can bind to membrane in the closed conformation, albeit with significantly reduced affinity. There is no simple biophysical approach that can easily rule this out. Our best evidence against the possibility that conformationally closed 4p-PTEN binds membrane is that the interfacial <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>s (i<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>s) for 4p-PTEN, n-PTEN, and t-PTEN are all the same, within error, in dephosphorylating vesicle-bound PIP<sub>3</sub>. Since the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>s for soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> dephosphorylation are different for 4p-PTEN and n-PTEN, it would be surprising that the i<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>s would be the same if the conformation of 4p-PTEN were closed when bound to vesicle. It is plausible, however, that some closed 4p-PTEN with reduced membrane affinity is interacting with vesicle while in a catalytically impaired state, which would contribute only in a minor way to the i<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>. On the other hand, we also know how important the CBRIII loop is for membrane binding which, as discussed above (and below), is likely abutting the phospho-tail in the closed conformation. Thus, the information available strongly supports the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. We discuss the alternate possibilities, and why they are disfavored in our opinion, in greater depth and clarity in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> suggests that 4p-PTEN might reduce k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub><italic>, as well as k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub><italic>/K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub><italic>. More evidence is needed proving that the effect of phosphorylation on catalysis can be explained only by reduced phospholipid binding. If possible, k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> <italic>should be measured with less error (e.g., using alternative substrates), in order to eliminate the possibility that phosphorylation affects turnover rate as well as binding constants, which would indicate mechanisms beyond simple steric interference with the active site</italic>.</p><p>Regarding the issue of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> not ruling out a k<sub>cat</sub> effect, we agree. However, we do not think that this is a key issue to the main conclusions of our manuscript or the (new) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> involves the soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate, rather than the more physiologic, vesicle embedded PIP<sub>3</sub> form. As discussed previously, the critical micellar concentration (CMC) of diC6 PIP<sub>3</sub> is greater than 1 mM, significantly higher than the concentrations used in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campbell et al. 2003</xref>). The mechanism of PTEN interaction with soluble substrate is at least somewhat distinct from the way PTEN interacts with vesicles, since the Lys residues of the C2 domain CBRIII loop are dispensable for efficient catalysis with soluble substrate, as first shown by Peter Downes and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McConnachie et al. 2003</xref>), but they are important for vesicle binding and tumor suppressive ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McConnachie et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shenoy et al. 2012</xref>, Shenoy et al. 2013). Thus, whether tail-phosphorylation of PTEN induces a pure K<sub>m</sub> effect or a mixed k<sub>cat</sub> and K<sub>m</sub> effect with soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate does not impact our understanding of the mechanism by which 4p-PTEN relative to n-PTEN binds vesicles more weakly, as demonstrated in both the interfacial kinetics and the sedimentation studies. Thus, we do not see a large benefit in trying to saturate the 4p-PTEN velocity versus soluble substrate concentration plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. We do think that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and soluble substrate assays add value to the manuscript because they: 1) show that the catalytic domain of PTEN is at least subtly altered in the closed conformation of 4p-PTEN relative to n-PTEN; 2) suggest that when 4p-PTEN binds vesicles, it opens, since the i<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of 4p-PTEN matches that of n-PTEN and t-PTEN; 3) provide a convenient method for distinguishing open and closed forms that help substantiate the more open state of the D5 4p-PTEN; 4) could ultimately be used for high throughput screening for allosteric activators of 4p-PTEN.</p><p>We have also carried out an additional experiment with D5 mutant 4p-PTEN in which we analyze the concentration dependence of soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> on its activity (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The model would suggest an intermediate K<sub>m</sub> value between that measured for wild-type 4p-PTEN and n-PTEN, since 4p-PTEN is closed and n-PTEN is open, and 5D 4p-PTEN is believed to be partially open. This value, which shows an apparent soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> K<sub>m</sub> of 110 μM for D5 mutant 4p-PTEN, is about 2-fold greater than that of wild-type n-PTEN but less than 4p-PTEN (K<sub>m</sub> &gt;&gt;160 μM). Thus, this new data further corroborates the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, and we add these results and a brief discussion on these points to the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Additional comments from Reviewer 3 based on the discussion between the reviewers: Discussion on comment 1: With respect to the presented “autoinhibitory model” it would be possible for the authors to indicate that the model that is put forward in the paper is one of many possibilities, and perhaps present hypotheses for alternate models that might be consistent with their observations</italic>.</p><p>We have broadened this discussion as noted above.</p><p><italic>Discussion on comment 2: The additional work that would be needed to demonstrate autoinhibition would require (1) showing similar kinetic parameters between t-PTEN and n-PTEN, and (2) showing that the phosphorylated C-terminal peptide inhibits t-PTEN in trans down to an activity comparable to 4p-PTEN. In order to argue that autoinhibition works by interfering with lipid binding, evidence would be needed showing that (3) the phospho-C-terminal peptide interacts with the lipid-binding interface, and (4) that conservative mutations at the lipid-binding interface interfere with peptide binding and relieve autoinhibition of 4p-PTEN. Other strategies might also be suitable, but these are among the experiments that I believe were used to demonstrate autoinhibition in Src kinases</italic>.</p><p>During the course of these studies we were somewhat reticent about pursuing the intermolecular line of investigation. We were concerned that, by disconnecting the tail from the body, there can be unnatural interactions that may not be seen with the intact molecule, where the physical attachment may help to define the orientation and energetics of the tail binding to the body. Nevertheless, the reviewers’ comments helped persuade us of the value of this complementary approach in illuminating whether the tail works as an autonomous module in regulating the body. Thus we have performed this series of experiments (i–v) as suggested and have shown: i) the lipid phosphatase kinetics with soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate t-PTEN are very similar to those of n-PTEN, ii) the C-tail phosphopeptide of PTEN potently inhibits t-PTEN lipid phosphatase activity with an IC50 of 1 μM, iii) the C-tail unphosphorylated peptide of PTEN has minimal effect on the enzymatic activity of t-PTEN, establishing the key role of the phosphate modifications, iv) the enzymatic activity of the D5 mutant of t-PTEN loses sensitivity to C-tail phosphopeptide, suggesting that the lipid-binding interface of the C2 domain is crucial to phosphopeptide interaction, v) addition of the C-tail phosphopeptide reduces t-PTEN binding to lipid vesicles. This additional set of experiments (shown as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) is fully consistent with, and helps support the connection between a phosphotail-C2 interaction and the functional inhibition of enzymatic activity and lipid binding as posited in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> model. Beyond helping to confirm the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, these trans tail–body experiments revealed some unexpected but interesting new aspects of the molecular recognition in phospho-PTEN. We did not anticipate the high apparent affinity of phosphopeptide tail binding to the PTEN body (ca. Kd 1 μM) based on the estimated 25:1 closed:open equilibrium measured in the alkaline phosphatase experiments with the intact 4p-PTEN. While there are several potential explanations for this high apparent affinity, one intriguing possibility is that adoption of the closed conformation of 4p-PTEN may be associated with energetic strain, a cost not incurred in the intermolecular system. Another unexpected finding was the nearly complete inhibition (&gt;95%) of t-PTEN enzymatic activity with 10 μM phosphopeptide, exceeding the apparent rate differential (6-fold) measured with 4p-PTEN vs. n-PTEN. There may be multiple reasons for this, but it is possible that the intermolecular binding event with 4p-PTEN pieces could result from structural interactions that are not thermodynamically accessible in the intramolecular case. Regardless, these additional findings should provide us and others with important topics for future investigation.</p><p><italic>The question about k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> <italic>could readily be addressed using p-nitrophenylphosphate or perhaps another short chain acyl PI3,4,5P3 (e.g., C2, C3, C4) with greater solubility in aqueous solution</italic>.</p><p>It is possible that saturation with 4p-PTEN and a PIP<sub>3</sub> surrogate could be achieved. But, as mentioned above, we do not think this is central to the main conclusions of the manuscript, or the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. While understanding how phosphorylation of PTEN affects the specific binding interaction of a soluble substrate to the PTEN active site may have some value, it is likely at least somewhat different from how the enzyme interacts with vesicle embedded phospholipid substrate. We believe that our original results and additional findings in the revised manuscript clearly demonstrate that the K<sub>m</sub> for soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> is increased by phosphorylation (and intramolecular conformational change) of PTEN, and this result is noteworthy regardless of whether k<sub>cat</sub> is also affected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
