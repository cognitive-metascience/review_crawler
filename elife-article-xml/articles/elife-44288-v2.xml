Inhibitors targeting MCL1 are in clinical development, however numerous cancer models are intrinsically resistant to this approach. To discover mechanisms underlying resistance to MCL1 inhibition, we performed multiple flow-cytometry based genome-wide CRISPR screens interrogating two drugs that directly (MCL1i) or indirectly (CDK9i) target MCL1. Remarkably, both screens identified three components (CUL5, RNF7 and UBE2F) of a cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL5) that resensitized cells to MCL1 inhibition. We find that levels of the BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Noxa are proteasomally regulated by the CRL5 complex. Accumulation of Noxa caused by depletion of CRL5 components was responsible for re-sensitization to CDK9 inhibitor, but not MCL1 inhibitor. Discovery of a novel role of CRL5 in apoptosis and resistance to multiple types of anticancer agents suggests the potential to improve combination treatments.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44288.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Organisms keep their tissues healthy by instructing damaged or unwanted cells to kill themselves via a controlled process known as apoptosis. Cancer cells, however, are able to evade death by increasing the level of proteins that block apoptosis, such as MCL1.</p><p>Researchers have recently developed new drugs that can inhibit the action of the MCL1 protein. But a number of cancers have become resistant to these inhibitors. So, one important question is whether other proteins in cancer cells could be drugged, together with MCL1, to overcome or even avoid this resistance.</p><p>Now, Kabir et al. have addressed this question by searching the genome of human lung cancer cells, which were resistant to treatment, for targets that could improve the performance of two MCL1 inhibitors. This involved reducing the level of every protein in these cells one by one using a genetic technique known as CRISPR-Cas9, and looking for cells that lost their resistance to the MCL1 inhibitor.</p><p>From these genetic screens, Kabir et al. identified three proteins that are part of complex called CRL5. Inactivating this protein complex caused cancer cells to become more sensitive to the MCL1 inhibitor. Further biochemical experiments showed that CRL5 may contribute to drug resistance by reducing the levels of two proteins that promote apoptosis.</p><p>These findings suggest that inhibiting CRL5 in combination with MCL1 could combat drug resistance. Although there are currently no drugs against CRL5, future experiments determining how CRL5 and MCL1 are linked could identify new drug targets and improve existing cancer treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MCL1 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>genome-wide CRISPRi screens</kwd><kwd>CUL5-RNF7-UBE2F ubiquitin ligase complex</kwd><kwd>CDK9 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>noxa</kwd><kwd>bim</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004325</institution-id><institution>AstraZeneca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kabir</surname><given-names>Shaheen</given-names></name><name><surname>Cidado</surname><given-names>Justin</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>Courtney</given-names></name><name><surname>Dick</surname><given-names>Cortni</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Pei-Chun</given-names></name><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Hong</given-names></name><name><surname>Belmonte</surname><given-names>Matthew A</given-names></name><name><surname>Drew</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Corn</surname><given-names>Jacob E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2 HL141006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corn</surname><given-names>Jacob E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007421</institution-id><institution>Li Ka Shing Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corn</surname><given-names>Jacob E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Heritage Medical Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corn</surname><given-names>Jacob E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DISC1-08776</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kabir</surname><given-names>Shaheen</given-names></name><name><surname>Baik</surname><given-names>Seung Hyun</given-names></name><name><surname>Corn</surname><given-names>Jacob E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeting the CRL5 ubiquitin ligase complex in combination with CDK9 or MCL1 inhibition could combat innate and acquired resistance of cancer cells to MCL1-targeting therapeutics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer cells frequently manipulate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway to evade cell death and expand their proliferative capacity. Aberrant increases in levels of anti-apoptotic proteins in the BCL-2 family, such as amplification of <italic>MCL1</italic>, have been widely implicated in the transformation of cancer cells and the development of resistance to current therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kelly and Strasser, 2011</xref>). BCL-2 family members are classified based on the conservation of their BCL-2 homology (BH) domains: multi-domain proteins BAK, BAX and BOK serve as apoptosis executors in the mitochondria; proteins containing only the BH3 domain (BH3-only) promote BAK/BAX activation. Anti-apoptotic proteins such as MCL1, Bcl-xL and BCL-2 inhibit apoptosis by antagonistic binding to pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins as well as BAK and BAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Czabotar et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>High-resolution investigation of somatic copy number alterations has revealed that gene amplification of <italic>MCL1</italic> and <italic>BCL2L1</italic> (Bcl-xL) are key determinants of survival in many cancers, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, and B-cell acute lymphoblatic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goodwin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koss et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>).

Unfortunately, the first BH3-mimetics that specifically antagonized Bcl-xL were associated with significant thrombocytopenia, thus complicating their therapeutic use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lessene et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leverson et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tao et al., 2014</xref>).

CDK9 inhibition restricts transcription elongation thus exploiting all mRNAs and proteins that have short-lived half-lives. Due to its short half-life, MCL1 is one of several targets that is particularly susceptible to acute CDK9i treatment, and other (proto-)oncogenes such as MYC are also CDK9i targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akgul et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gregory et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lemke et al., 2014</xref>). Although CDK9 inhibition suppresses MCL1 expression, it does not affect levels of other anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-xL, exposing a potential vulnerability in CDK9i treatment such that cancers may already have or develop a mode of resistance. Selective CDK9 inhibitors have shown promising results in preclinical murine models; however, they have a limited therapeutic window and must be acutely dosed for clinical applications due to their global effects on transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Cuellar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hellvard et al., 2016</xref>). In order to truly harness the power of CDK9 inhibitors (CDK9i) or MCL1 inhibitors (MCL1i), it is imperative to uncover additional targets that may sensitize cells to these treatments.</p><p>Since CDK9i shares at least one of its targets with MCL1i, we reasoned that a genome wide search could uncover shared factors that modulate the therapeutic activity of these compounds and suggest approaches to resensitize otherwise resistant tumor cells. As lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality and most NSCLC patients develop resistance to first-line treatment, we performed genome-wide CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) screens in a NSCLC line resistant to both CDK9 and MCL1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Siegel et al., 2016</xref>). We discovered that disruption of multiple members of the cullin 5-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL5) complex markedly resensitized cells to both CDK9i and MCL1i. The CRL5 complex targets pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins Bim and Noxa for proteasomal degradation. Epistatic knockdown of Bim or Noxa in a CUL5 knockout background rendered cells once again resistant to CDK9i, but did not affect increased sensitivity to MCL1i. Our data indicate that members of the CRL5 complex modulate the apoptotic threshold and could be attractive targets for future combination therapy to treat otherwise resistant NSCLC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>MCL1</italic>-amplified NSCLC lines resistant to CDK9i and MCL1i have increased Bcl-xL</title><p>We assessed a panel of NSCLC lines for their sensitivity to CDK9i (AZD5576) or MCL1i (AZD5991) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Despite separate mechanisms of drug action and potentially distinct targets, significantly more of the top resensitization hits were shared between CDK9i and MCL1i than are expected by chance (exact hypergeometric test p&lt;6.4×10<sup>−9</sup>). These shared hits are part of two physical complexes, one potentially involved in specialized translation and the other involved in protein degradation. First, knockdown of multiple components of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex (EIF3H and EIF3M) resensitize LK2 cells to CDK9i and MCL1i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). eIF-3 is reported to bind a highly specific program of messenger RNAs involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). We speculate that this complex could be involved in mediating translational activation of certain anti-apoptotic proteins or repression of pro-apoptotic proteins.

This suggests that inactivation of CRL5 could be less toxic than inhibition of Bcl-xL and that inhibition of CRL5 may be better suited to co-administration with CDK9 and MCL1 inhibitors.</p><p>To further validate the synergy between inhibition of CRL5 and CDK9i or MCL1i, we made isogenic CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts of <italic>CUL5</italic> and <italic>UBE2F</italic> in the LK2 background (Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>).

Knocking down Bim in CUL5-CRISPRi cells did not prevent CDK9i-induced apoptosis, and simultaneously knocking down both Noxa and Bim in CUL5-CRISPRi cells did not further inhibit apoptosis beyond what was observed with knockdown of Noxa alone. These data indicate that in CDK9i-treated cells lacking CUL5, initiation of apoptosis is primarily dependent on Noxa.

While CUL3 is implicated in a wide array of cancer biologies, relatively little is known about the physiological functions of many CUL5-containing ubiquitin ligases. A few reports have implicated genetic alterations in CUL5 in cancer progression and our unbiased screens reveal that the CUL5-RNF7-UBE2F ubiquitin ligase can modulate the apoptotic threshold of LK2 cells in response to multiple emerging cancer therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burnatowska-Hledin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fay et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lubbers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2012</xref>).

Based on our data, patients with lung cancers that exhibit loss of function mutations in either CUL5, RNF7, UBE2F or Elongin B that coincide with high expression of MCL1/Bcl-xL could be good candidates for treatment with CDK9i or MCL1i. These patients may be unlikely to have pre-existing CRL5-mediated resistance to treatment.</p><p>There are currently no small-molecule inhibitors that target specific components of the CRL5 complex. However, several potent inhibitors that broadly inhibit the ubiquitin-proteasome system have been developed. MLN4924 inhibits the NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE), thereby preventing conjugation of NEDD8 onto all cullin scaffolds, and shows significant antitumor activity in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Soucy et al., 2009</xref>). Similiarly, treatment with MLN7243, a small molecule inhibitor of the ubiquitin activating enzyme (UAE) currently in clinical trials, depletes cellular ubiquitin conjugates and also demonstrates antitumor activity in xenografts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hyer et al., 2018</xref>). Several clinically approved proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib and carfilzomib are currently used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuhn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Richardson et al., 2005</xref>). Although a therapeutic window exists for these compounds, patients also experience adverse side effects due to the widespread effects of proteasome inhibition, complicating the possibility of co-dosing with CDK9i or MCL1i.</p><p>Compounds have also been developed that directly manipulate protein-protein interactions within specific ligases. The small molecule CC0651 selectively inhibits Cdc34A, an E2 for SCF-type CRLs, and has been shown to impede proliferation of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ceccarelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2014b</xref>).

While ubiquitin ligases are challenging targets for small molecule development, their importance in myriad disease states have spurred efforts to manipulate their activity. Our results in LK2 cells suggest that targeting CRL5 could be used to combat innate and acquired resistance to therapeutics that directly or indirectly affect MCL1. Additional work will be necessary to establish the mechanistic distinctions between CRL5’s ability to set the apoptotic response to distinct small molecules, as well as the clinical applicability of targeting CRL5 in cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>The LK2 cell line was obtained from AstraZeneca and maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin and streptomycin, GlutaMAX, sodium pyruvate and non-essential amino acids.

Your article has been reviewed by Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor, Michael Green as the Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Narendra Wajapeyee (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Kabir et al., address the important problem of resistance/non-response to drugs under clinical development. In a CRISPRi/FACS screen they identify genes for which knock-down synergizes with either CDK9 (CDK9i) or MCL1 (MCL1i) inhibition. Along BclXl, which is known to synergize with MCL1 inhibition and lower the apoptotic threshold, they identify components of a Cullin5 RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL5), namely the scaffold protein Cul5, the zinc-finger protein RBX2/RNF7 and the NEDD8 specific E2 enzyme UBE2F, suggesting a role in a CRL5 type ligase in regulating apoptosis. They go on to validate these findings in cellular models using individual knock-outs/downs of either CUL5, UBE2F and RNF7 confirming the role of these proteins in regulating the sensitivity to CDK9i/MCL1i. Since substrate receptors are a key component of a CRL5 ligase and confer specificity to the ligase complex, they attempt to identify the relevant substrate receptor by targeted knock-out of all known CRL5 substrate receptors, however, fail to identify a specific substrate receptor. In search of the relevant downstream targets, they observe up-regulation of Bim and Noxa in response to CRL5 inhibition by either CRISPRi or shRNA. They further show that in a CUL5 depleted background, efficacy of CDK9i but not MCL1i depends on the presence of Noxa.</p><p>In summary, the authors identify CRL5 as a critical node in regulating apoptosis and suggest that targeting CRL5 could provide potential synergy with CDK9i/MCL1i, or that patient stratification based on mutations in components of the CRL5 ligase could inform benefits of CDK9i/MCL1i. In the absence of a known substrate receptor, the authors did not succeed in identifying the mechanism by which CRL5 depletion regulates apoptosis, and the differences in response of CDK9i vs MCL1i suggest a more complex regulation of the pathway.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript is based on the assumption that a key target of CDK9i is MCL1 (Abstract: &quot;that interrogate two drugs directly or indirectly targeting MCL1&quot;), which appears to be only marginally supported. If that were to be the case, the genome scale screens should exhibit a significant global correlation, which the authors should show. It is also confusing why in such a scenario CDK9i but not MCL1i requires Noxa (Discussion section). The authors need to be clearer about their assumptions and the nature of CDK9i leading to a global and profound downregulation of transcription with likely complex downstream effects directly/or indirectly signaling into apoptosis. The authors need to discuss this more accurately, and reference data that suggests that CDK9i exerts therapeutic effects pre-dominantly through MCL1 downregulation.</p><p>2) While the manuscript addresses an important problem and the screens are well designed and rigorously executed, it appears that some of the downstream experiments (in particular the investigation of Bim and Noxa) are not sufficient to support the overall statements. For example, subsection &quot;Noxa is required to resensitize CUL5-deficient cells to MCL1 inhibition&quot;, however, in Figure 5B the authors show that co-depletion of CUL5 and Noxa still results in apoptosis levels comparable to CUL5-/- upon MCL1i treatment. There are more such inconsistencies that need to be addressed.</p><p>3) Overall, the authors should rewrite the manuscript and be clearer about their overall conclusions. They show that depletion of key components of the CRL5 family of ubiquitin ligases can sensitize to CDK9 and MCL1 inhibition, while more work is needed to identify the exact mechanism.</p><p>4) The majority of the drug-resistance experiments are short-term apoptosis assays. To draw strong conclusion about drug-resistance and susceptibility it is important to perform some type of long-term survival and proliferation assays. Please confirm the key conclusions of the study using some type of long-term survival and proliferation assay.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The CUL5 ubiquitin ligase complex mediates resistance to CDK9 and MCL1 inhibitors in lung cancer cells&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Cynthia Wolberger (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In particular, one of the reviewers feels that the conclusions, particularly the clinical implications, have been over-stated. Some of the reviewer's original comments and other comments provided during discussion of the manuscript are provided below.</p><p>Please carefully review these comments and revise your manuscript accordingly. Please provide a point-by-point response of how you have revised the manuscript to address the reviewer's concerns.</p><p>Comments from original review:</p><p>In this revised manuscript, Kabir et al., deploy elegant CRISPR screens to identify potential mechanisms of resistance/non-response to CDK9 inhibitors (CDK9i) and MCL1 inhibitors (MCL1i). They identify components of the Cullin-5 RING ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL5) as mediators of sensitivity to CDK9i and MCL1i. They further show that genetic inactivation of CUL5 or RNF7 leads to elevated levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM and NOXA. While they show that knockout of NOXA partially abrogates the sensitizing effect of CUL5 knockout in the context of CDK9i, no effect is observed for MCL1i.</p><p>The key criticism to the manuscript was the weakly supported assumption that both, CDK9i and MCL1i, act predominantly through inhibition of MCL1. The authors acknowledge the lack of data for their initial assumption yet fail to provide data that would further support this key assumption for conclusions drawn in the paper (rebuttal major points 1-3). In light of this, I feel that both screens have to be considered as potentially correlated but not necessarily functionally linked and the key message that CUL5 ubiquitin ligase complexes mediate resistance to CDK9i and MCL1i is not sufficiently supported. With just a single experiment in a single cell line, and sensitization to potentially unrelated drugs, depletion of CUL5 could result in general lowering of the apoptotic threshold instead of a CDK9i/MCL1i specific effect.</p><p>Overall, I feel this manuscript as it is presented right now is overselling the therapeutic value of the findings and more thorough experiments and importantly discussion of the data would be necessary.</p><p>Representative major points:</p><p>The screens are carried out in a single cell line, and since at least for MCL1i no mechanistic understanding beyond the genetic link to CUL5 is provided (regulation of NOXA impacts CDK9i but not MCL1i), the obvious question is whether knockdown of CUL5, RNF7 or UBE2F is just a general reduction of apoptotic threshold and as such would sensitize without necessarily increasing the therapeutic index. Moreover, I feel the overlap between both screens is overstated at multiple occasions, for example in Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E referenced as &quot;the top resensitization hits were strikingly consistent, only 3 out of the top 10 hits overlapped.</p><p>For MCL1i, the authors provide only a genetic screen, which while elegant, does not provide mechanistic inside into the resistance mechanism. The fact that Noxa/Bim are downregulated appears to be correlated, but not necessarily functionally linked to MCL1i.</p><p>In the second paragraph of the Discussion section – refer to significant co-occurrence of MCL1 amplification with CUL5/UBE2F deletions, which appears to be overstated based on data available at cbioportal: Out of 3351 lung cancer samples, only 3 have a co-occurrence of CUL5 deletions with either MCL1 or BCL<sup>-</sup>xL amplification, 2 a co-occurrence of UBE2F deletion with MCL1/BCL<sup>-</sup>xL amplification, and none a co-occurrence of RNF7 deletions. If further data is available, it should be provided as supplementary figure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44288.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript is based on the assumption that a key target of CDK9i is MCL1 (Abstract: &quot;that interrogate two drugs directly or indirectly targeting MCL1&quot;), which appears to be only marginally supported.

We have stated this more clearly in the Introduction and have also clarified that our goal is to find any synergistic hits that can be used to stratify patients or in combination therapies with either inhibitor. Furthermore, we have also included a Venn diagram showing that while a subset of hits in the MCL1i screen overlap with the CDK9i screen, the CDK9i screen has a greater number of hits likely due to its additional targets (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, discussed in subsection “Genome-wide CRISPRi screens identify factors that synergize with CDK9 and MCL1 inhibition”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also confusing why in such a scenario CDK9i but not MCL1i requires Noxa (Discussion section).

We show that the CRL5 complex targets pro-apoptotic proteins Noxa and Bim for degradation, which may contribute in part to the resistance against CDK9i and MCL1i, but more work is needed to elucidate the exact mechanistic distinctions between direct and indirect inhibition of MCL1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The majority of the drug-resistance experiments are short-term apoptosis assays. To draw strong conclusion about drug-resistance and susceptibility it is important to perform some type of long-term survival and proliferation assays. Please confirm the key conclusions of the study using some type of long-term survival and proliferation assay.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point that we have now addressed through new clonogenic experiments presented in the revised Figure 3G-H. Clonogenic assays are established in the field of cancer biology as readouts of long-term survival, replicative capacity and determining the effects of anti-cancer therapeutics on colony forming ability. We performed clonogenic assays using LK2 parental cells and our isolated CUL5-KO and UBE2F-KO clones. Cells were subjected to acute CDK9i and MCL1i treatments, since cells do not tolerate persistent treatment as discussed in the manuscript. The results clearly show that LK2 cells are much more resistant to these small molecules than the CUL5-KO and UBE2F-KO cells. We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and feel that the results of our clonogenic assays strengthen the manuscript, providing credence to our conclusion that CRL5 does in fact sensitize cells in a permanent way to CDK9 and MCL1 inhibition.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments from original review:</p><p>In this revised manuscript, Kabir et al., deploy elegant CRISPR screens to identify potential mechanisms of resistance / non-response to CDK9 inhibitors (CDK9i) and MCL1 inhibitors (MCL1i). They identify components of the Cullin-5 RING ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL5) as mediators of sensitivity to CDK9i and MCL1i. They further show that genetic inactivation of CUL5 or RNF7 leads to elevated levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM and NOXA. While they show that knockout of NOXA partially abrogates the sensitizing effect of CUL5 knockout in the context of CDK9i, no effect is observed for MCL1i.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referees for critically re-reading our manuscript and for their support in the revision process. Most of the referee’s comments relate to possibly overstating the importance or functional relevance of the CRL5 complex in the context of CDK9i and MCL1i. We certainly did not mean to “oversell” the data, and most of our edits to the first revision were aimed at softening our interpretation. We have further scaled this back throughout the manuscript, and hope that the renewed focus on the data itself has now addressed the referee’s concern. In one case we have chosen to add a statistical measure to strengthen the data presented (e.g. overlap between screen outputs). We note that a new preprint (June 23, 2019) from the lab of John Doench has recently used CRISPR screening to identify CUL5, RNF7, and UBE2F as synthetic lethal with MCL1 knockout (notably these genes were <italic>not</italic> synthetic lethal hits in screens with several other parental knockouts). This preprint (which cites our own preprint), highlights the reproducibility of our results, its specificity to MCL1 intervention, and stresses the timeliness of our manuscript (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/06/23/677385.full.pdf).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The key criticism to the manuscript was the weakly supported assumption that both, CDK9i and MCL1i, act predominantly through inhibition of MCL1. The authors acknowledge the lack of data for their initial assumption yet fail to provide data that would further support this key assumption for conclusions drawn in the paper (rebuttal major points 1-3).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for inadvertently suggesting that CDK9i primarily acts through inhibition of MCL1. This was not what we meant, and we thank the referee for pointing this out. We instead mean that one of CDK9i’s mechanisms is through depletion of MCL1 transcript. In this way, CDK9i is an indirect inhibitor of MCL1 that also downregulates other transcripts relevant to cancer (e.g. <italic>MYC</italic>), while MCLi is a direct inhibitor of MCL1. Figure 4D and Figure 3—figure supplement 2E show that CDK9i in our hands potently depletes MCL1 mRNA and protein. We did not provide further data on the ability of CDK9 inhibitors to downregulate <italic>MCL1</italic> and thereby alter tumor cell survival due to the extensive literature on this topic (e.g. Brisard et al., 2018, Minzel et al., 2018, Inoue-Yamauchi et al., 2017, Tong et al., 2017, Mitra et al., 2016, Baker et al., 2016, Gregory et al., 2015, Yin et al., 2014, Lemke et al., 2014, Thomas et al., 2013, and MacCallum et al., 2005). We have added language attempting to clarify that CDK9i effects MCL1 but also other oncogenes (see Introduction).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In light of this, I feel that both screens have to be considered as potentially correlated but not necessarily functionally linked and the key message that CUL5 ubiquitin ligase complexes mediate resistance to CDK9i and MCL1i is not sufficiently supported. With just a single experiment in a single cell line, and sensitization to potentially unrelated drugs, depletion of CUL5 could result in general lowering of the apoptotic threshold instead of a CDK9i/MCL1i specific effect.</p><p>Overall, I feel this manuscript as it is presented right now is overselling the therapeutic value of the findings and more thorough experiments and importantly discussion of the data would be necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee that depletion of CUL5 could generally reduce the apoptotic threshold. Indeed, anti-apoptotic BCL<sup>-</sup>2 family members such as MCL1 are responsible for setting the apoptotic threshold, so our data are not at odds with the referees’ comments. Inhibition or depletion of BCL<sup>-</sup>2, BCL<sup>-</sup>xL, and MCL1 synergizes with a variety of anti-cancer agents (inhibitors of kinases such as BRAF, BTK, etc and even HDAC inhibitors). Inhibition of BCL2 family members such as MCL1 is particularly important for primary effect in contexts where the family member is highly upregulated. Our data suggest that depletion of the CRL5 complex can overcome the extremely high apoptotic threshold set by simultaneous BCL<sup>-</sup>xL overexpression and MCL1 copy number gain (Figure 1B, Supplementary file 1). Depletion of CRL5 does not induce high basal levels of apoptosis, as is typical of BCL<sup>-</sup>xL inhibition, but instead strongly synergizes with both MCL1i and CDK9i (Figure 3E). Finally, we note that a very recent preprint from the lab of John Doench describes synthetic lethal screens for genetic interactions with multiple factors. When querying MCL1 (and *only* MCL1), the authors found CUL5, UBE2F, and RNF7 as top synthetic lethal hits. This genetic interaction underscores our own results with chemical inhibitors. DeWeirdt et al., 2019.</p><p>Inhibition of BCL2 family members has proven to have therapeutic value, despite associated toxicity in certain settings. But proving this therapeutic value took many years and many studies, and we fully acknowledge that our current manuscript is not the final word on whether targeting the CRL5 complex is therapeutically appropriate. We have edited the manuscript to attempt to adequately represent the referee’s point and to avoid overselling our current results, while still attempting to convey their importance. For example, we have stressed that our data demonstrate that CRL5 knockdown re-sensitizes to both CDK9i and MCL1i in one NSCLC setting, but other mechanisms could underlie resistance of other NSCLC lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Representative major points:</p><p>The screens are carried out in a single cell line, and since at least for MCL1i no mechanistic understanding beyond the genetic link to CUL5 is provided (regulation of NOXA impacts CDK9i but not MCL1i), the obvious question is whether knockdown of CUL5, RNF7 or UBE2F is just a general reduction of apoptotic threshold and as such would sensitize without necessarily increasing the therapeutic index.</p></disp-quote><p>See comments above about apoptotic threshold. Particularly, note that depletion of CRL5 does not induce high basal levels of apoptosis, as is typical of BCL<sup>-</sup>xL inhibition, but instead strongly synergizes with both MCL1i and CDK9i (Figure 3E). Since BCL<sup>-</sup>xL inhibitors are already used therapeutically (but with significant toxicity), we feel that this implies that targeting CRL5 could be useful in future.

We have attempted to clarify this point in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, I feel the overlap between both screens is overstated at multiple occasions, for example in Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E referenced as &quot;the top resensitization hits were strikingly consistent, only 3 out of the top 10 hits overlapped.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the genome-scale of the library, the overlap between hits in the CDK9i and MCL1i screens is highly significant. This can be calculated as a hypergeometric probability, conveniently implemented at the following website: http://nemates.org/MA/progs/overlap_stats.html.</p><p>Taking the cutoffs shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, 18,746 genes in the CRISPRiv2 library, 24 hits with MCL1i, 117 hits with CDK9i, and 6 gene overlaps, the representation factor is 40.1 with p &lt; 6.4e-9. As expected, CDK9i’s pleiotropic effects on transcription lead to more hits than the more specific MCL1i, but the overlap is significant. We furthermore note that Figure 2 —figure supplement 1D/E show the raw output of MaGECK, which ranks gene-level hits solely by statistical significance, neglects effect size, and only shows the ten lowest p-values (RRA is a type of p-value). Of course, relevant hits can be present with p-values larger than the lowest observed p-values while still passing an appropriate threshold. This is why we presented volcano plots for both screens in Figure 2, taking into account both statistical significance and effect size.</p><p>We have added information on the statistical significance of the overlap to the revised manuscript. We have also revised the statements about the screens in an attempt to avoid over-stating the implications of our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For MCL1i, the authors provide only a genetic screen, which while elegant, does not provide mechanistic inside into the resistance mechanism. The fact that Noxa/Bim are downregulated appears to be correlated, but not necessarily functionally linked to MCL1i.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is completely correct that our mechanistic insights for CRL5 downregulation in the context of CDK9i are stronger than CRL5 downregulation in the context of MCL1i.

If further data is available, it should be provided as supplementary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>This discussion point was originally based on TCGA lung adenocarcinomas published in Nature in 2014 (doi: 10.1038/nature13385), where out of 230 samples profiled, 5 samples had a co-occurrence of MCL1 amplification and CUL5 mutation/deletion. However, the reviewer makes a fair point that as we do not observe a more significant trend when taking into account all the 3351 lung cancer samples available, this discussion point is overstated. We thank the reviewer for carefully and critically assessing our manuscript and have removed this statement so as not to mislead.</p></body></sub-article></article>
