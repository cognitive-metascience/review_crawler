It exerts its function, at least in part, through repressing genes associated with epigenetic modification and cell differentiation. Here, we show that this repressive function is mediated through an ETO-family co-repressor Mtgr1, which tightly binds to the pre-SET/SET domains of Prdm14 and co-occupies its genomic targets in mouse ESCs. We generated two monobodies, synthetic binding proteins, targeting the Prdm14 SET domain and demonstrate their utility, respectively, in facilitating crystallization and structure determination of the Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex, or as genetically encoded inhibitor of the Prdm14-Mtgr1 interaction. Structure-guided point mutants and the monobody abrogated the Prdm14-Mtgr1 association and disrupted Prdm14's function in mESC gene expression and PGC formation in vitro. Altogether, our work uncovers the molecular mechanism underlying Prdm14-mediated repression and provides renewable reagents for studying and controlling Prdm14 functions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10150.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10150.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10150.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In animals, there are many different types of cells that perform different roles. For example, stem cells divide to produce new cells that may then become other types of cells such as muscle or skin cells. Most stem cells can only produce a limited range of other cell types, except for a subset known as ‘pluripotent’ stem cells that can give rise to cells of any type in the body.</p> <p>A protein called Prdm14 helps to keep stem cells in a pluripotent state. In mouse embryos, Prdm14 binds to and represses particular genes that promote a process by which the stem cells can change into other cell types. If Prdm14 is missing from pluripotent stem cells, these cells become more sensitive to signals that encourage them to become other types of cells, which can lead to the loss of pluripotency. Prdm14 contains a region called the SET domain. In other proteins, this domain can alter how DNA is packaged to help switch particular genes on or off. However, such activity has not been found for the SET domain of Prdm14, raising questions about how it actually works.</p> <p>Here, Nady, Gupta et al. show that Prdm14 tightly interacts with a protein called Mtgr1, which belongs to a family of proteins known to be involved in leukemia. The loss of Mtgr1 also leads to the loss of pluripotency in mouse stem cells and disrupts the formation of reproductive stem cells. Furthermore, Mtgr1 binds to the same genes as Prdm14. Next, Nady, Gupta et al. made synthetic proteins, termed monobodies, that bind to the Prdm14 SET domain. One such monobody enabled the authors to determine the three-dimensional structure of Prdm1 and Mtgr1, which revealed that the SET domain of Prdm14 has many points of contact with Mtgr1. Importantly, interaction between the two partners is crucial for these proteins to maintain pluripotency and promote the production of reproductive stem cells.</p> <p>Altogether, these findings identify Mtgr1 as a key binding partner of Prdm14 in pluripotent stem cells and uncover a role for the SET domain in this interaction. A future challenge will be to understand the roles of these proteins in leukemia and other diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10150.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10150.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>primordial Germ Cells</kwd><kwd>embryonic stem cell</kwd><kwd>genomic</kwd><kwd>monobody</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Project Grant R01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koide</surname><given-names>Shohei</given-names></name><name><surname>Wysocka</surname><given-names>Joanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post-doctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nady</surname><given-names>Nataliya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007234</institution-id><institution>University of Chicago</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Support Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koide</surname><given-names>Shohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Support</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wysocka</surname><given-names>Joanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Mtgr1 protein promotes the maintenance of pluripotency and germ cell formation via its interaction with the stem cell regulator Prdm14.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prdm14 is a sequence-specific transcriptional regulator that plays key roles in promoting primordial germ cell (PGC) specification and safeguarding pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakaki and Saitou, 2014</xref>). During mouse embryogenesis, Prdm14 is expressed in preimplantation embryos, where its asymmetric expression promotes allocation of cells toward the pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM) fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakaki and Saitou, 2014</xref>). Prdm14 expression ceases in postimplantation epiblast cells and their differentiated progeny. However, during PGC specification from the epiblast, cells reacquire many transcriptional and epigenetic characteristics of the preimplantation state, and Prdm14 is re-expressed along with several other pluripotency-associated factors (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Magnúsdóttir and Surani, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saitou et al., 2012</xref>]). The loss of Prdm14 in mice results in sterility associated with early germ cell deficiency, as cells fated to become PGCs fail to reacquire expression of key pluripotency factors and undergo epigenetic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamaji et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of Prdm14 in epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) is sufficient to induce PGCs in vitro (albeit with low frequency), suggesting a central role of Prdm14 in the mouse PGC regulatory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Magnúsdóttir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakaki et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, Prdm14 is repressed in normal somatic tissues but is aberrantly reactivated in human malignancies of various tissue origin, including leukemias and lymphomas, breast, testicular, and lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carofino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dettman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishikawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ruark et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Given the poor accessibility and transient nature of preimplantation embryo cells and PGCs in vivo, mechanistic studies of Prdm14 function in early development have been chiefly conducted in the context of mouse ESCs (mESCs). These cells represent a so-called 'naïve' pluripotent state, thought to resemble preimplantation embryo ICM and serve as a useful system for understanding early cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nichols and Smith, 2009</xref>). Loss of Prdm14 destabilizes mESCs and sensitizes them to differentiation stimuli, leading to acquisition of alternative embryonic states, such as the postimplantation epiblast state or extraembryonic endoderm state, and eventual depletion of the naïve cell subpopulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamaji et al., 2013</xref>). The differentiation in Prdm14<sup>−/−</sup> cells is thought to result from upregulation of signaling pathways such as the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway and by widespread DNA hypermethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grabole et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hackett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leitch et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, genome-wide Prdm14 occupancy studies by chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq) suggest that these are direct effects of the loss of Prdm14, as Prdm14 occupies and represses the regulatory elements of genes involved in FGFR signaling and de novo DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leitch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Magnúsdóttir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamaji et al., 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, Prdm14<sup>−/−</sup> mESCs can be maintained indefinitely under 2i conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grabole et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Payer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamaji et al., 2013</xref>), in which differentiation stimuli, including FGFR signaling, are chemically inhibited, providing an opportunity to study the early effects of Prdm14 deficiency upon release from such inhibition.</p><p>Although the cellular and molecular phenotypes associated with loss of Prdm14 in mESCs have been well characterized, much less is known about molecular mechanisms and partners through which Prdm14 acts. As a member of the PRDM family, Prdm14 contains both a zinc-finger array, responsible for sequence-dependent DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2011</xref>), and a PR domain that is related to the SET domain (Su(var)3–9, Enhancer-of-zeste and Trithorax) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fog et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hohenauer and Moore, 2012</xref>). Many SET domains harbor methyltransferase activity for either histone or non-histone substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Del Rizzo and Trievel, 2011</xref>). However, to date, no enzymatic activity has been reported for Prdm14, and interestingly multiple members of the PRDM family appear to be catalytically inactive. Instead, candidate-based co-immunoprecipitation studies implicated Polycomb complex PRC2 as a mediator of Prdm14-dependent repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamaji et al., 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether PRC2 is a major or auxiliary partner of Prdm14, and what other molecular players are important for Prdm14's function.</p><p>To address these questions, we used an unbiased biochemical approach to uncover major Prdm14-associated proteins in mESCs. We identified an ETO-family corepressor, myeloid translocation gene related 1 (Mtgr1, a.k.a. Mtg8r, Cbfa2t2, and Zmynd3), as a direct, stoichiometric partner of Prdm14. We demonstrate that Mtgr1 co-occupies Prdm14 target loci, and its deletion in mESCs results in phenotypes and gene expression defects similar to those observed upon loss of Prdm14. Moreover, Mtgr1 knockout cells show impaired induction of PGC-like cells in vitro. To further facilitate studies of the Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex, we mapped interaction domains and developed multiple synthetic binding proteins, termed monobodies, that specifically recognize the SET domain of Prdm14 in a manner independent of, or alternatively, competitive with Mtgr1. Taking advantage of the stabilizing effect of one such monobody, we obtained a crystal structure of the Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex, revealing an extensive interface and electrostatic interactions mediating the association of the two proteins. Furthermore, structure-guided mutagenesis of the interface and the use of an inhibitory monobody demonstrated the function of the complex in safeguarding pluripotency and PGC-like cell induction. Altogether, we report a multi-disciplinary study that advances our understanding of Prdm14 function, identifying Mtgr1 as the major partner of Prdm14 in its roles in pluripotency and PGC induction, and providing the community with renewable, genetically encoded reagents that can be used both in vitro and in vivo to study and control Prdm14 function in development and malignancy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of Mtgr1 as a novel Prdm14 partner</title><p>To identify Prdm14 partners in an unbiased manner, we employed a two-step immunopurification strategy (FLAG followed by HA [FH]) from a previously described clonal mESC transgenic line stably expressing tagged FH-Prdm14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2011</xref>). Examination of recovered proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and silver staining revealed two major polypeptides that were present in similar quantities in the FH-Prdm14 purifications, but not in the control immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Next, we mapped the minimal regions within Prdm14 and Mtgr1 that were required for the interaction by overexpressing differentially-tagged proteins (V5-Mtgr1 and FH-Prdm14) in HEK293 cells, followed by IP-Western analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). This strategy revealed that the nervy homology region 1 (NHR1) domain of Mtgr1 was necessary and sufficient for the interaction with Prdm14, whereas both Prdm14 SET domain and the region directly preceding it (pre-SET) were important for efficient binding to Mtgr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). To quantify the strength of the Prdm14–Mtgr1 interaction, we next expressed and purified recombinant proteins corresponding to the NHR1 domain of Mtgr1 (residues 98–206) and pre-SET+SET domains of Prdm14 (residues 184–373), and performed a bead-based binding assay in reciprocal orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nishikori et al., 2012</xref>). The obtained binding measurements yielded a dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) in the low nanomolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>), which is consistent with a robust, direct interaction between the two proteins. On the other hand, the binding of the Prdm14 SET domain alone (residues 232–373) to the Mtgr1 NHR1 domain was barely detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), further supporting that both pre-SET and SET domains are required for the high affinity interaction with Mtgr1.</p><p>Altogether, our approach identified an ETO protein Mtgr1 as a novel, direct partner of Prdm14 in mESCs. While the ETO proteins, especially Mtg8 (a.k.a. ETO), have been studied in the context of acute myeloid leukemias (AML) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatlen et al., 2012</xref>), their function in ESCs and during early embryogenesis has not been explored. Notably, all three ETO family members have the capacity to interact with Prdm14 (not shown), but the high expression of Mtgr1 in mESCs compared with Mtg8 and Mtg16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) likely accounts for the preferential recovery of Mtgr1 in our experiments and suggests that this family member may be most relevant in the context of mESCs. We therefore proceeded to explore the functional significance of the Prdm14–Mtgr1 interaction in mESC biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Prdm14 and Mtgr1 co-occupy genomic targets</title><p>Prdm14 is a sequence-dependent DNA-binding protein that binds many genomic loci in mESCs, corresponding primarily to distal regulatory elements, whereas ETO proteins do not contain domains implicated in direct DNA sequence recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rossetti et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2008</xref>).

Not surprisingly, the Prdm14 and Mtgr1 sites shared common functional ontologies, with enrichment for processes involved in embryonic development and cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, the most highly enriched DNA sequence motif at Mtgr1-bound sites corresponded to the previously identified Prdm14 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, we noted that, at many targets, Mtgr1 binding was enhanced by Prdm14 overexpression (see tracks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, compare wt and <italic>FH-Prdm14</italic> ESC). This observation prompted us to quantitatively compare Mtgr1 ChIP-seq enrichments in wt ESCs and <italic>FH-Prdm14</italic> cells that are characterized by ~5-fold overexpression of Prdm14. We observed that Mtgr1 enrichments were higher in <italic>FH-Prdm14</italic> than in wt ESCs at most target sites, consistent with Prdm14-mediated recruitment of Mtgr1 to chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, we also noticed that a subset of Mtgr1 sites was bound more weakly in <italic>FH-Prdm14</italic> cells than in wt ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The major distinction between these two populations was the presence of the Prdm14 sequence motif and Prdm14 occupancy at the sites where Mtgr1 binding was enhanced by Prdm14 overexpression, and lack of the Prdm14 sequence motif with low/no Prdm14 occupancy at the sites where Mtgr1 binding was diminished by Prdm14 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Of note, at the Prdm14 motif-lacking sites, the most enriched sequence motifs corresponded to helix-loop-helix transcription factor recognition sites, suggesting that a TF from this family may be involved in mediating Mtgr1 binding at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Regardless, our results indicate that Prdm14 is sufficient to augment interaction of Mtgr1 with chromatin at its cognate binding sites and, at high levels, redirect it away from the motif-lacking sites. Thus, Prdm14 might be a limiting factor for Mtgr1 recruitment to chromatin. To test this notion further, we performed Mtgr1 ChIP-seq analysis from Prdm14<sup>−/−</sup> ESCs and generated average signal profiles at Prdm14 motif-containing and Prdm14 motif-lacking sites across all our Mtgr1 ChIP-seq datasets. We observed that at Prdm14 motif-containing sites, Mtgr1 binding is increased in FH-Prdm14 overexpressing cells and diminished (but not completely abrogated) in Prdm14<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>, left panel). On the other hand, at Prdm14 motif-lacking sites, Mtgr1 binding is depleted by FH-Prdm14 overexpression, but it is also moderately affected in Prdm14<sup>−/−</sup> cells despite low/no Prdm14 binding at these sites, suggesting an indirect effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>, right panel). Altogether, these results are consistent with the Mtgr1 genomic occupancy being sensitive to the Prdm14 dosage (either loss or gain) at the Prdm14-motif containing sites. However, these results also demonstrate that even in the absence of Prdm14, some Mtgr1 binding remains at the motif-containing sites, suggesting partial redundancies in the recruitment mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Loss of Mtgr1 phenocopies requirement for Prdm14 in safeguarding pluripotency</title><p>Prdm14 has well-characterized roles in pluripotency and PGC formation, and if Mtgr1 is a key mediator of Prdm14's functions then the loss of Mtgr1 should impact these processes in a similar manner.

A more systematic comparison of all genes upregulated at least twofold upon loss of either Prdm14 or Mtgr1 revealed that while indeed, the majority of genes that are upregulated in either knockout are upregulated in both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>, purple dots), a subset of transcripts is preferentially affected only in one of the knockouts (red or blue dots).</p><p>Importantly, in the <italic>FH-Prdm14</italic> or <italic>FH-Mtgr1</italic> reconstituted knockout cells the derepression defects were rescued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Indeed, many of the expression differences observed between wt mESC grown in 2i versus serum were recapitulated in <italic>FH-Prdm14</italic> mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Of note, a subset of transcripts was upregulated only in <italic>FH-Prdm14</italic> cells; many of those genes represent markers of the so-called 2-cell (2C) state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In our analysis of variably expressed genes, the <italic>Prdm14</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Mtgr1</italic><sup>−/−</sup>cell lines clustered together, but separately from the respective rescue lines and wt mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These observations were further confirmed by the global comparisons of transcriptomes with principal component analysis (PCA), in which the <italic>Prdm14</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Mtgr1</italic><sup>−/−</sup>cells were closest to each other and clustered away from the remaining cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Given that: (i) the <italic>FH-Prdm14</italic> cell lines in our study express Prdm14 at levels ~5–6-fold higher than wt ESCs, (ii) Prdm14 has an autonomous DNA-binding activity, and (iii) Prdm14 overexpression can augment Mtgr1 recruitment to the target genes (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we propose that expression changes observed in <italic>FH-Prdm14</italic> cell lines are associated with more robust repression of differentiation programs by Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex compared with wt cells and consequently, with the stabilization of the naïve pluripotency program. Similar gain-of-function effects are not observed in <italic>FH-Mtgr1</italic> cells, likely because Mtgr1 lacks the autonomous ability to access its genomic targets and, at least in mESCs, Prdm14 is limiting for its chromatin association. Altogether, our data uncover the function of Mtgr1 in safeguarding mESC pluripotency and demonstrate that loss of Mtgr1 phenocopies gene expression defects associated with Prdm14 deletion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mtgr1 is required for PGC specification in vitro</title><p>Prdm14 is critical for the specification of PGCs from the post-implantation epiblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Magnúsdóttir and Surani, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamaji et al., 2008</xref>).

Following phage display selection, we performed gene shuffling for affinity maturation and further selection in the yeast display format to isolate clones with high affinity. We identified a total of 12 clones that bound to human PRDM14 (hPRDM14) with <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> &lt;100 nM as measured by yeast surface display (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among them, we identified two clones, Mb(hPRDM14_S4) and Mb(hPRDM14_S14), that bound hPRDM14 (residues 238–487) at least five-fold stronger than the closest homologues, hPRDM6 (residues 194–405) and hPRDM12 (residues 60–229) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We will use shorthand names, Mb(S4) and Mb(S14), for referring to them hereafter for brevity. Additionally, these two monobodies showed comparable binding to the mouse homologue of hPRDM14, Prdm14. Of note, hPRDM14 was able to substitute for the mouse Prdm14 in rescue of the Prdm14<sup>-/-</sup> ESC defects, suggesting both biochemical and biological conservation of function between mouse and humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We produced these two monobodies as purified proteins for further characterization.

We then examined whether these monobodies inhibited the interaction of Prdm14 with Mtgr1. Mb(S14) potently competed against the binding of Mtgr1 to Prdm14 but Mb(S4) did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This result suggests that the two monobodies bind to distinct surfaces of Prdm14 and the epitope for Mb(S14) overlaps with and therefore occludes the Mtgr1-binding surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>We next tested whetherif these monobodies can immunoprecipitate Prdm14 from mESC lysates. Mb(S4) captured Prdm14 and co-immunoprecipitated vast majority of Mtgr1 from the <italic>FH-Prdm14</italic> cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). On the other hand, Mb(S14) captured lower levels of Prdm14 , in agreement with its competition for the same binding surface as Mtgr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Since PRC2 complex has been previously reported to associate with Prdm14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Payer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamaji et al., 2013</xref>), we also looked for the presence of Suz12, a PRC2 component. We did not detect immunoprecipitated Suz12 in the elution fraction for either of the two monobodies. Next, we used monobodies to precipitate endogenous Prdm14 from wt ESCs. Immunoblot analysis with α-Mtgr1 antibody showed that Mb(S4) monobody, which does not disrupt Prdm14-Mtgr1 interaction, recovered endogenous Mtgr1 (and was able to deplete most of it from the extract, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). In addition, we performed Prdm14 Mb(S4)-precipitation/mass spec analysis from wt ESCs, which readily detected Prdm14- and Mtgr1-originating peptides, but did not recover any other PRDM proteins confirming a high specificity of this monobody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). Common to monobodies generated to recognize native, folded proteins, neither Mb(S4) nor Mb(S14) detected denatured Prdm14 in immunoblotting (not shown).

However, aggregation of both proteins resulted in low yields of the complex suitable for crystallization. To overcome this problem, we designed a fusion construct of Prdm14 and Mtgr1 in which the two proteins were linked with a ten-residue linker (GSSGSSGS), a common strategy for stabilizing heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ernst et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kobe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reddy Chichili et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). To confirm that the linker did not distort the Prdm14–Mtgr1 complex, we performed a series of experiments. The fusion protein had the same retention time on size-exclusion chromatography as the unlinked complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that the linker did not alter the stoichiometry of the complex. We then compared the fusion and the unlinked complex using solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Most of the cross peaks in the heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of <sup>15</sup>N-Prdm14 in complex with unlabeled Mtgr1 (where we observe signals only from <sup>15</sup>N-Prdm14) overlapped with those in the HSQC spectrum of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled Prdm14-linker-Mtgr1 (where we observe signals from the entire fusion protein including both Prdm14 and Mtgr1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The large number of overlapping peaks in the two spectra strongly suggests that the Prdm14 protein takes on nearly identical average conformation in the unlinked complex and the fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, the fusion protein and the unlinked complex had the same affinity to Mb(S4), indicating that the linker did not distort the Prdm14 epitope for the monobody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This fusion construct allowed us to overcome the aggregation problem, but it still yielded no crystals in crystallization trials using over 500 conditions.</p><p>We then used Mb(S4), the monobody that did not inhibit the Prdm14-Mtgr1 interaction, as a crystallization chaperone. Monobodies, like antibody fragments, often facilitate the crystallization of otherwise recalcitrant systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koide, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stockbridge et al., 2015</xref>). The addition of Mb(S4) readily led to crystallization of Prdm14-linker-Mtgr1, and we determined its structure to a resolution of 3.06 Å through single wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) phasing using selenomethionine-labeled crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The crystallized complex had two Prdm14-linker-Mtgr1/Mb(S4) complexes in the asymmetric unit. As expected, the monobody bound exclusively to Prdm14, burying 604 Å<sup>2</sup> surface areas, a similar interface size to other monobody/target complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B, E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilbreth et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wojcik et al., 2010</xref>).

The crystallization construct includes residues 184–239 that precede the SET domain (pre-SET) and residues 357–373 following the SET domain (post-SET). Unlike many SET domain-containing proteins, Prdm14 does not have cysteine-rich Zn finger domains adjacent to the SET domain, commonly termed pre-SET and post-SET domains. Thus, in the absence of well-defined domains, we refer to these adjacent segments as pre-SET and post-SET regions. The crystal structure of the mouse Prdm14 SET domain is very similar to that of the hPRDM12 SET domain, the closest human homologue of Prdm14 (PDB ID 3EP0; Cα RMSD=0.99; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The Prdm14 SET domain in our structure has a total of nine β-strands (β1-β9) arranged in three antiparallel β-sheets with a short 3<sub>10</sub> helix (η1) inserted between β6 and β7. The pre-SET region in our construct has a short helix at the N-terminus followed by a long structurally disordered region a part of which (residues 217–239) has no detectable electron density even at 0.5 σ contour levels (2Fo-Fc). The residues that constitute the post-SET region at the C-terminus to the SET domain are arranged in an antiparallel beta sheet (β10 and β11). Overall, the structural features of the PR/SET domain in Prdm14 show no major differences with other PR/SET domains in Prdm proteins.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10150.024</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Data collection, phasing and refinement statistics for Prdm14-linker-Mtgr1/Mb(S4) complex crystals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10150.024">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10150.024</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Native</th><th>SeMet SAD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><bold>Data collection</bold></td> <td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Beamline</td><td>APS 19ID</td><td>APS 19ID</td></tr><tr><td>Space group</td><td>P4<sub>3</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2</td><td>P4<sub>3</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Cell dimensions</italic></td> <td/><td/></tr><tr><td><italic>a, b, c</italic> (Å)</td><td>106.8,106.8,180.7</td><td>106.9, 106.9,180.9</td></tr><tr><td>a, b, g (°)</td><td>90,90,90</td><td>90,90,90</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td><italic>Peak</italic></td> </tr><tr><td>Wavelength</td><td>0.97918 Å</td><td>0.97918 Å</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution (Å)</td><td>37.7–3.05 (3.16–3.05)</td><td>50–3.18 (3.23–3.18)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>R<sub>pim</sub></italic></td> <td>0.024 (0.482)</td><td>0.022 (0.315)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>I</italic> / σ<italic>I</italic></td> <td>30.0 (1.4)</td><td>52.4 (2.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Completeness (%)</td><td>100 (100)</td><td>100 (100)</td></tr><tr><td>Redundancy</td><td>20.5 (19.5)</td><td>86.2 (45.2)</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Refinement</bold></td> <td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Resolution (Å)</td><td>37.7–3.05 (3.16–3.05)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>No. of unique reflections</td><td>20631 (2013)</td><td/></tr><tr><td><italic>R</italic><sub>work</sub> / <italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub></td><td> 0.189/0.250</td><td/></tr><tr><td>No. atoms</td><td>5476</td><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Protein</p></td><td>5476</td><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Ligand/ion</p></td><td>0</td><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Water</p></td><td>0</td><td/></tr><tr><td><italic>B</italic>-factors</td><td>114.3</td><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Protein</p></td><td>114.3</td><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Ligand/ion</p></td><td>0</td><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Water</p></td><td>0</td><td/></tr><tr><td>R.m.s deviations</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Bond lengths (Å)</td><td>0.006</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Bond angles (°)</td><td>1.13</td><td/></tr><tr><td><italic>Ramachandran statistics</italic></td> <td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Favorable</p></td><td> 95.8</td><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Allowed</p></td><td> 4.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td><p>Outliers</p></td><td> 0.1</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>The Mtgr1 NHR1 domain (also called the TAFH domain) is highly conserved in the ETO family. The Mtgr1 NHR1 domain in the crystal structure contains four well-defined α-helices arranged in a bundle (αA-αD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Currently, three NMR structures for the NHR1 domain of human MTG8, another member of the ETO family, are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Park et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Plevin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wei et al., 2007</xref>). Mtgr1 in the crystal structure has almost identical topology as the average solution NMR structure of the NHR1 domain from MTG8 (ETO) in complex with a stabilizing peptide (PDB ID 2KNH; Cα RMSD=1.77 Å; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Similar structural features and high sequence identity for the NHR1 domain in ETO proteins explain the pull-down of Mtg8 and Mtg16 in the FH-Prdm14 purifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> (left); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Mtgr1 contacts with the SET domain and pre-SET region of Prdm14</title><p>The Mtgr1-Prdm14 interaction interface buries 2180 Å<sup>2</sup>, a large interface but still within the observed range for high-affinity protein–protein interaction interfaces with a low nanomolar <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lo Conte et al., 1999</xref>). We observe that Mtgr1 interacts with both SET domain and pre-SET region of Prdm14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), as was predicted from our earlier interaction mapping co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The interactions between the Prdm14 SET domain and Mtgr1, mediated primarily by αA and αD, contribute 65% of the total buried surface area. The substantial interaction interface between the pre-SET region and Mtgr1 (35% of the interface) rationalizes the importance of the pre-SET region in the Prdm14-Mtgr1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Several features in the interface are notable. Arg105 located at the N-terminal end of Mtgr1 αA sits in a pocket formed by Ser290, Met292, Cys319 and Tyr339 of Prdm14 and its guanidinium moiety makes hydrogen bonds with the side chains of all of these residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Mutating Mtgr1 Arg105 to Asp resulted in a loss of detectable binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), and replacing Prdm14 Tyr339 of the pocket with Arg substantially reduced binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In addition, Lys109 in Mtgr1 αA interacts with Glu294, Tyr355 and Pro366 of Prdm14 SET domain. Lys109 in Mtgr1 forms a salt bridge with Glu294 from β5 of the Prdm14 SET domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Mutating either of these residues led to a loss of detectable binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Remarkably, charge reversal of this ionic interaction, that is, the combination of Mtgr1 K109E and Prdm14 E294K restored binding, in agreement with the salt bridge formation across the binding interface in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> middle). These mutation experiments together supports the authenticity of the binding interface observed in the crystal structure and identified critical electrostatic interactions.</p><p>The Mtgr1 interaction with Prdm14 pre-SET region involves residues from Mtgr1 helix αA, αB and αD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Several Leu and Val residues from the helix in the pre-SET region contribute to hydrophobic interactions with residues in Mtgr1 helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In addition, Mtgr1 Asn141 forms hydrogen bonds with residues Phe185 and Phe187 from the helix in the pre-SET region. These results further reinforce the observation that Prdm14 utilizes both pre-SET region and SET domain to interact with Mtgr1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Association of Prdm14 with Mtgr1 is required for mESC maintenance and PGC-LC formation</title><p>Given strong association between Prdm14 and Mtgr1, as well as phenotypic similarities upon loss of either protein, we next examined whether the lack of Prdm14–Mtgr1 interaction would have a biological effect on mESC gene expression and the efficiency of PGC-LC induction. To this end, we first confirmed that the point mutations designed based on the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>) also disrupted the interaction between the full-length proteins in cells, and that the combined charge reversal mutations restored the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Next, we used RNA-seq to compare gene expression patterns of these mESCs after transition from 2i+LIF to serum+LIF culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Given that one of the monobodies we developed, Mb(S14), binds to Prdm14 competitively with Mtgr1, we hypothesized that this reagent can be utilized to inhibit Prdm14 function in living cells or organisms in a highly controlled manner. To provide a proof-of-principle for such strategy, we engineered piggyBac doxycycline-inducible constructs encoding mCherry-Mb(S14) fusion or, as a control, mCherry alone, and introduced them into <italic>Stella</italic>:GFP reporter mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Next, we induced mPGC-LC formation from mESCs in the absence or presence of doxycycline (added during the induction of mPGC-LCs from mEpiLCs) to activate monobody expression. We observed consistent reduction in PGC-LC formation efficiency in cells expressing the mCherry-Mb(S14) fusion protein, as compared with the same cell population without addition of doxycycline or to cells expressing mCherry alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). A more moderate effect of the monobody (compared with the Prdm14 E294K mutation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) is probably due to the fact that this monobody needs to compete against the high-affinity interaction between Prdm14 and Mtgr1. In addition, we noticed a short half-life of the mCherry-Mb(S14) fusion protein (data not shown), which may contribute to the moderate effect but could also facilitate inhibition with high temporal resolution in the future. Thus, Mb(S14) represents a novel tool that can be utilized to perturb Prdm14 function in living cells during a dynamic biological process such as the PGC induction and can be further modified in the future for addressing particular questions using standard protein-engineering technologies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study identified the ETO family co-repressor Mtgr1 as a new regulator of mESC identity, which facilitates molecular functions of Prdm14 through direct binding to its pre-SET/SET region. Therefore, although no evidence has been previously found for the catalytic activity of the Prdm14 SET domain, our data demonstrate that this domain is nonetheless essential for Prdm14 function by mediating the interaction with its key partner, Mtgr1. Prdm14 and Mtgr1 co-occupy distal regulatory regions of many target genes linked to differentiation, DNA methylation and chromatin modification, consistent with their tight interaction. Loss of either protein results in upregulation of a subset of these target genes and a gradual loss of mESC self-renewal. However, similar to what has been observed previously for Prdm14, Mtgr1 is not required for maintenance of mESC under 2i+LIF. This can be explained by the fact that the Fgf/Erk pathway, a major signaling cascade driving both epiblast and extraembryonic endoderm differentiation (to which loss of Prdm14/Mtgr1 sensitizes cells), is inhibited under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nichols and Smith, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Concordant upregulation of gene transcripts in <italic>Prdm14<sup>−/−</sup></italic> or <italic>Mtgr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells compared with wt mESCs supports function of the Prdm14–Mtgr1 complex in gene silencing and agrees with the reported role of Mtgr1 as an HDAC-recruiting co-repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rossetti et al., 2004</xref>). Notably, we detected HDACs 1–3 in our Prdm14 immunoprecipitates, and HDAC3 and other NCoR1 repressive complex components in our purifications with the Mb(S4) monobody, suggesting that the Prdm14–Mtgr1-dependent repression may indeed be facilitated by histone deacetylation and that Mtgr1 is required for recruiting HDACs to Prdm14-binding loci. Furthermore, although a subset of genomic sites occupied by Mtgr1 occurs at Prdm14 motif-lacking sites, the high similarity of transcriptional changes observed upon loss of either protein suggests that the major impact of Mtgr1 on gene expression and cell identity of mESCs is in the context of its association with Prdm14. Moreover, our data suggest that Prdm14 can not only guide, but through change in its levels, quantitatively tune the degree of interaction of ubiquitously expressed Mtgr1 with chromatin.</p><p>Our results from the in vitro PGC-LC formation model strongly suggest that in addition to its role in mESCs, Mtgr1 is also a critical mediator of the Prdm14 function in germline development. Three lines of evidence support this notion: (i) Mtgr1 deletion; (ii) single point mutations in Prdm14 disrupting association with Mtgr1; and (iii) expression of a monobody targeting the Prdm14–Mtgr1 interaction surface, all of which hinder PGC-LC induction in vitro. It is therefore surprising that a <italic>Mtgr1</italic> mouse knockout strain has been reported as viable and fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amann et al., 2005</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether this strain represents a true loss-of-function, because in the mouse targeting strategy, the first six exons are preserved (encoding amino acids 1–316, which span the Prdm14 interaction region and NHR2 domain involved in dimerization and association with mSin3/HDAC complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rossetti et al., 2004</xref>). In light of our findings and aforementioned caveats, we suggest that the in vivo function of Mtgr1 in the germline should be revisited. It is also possible, however, that requirement for Mtgr1 in germ cell development in vivo can be fully or partially compensated by the other ETO proteins. Because residues that form the Prdm14 binding interface in Mtgr1 are conserved among the ETO family members, we expect that the other ETO proteins would bind directly to the Prdm14 pre-SET/SET regions and could therefore compensate for the absence of Mtgr1 function.</p><p>Our study provides novel insights into how pre-SET and SET regions might mediate high affinity protein–protein interactions. While many structures of the catalytic SET domains have been obtained with their substrates (typically, histone tails), to the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first structural analysis of the SET domain acting as a module for a high affinity protein–protein interaction. Interestingly, a comparison of our structure with that of the Prdm9–AdoHcy–histone peptide complex indicates that the surface of the Prdm14 pre-SET and SET regions engaged in interaction with Mtgr1 overlaps with surfaces other Prdm proteins use for binding to their histone peptide substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2013</xref>]). Indeed, Mtgr1 Lys109 is in close proximity to Tyr355 that corresponds to the catalytic Tyr based on the consensus SET domain sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith and Denu, 2009</xref>). In Prdm9, the catalytic tyrosine Tyr356 along with Tyr276 and Tyr341 form the Lys4me2 binding pocket and are critical for catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). In Prdm14, the side chain of Tyr355 flips over (with respect to the conformation of Tyr357 in Prdm9) and interacts with K109 of Mtgr1. The location of K109 is distinct from that of Lys4me2 in Prdm9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>). In addition, the high affinity of the Prdm14–Mtgr1 interaction strongly suggests that Mtgr1 would be a poor substrate, given that a substrate needs to be released after catalysis for efficient enzyme reaction. We also note that His211 and Ala212 in the pre-SET region of Prdm14 occupy the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>) and thus, at least in the context of the presented structure, preclude the binding of this cofactor necessary for methylation. Taken together, our results suggest that Mtgr1 Lys109 is unlikely to be an actual substrate for Prdm14-mediated methylation. Consistent with this notion, radioactive in vitro methyltransferase assays with recombinant Prdm14 and Mtgr1 proteins, their respective interaction mutants, as well as histone substrates, all failed to yield methyltransferase activity (not shown). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that under presently unknown conditions, such activity can ultimately be found. Regardless, our comparisons suggest that substrate-binding surfaces can, in some SET domain proteins, be co-opted for mediating high affinity protein–protein interactions, which may provide a molecular explanation as to why such surfaces are typically highly conserved even in SET domain proteins with no apparent catalytic activity.</p><p>Lastly, aberrant reactivation of the <italic>PRDM14</italic> locus is associated with a variety of human cancers, and mice overexpressing Prdm14 in blood cells develop early-onset T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carofino et al., 2013</xref>). We speculate that the oncogenic function of Prdm14 may be mediated by the formation of a complex with Mtgr1, which is broadly expressed and thus readily available for association in many different organ systems, or perhaps with other ETO proteins using the same interface. If this proves to be the case, inhibition of the Mtgr1-interaction surface on Prdm14 could be an attractive target for therapy as Prdm14 expression is restricted under non-pathological conditions to the preimplantation embryo and PGCs, reducing the risk of off-target effects on normal somatic tissues. Thus, the monobodies directed to Prdm14 generated in this study will be powerful tools for testing the 'druggability' of the Prdm14–Mtgr1 interaction. Indeed, we have introduced monobodies into CML cells and demonstrated the potential druggability of a domain interface in Bcr-Abl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grebien et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the crystal structure shows that Mb(S4) binds to a distinct surface of Prdm14. Because monobodies usually bind to functional sites on target proteins, we hypothesize that the Mb(S4) epitope may also be important for Prdm14 function, which will be a subject of future research. We emphasize that the genetically encoded monobodies are portable tools, as they can be readily introduced into different cells via transfection or viral transduction. This attribute should facilitate the investigation of Prdm14 functions in diverse contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, line derivation and embryoid body formation</title><p>Stable lines expressing tagged Prdm14 were established from single colonies by transducing LF2 mESCs with FH-Prdm14 pTrip lentivirus for 24 hr, followed by selection with neomycin as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2011</xref>); these lines were used for immunoprecipitations followed by mass spectrometry experiments. <italic>Stella:</italic>GFP cells were a gift from A.

Iterative model building and refinement were done using the programs COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>) and PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>).The structure refined from SAD data was later refined against the higher resolution native data at a 3.05 Å resolution. The final structures were analyzed using Procheck and Molprobity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2004</xref>). Figures were made using Pymol (DeLano, 2002). The structure has 100% residues in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot with no outliers. The Molprobity score (2.16) is above average for structures refined at comparable resolutions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>NMR spectroscopy</title><p>Uniformly <sup>15</sup>N-labeled Prdm14-linker-Mtgr1 and <sup>15</sup>N-labeled Prdm14 were prepared by growing bacterial cells in M9 minimal media supplemented with <sup>15</sup>N-labeled ammonium sulphate (0.8 g l<sup>-1</sup>, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>In this study, the Wysocka and Koide labs have examined how Prdm14, a PR-SET domain transcription factor regulates gene expression. Prdm14 has a critical role in pluripotency in ES cells and in the specification of primordial germ cells (PGCs). They have identified an ETO-family protein Mtgr1 as a co-repressor that binds tightly to the preSET/SET domain as shown by crystal structure of Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex. The authors mapped the domains of both proteins involved in direct interaction, demonstrated (via Chip-seq) that these two proteins tend to recognize the same genomic targets, probably through the DNA binding domain of Prdm14, and indicate that Mtgr1 is required for Prdm14 function in ESCs and PGC formation. Mtgr1 is known for its role in leukemias but had not been previously implied in the regulation of pluripotency and germ line formation. In fact, Mtgr1 null mice appear viable and fertile, suggesting some redundancy in vivo.</p> <p>The authors also generated a collection of monobodies that either disrupt the interaction between Prdm14 and Mtgr1 or allow the co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins. Using a monobody that does not inhibit Prdm14-Mtgr1 interaction and a tethered protein construct, the authors obtain crystals of Prdm14-Mtgr1-Mb(S4). The structure was used to analyze the effects of interface mutants.</p> <p>Overall, the findings are novel and provide information, at least in part, on how Prdm14 functions to repress target genes. Previous studies had indicated Prdm14 interaction with PRC2 and TET1/2, which could not be confirmed in this study. Prdm14 can also activate some genes, but how this occurs remains to be determined in the future.</p> <p>The authors apply a wide range of approaches, ranging from ESC studies (with knockouts) to structures, monobody generation, and genomics. Indeed, the monobody approach could represent a novel tool to study pluripotency and the regulation of gene expression, and open up mechanisms to target Prdm14 in cancers. With appropriate revisions, this paper is highly suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>1) The conclusion from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> is that some Mtgr1 bound sites are Prdm14 independent. However, that may not be completely clear based on just over-expression experiments. The authors should acknowledge this (editing the manuscript to be more clear on this point) or add new experiments such as showing Mtgr1 ChIP at &quot;Prdm14-independent&quot; sites in a Prdm14 KO ESC line, or upon over-expression of mutant Prdm14 constructs.</p> <p>Further, it would be informative to know if there are Prdm14 binding sites without Mtgr1. This might indicate that Prdm14 could recruit other interactors to targets, especially to putative targets that might be activated by Prdm14. The authors are encouraged to add new data to clarify these points, or alter the text to be more clear on what is formally shown by the existing data.</p> <p>2) The RNA-seq data obtained from ESCs expressing mutant Prdm14 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) should be shown by PCA analysis and differential gene expression/heatmaps as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B/C</xref>, plus some correlation values/GO-terms, to better reveal the similarity between the samples. Also, it seems only one mutant's RNA-seq data are shown? Data from at least an n=2 is needed.</p> <p>3) Loss of Prdm14 and Mtgr1 in ES cells led to the upregulation of target genes. Careful comparison of the RNA-Seq data might show if there are any differences between them. The authors are encouraged to perform such analyses and clarify which targets are in common and which are distinct.</p> <p>4) The study shows that Mtgr1 (like Prdm14) is required for PGC specification. This suggests that Prdm14-Mtgr1 plays a similar role to that in ES cells. While this is a reasonable assumption, it does not discount additional or different targets (repressed and activated) in PGCs. it remains unclear whether Mtgr1 deletion does specifically affect germline differentiation or would lead to a general block in differentiation. Thus, the question remains whether the critical function of Mtgr1 is limited to the germline. The analysis of the self-renewing ESC state in the absence of Mtgr1 is rather limited (only RNA-seq and morphology). Expansion of these analyses to clarify whether Mtgr1 blocks cell differentiation more generally would be welcomed.</p> <p>5) Published data on Mtgr1 knockout does not support the proposed role for this gene since the mutant mice are viable and fertile. This remains a major issue to be resolved in light of this study. While other ETO proteins might compensate for Mtgr1 in the germline in vivo, this would also be expected in the in vitro studies on PGCLCs. Some discussion of this conundrum is warranted.</p> <p>6) Prdm14 and Mtgr1 should be shown to interact in wt ESCs that are not over-expressing any tagged proteins.</p> <p>7) There is quite high percentage (&gt;10%) of the protein residues located outside of favorable Ramachandran plot, which is unusual. The authors need to check their structure carefully, and/or give an explanation for such large number of residues in non-favorable conformations. For example, what were the values for <italic>R<sub>merge</sub></italic> or <italic>R<sub>sym</sub></italic> (in addition to <italic>R<sub>pim</sub></italic>)?</p> <p>8) A covalently linked construct of Prdm14-linker-Mtgr1 was used for crystallization, to overcome the aggregation problem. There could be potential issues with this approach by artificially forcing the two domains together in a certain way. To alleviate these concerns, a specific protease site could be introduced into the linker. The authors could probe whether, after cleavage, the two proteins still associate? Can the same crystal be obtained after adding Mb(S4)? I note that, based on the structure information provided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), the construct could also be made in the order of Mtgr1-linker-Prdm14. Does this give the same crystal and/or structure? The reviewers find it important to provide data demonstrating that the specific linked construct used did not impact the structure presented.</p> <p>9) The work on monobodies is of general interest. Here the work refers to the use of human PRDM14. Is there evidence to show that hPRDM14 can substitute for mouse Prdm14 in ES cells or PGCs? I note in the crystal structure studies that mouse Prdm14 SET domain is similar to human PRDM12 SET domain.</p></body> </sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10150.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub> <body><p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) The conclusion from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> is that some Mtgr1 bound sites are Prdm14 independent. However, that may not be completely clear based on just over-expression experiments. The authors should acknowledge this (editing the manuscript to be more clear on this point) or add new experiments such as showing Mtgr1 ChIP at &quot;Prdm14-independent&quot; sites in a Prdm14 KO ESC line, or upon over-expression of mutant Prdm14 constructs.</italic> </p> <p>In the original manuscript we uncovered two types of Mtgr1 genomic sites: first class contained Prdm14 sequence recognition motif, whereas the second class did not. Based on these observations we referred to the first class as the 'Prdm14-dependent' and to the second class as 'Prdm14-independent' sites. We further noted that the first class sites showed robust Prdm14 binding and gain of Mtgr1 ChIP-seq signal in the Prdm14 overexpressing cell line. In contrast, the second class showed low/no Prdm14 binding and diminished occupancy of Mtgr1 upon Prdm14 overexpression. However, we agree with the reviewers that our results did not show directly that Prdm14 is not required for Mtgr1 binding at the second class of sites, and in retrospect, we should have referred to these sites as 'Prdm14 motif-lacking' sites rather than 'Prdm14-independent'. This is now rectified in the revised manuscript.</p> <p>To address the reviewers' comment further, we have now performed Mtgr1 ChIP-seq from Prdm14<sup>-/-</sup> ESCs, and generated average signal profiles at Prdm14 motif-containing and Prdm14 motif-lacking sites across all our ChIP-seq datasets (shown in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The results can be summarized as follows: (i) in wt ESCs, the average Mtgr1 enrichment is similar at Prdm14 motif-containing vs. lacking sites (compare black profiles in left and right panels; note that the scale on the Y axis is the same), (ii) at Prdm14 motif-containing sites, Mtgr1 binding is increased in FH- Prdm14 OE cells and diminished (but not entirely abrogated) in Prdm14<sup>-/-</sup> cells, left panel, (iii) at Prdm14 motif-lacking sites, Mtgr1 binding is diminished by FH-Prdm14 overexpression, but it is also moderately affected in Prdm14<sup>-/-</sup> cells (right panel). Altogether, these results are consistent with the Mtgr1 binding to chromatin being sensitive to the Prdm14 dosage (either loss or gain) at the Prdm14-motif containing sites, which are the main focus of our study. However, these results also demonstrate that even in the absence of Prdm14, some Mtgr1 binding remains at the motif-containing sites, suggesting partial redundancies in the recruitment mechanisms. Finally, although quite likely a modest negative effect of Prdm14 deletion on Mtgr1 binding at motive-lacking sites can be attributed to indirect effects (given that these sites show low/no Prdm14 occupancy), we nonetheless concur that it is best to refrain from calling these sites Prdm14-independent.</p> <p>We have now clarified some of these nuances in the text (subsection “Prdm14 and Mtgr1 co-occupy genomic targets”) and also included an additional figure showing the top five sequence motifs recovered at the Prdm14 motif-lacking Prdm14 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Of note, the top motif recovered at these sites represents a consensus motif for helix-loop-helix transcription factors, suggesting that a TF from this family may be mediating Mtgr1 recruitment to the Prdm14 motif-lacking sites.</p> <p><italic>Further, it would be informative to know if there are Prdm14 binding sites without Mtgr1. This might indicate that Prdm14 could recruit other interactors to targets, especially to putative targets that might be activated by Prdm14. The authors are encouraged to add new data to clarify these points, or alter the text to be more clear on what is formally shown by the existing data.</italic> </p> <p>We have not been able to detect a class of Prdm14 sites devoid of Mtgr1 binding. This point is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, showing Mtgr1 vs. Prdm14 ChIP-seq enrichments at all genomic sites bound by either Mtgr1 or Prdm14 in FH-Prdm14 overexpressing ESCs. If a class of sites bound strongly by Prdm14, but not Mtgr1 existed, than it would show up as a population of sites that have high signal at the X axis and low signal at the Y axis. However, we do not detect such population. As a side note with respect to the previous comment: given that this analysis was out of necessity (as we do not have a ChIP-compatible Prdm14 antibody) done in FH-Prdm14 OE cells, in which Mtgr1 binding at Prdm14 motif-lacking sites is highly diminished, the population of sites that have low value on the X axis and high value on the Y axis (e.g. bound by Mtgr1 and not Prdm14) is also relatively small. Consequently, Mtgr1 and Prdm14 binding patterns in FH-Prdm14 cells are highly correlated (R correlation coefficient ~0.9).</p> <p><italic>2) The RNA-seq data obtained from ESCs expressing mutant Prdm14 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) should be shown by PCA analysis and differential gene expression/heatmaps as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>/C, plus some correlation values/GO-terms, to better reveal the similarity between the samples. Also, it seems only one mutant's RNA-seq data are shown? Data from at least an n=2 is needed.</italic> </p> <p>First, we want to clarify that data from two distinct cell lines reconstituted with Prdm14 E294K mutants were used in our analyses. Following the reviewers' suggestions, we have now performed the principal component analysis, differential gene expression, and clustering based on distances among our samples, including the two Prdm14<sup>-/-</sup> cell lines reconstituted with the mutant Prdm14 protein. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>. Altogether, these results support the notion that Prdm14 E294K lines show hypomorphic expression profile, which falls in between the Prdm14<sup>-/-</sup> ESCs and those reconstituted with wt Prdm14. Nonetheless, cells reconstituted with Prdm14 E294K mutant cluster together with Prdm14<sup>-/-</sup> and Mtgr1<sup>-/-</sup> cells and away from cells rescued with wt Prdm14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). When considering PCA plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>, please note the following: (i) cells reconstituted with wt Prdm14 have a gain-of-function phenotype, which results in tighter repression of differentiation genes and makes their gene expression profile look more like that of ESCs grown under 2i+LIF, even when they are maintained under serum, (ii) wt and mutant reconstituted cell lines show comparable Prdm14 overexpression levels.</p> <p><italic>3) Loss of Prdm14 and Mtgr1 in ES cells led to the upregulation of target genes. Careful comparison of the RNA-Seq data might show if there are any differences between them. The authors are encouraged to perform such analyses and clarify which targets are in common and which are distinct.</italic> </p> <p>We have performed careful analysis of all genes that are upregulated at least twofold upon knockout of either Prdm14 or Mtgr1 (datasets from multiple clonal knockout lines have been considered for each), and we color coded them based on whether they are statistically significantly affected in one or both set of knockout samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref> in the revised manuscript). The majority of genes upregulated in either knockout is upregulated in both (purple dots). However, there is also a subset of genes that show significant upregulation only in Mtgr1 null cells (blue dots) or only in Prdm14 null cells (red dots). To our knowledge, these differential genes do not appear to be associated with a coherent biological function or phenotype. Nonetheless, to facilitate further follow up work we have incorporated gene names for these uniquely upregulated transcripts into the figure.</p> <p><italic>4) The study shows that Mtgr1 (like Prdm14) is required for PGC specification. This suggests that Prdm14-Mtgr1 plays a similar role to that in ES cells. While this is a reasonable assumption, it does not discount additional or different targets (repressed and activated) in PGCs. it remains unclear whether Mtgr1 deletion does specifically affect germline differentiation or would lead to a general block in differentiation. Thus, the question remains whether the critical function of Mtgr1 is limited to the germline. The analysis of the self-renewing ESC state in the absence of Mtgr1 is rather limited (only RNA-seq and morphology). Expansion of these analyses to clarify whether Mtgr1 blocks cell differentiation more generally would be welcomed.</italic> </p> <p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important point. To test whether loss of Mtgr1 results in general block of cell differentiation, we induced embryoid body (EB) formation from wild type and Mtgr1<sup>-/-</sup> mESCs and analyzed expression of differentiation markers by RT- qPCR at day 4 and day 8 after induction. We detected comparable expression of markers representing all three germ layers in wild type and Mtgr1<sup>-/-</sup> EBs (these results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Although we cannot exclude a possibility that Mtgr1<sup>-/-</sup> cells show differentiation defects in specific somatic lineages, our data are inconsistent with a general block in differentiation.</p> <p><italic>5) Published data on Mtgr1 knockout does not support the proposed role for this gene since the mutant mice are viable and fertile. This remains a major issue to be resolved in light of this study. While other ETO proteins might compensate for Mtgr1 in the germline in vivo, this would also be expected in the in vitro studies on PGCLCs. Some discussion of this conundrum is warranted.</italic> </p> <p>We agree that this is a conundrum, as based on our results one would expect a germline phenotype in Mtgr1 knockout mouse, unless a stronger selection for the compensation by other ETO proteins occurs in vivo than in the vitro derived cells. Nonetheless, there are also caveats associated with the described targeting strategy in published Mtgr1 knockout mice, namely the first six exons encoding amino acids 1-316 (spanning the Prdm14 interaction region as well as NHR2 domain involved in dimerization and association with mSin3/HDAC complex), are still preserved (Amann et al., 2005; Rossetti et al., 2004). Thus, this mutant strain is likely hypomorphic. Furthermore, through a symposium presentation earlier this year we became aware of another Mtgr1 knockout study using a different targeting strategy, in which homozygous null mice showed very strong defects in both male and female germline. However, given that this work is as of yet unpublished and we are not familiar with all experimental details, unfortunately we cannot comment on these distinct results in our manuscript. We therefore hope that the reviewers can understand that we keep the discussion of the apparent discrepancy fairly succinct (from main text Discussion section):</p> <p>“It is therefore surprising that Mtgr1 mouse knockout strain has been reported as viable and fertile (Amann et al., 2005). However, it remains unclear whether this strain represents a true loss-of-function, because in the mouse targeting strategy the first six exons are preserved (encoding amino acids 1-316 which span the Prdm14 interaction region and NHR2 domain involved in dimerization and association with mSin3/HDAC complex) (Rossetti et al., 2004). In light of our findings and aforementioned caveats, we suggest that the in vivo function of Mtgr1 in the germline should be revisited. It is also possible, however, that requirement for Mtgr1 in germ cell development in vivo can be fully or partially compensated by the other ETO proteins.”</p> <p><italic>6) Prdm14 and Mtgr1 should be shown to interact in wt ESCs that are not over-expressing any tagged proteins.</italic> </p> <p>While IP experiments with endogenous proteins were initially hampered by the lack of suitable antibodies recognizing mouse Prdm14, we were now able to perform these analyses by taking advantage of our monobodies, which we used to precipitate endogenous Prdm14 from wild type ESCs. Immunoblot analysis with α-Mtgr1 antibody showed that Mb(S4) monobody, which does not disrupt Prdm14-Mtgr1 interaction, but not Mb(S14) monobody, which binds competitively, recovers endogenous Mtgr1 (and is able to deplete most of it from the extract). These data are now part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>. In addition, we now performed Prdm14 Mb(S4)-precipitation/mass spec analysis from wt ESCs, which readily detected Mtgr1-originating peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p> <p><italic>7) There is quite high percentage (&gt;10%) of the protein residues located outside of favorable Ramachandran plot, which is unusual. The authors need to check their structure carefully, and/or give an explanation for such large number of residues in non-favorable conformations. For example, what were the values for</italic> R<sub>merge</sub> <italic>or</italic> R<sub>sym</sub> <italic>(in addition to</italic> R<sub>pim</sub><italic>)?</italic> </p> <p>We thank the reviewer(s) for suggesting the possibility of improving the structure. We have now reexamined the structure and indeed we have been able to improve its geometries. The new structure has 95.8% favorable, 4.1% allowed and 0.1% outliers, which we consider as acceptable statistics. In addition, the newly refined structure has improved <italic>R/R<sub>free</sub></italic> values of 0.189/0.250. The improved structure no longer has statistically unusual features.</p> <p><italic>8) A covalently linked construct of Prdm14-linker-Mtgr1 was used for crystallization, to overcome the aggregation problem. There could be potential issues with this approach by artificially forcing the two domains together in a certain way. To alleviate these concerns, a specific protease site could be introduced into the linker. The authors could probe whether, after cleavage, the two proteins still associate? Can the same crystal be obtained after adding Mb(S4)? I note that, based on the structure information provided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), the construct could also be made in the order of Mtgr1-linker-Prdm14. Does this give the same crystal and/or structure? The reviewers find it important to provide data demonstrating that the specific linked construct used did not impact the structure presented.</italic> </p> <p>We appreciate the importance of explicitly supporting the authenticity of the structure determined with the use of a flexible linker, although connecting an interacting pair of proteins with a flexible linker is a common approach to stabilize the complex while retaining its biological function. This linker strategy is well accepted among crystallographers (Ernst et al., 2014; Kobe et al., 2015; Reddy Chichili et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2015). The linker we used in this work is similar to those used for the single-chain Fv form of antibodies in which the light and heavy chain domains are linked. There are thousands of single-chain Fv molecules that are fully functional and most likely retain the native conformation. Whereas the approach suggested by the reviewers is intriguing, the difficulties in handling the Mtgr1 protein at high concentrations and our complete failure in crystallizing unlinked constructs even with the monobody strongly suggest that it would be a long-term project in itself. Therefore, we have taken different approaches using NMR spectroscopy and affinity measurements and produced additional data that strongly support the authenticity of the structure.</p> <p>First, we compared the <sub>1</sub>H-<sub>15</sub>N HSQC spectrum of <sub>15</sub>N-Prdm14 in complex with unlabeled Mtgr1 against that of <sub>15</sub>N-labeled Prdm14-linker-Mtgr1 fusion. Because the amide NMR chemical shifts are exquisitely sensitive to the local conformation and each amino acid residue (except for proline) gives rise to an HSQC cross peak, a <sub>1</sub>H-<sub>15</sub>N HSQC spectrum gives a comprehensive fingerprint of an <sub>15</sub>N-labeled protein. Most of the cross peaks in the HSQC spectrum of <sub>15</sub>N-Prdm14 in complex with unlabeled Mtgr1 (shown in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>; where we observe signals only from <sub>15</sub>N-Prdm14) overlapped with those in the HSQC spectrum of <sub>15</sub>N-labeled Prdm14-linker-Mtgr1 (shown in black; where we observe signals from both Prdm14 and Mtgr1). The high levels of coincided peaks in the two spectra strongly suggest that the Prdm14 protein takes on nearly identical conformation in the unlinked complex and in the fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Please also note that the spectrum for <sub>15</sub>N-Prdm14 in complex with unlabeled Mtgr1 was of poorer quality because we needed to keep its concentration low to prevent aggregation.</p> <p>Second, we determined the affinity of Mb(S4) to the Prdm14-linker-Mtgr1 fusion and to the Prdm14/Mtgr1 complex. The dissociation constants of Mb(S4) to these two samples were identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that the epitope for Mb(S4) on Prdm14 is not distorted by the introduction of the linkage between Prdm14 and Mtgr1.</p> <p>In addition to the new data described above, we would like to note the following points already in the original manuscript that support the crystal structure:</p> <p>i) The linked molecule maintained the 1:1 heterodimer architecture of the separate Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex in solution and in the crystal. Therefore, the linkage did not introduce gross changes to the complex, such as oligomerization due to 3D domain swapping (reviewed in (Liu and Eisenberg, 2002)). The size-exclusion chromatography data are now included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>.</p> <p>ii) The linker used in our work is sufficiently long to allow the two domains to move freely. The distance between the beginning and end of the linker in the observed structure is ~18 Å, whereas the polypeptide connecting these points include eight residues that can span more than 24 Å even using a conserved (i.e. short) distance estimate of 3 Å per residue. Accordingly, the linker makes a U-turn in the structure and it cannot impose steric strain (&quot;pull&quot;) between the two domains. Indeed, several residues within the linker are undetected, suggesting that they are flexible and not under tension. In retrospect, the dotted straight lines in original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> may have given a false sense of tension or distortion in the structure. We have replaced the line with a curve that more accurately reflects the actual length of the linker.</p> <p>iii) The reviewer suggested, &quot;<italic>To alleviate these concerns, a specific protease site could be introduced into the linker. The authors could probe whether, after cleavage, the two proteins still associate?&quot;</italic> We have shown that free Prdm14 and Mtgr1 associate with high affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>), which in our opinion has already answered this question.</p> <p>iv) The mutation data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) validate the authenticity of the observed interface including a specific ionic interaction in the full-length Prdm14 and Mtgr1 proteins, and show that structure-based mutations affect key biological functions of Prdm14.</p> <p>Altogether, we hope that this extensive series of results convinces reviewers that the linker strategy used here introduced little if any perturbation to the conformation of the Prdm14/Mtgr1 complex. In order to clarify this important point, we have added a paragraph that summarizes the discussion above (subsection “Generation of renewable monobody reagents to study and inhibit Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex”).</p> <p><italic>9) The work on monobodies is of general interest. Here the work refers to the use of human PRDM14. Is there evidence to show that hPRDM14 can substitute for mouse Prdm14 in ES cells or PGCs? I note in the crystal structure studies that mouse Prdm14 SET domain is similar to human PRDM12 SET domain.</italic> </p> <p>First, we would like to point out that our monobodies recognize mouse and human Prdm14 with similar affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Regarding the second part of the comment: a question whether hPRDM14 can complement defects observed upon loss of the mouse protein has, to our knowledge, never been addressed. Therefore, to answer reviewer's point, we cloned hPRDM14 cDNA, and introduced it to mouse Prdm14<sub>-/-</sub> ESCs using a piggyBac system. We subsequently compared tagged Prdm14 levels (by immunoblotting), cell morphology and expression of select Prdm14-bound genes (by RT- qPCR) in Prdm14<sub>-/-</sub> ESCs reconstituted with either mouse or human Prdm14 (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These analyses revealed that at least with respect to ESC functions, the hPRDM14 could substitute for the mouse protein (see subsection “Generation of renewable monobody reagents to study and inhibit Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex”).</p></body> </sub-article></article>
