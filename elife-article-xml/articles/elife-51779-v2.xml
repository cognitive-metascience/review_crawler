potential. The paucity of therapies for tendon injuries is due to our limited understanding of the cells and molecular pathways that drive tendon regeneration. Using a mouse model of neonatal tendon regeneration, we identified TGFβ signaling as a major molecular pathway that drives neonatal tendon regeneration. Through targeted gene deletion, small molecule inhibition, and lineage tracing, we elucidated TGFβ-dependent and TGFβ-independent mechanisms underlying tendon regeneration. Importantly, functional recovery depended on canonical TGFβ signaling and loss of function is due to impaired tenogenic cell recruitment from both <italic>Scleraxis</italic>-lineage and non-<italic>Scleraxis</italic>-lineage sources. We show that TGFβ signaling is directly required in neonatal tenocytes for recruitment and that TGFβ ligand is positively regulated in tendons. Collectively, these results show a functional role for canonical TGFβ signaling in tendon regeneration and offer new insights toward the divergent cellular activities that distinguish regenerative vs fibrotic healing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tendon</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>tgfβ</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR069537</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Alice H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31AR073626</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaji</surname><given-names>Deepak A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR070748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hubmacher</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TGFß signaling regulates migration of tenogenic cells from Scx- and non-Scx lineages and is required for functional regeneration after neonatal tendon injury.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tendons connect muscle to bone and function to transmit muscle forces to the skeleton. Tendon function is enabled by a specialized extracellular matrix predominantly composed of highly aligned type I collagen fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Voleti et al., 2012</xref>). Although healthy tendon can normally resist high mechanical loads, mechanical properties are permanently impaired after injury due to its minimally regenerative potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Voleti et al., 2012</xref>). This loss of function can lead to chronic pain, decreased quality of life, and increased risk of re-rupture. Current treatment options remain limited and there are almost no cell or biological treatments to improve tendon repair or induce regeneration.</p><p>To date, the majority of injury models to study tendon healing result in scar-mediated healing since adult tendon does not regenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackerman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dyment et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dyment et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Howell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katzel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mass and Tuel, 1991</xref>). Although a few groups showed successful tendon regeneration in model systems such as fetal sheep and MRL/MpJ mice, genetic manipulation is relatively challenging in these systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beredjiklian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paredes et al., 2018</xref>). To overcome these limitations, we previously established a model of tendon regeneration in neonatal mice, that can be directly compared to fibrotic tendon healing in adult mice within the same genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Howell et al., 2017</xref>). Using lineage tracing, we found that neonatal tendon regeneration is driven by tenocyte proliferation, recruitment, and differentiation leading to full functional restoration. In contrast, adult tendon healing is defined by the persistence of aSMA+ cells, absence of tenocyte proliferation or recruitment, abnormal differentiation into cartilaginous cells, and loss of functional tendon properties. Having identified cellular processes distinguishing neonatal and adult tendon healing, we now focus on the molecular pathways that regulate neonatal tendon regeneration.</p><p>Although FGF signaling was first established in chick tendon development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brent et al., 2003</xref>), the TGFβ pathway subsequently emerged as the most important signaling pathway identified for mammalian tendon formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Havis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pryce et al., 2009</xref>). Members of the TGFβ superfamily of growth factors signal through type II receptors, which then dimerize with type I receptors. The type I receptor then phosphorylates intracellular Smad transcription factors that complex with the co-Smad, SMAD4, to change transcriptional programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shi and Massagué, 2003</xref>). In mouse embryos, TGFβ ligands are expressed by tendon cells and genetic deletion of the TGFβ type II receptor (TβR2) or the TGFβ ligands result in a total absence of tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Havis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pryce et al., 2009</xref>). TGFβs also induce expression of the tendon transcription factor, <italic>Scleraxis</italic> (<italic>Scx</italic>), in different experimental systems including embryonic limb explants, mesenchymal stem cells, and tendon-derived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pryce et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its essential role in tendon development and tendon cell differentiation, TGFβ is also a known inducer of fibrotic scar formation in diverse tissues, including adult tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katzel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thomopoulos et al., 2015</xref>). TGFβ is well established as a driver of myofibroblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Border and Noble, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Desmoulière et al., 1993</xref>) and excessive release of TGFβ ligand after injury can also induce tenocyte death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maeda et al., 2011</xref>). Given these contradictory roles of TGFβ signaling in both tendon differentiation and scar formation, it is unclear whether TGFβ signaling enacts a positive or negative response in the context of tendon regeneration. To determine the requirement for TGFβ signaling in neonatal tendon regeneration, we used pharmacological TGFβ inhibition and genetic deletion experiments. We identified a role for canonical TGFβ signaling in promoting functional regeneration of neonatal tendon and recruitment of tenogenic cells derived from both <italic>Scx</italic> and non-<italic>Scx</italic> lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TGFβ signaling is activated after neonatal injury</title><p>To determine whether TGFβ signaling is activated after neonatal injury, we measured gene expression of the TGFβ type II receptor (<italic>Tgfbr2</italic>) and the isoforms <italic>Tgfb1</italic>, <italic>Tgfb2</italic>, and <italic>Tgfb3</italic> at day (d) 3, d7, d14, and d28 post-injury by qPCR. <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>was expressed at all time points after injury and upregulated in injured tendons compared to uninjured controls at d7 and d28 (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>Tgfb1 </italic>and <italic>Tgfb2 </italic>expression levels were transiently upregulated at alternating time points; however, overall expression levels were quite low for <italic>Tgfb2</italic> expression (several fold lower than <italic>Tgfb1</italic> and <italic>Tgfb3</italic>), suggesting a relatively minor role in regeneration for this ligand.

We found that early proliferation of Scx<sup>lin</sup> tenocytes and activation of aSMA+ cells do not depend on TGFβ signaling. However, proliferation of non-Scx<sup>lin</sup> cells, subsequent recruitment of tenogenic cells (from Scx<sup>lin</sup> and non-Scx<sup>lin</sup> sources), and functional restoration depend on TGFβ signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). TGFβ signaling is a known regulator of many cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shi and Massagué, 2003</xref>). In tendon, TGFβ signaling is essential for embryonic tendon development as well as for the induction and maintenance of tendon cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pryce et al., 2009</xref>). However, after injury, TGFβ signaling is also known as a driver for fibrotic, scar-mediated healing and excessive TGFβ signaling results in tenocyte apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katzel et al., 2011</xref>). In the context of tendon regeneration, it was therefore unclear whether TGFβ would be required for tendon differentiation or whether activation of TGFβ would drive fibrotic responses. Using our previously established model of neonatal tendon regeneration, we show here that TGFβ signaling is induced after injury and is required for the recruitment of neonatal tenocytes to the injury site. Since tenocyte proliferation after injury was not affected by inhibition of TGFβ signaling, we propose that tenocyte-mediated regeneration requires active migration of cells to bridge the gap space. This is further supported by in vitro data showing enhanced migration of neonatal tenocytes in the presence of TGFβ ligand and is consistent with several studies for other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shi and Massagué, 2003</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Requirement for TGFβ signaling in neonatal tendon regeneration.</title><p>Schematic depiction of conceptual model of the TGFβ-dependent and TGFβ-independent cellular processes during neonatal tendon regeneration.

Inhibition of TGFβ signaling also resulted in reduced numbers of these cells. One potential source of these cells may be the epitenon as it was previously proposed that tendon stem/progenitor cells reside in epitenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dyment et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dyment et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gumucio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mendias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mienaltowski et al., 2013</xref>). Although lineage tracing with <italic>Acta2-CreERT2</italic> showed restricted labeling in the epitenon/paratenon in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dyment et al., 2014</xref>), we found considerable labeling in tenocytes at neonatal stages. After injury, αSMA<sup>lin</sup> cells were recruited into the neotendon, suggesting that this may be the source of non-Scx<sup>lin</sup>, <italic>Scx-GFP</italic> cells. However, not all of the <italic>Scx-GFP</italic> cells in this line were derived from αSMA<sup>lin</sup> cells; therefore, the possibility of additional sources of tenogenic cells cannot be excluded. Alternatively, since <italic>Acta2-CreERT2</italic> labels only a sub-population of uninjured tenocyes, it may be that <italic>Scx-GFP</italic>-only cells in these mice are derived from the Scx<sup>lin</sup>, non-αSMA<sup>lin</sup> population. Double labeling for αSMA<sup>lin</sup> and Scx<sup>lin</sup> cells would be required to test this hypothesis; however, this is not currently possible using existing genetic tools. Other sources of tenogenic cells include tendon-associated vasculature, as CD146+ pericytes have been identified near tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Since <italic>Scx-GFP</italic> may also be more broadly expressed compared to true <italic>Scx</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best and Loiselle, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pryce et al., 2007</xref>), the non-Scx<sup>lin</sup>/<italic>Scx-GFP</italic> and non-αSMA<sup>lin</sup>/<italic>Scx-GFP</italic> populations detected may also be a limitation of the transgenic reporter and not represent novel tenogenic cell populations. These issues can be addressed by using single cell RNASeq of sorted Scx<sup>lin</sup> and αSMA<sup>lin</sup> populations in future studies.</p><p>Unlike Scx<sup>lin</sup> cells, αSMA<sup>lin</sup> cells were present in the neotendon at d14 with SB-431542 treatment, consistent with immunostaining results showing considerable presence of αSMA+ cells at d3. However, quantitative measurements are required to determine whether proliferation or recruitment of these cells is affected by SB-431542 treatment. In addition to the αSMA<sup>lin</sup>/<italic>Scx-GFP</italic>+ cells occupying the neotendon at d14, we also identified αSMA<sup>lin</sup>/<italic>Scx-GFP</italic>- cells. These cells were largely negative for αSMA immunostaining at this timepoint, yet did not adopt a tenogenic phenotype. The role of this population in tendon regeneration is unclear, but they may function to support tenogenic cells, undergo tenogenesis themselves, or also adopt a fibrotic phenotype. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the αSMA<sup>lin</sup> cells in the gap space at d3 are the same ones observed in the neotendon at d14, or whether they represent a second wave of cell recruitment at later stages of the healing response. Additional experiments with quantitative measurements, temporal labeling, and localized ablation can be carried out in future studies to fully elucidate the dynamics of the αSMA<sup>lin</sup> populations, their interaction with the Scx<sup>lin</sup> population, and their roles in tendon regeneration and fibrosis. Despite impaired recruitment of tenogenic cells after TGFβ signaling inhibition, the expression of tenogenic markers <italic>Scx</italic>, <italic>Tnmd</italic>, and <italic>Mkx</italic> were not different at d14. Identifying additional markers for tendon cell fate is the focus of ongoing studies.</p><p>We identified a potential source of TGFβ ligands in cells within the gap space, which may drive directional migration of the tenocytes from the stubs. After injury, there was an increase in TGFβ ligands in the tendon stub, which was suppressed by small molecule inhibition of TGFβ signaling. This suggests that initiation of TGFβ signaling results in positive feedback in tenocytes. We also observed a requirement for proliferation and recruitment of non-Scx<sup>lin</sup> cells, but only with SB-431542 treatment and not in the TGFBR2<sup>Scx</sup> mutant (which only targets TGFβ signaling in Scx<sup>lin</sup> cells). This suggests that in the absence of Scx<sup>lin</sup> cell recruitment, there is compensatory proliferation or recruitment of non-Scx<sup>lin</sup> cells that also depends on TGFβ signaling. Other sources of TGFβs may be immune cells, which are known to secrete TGFβs. Of the three TGFβ isoforms, gene expression data suggested that the primary ligands driving neonatal regeneration may be TGFβs 1 and 3. Although <italic>Tgfb1</italic> showed bimodal upregulation pattern, <italic>Tgfb3</italic> was consistently upregulated after injury. Analysis of TGFB1 protein at d14 surprisingly showed a large change of total TGFB1 only, with no change in active TGFB1. TGFβs are typically secreted in a latent form bound to LTBPs in the extracellular matrix and release of TGFβs to its active form can be induced by proteases or mechanically (such as with transection injury) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maeda et al., 2011</xref>). It is generally thought that ligand signaling can only occur with release of TGFβs from LTBP. However, recent studies using cryo-EM suggest that TGFβ activation can also occur without release from LTBP. This mechanism depends on interaction with the integrin αvβ8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2020</xref>). Alternatively, it is also possible that signaling is mostly mediated by active TGFB3, which was not measured (validated ELISA kits to specifically detect mouse TGFB3 in tissue lysates are currently not available). During embryonic development, <italic>Tgfb2</italic> and <italic>Tgfb3</italic> are expressed in tendons and allelic deletion of these ligands results in increasing loss of tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pryce et al., 2009</xref>); in the context of injury, <italic>Tgfb3</italic> is expressed during regenerative fetal tendon healing in sheep while TGFB1 is associated with fibrotic adult tendon healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beredjiklian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Although this supports the notion that TGFβs 2 and 3 are pro-tenogenic relative to TGFB1, it is unclear whether the individual ligands actually can activate distinct healing or tenogenic responses. Additional research must therefore be carried out to elucidate their activities.</p><p>Although adult tendon healing was not determined in this study, it is well established that TGFβ signaling is elevated after adult injury and results in fibrotic scar formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leask and Abraham, 2004</xref>). Inhibition of TGFβ signaling, either with neutralizing antibodies or via <italic>Smad3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> deletion attenuates fibrosis but fails to regenerate tendon structure or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katzel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). We previously showed that adult tenocytes are largely quiescent after full transection injury with minimal cell proliferation or recruitment. The distinctive response of neonatal vs adult tenocytes to TGFβ may reflect differences in intrinsic potential (for example adult tenocytes are post-mitotic) or the activation of other signaling pathways that may interact with or modify TGFβ signaling. In addition to Smad signaling, TGFβs can also activate a number of non-Smad pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang, 2017</xref>); there may be differences in downstream signaling between neonatal and adult tenocytes. Using an in vitro engineered tendon model, we previously showed that the tenogenic outcomes of TGFβ signaling did not depend on <italic>Smad4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chien et al., 2018</xref>). Whether this finding is applicable in the context of in vivo injury remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tg(Scx-GFP)1Stzr <break/>(ScxGFP)</td><td valign="top">Ronen Schweitzer <break/>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pryce et al., 2007</xref>)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3717419">MGI:3717419</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Scx-CreERT2</td><td valign="top">Ronen Schweitzer</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/allele/key/827618">Tg(Acta2-cre/ERT2)1Ikal</ext-link>(Acta2-CreERT2)</td><td valign="top">Ivo Kalajzic <break/>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grcevic et al., 2012</xref>)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5461154">MGI:5461154</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</sup> <break/>(ROSA-Ai14)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Labs <break/>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>)</td><td valign="top">Stock: 007908 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3809524">MGI:3809524</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tgfbr2<sup>tm1.1Hlm</sup> <break/>(Tgfbr2<sup>f/f</sup>)</td><td valign="top">Harold Moses <break/>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chytil et al., 2002</xref>)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:2384512">MGI:2384512</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">SB-431542</td><td valign="top">Stemgent</td><td valign="top">Cat. #

response. The paper represents a novel addition to existing literature on tendon biology. It delineates the molecular basis for neonatal tendon regeneration, And particularly highlights the role of TGFβ signaling. Through a combination of targeted gene deletion, small molecule inhibition, and lineage tracing, the publication identifies TGFβ-dependent and -independent cellular mechanisms involved in tendon regeneration.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;TGFβ signaling is required for tenocyte recruitment and functional neonatal tendon regeneration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Reviewing Editor and Clifford Rosen as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mei Wan (Reviewer #1); Alayna E Loiselle (Reviewer #2); Nathanial Dyment (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The studies potentially reveal a new molecular pathway that regulates neonatal tendon regeneration.

It would also be a nicer parallel to the in vivo studies to do the scratch assay with the Tgfbr2 cKO cells.</p><p>10) It is recommended not to call aSMA+ cells in this paper only myofibroblasts. Some of them are likely myofibroblasts but not all. Even though aSMA is a marker of a myofibroblast, all mesenchymal cells that express aSMA are not myofibroblasts. aSMA is expressed during expansion of progenitor cell populations that contribute to tissue healing. These cells go on to differentiate into ScxGFP+ cells, osteocytes, fibrocartilage, and odontoblasts. Myofibroblasts, on the other hand, are a more mature cell type. The key defining features of myofibroblasts are the de novo development of in vivo stress fibers and contractile forces. Stress fibers containing aSMA produce higher contractile forces, which is why myofibroblasts express aSMA. The fact that aSMA expression was not inhibited at this early stage by SB-431542, despite TGFb being a potent inducer of myofibroblasts (as stated in the third paragraph of the Discussion), also indicates that these cells may not be myofibroblasts.</p><p>11) It is suggested that the authors add uninjured limbs to the main figure instead of in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.

We chose our dosing regimen based on this prior literature and used 10 mg/kg daily IP injections as the most commonly used, highest dose, and therefore most likely to be effective. To determine the effect of the drug on TGFβ signaling, we carried out western blotting for pSmad2/3 with carrier and SB-431542 treatment. We were surprised not to see a difference between injured tendons (carrier vs. inhibitor), however there was a significance increase in uninjured control tendons with inhibition. This suggested that the systemic level of pSmad2/3 is generally higher in those mice and we therefore normalized to the contralateral control. Once normalized, there was a ~67% reduction in pSmad2/3 with SB-431542 treatment (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p>This difference in pSmad2/3 in control tendons could indicate a potential feedback mechanism with SB-431542 inhibition or potential compensation by other TGFβ superfamily molecules. We also tested whether this result was specific to pSmad2/3 by assaying phospho-p38 protein (a non-Smad mediator of TGFβ signaling) and found no difference with injury or with inhibitor treatment, either normalized or un-normalized. This is expected as SB-431542 should not affect ERK or p38 signaling, based on in vitro studies (see (Inman et al., 2002). There is also a question of whether we chose the right time (2 hours after last injection) to harvest the tendons. There is evidence that TGFβ signaling is cyclic (Zi et al., 2012); the compound may therefore only inhibit at certain durations per day. Although our pSmad2/3 results were somewhat unexpected, we do see a relative inhibition with SB-431542 and many of our results (the functional assays, recruitment, total cells) point to an effect of the inhibitor on healing. Materials and methods, Results subsection “TGFβ signaling is required for functional regeneration”, and Discussion have been updated with a new Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Genetic deletion</p><p>The original Tgfbr2<sup>Scx</sup> samples were extremely hard to come by. We lost many litters (representing perhaps ~200 mice) after tamoxifen treatment and the samples included here were the few that survived. Outcrossing the line did not help (we tried twice) and after years of attempted experiments, we eliminated the line in early 2019, prior to the initial submission of this manuscript. While we were therefore not able to generate new mice for experiments, we examined remaining cryosections and tried immunostaining for pSmad2/3 (did not work) and immunostaining for TGFBR2. We now include the TGFBR2 results showing reduced immunostaining of TGFBR2 in Tgfbr2<sup>Scx</sup> mutants with tamoxifen treatment (new Figure 3—figure supplement 2, subsection “TGFβ signaling in neonatal tenocytes is required for cell recruitment after injury”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The specificity of labeling in reporter ScxCreERT2/RosaT mice needs further validation, particularly in relation to possible leakiness in the absence of tamoxifen.</p></disp-quote><p>Analysis of ScxCreERT2/RosaT/ScxGFP mice at 1 year of age without any tamoxifen injections showed no presence of RosaT+ cells suggesting that there is no leakiness.

To truly address this, we would likely need to lineage trace both Scx<sup>lin</sup> and aSMA<sup>lin</sup> cells within the same mouse, which is currently impossible since these are both CreERT2 lines. However, if all ScxGFP cells are from the aSMA<sup>lin</sup>, this would point to the epitenon/paratenon as a likely second source of cells. To test this, we generated aSMACreERT2/RosaT/ScxGFP pups with P2, P3 tamoxifen labeling and P5 injury, with and without injection of SB-431542 (n=2/group although 1 mouse ended up ScxGFP-negative in the untreated group and was not useful). All pups at d14 showed recruitment of RosaT+ cells into the gap space, regardless of SB-431542 treatment. This is consistent with our aSMA immunostaining showing that aSMA cells were not affected by SB-431542 treatment at d3. We found aSMA<sup>lin</sup> cells comprised a majority of non-ScxGFP cells and a proportion (but not all) of ScxGFP+ cells (new Figure 8—figure supplement 3). Since aSMA labels some of the original tenocytes (Figure 8—figure supplement 2) we still cannot completely exclude the possibility that aSMA<sup>lin</sup>+/ScxGFP+ cells are also Scx<sup>lin</sup>.

Although it was long thought that TGFβ cannot signal without release from the latent complex, an interesting paper in Cell recently showed that latent TGFβ may also be able to signal by binding through the integrin αvβ8 (Campbell et al., 2020). It is also possible that most of the signaling is mediated by TGFβ3, which we were not able to assay since the mouse TGFβ2 and TGFβ3 ELISA kits are either not commercially available or not validated for tissue lysates (as discussed with the manufacturer for the TGFβ3 kit). We do identify increases in pSmad2/3 signaling however, which indicates active signaling with injury.

However, EdU staining did show some degree of proliferation occurred despite serum-starving. Therefore, we now include the requested experiment repeating the scratch assay and quantifying proliferation to determine whether proliferation and migration were in any way coupled.

While it would also be helpful to have TGFβ1 ELISA data from the inhibitor treated cohort at d3 to support these data, we were not able to generate additional mice at this time. In addition, since the increase is specific to a localized region of the tendon, it is not clear the difference would be detectable since whole tendon lysates are combined and used for ELISA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors have previously shown insufficient tenocyte recruitment in adult healing, but appropriate recruitment in neonates- is this a function of size/distance since multiple other models show bridging tissue or is this an AT specific finding?</p></disp-quote><p>We measured the gap space normalized to the original geometry of the contralateral tendon and found there is no difference in relative gap space between neonates and adults (indeed, relative gap space normalized to length may be slightly larger in neonates). Since the current study does not include adult injury, we only show these data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>. We posit that the transection injury without repair creates a critical size defect in adults and adult tenocytes are not able to bridge this gap while neonatal tenocytes are able. Elegant studies from Dr. Loiselle’s lab observed successful bridging of adult tenocytes of flexor tendons when tendon ends are sutured, suggesting there may be a gap distance threshold for adult tenocyte recruitment. Note that although the adult gap space is not occupied by Scx<sup>lin</sup> tenocytes, there IS bridging fibrovascular scar tissue that is highly aSMA+ at d14. There may also be tendon-specific differences as suggested by reviewers, since work from Dr. Dyment previously showed that the patellar tendon defect is bridged by paratenon cells without significant activity of the intrinsic tenocytes (in this model however, full transection was not carried out). Single cell RNASeq data from Dr. Chris Mendias’s group also show significant transcriptional differences between specific mouse tendons; these differences may result in different healing responses. Since this manuscript does not include any data from adult injury, we do not include extensive discussion of these points related to adult tendon injury models, but hopefully this response addresses reviewers’ questions.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51779-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3D: what do the authors attribute the massive variation in the # of TdTomato+ cell recruitment in inhibitor treated animals to?

We therefore believe this is simply due to natural biological variation in the healing process.

Interestingly, we find that total DAPI cells is decreased with SB-431542 treatment and Scx<sup>lin</sup> cell recruitment is no longer different once normalized. However, no difference in total DAPI was observed in TBR2 group vs. WT and normalized Scx<sup>lin</sup> recruitment is still different. This suggests to us that in the Tgfbr2 mutants, there is compensatory recruitment of non-Scx<sup>lin</sup> cells when Scx<sup>lin</sup> cells are not recruited.
