spinal cord, microglia are crucial for the phagocytosis of infectious agents, apoptotic cells and synapses. During brain injury or infection, bone-marrow derived macrophages invade neural tissue, making it difficult to distinguish between invading macrophages and resident microglia. In addition to circulation-derived monocytes, other non-microglial central nervous system (CNS) macrophage subtypes include border-associated meningeal, perivascular and choroid plexus macrophages. Using immunofluorescent labeling, flow cytometry and Cre-dependent ribosomal immunoprecipitations, we describe <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic>, a new tool for the genetic targeting of microglia. We use this new tool to track microglia during embryonic development and in the context of ischemic injury and neuroinflammation. Because of the specificity and robustness of microglial recombination with <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic>, we believe that this new mouse line will be particularly useful for future studies of microglial function in development and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>fate mapping</kwd><kwd>ribosomal profiling</kwd><kwd>neuroinflammation</kwd><kwd>stroke</kwd><kwd>multiple sclerosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08NS96192</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arnold</surname><given-names>Thomas D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20POST35120371</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santander</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>P2ry12-CreER robustly and specifically labels microglia in fate-mapping and ribosomal profiling experiments, revealing new markers for myeloid subpopulations in the central nervous system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CNS macrophages can be broadly separated into three types: microglia, choroid plexus macrophages, and border-associated macrophages (BAMs) of the dura, subdura/pia and the perivascular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wolburg and Paulus, 2010</xref>). Circulatory monocytes, which invade the CNS and differentiate into macrophages, are also present in the context of CNS injury and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shechter et al., 2009</xref>). These different types of macrophages play fundamental roles in CNS development, homeostasis and disease, but their specific functions remain poorly defined. An important barrier to defining the subtype-specific functions of CNS macrophages has been a lack of genetic tools to specifically target these subpopulations, although there has been some progress in this regard in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chappell-Maor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Werner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wieghofer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Microglia, the resident macrophages of the neural parenchyma, regulate a wide variety of processes in the brain, from development and synapse remodeling, to inflammatory insult and antigen presentation. Fate-mapping and developmental analyses have revealed that microglia are derived from the embryonic yolk sac, unlike circulating monocytes, which are derived from the adult bone marrow. Although bone marrow derived macrophages can adopt some features of endogenous microglia, they are not able to fully recapitulate all of their properties, suggesting that there may be important functional differences between these two populations of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett et al., 2018</xref>). The use of single-cell transcriptomic profiling has revealed new insights about microglial biology in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hammond et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">JordÃ£o et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Van Hove et al., 2019</xref>) suggesting a greater degree of heterogeneity among microglia than previously recognized. Recently developed microglial genetic labeling strategies, such as the mouse line <italic>Cx3cr1-CreER</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parkhurst et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yona et al., 2013</xref>), have significant advantages compared to their predecessors, but still have a number of drawbacks. For instance, <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> is expressed in other immune cell types in the brain, including perivascular, choroid plexus and meningeal macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldmann et al., 2016</xref>). Acute tamoxifen administration in <italic>Cx3cr1-CreER</italic> mice also labels circulating monocytes, which can infiltrate the CNS in the context of injury or disease, thus complicating interpretation. This can be circumvented by administering tamoxifen and then waiting for recombined circulating monocytes to be replaced by non-recombined monocytes from the bone marrow (~15â30 days), so that only resident macrophages (e.g. BAMs and microglia) are recombined. Finally, <italic>Cx3cr1-EGFP, -Cre and -CreER</italic> mouse lines are haploinsufficient for <italic>Cx3cr1,</italic> as they were designed such that the <italic>EGFP</italic>, <italic>Cre</italic> or <italic>CreER</italic> coding regions replace the endogenous <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> coding region. There is evidence that <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> haploinsufficiency affects microglial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hickman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rogers et al., 2011</xref>), so these lines should be used with this caveat in mind.</p><p>Here, we describe a <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> knock-in mouse line that we have developed to specifically label microglia. P2RY12 is a nucleotide sensing metabotropic GPCR in the P2Y family of GPCRs that has an important role in the microglial âsensomeâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hickman et al., 2013</xref>). P2RY12 has been shown to regulate the morphological changes that microglia display in response to tissue damage or inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haynes et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we found that <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic>, unlike the commonly used <italic>Cx3cr1-CreER</italic>, specifically labeled brain microglia and a subset of dural and choroid plexus macrophages, but not pial-associated or perivascular macrophages. During embryonic development, <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> recombination was robust in microglia, although we also observed recombination in a small subset of meningeal and perivascular macrophages, which we suggest may reflect cells that are in a âtransitionâ state. Using <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> with a conditionally expressed <italic>Rpl22-HA</italic> allele, we performed Cre-dependent ribosomal immunoprecipitations and transcriptional profiling of adult microglia. By comparing this dataset to existing ribosomal profiles of CNS macrophages and subtracting genes that are shared by both datasets, we identify a number of border-associated macrophage markers, including <italic>Pf4</italic>. Analysis of the <italic>Pf4-Cre</italic> mouse line shows that <italic>Pf4-Cre</italic> recombination robustly labels BAMs and not microglia. Finally, we show that <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> can be used to label microglia in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced ischemic stroke, as well as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a P2ry12-CreER mouse line</title><p>To identify specific markers of brain microglia, we cross-referenced published reports of microglial markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buttgereit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gautier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wieghofer et al., 2015</xref>) with recently produced single cell sequencing data sets (Tabula Muris: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tabula-muris.ds.czbiohub.org">https://tabula-muris.ds.czbiohub.org</ext-link>, Myeloid Cell Single Cell Seq database: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://myeloidsc.appspot.com">https://myeloidsc.appspot.com</ext-link>).

We show that <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> robustly and specifically recombines microglia using flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and ribosomal profiling. We did, however, find recombination in a subset of dural and choroid plexus macrophages. We believe that these recombined cells in the choroid plexus are likely to be Kolmerâs epiplexus cells, which express significant levels of <italic>P2ry12</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Van Hove et al., 2019</xref>). Whether the gene expression similarities between CNS microglia and Kolmerâs epiplexus cells have any developmental basis or functional significance will be an interesting topic for future research. In the blood, we did not see any significant recombination of monocytes or platelets. In most organs of adult mice, there was little to no recombination, although in the spleen we did see significant levels of recombination in marginal zone macrophages. In embryos, we found that <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> robustly labels microglia, as well as a small fraction of meningeal and perivascular macrophages. We did not see recombination in any non-macrophage cell types in the embryonic brain. In addition, we did not observe recombination in the embryonic heart and liver, and found it only in a small fraction of lung and intestinal macrophages. Altogether, our data suggest that <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> is robust in embryonic and adult microglia, while recombination in non-CNS organs and border-associated macrophages is limited or not detected.</p><p>Of note, while we observed limited <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> recombination in CD206+ and LYVE1+ macrophages of the embryonic meninges, we saw significantly more recombination in CD206+ macrophages of the hippocampus. Interestingly, CD206+; TdTomato+ cells were most highly concentrated at the junction between the hippocampus and the overlying meninges. Continuous with the hippocampus, CD206+; TdTomato+ cells formed a âstreamâ through the cortical SVZ, suggestive of preferential localization, or possibly migration. Possibilities for what these cells represent could fit a few different models: 1) âtransitionaryâ macrophages that express <italic>P2ry12</italic> while in border areas, which downregulate BAM genes as they enter the brain parenchyma; 2) developmental expression (or possibly continual expression, in the case of <italic>P2ry12-CreER; Rosa26<sup>Ai14</sup></italic> recombined dural macrophages) of <italic>P2ry12</italic> in a subset of BAMs; or 3) expression of <italic>P2ry12</italic> in cells that are transitioning from microglial to BAM identity. The turnover and exchange of BAMs and microglia into and out of their specific niches, and the gene expression programs that these cells adopt, could in theory be quite dynamic. Related to these observations, a recent study found that CD206+ and CD206- macrophages of the CNS derive from distinct yolk sac progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Utz et al., 2020</xref>).

However, <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>-based mouse lines mark BAM macrophages in addition to microglia. <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> is also expressed in circulating T cells, B cells, NK cells and monocytes, which means that in the context of injury, <italic>Cx3CR1-Cre, CreER</italic> and <italic>EGFP</italic> are incapable of distinguishing between resident macrophages and other invading immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bar-On et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fogg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Imai et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2009</xref>).

One major drawback to strategies that rely on the physical dissection of these populations is that this process results in significant levels of cross contamination from microglia and other cells that that are in close contact with the meningeal layers. Furthermore, physical dissection of the meningeal layers does not separate perivascular macrophages of the penetrating vessels from the parenchymal microglia. In contrast, <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> recombination provides a more precise and complete genetic segregation of these populations that minimizes the transcriptional changes that are known to occur during sorting. The differential enrichment observed in our subtractive approach revealed several transcripts only expressed in BAMs. We focused on one such gene, <italic>Pf4</italic>, and found that <italic>Pf4-Cre</italic> robustly and preferentially recombines these cells.</p><p>The <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> mouse line is also particularly well suited for the labeling and tracking of microglia during CNS injury. One major barrier to studying microglia in the context of injury is that microglia undergo significant transcriptional changes in response to injury and/or inflammation, making it difficult to distinguish these microglia from other macrophage subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haimon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">JordÃ£o et al., 2019</xref>).

Recombination was induced by three doses of tamoxifen dissolved in corn oil, administered by oral gavage every other day (150 ÂµL of 20 mg/mL). For embryonic mouse inductions, pregnant dams were given tamoxifen (150 ÂµL of 20 mg/mL) on E13.5, E15.5 and E17.5, for a total of three gavage injections. All mouse work was performed in accordance with UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols. Mice had food and water ad libitum.

To isolate single cells, brains were cut into small pieces and passed through a 40 Âµm filter. Single cell suspensions were prepared and centrifuged over a 30%/70% discontinuous Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare) and mononuclear cells were isolated from the interface. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACS Aria III using the FACSDiva 8.0 software (BD Biosciences) and was analyzed using FlowJo v10.6.1. TdTomato+ cells were analyzed for CD45 and CD11b expression following initial gatings for forward scatter, singlets and live cells. Blood smears and flow cytometry were performed on adult mice following three tamoxifen inductions as described above. Blood was collected from the facial vein and smears were imaged for EGFP and TdTomato expression. Prior to immunostaining, blood samples used for flow cytometry were depleted of erythrocytes using an ammonium chloride lysis buffer (.15M NH4Cl, 10 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM EDTA) wash.

Tissue lysates were centrifuged at 10k-rcf for 10 min at four degrees to obtain a supernatant ribosomal fraction. An 80 ÂµL input sample was taken at this point to serve as a comparison to immunoprecipitated samples. Rabbit monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Cell Signaling C29F4, 2.5 ÂµL per mL) was added to the supernatant and incubated for 4 hr at four degrees. Iron-linked Protein A beads were added to the ribosomal fraction/antibody mixture (40 ÂµL per mL) and incubated for an additional 4 hr before being magnetically precipitated. Immunoprecipitate/beads were washed with a high salt buffer (0.3M KCL, 1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 0.012M MgCL2, cyclohexamide, 0.5 mM DTT) three times and then eluted with 350 ÂµL of buffer RLT (Qiagen RNeasy kit).

The right internal carotid artery (ICA) was dissected and a temporary ligature was tied using a strand of 6â0 suture at its origin. This ligature was retracted laterally and posteriorly to prevent retrograde blood flow. A second suture strand was looped around the ICA above the pterygopalatine artery and an arteriotomy was made proximal to the isolated ICA. A silicone coated 6â0 nylon filament from Doccol Corporation (Sharon, MA, USA) was inserted 5 mm to occlude the MCA and the second suture strand was tied off to secure the filament for the duration of occlusion. Following recovery from anesthesia, mice were returned to their cage for the 90 min duration of the occlusion. Injury was confirmed by severe left frontal/hindlimb paresis resulting in circling movements during the occlusion period. For reperfusion, each animal was anesthetized and all suture ties and the occluding filament were removed. Avitene Microfibrillar Collagen Hemostat (Warwick, RI, USA) was placed over the arteriotomy and the skin incision was closed.

This manuscript provides an interesting new tool, the <italic>P2RY12-CreER</italic> mice to specifically label and target microglia and not other brain macrophages (meninges, choroid plexus, perivascular space). Once validated, this resource would be widely used in the field and the authors plan to make this new line available at Jackson Labs. All reviewers were enthusiastic about this new resource and mouse tool for the field. Although the data shown look promising, a more thorough validation and characterization of this new mouse line is needed. In particular, the authors must put a strong effort into actually quantifying the percentage of cells labeled/targeted in each experiment, instead of using terms such as &quot;widespread or sparse labeling&quot;. There were also missing pieces of information on methodology used and references that should be addressed before publication. We list the concerns below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Given the leakiness of some <italic>CreER</italic> strains in combination with certain reporter lines (see Van Hove et al., 2019 and Chappell-Maor et al., 2019), it is critical to analyze the recombination of microglia in <italic>P2ry12-CreER Ai14</italic> mice also without tamoxifen treatment.</p><p>2) More rigorous quantification and assessment of recombination in BAMs.</p><p>Perivascular macrophages can be interrogated in brain sections by IHC, but to achieve a complete assessment of the meningeal BAMs, the meninges need to be removed from inside of the skull. Only the pia layer of the meninges stays adhered to the brain when the skull is removed. LYVE1 is also not an appropriate marker for labeling of BAMs as it only labels a subset. Importantly, dounce homogenization followed by percoll purification is not an appropriate method for isolating BAMs and the expression of TdTomato in other cells than microglia can therefore not be quantified correctly using these approaches.</p><p>3) Effect on P2RY12 protein expression and function.</p><p>Figure 1A: The authors use single examples of immunostaining against P2RY12 to demonstrate that the <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> mouse has normal P2RY12 protein expression. However, this claim should be supported by quantification, and immunohistochemistry is not a sensitive method for measuring protein levels. It will be critical to validate that the P2RY12 protein expression in the <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> mice is similar to WT mice with and without tamoxifen treatment. This is straightforward as there are antibodies against P2RY12 commercially available for flow cytometry. Additionally, the P2RY12-dependent motility of microglial processes in the <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> mouse should be assessed. Over the last decade, evoking laser-induced injuries has become a standard paradigm in many labs that are studying microglia.</p><p>4) Effect on P2ry12 transcription.</p><p>Based on the (n=1) ribosomal immunoprecipitations, the <italic>p2ry12</italic> transcriptions might appear to be normal and based on this one example. It would be helpful if the authors could quantify P2ry12 transcript levels using qRT-PCR to confirm that the presence of the <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> allele does not impact expression of the gene.</p><p>5) Reproducibility of Ribosomal immunoprecipitations experiment.</p><p>This experiment is elegant and support the conclusion that <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> is selective to microglia. However, is this (n=1) experiment reproducible? Please repeat for a minimum of 3 replicate experiments. It would be very powerful to also perform ribosomal immunoprecipitation on the meninges.</p><p>6) In Figure 1B, CD11b and CD45 does not suffice to detect non-parenchymal macrophages by flow cytometry. CD11bhi cells also comprise monocytes, neutrophils, some cDCs and conversely, some borderzone macrophages are CD45low. More markers should be included to identify borderzone macrophages.</p><p>7) In Figure 1C, what is the percentage of microglia, borderzone macrophages and monocytes that are TdTomato+ in <italic>P2ry12-CreERAi14</italic> mice by flow cytometry?</p><p>8) In Figure 1E-G, the images suggest that <italic>P2ry12-CreER;Ai14</italic> recombination does not occur in perivascular or meningeal macrophages, nor in non-macrophage cells in the brain, but can be detected in choroid plexus macrophages. These conclusions should be supported by quantification, either of immunohistochemistry images, or of FACS data. In Figure 1G, what are the TdTomato+ cells in <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic>; <italic>Ai14</italic> mice (Iba1-) in the choroid plexus?</p><p>9) In Figure 2, the authors describe recombination in <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic>; <italic>Ai14</italic> embryos in microglia, in choroid plexus macrophages and also in some meningeal macrophages. Are perivascular macrophages also labeled? Also here, the images should be quantified. Are macrophages in other embryonic tissues also TdTomato+ or just brain macrophages? It seems that this <italic>CreER</italic> strain is not microglia-specific during embryogenesis. This should be discussed in more detail. They should discuss their model also in the context of other previously described models to target microglia (for example Kaiser et al., 2019).</p><p>10) Analyses and quantification of recombination in other organs.</p><p>In Figure 3, what is the percentage of the macrophages positive for TdTomato in the different organs? This should be quantified (FACS or immunohistochemistry). Where are they located (associated to vessels, peripheral nerves)? The authors state that recombination in tissue-resident macrophages in peripheral organs is âlimitedâ even though they provide images of TdTomato expression in both the spleen, lung, heart, thymus, intestine, and liver. Some level of quantification should be provided to support that this expression is âlimitedâ and negligible. The recombination in the brains of these mice (n = 3 or higher) should also be measured as a positive control to demonstrate high recombination efficiency.</p><p>11) In Figure 3A, there seems to be TdTomato expression in neurons. Can the authors comment on this or provide higher magnification images to exclude co-expression?</p><p>12) In Figure 3C, it is not clear why the cells are yellow as there is no GFP.</p><p>13) Some microglia signature genes including P2ry12 are downregulated upon microglia activation and in disease. Can this strain be utilized to target activated microglia?</p><p>14) P2ry12 is also highly expressed by platelets. Do the authors find evidence that megakaryocytes are targeted with the <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic>;<italic>Ai14</italic> mice?</p><p>15) They show that with Pf4-Cre mice borderzone macrophages can be targeted. This needs better characterization and should be quantified. Are monocytes, tissue macrophages in other organs, or any other cells also labeled?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for re-submitting your article &quot;A New Genetic Strategy for Targeting Microglia in Development and Disease&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been re-reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Isaac M Chiu as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Amanda Sierra (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study has developed <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> mice to genetically mark and target microglia, which are resident immune cells of the CNS. The authors were able to use these mice to distinguish microglia from border associated macrophages, and to track microglia during development and following injury and inflammation. This could be a broadly useful tool for the neuroscience field to study microglial biology and function.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>All the reviewers agree that the authors have done a good job addressing the points raised. Major concerns regarding the need for proper cell quantification have been met. Nomenclature issues have been addressed. The Discussion now properly takes into account the comparison with other mouse lines available.</p><p>There is only one comment that should be addressed:</p><p>Regarding point 13) in their response letter:</p><p>They clearly demonstrate that microglia are efficiently (irreversibly) labeled with their strain, and hence previously labeled microglia will remain labeled also in disease models. My earlier question was whether microglia can be labeled/manipulated in an inducible manner once they are reactive i.e. during the course of an inflammatory disease. Given that P2ry12 is downregulated in reactive microglia, the question remains whether levels of Cre are nonetheless sufficient to allow targeting of microglia in inflammation in <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> mice. (For example, tamoxifen injection in EAE-diseased animals at peak disease). If they don't have this data, it should at least be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54590.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Given the leakiness of some CreER strains in combination with certain reporter lines (see Van Hove et al., 2019 and Chappell-Maor et al., 2019), it is critical to analyze the recombination of microglia in P2ry12-CreER Ai14 mice also without tamoxifen treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We performed these experiments and found that there is very low (but not zero) recombination in the absence of tamoxifen using the Ai14 reporter line. We observed a non-tamoxifen recombination rate of 0.38%, or about 1 in every 263 microglia (see Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D). Given the sensitivity of the Ai14 reporter allele (Alvarez-Aznar et al., 2020), we believe that this recombination frequency is likely to be lower for other floxed alleles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) More rigorous quantification and assessment of recombination in BAMs.</p><p>Perivascular macrophages can be interrogated in brain sections by IHC, but to achieve a complete assessment of the meningeal BAMs, the meninges need to be removed from inside of the skull. Only the pia layer of the meninges stays adhered to the brain when the skull is removed. LYVE1 is also not an appropriate marker for labeling of BAMs as it only labels a subset. Importantly, dounce homogenization followed by percoll purification is not an appropriate method for isolating BAMs and the expression of TdTomato in other cells than microglia can therefore not be quantified correctly using these approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much appreciate these suggestions. We have removed flow cytometry data of macrophages other than microglia (CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>int</sup> cells). Regarding recombination in BAMs, we have generated new pia mater and dura mater whole-mount data from <italic>P2ry12-CreER; Ai14</italic> mice. Labeling these preparations (and thin coronal sections to visualize perivascular macrophages) for two different BAM markers, LYVE1 and CD206, we found that <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> does not recombine perivascular or subdural BAMs, but does recombine a subset of CD206+ BAMs in the dura, some of which were also LYVE1+ (Figure 2, Figure 2âfigure supplement 2). Our results are consistent with single cell sequencing (Van Hove et al., 2019) which showed low (but not zero) expression of <italic>P2ry12</italic> in meningeal BAMs compared to microglia and CPepi cells (see point 8, below), and with our RiboTrap data which show minimal enrichment of BAM transcripts in immunoprecipitations from <italic>P2ry12-CreER; Rpl22-HA</italic> mice. Importantly, the dura was not separately analyzed in our RiboTrap preparations which would explain why we donât see enrichment for dural BAM markers in these experiments despite seeing recombination of some dural BAMs in our whole-mount preparations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Effect on P2RY12 protein expression and function.</p><p>Figure 1A: The authors use single examples of immunostaining against PR2Y12 to demonstrate that the P2ry12-CreER mouse has normal P2RY12 protein expression. However, this claim should be supported by quantification, and immunohistochemistry is not a sensitive method for measuring protein levels. It will be critical to validate that the P2RY12 protein expression in the P2ry12-CreER mice is similar to WT mice with and without tamoxifen treatment. This is straightforward as there are antibodies against P2RY12 commercially available for flow cytometry.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We performed quantitative PCR for <italic>P2ry12</italic> from brains of wild type, heterozygous and homozygous <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> mice. We did find a reduction of <italic>P2ry12</italic> mRNA expression in homozygous knock-in mice (please see Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A). To test whether this RNA reduction resulted in a reduction in translated protein, we analyzed P2RY12 protein levels in wild-type and homozygous mutant mice, with or without tamoxifen (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B-C). Here, we saw no significant change in P2RY12 protein level in the homozygote mouse, with or without tamoxifen treatment. From this analysis, we conclude that although there is a reduction in <italic>P2ry12</italic> mRNA expression in homozygous knock-in mice, this does not result in a significant change in P2RY12 protein levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the P2RY12-dependent motility of microglial processes in the P2ry12-CreER mouse should be assessed. Over the last decade, evoking laser-induced injuries has become a standard paradigm in many labs that are studying microglia.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion. Because P2RY12 protein expression is not affected by gene targeting (see above), we believe P2RY12-dependant processes motility is unlikely to be affected in <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> mice. However, we did not test process motility directly. While important, we believe that the suggested experiments are beyond the immediate scope of this manuscript â establishing laser-induced injury and live 2-photon microscopy protocols will take several months and require new animal (IACUC) approval.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Effect on P2ry12 transcription.</p><p>Based on the (n=1) ribosomal immunoprecipitations, the p2ry12 transcriptions might appear to be normal and based on this one example; It would be helpful if the authors could quantify P2ry12 transcript levels using qRT-PCR to confirm that the presence of the P2ry12-CreER allele does not impact expression of the gene.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion around our ribosome immunoprecipitation protocol. We in fact performed 3 separate immunoprecipitations, each from individual recombined <italic>P2ry12-CreER;Rpl22-HA</italic> mice (3 IPs total, one mouse brain per IP). Three separate libraries were generated from these immunoprecipitations, which were then sequenced along with libraries derived from 3 input controls from the three separate brain lysates prior to immunoprecipitation.</p><p>To more quantitatively measure <italic>P2ry12</italic> transcript levels, we performed qPCR analysis as suggested. We observed a reduction in <italic>P2ry12</italic> mRNA in homozygous knock-in mice compared to controls, but no significant difference in P2RY12 protein expression between these same groups (please see Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A and response to point #3 above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Reproducibility of Ribosomal immunoprecipitations experiment.</p><p>This experiment is elegant and support the conclusion that P2ry12-CreER is selective to microglia. However, is this (n=1) experiment reproducible? Please repeat for a minimum of 3 replicate experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion here. As described above (point 4), we in fact performed 3 separate immunoprecipitations, each from individual recombined <italic>P2ry12-CreER;Rpl22-HA</italic> mice (3 IPs total, one mouse brain per IP).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be very powerful to also perform ribosomal immunoprecipitation on the meninges.</p></disp-quote><p>We absolutely agree. As discussed above, we observed <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> recombination in LYVE1+ and CD206+ dural macrophages. We would like to transcriptionally profile these cells and compare to <italic>Pf4-Cre</italic> and <italic>Lyve1-Cre</italic> recombined dural, subdural and perivascular macrophages to begin to understand the heterogeneity and transcriptional programs of these BAMs. This will be a focus of future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 1B, CD11b and CD45 does not suffice to detect non-parenchymal macrophages by flow cytometry. CD11bhi cells also comprise monocytes, neutrophils, some cDCs and conversely, some borderzone macrophages are CD45low. More markers should be included to identify borderzone macrophages.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Our new whole-mount immunohistochemistry and labeling with CD206 and LYVE1 (Figure 2 and Figure 2âfigure supplement 2) clearly identifies distinct BAM populations (meningeal â dural/subdural; perivascular; choroid plexus) and shows that <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> preferentially targets microglia, and a subset of choroid plexus and dural BAMs, but not other BAM populations. This result is further supported by our ribosome IP sequencing data. We have removed our flow cytometry analysis of non-parenchymal macrophages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 1C, what is the percentage of microglia, borderzone macrophages and monocytes that are TdTomato+ in P2ry12-CreER Ai14 mice by flow cytometry?</p></disp-quote><p>By flow cytometry, the recombination percentage of microglia is 94.8% (Figure 1) and the recombination percentage of circulating monocytes is 0.0175% (Figure 4D). We have removed our flow cytometry analysis of percoll-purified BAMs, but histologically we do not see any recombination in perivascular or pial BAMs (see Figure 2 and Figure 2âfigure supplement 2). We do however see some <italic>P2ry12-CreER; Ai14</italic> recombination in dural and choroid plexus macrophages (see Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 1E-G, the images suggest that P2ry12-CreER; Ai14 recombination does not occur in perivascular or meningeal macrophages, nor in non-macrophage cells in the brain, but can be detected in choroid plexus macrophages. These conclusions should be supported by quantification, either of immunohistochemistry images, or of FACS data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this conclusion, and have added quantification of immunohistochemistry images (please see Figure 2) to provide further support.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1G, what are the TdTomato+ cells in P2ry12-CreER; Ai14 mice (Iba1-) in the choroid plexus?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question. We believe that these cells are CPepi (Kolmerâs epiplexus) cells. We have performed a deeper, more quantitative analysis of <italic>P2ry12-CreER; Ai14</italic> recombination in the adult choroid plexus and have found that all recombined cells are IBA1(+) (see Figure 2). Similar to <italic>Sall1-CreER</italic> (as presented in Van Hove et al., 2019), and in contrast to <italic>Cx3cr1-CreERT2</italic>, which recombines all IBA1+ macrophages in the choroid plexus (see Figure 4âfigure supplement 1), we found that <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> labeled a subset of IBA1+ CP macrophages on the apical surface of the CP. Van Hove et al. identified several transcripts enriched in putative CPepi-BAMs, including <italic>Clec7a</italic> (also enriched ribosomal IPs from <italic>P2ry12-CreER; Rpl22-HA</italic> mice) and <italic>P2ry12</italic>. Together, these data would suggest that <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> recombines CPepi BAMs. It is important to note that in Van Hove et al., 2019, <italic>Sall1-CreERT2</italic> appears to recombine many additional non-macrophage (IBA1-) cells in the wall of the lateral ventricle and choroid plexus stroma (small round cells), whereas <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> recombines only IBA1+ cells in the choroid plexus, speaking to the greater specificity of <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> recombination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In Figure 2, the authors describe recombination in P2ry12-CreER; Ai14 embryos in microglia, in choroid plexus macrophages and also in some meningeal macrophages. Are perivascular macrophages also labeled?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, in embryos we did see recombination in SMA-adjacent CD206+ macrophages. Please see Figure 3E and discussion below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also here, the images should be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have quantified the % recombination of embryonic meningeal and choroid plexus BAMS in embryos (see Figure 3). As the presence of SMA-coated arteries is very low at the time point we analyzed (E18.5), and the occurrence of CD206+ or LYVE1+ recombined cells is also very low (see Figure 3G), we were unable to quantify perivascular recombination in embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are macrophages in other embryonic tissues also TdTomato+ or just brain macrophages?</p></disp-quote><p>We observed no recombination in embryonic liver or heart. Recombination was low in the embryonic intestine (3.2% of CD206+ cells and 8.2% of IBA1+ cells) and lung (3.2% of CD206+ cells and 5.5% of IBA1+ cells)(see Figure 4âfigure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems that this CreER strain is not microglia-specific during embryogenesis. This should be discussed in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our immunostaining, there appears to be a population of cells recombined by <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> during embryogenesis that are outside of (but adjacent to) the brain parenchyma. These cells express BAM markers, such as LYVE1 and CD206, and are found in the meningeal space or around aSMA+ vessels (Figure 3D,H). We also see recombination in embryonic IBA1+ cells of the choroid plexus (Figure 3E). Within the brain parenchyma, there is a notable population of <italic>P2ry12-CreER;Ai14</italic> recombined cells that are also CD206+. These cells are most prominent at the junction of the developing dentate gyrus and the meninges overlying the hippocampus (Figure 3G). These CD206+ recombined cells are most concentrated at this position, but form a continuous âstreamâ through the embryonic subventricular zone (SVZ), although the fraction of CD206+ recombined cells diminishes with greater distance from the hippocampus. Hammond et al. recently described a population of Ms4a-expressing embryonic microglia which co-express both BAM (e.g. <italic>Mrc1</italic>, <italic>CD206</italic>) and microglia (e.g. <italic>P2ry12</italic>, <italic>Fcrls</italic>) transcripts. We speculate that these cells could be described by different models: (1) Embryonic LYVE1+ and CD206+ meningeal macrophages may express <italic>P2ry12</italic> while in border regions, and then die or downregulate BAM genes as they enter the brain parenchyma and become microglia. (2) Some small fraction of cells that will eventually become pial and perivascular macrophages may transiently express <italic>P2ry12</italic> during development and thus be recombined at this time point, (3) These cells may transiently express <italic>P2ry12</italic> while transitioning from microglia to dural BAM state/location, or (4) These cells may express <italic>P2ry12</italic> while in BAM regions and maintain <italic>P2ry12</italic> expression and positioning in these regions (dural BAMs and CPepi cells). The turnover and exchange of BAMs and microglia into and out of their specific niches, and the gene expression programs that these cells adopt, could in theory be quite dynamic. We discuss these findings and models in the Discussion. In the future, we plan to perform more detailed lineage tracing and ablation experiments (beyond the scope of this manuscript) to evaluate these different possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They should discuss their model also in the context of other previously described models to target microglia (for example Kaiser et al., 2019).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is important topic; we have created a separate Discussion section to more explicitly compare these various models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Analyses and quantification of recombination in other organs.</p><p>In Figure 3, What is the percentage of the macrophages positive for TdTomato in the different organs? This should be quantified (FACS or immunohistochemistry). Where are they located (associated to vessels, peripheral nerves)? The authors state that recombination in tissue-resident macrophages in peripheral organs is âlimitedâ even though they provide images of TdTomato expression in both the spleen, lung, heart, thymus, intestine, and liver. Some level of quantification should be provided to support that this expression is âlimitedâ and negligible. The recombination in the brains of these mice (n = 3 or higher) should also be measured as a positive control to demonstrate high recombination efficiency.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and have now added quantification of Cx3cr1-EGFP+ and CD206+ recombined cells in various organs from <italic>P2ry12-CreER;Ai14;Cx3cr1GFP</italic> mice. All of these mice had high levels of microglial recombination (over 90%), but recombination in CD206+ or Cx3CR1-EGFP+ cells was low (quantification in Figure 4C). The most significant recombination observed in non-neural tissue was in the marginal zone of the spleen (Figure 4B,C and lower magnification of spleen recombination in images Figure 4âfigure supplement 1).</p><p>SMA staining in the liver suggests that recombined cells are specifically not associated with SMA+ vessels, unlike <italic>Cx3CR1-EGFP</italic> expressing cells (see Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C). In the lung however, recombined cells were specifically associated with SMA-associated airways, or airway adjacent blood vessels (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D). We have not yet had the opportunity to examine whether <italic>P2ry12-CreER; Ai14</italic> recombination is associated with peripheral nerves in these organs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In Figure 3A, there seems to be TdTomato expression in neurons. Can the authors comment on this or provide higher magnification images to exclude co-expression?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. High magnification images with DAPI show that these are overlapping cells from thick optical sections, and not the same cell (please see new images in Figure 4). Also, please note that neuronal transcripts are specifically depleted in our ribosome IP RNA sequencing data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) In Figure 3C, it is not clear why the cells are yellow as there is no GFP.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. This was a problem with the processing of the image, and this did not reflect actual expression of EGFP. We have corrected the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Some microglia signature genes including P2ry12 are downregulated upon microglia activation and in disease. Can this strain be utilized to target activated microglia?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed! Using two different models of injury/inflammation (MCAO stroke and EAE), we have found that <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> mice can be used to label what we assume are resident microglia that are responding to injury (inside or near lesion; tdT+P2RY12-TMEM119-) or maintain homeostatic signature (away from lesion; tdT+P2RY12+TMEM119+). We have added these experiments to the manuscript as new Figures 7 and 8, for the MCAO and EAE data respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) P2ry12 is also highly expressed by platelets. Do the authors find evidence that megakaryocytes are targeted with the P2ry12-CreER;Ai14 mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Blood preparations from induced <italic>P2ry12-CreER;Ai14</italic> and <italic>Pf4-Cre;Ai14</italic> mice (well known to recombine platelets) were stained for platelet marker CD41. Although we saw robust labeling of platelets in <italic>PF4-Cre; Ai14</italic> mice, we saw no recombination of platelets in <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> mice (see Figure 4). We also found no enrichment for platelet markers in our ribosome sequencing experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) They show that with Pf4-Cre mice borderzone macrophages can be targeted. This needs better characterization and should be quantified. Are monocytes, tissue macrophages in other organs, or any other cells also labeled?</p></disp-quote><p>This mouse line has been well characterized for recombination in monocytes and organ macrophages outside of the CNS (Calaminus et al., 2012, Abram et al., 2014). We have now quantified recombination in BAMs using various markers and whole-mount preparations (Figure 6).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>All the reviewers agree that the authors have done a good job addressing the points raised. Major concerns regarding the need for proper cell quantification have been met. Nomenclature issues have been addressed. The Discussion now properly takes into account the comparison with other mouse lines available.</p><p>There is only one comment that should be addressed:</p><p>Regarding point 13) in their response letter:</p><p>They clearly demonstrate that microglia are efficiently (irreversibly) labeled with their strain, and hence previously labeled microglia will remain labeled also in disease models. My earlier question was whether microglia can be labeled/manipulated in an inducible manner once they are reactive i.e. during the course of an inflammatory disease. Given that P2ry12 is downregulated in reactive microglia, the question remains whether levels of Cre are nonetheless sufficient to allow targeting of microglia in inflammation in P2ry12-CreER mice. (For example, tamoxifen injection in EAE-diseased animals at peak disease). If they don't have this data, it should at least be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not addressing this question in our previous response letter. Whether microglia can be targeted during inflammation is an important question. We suspect that <italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> expression would be reduced in microglia responding to inflammation and that this would thus reduce the probability of tamoxifen-dependent recombination, but we have not yet tested this. We have added some discussion about this potential strategy in our Discussion section â<italic>P2ry12-CreER</italic> applicationsâ.</p></body></sub-article></article>
