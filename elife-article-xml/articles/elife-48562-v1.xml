at thousands of chromosomal sites known as origins. At each origin, the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1 co-assemble to load the Mcm2-7 replicative helicase onto chromatin. Current replication models envisage a linear arrangement of isolated origins functioning autonomously; the extent of inter-origin organization and communication is unknown. Here, we report that the replication initiation machinery of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> unexpectedly undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) upon binding DNA in vitro. We find that ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that drive LLPS and constitute a new class of phase separating elements. Initiator IDRs are shown to regulate multiple functions, including chromosome recruitment, initiator-specific co-assembly, and Mcm2-7 loading. These data help explain how CDK activity controls replication initiation and suggest that replication programs are subject to higher-order levels of inter-origin organization.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered</kwd><kwd>ORC</kwd><kwd>Cdc6</kwd><kwd>Cdt1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM116393</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>Matthew W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA030490</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Botchan</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>James M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>DNA replication initiation proteins contain a disordered domain that impacts each stage of their function, from chromatin recruitment and initiator co-assembly to the subsequent displacement of the factors from chromatin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The appropriate spatiotemporal regulation of DNA replication is essential to genetic integrity and cell proliferation. In eukaryotes, the initiation of DNA replication requires the coordinated action of three proteinaceous factors – the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1 – which co-assemble on DNA origins in the G1 phase of the cell cycle to catalyze loading of the Mcm2-7 replicative helicase onto chromatin. Once activated during the transition to S phase, Mcm2-7 helps promote origin melting, replisome assembly, and translocation of the replication fork.</p><p>ORC consists of a heterohexameric complex comprising the subunits Orc1-6. Five ORC subunits (Orc1-5), as well as Cdc6 and the six subunits of Mcm2-7, possess an ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities (AAA+) domain; Orc6 and Cdt1 are the only non-AAA+ proteins used for Mcm2-7 loading. Despite sharing a high overall degree of conservation across eukaryotes, certain aspects of initiator subunit sequence and function have nonetheless diversified during evolution. For example, <italic>S. pombe</italic> Orc4 contains a unique domain not found in other ORCs that endows the protein with a preference for A/T rich regions of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chuang and Kelly, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). Conversely, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ORC is able to recognize specific origin sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell and Stillman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 2018</xref>), whereas origin specification for metazoan ORCs appears more contextual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Remus et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Vashee et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Cdt1 additionally possesses a catalytically-inactive dioxygenase domain at its N-terminus that is necessary for yeast viability and Mcm2-7 loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Frigola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Takara and Bell, 2011</xref>); this fold is absent in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and metazoan Cdt1s.</p><p>Much of our current understanding of initiator mechanism derives from reconstitution studies using budding yeast initiation factors. These efforts have helped define an orchestrated set of ATP-dependent molecular exchanges between ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 that culminate in the loading of two copies of Mcm2-7 onto origin DNA in the form of a stable double-hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duzdevich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Remus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>). One aspect of initiation that has been difficult to probe in vitro, however, is the potential for interactions between initiation factors associated with different origins. Evidence for mesoscale coordination of origin activity derives from multiple sources. For example, genomic studies aimed at defining sites of ORC binding and their relation to replication origins have revealed evidence of origin clustering across chromosomes at nucleosome-free regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cayrou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Miotto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Vaughn et al., 1990</xref>). Cellular patterns of ORC localization are also strikingly non-uniform, often presenting as concentrated foci on chromatin whether it be in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Austin et al., 1999</xref>) or human cells in tissue culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lidonnici et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Shen et al., 2010</xref>). Outside of initiation, there exists a well-characterized phenomenon of origin interference that has been taken as evidence of inter-origin communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cayrou et al., 2011</xref>); the clustering of co-replicating regions into so-called Replication Factories or replication domains (RD) similarly has been observed in both fixed and live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cook, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Xiang et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, the replication timing profile of origins, which fire asynchronously throughout S-phase, partition to specific chromosome territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cremer and Cremer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gilbert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pope et al., 2014</xref>). It is currently unclear whether the clustering patterns observed for ORC binding sites, origin communication, and the timing of replication domains is coincidence or dependent upon an as-yet-discovered set of physiological properties of replication factors.</p><p>Present-day views of mesoscale organization within cells typically invoke processes such as protein gradients or membrane compartmentalization. Recently, a rapidly expanding body of work has begun to recognize protein/protein and protein/RNA liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) as playing critical functions in generating membraneless pseudo-organelles and co-localized bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boeynaems et al., 2018</xref>). Both nuclear and cytoplasmic liquid phase condensates (also known as biomolecular condensates) have been observed and implicated in a panoply of functions, including cellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Su et al., 2016</xref>), centrosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Woodruff et al., 2017</xref>), and chromatin/heterochromatin assembly and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Larson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Strom et al., 2017</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Maeshima et al., 2016</xref>). A functional role for biological condensates is only beginning to emerge; such entities may help sequester and/or co-localize certain factors to modulate biochemical output and response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>). Intrinsically disordered amino acid regions (IDRs) are often found in proteins that phase separate and can underpin multivalent interactions that help drive phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Many phase-separating IDRs are additionally enriched for certain amino acids and are hence referred to as low-complexity domains (LCD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hennig et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). Although multiple nuclear events are now being scrutinized through the lens of phase separation, how these processes integrate and communicate with other LLPS or dispersive-state pathways is currently unknown.</p><p>Here we report that the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> replication initiation factors ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 possess N-terminal IDRs that facilitate DNA-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that these initiator IDRs possess a high-complexity sequence signature that is preserved in metazoan homologs, but that is distinct from other condensate-promoting IDRs in other cellular pathways. Biochemical studies show that these IDRs drive the selective co-assembly and enrichment of <italic>Drosophila</italic> initiation factors into liquid phases in the presence of DNA, while simultaneously excluding non-partner proteins that also phase separate. Although <italic>Drosophila</italic> Mcm2-7 does not appear to phase separate on its own, initiation factors can recruit the complex into condensates in a DNA-, ATP-, and ORC/Cdc6/Cdt1-dependent manner. In addition, cellular and genetic studies establish that the Orc1 IDR is critical for its recruitment to mitotic chromosomes and is essential for viability. Collectively, our observations not only reveal a new class of high-complexity sequences that undergo phase separation, but also provide a model for how these elements promote physical interactions between replication initiation factors that could help promote long-range chromosomal communication observed in replication programs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Cdt1 undergoes DNA-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)</title><p>The architecture of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Cdt1 (<italic>Dm</italic>Cdt1) is markedly different from its budding yeast counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Interestingly, in the course of conducting these studies, we found that upon mixing 20 µM <italic>Dm</italic>Cdt1 with stoichiometric amounts of a 60 bp duplex oligo, the solution became visibly turbid, and that this turbidity was reversible by the addition of salt (400 mM KCl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Inspection of the turbid solution by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy unexpectedly revealed the presence of phase-separated droplets up to 4 µm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These droplets were fully absent from the DNA alone sample and barely detectable in both number and size in the <italic>Dm</italic>Cdt1 alone sample. Notably, Cdt1 phase separation was dependent on the length, but not the sequence, of the dsDNA substrate, with maximal LLPS occurring in the presence of oligonucleotides longer than 25 basepairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). To confirm that the affinity determined for Cdt1 in binding DNA was not confounded by the phase transition event, we determined whether a rapid binding/exchange equilibrium was maintained in the FP DNA-binding assay using a competition assay that titrated ‘cold’ dsDNA against pre-formed Cdt1/DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The unlabeled oligonucleotide was able to fully reduce DNA binding by Cdt1 to background levels, with an inhibition constant (K<sub>c, app</sub> = 62 ± 4 nM) comparable to the observed K<sub>d, app</sub> (83 nM), demonstrating that the labeled DNA in droplets is freely exchangeable and therefore in equilibrium between bound and unbound states.

We therefore purified an N-terminal IDR deletion of Cdt1 (Cdt1<sup>ΔIDR</sup>) and determined whether, upon mixing with DNA, a condensed phase could form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). No droplets were observed when Cdt1<sup>ΔIDR</sup> was mixed with Cy5-dsDNA, even at elevated levels (10 µM protein, 10 µM DNA). To confirm these data with unlabeled DNA, we devised a simple depletion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In this approach, protein is incubated with or without DNA, after which the denser, phase-separated material is pelleted by centrifugation, and the degree to which protein is depleted from the supernatant is assessed by SDS-PAGE. In agreement with the microscopy data, no depletion of full-length Cdt1 was observed relative to the load control in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that no phase separation occurred. Moreover, the full-length Cdt1 signal was fully lost from the supernatant in the presence of DNA, indicating that a near complete partitioning of Cdt1 into the condensed (pelleted) phase took place. When the <italic>Dm</italic>Cdt1 IDR was removed, the protein was again fully retained in the supernatant, regardless of whether DNA was present or not. Notably, a construct containing only the Cdt1 N-terminal IDR residues (Cdt1<sup>IDR</sup>) bound DNA (K<sub>d, app</sub> = 158 ± 32 nM) and underwent DNA-dependent phase separation on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), demonstrating that the Cdt1 IDR is necessary and sufficient for condensation and that it directly interacts with dsDNA. Budding yeast Cdt1, which neither has an IDR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) nor binds DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), did not exhibit phase separation behavior in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). However, all other metazoan Cdt1 homologs possess an N-terminal IDR; tests with human Cdt1 revealed that, similar to <italic>Dm</italic>Cdt1, it also can undergo DNA-induced liquid phase condensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>).

Given the low concentration of endogenous Cdt1, it was unclear whether our biochemical experiments, which were conducted at micromolar protein concentrations, would accurately reflect Cdt1 behavior in vivo. To address this question, we used fluorescence microscopy to generate a phase diagram for <italic>Dm</italic>Cdt1, titrating protein and salt concentration, and assaying for the presence or absence of a condensed phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Droplets were observed down to the lowest concentration of Cdt1 tested (62.5 nM) when salt concentrations were set at or below physiological levels ([KGlutamate]=150 mM). Increasing salt concentration to twice physiological levels (300 mM) shifted the concentration of protein necessary to see phase separation to 500 nM. When the concentration of potassium glutamate was increased to 600 mM, no phase separation was observed for any concentration of Cdt1 tested. The ability of Cdt1 to phase separate at nanomolar concentrations was confirmed by the depletion assay, wherein stoichiometric mixtures of <italic>Dm</italic>Cdt1 and duplex DNA were prepared from 800 nM to 50 nM, and assessed for DNA-dependent depletion of protein in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

In all cases, the longest regions of uninterrupted disorder reside N-terminal to the bulk of the folded domain content of the chain (i.e., upstream of the Cdt1 WH domains and of the AAA+ and WH domains of Orc1, Orc2, and Cdc6). Cdc6 possesses the shortest N-terminal IDR (246 amino acids) and Orc1 the longest (362 residues). There also exist shorter regions of disorder that serve as linker sequences between tandem globular domains, such as between the AAA+ and WH domain of Cdc6 (26 amino acid IDR) or the two WH domains of Cdt1 (152 amino acid IDR).</p><p>The realization that Cdc6 and two subunits of ORC possess long N-terminal IDRs suggested that these factors, like Cdt1, might also undergo phase separation in a DNA-dependent fashion, and that this property might promote their functional integration within a single condensed phase. This idea was first tested by examining the ability of recombinant <italic>Dm</italic>ORC to phase separate using the depletion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 1–3). Similar to the behavior of <italic>Dm</italic>Cdt1 when it forms condensates, ORC was found to be depleted from the supernatant in the presence, but not in the absence, of DNA. The inclusion of ATP did not have an appreciable effect on phase separation by ORC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 4–5), and fluorescence microscopy with Cy5-dsDNA confirmed that the DNA-dependent depletion of ORC from the supernatant was due to phase separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, no droplets are observed for DNA alone). Assaying ORC phase separation over a range of protein concentrations (50 nM to 800 nM) consistently revealed ORC depletion when DNA was present but not when it was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Depletion occurred regardless of oligonucleotide sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), although like Cdt1, maximal phase separation occurred with oligonucleotides longer than 25 basepairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, like Cdt1, ORC is able to undergo LLPS at physiological concentrations in the presence of a variety of DNA substrates without any apparent DNA sequence dependence.</p><p>We next investigated whether ORC’s ability to undergo phase separation could be targeted to the IDR of a specific subunit, or whether the IDRs of both Orc1 and Orc2 are required for this behavior. In terms of length, the Orc1 IDR, at 362 amino acids, is approximately 100 residues longer than the Orc2 IDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Comparisons of sequence composition between Orc1 and Orc2 IDRs – performed by calculating the relative percentage of hydrophobic (A, G, I, L, M, P, V), hydrophilic (C, N, S, T, Q), charged (D, E, H, K, R), and aromatic (F, W, Y) residues – show that the IDRs of Orc1 and Orc2 are highly similar in content, with the values for Orc1 and Orc2 within 3% for each amino acid category. Interestingly, Orc1 and Orc2 IDR amino acids are near equally distributed across hydrophobic (36/35%), hydrophilic (30/29%), and charged (32/33%) classes; this preponderance of hydrophobic residues is somewhat unexpected given the predicted unstructured nature of these sequences. Glycine, which is grouped within the hydrophobic class, is often enriched in protein unstructured regions, yet for both Orc1 and Orc2, glycine content is lower than expected for such a region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brüne et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although the Orc1 and Orc2 IDRs are highly similar in terms of amino acid types, they do show a marked difference in their isoelectric points (pI): the Orc1 IDR (pI = 10.1) is enriched for positively-charged residues (20% positive and 12% negative), whereas the Orc2 IDR (pI = 6.0) is weakly enriched for negatively-charged residues (17% negative and 16% positive). Speculating that this divergence in net charge might be important for facilitating LLPS by ORC, we constructed two mutant <italic>Dm</italic>ORC complexes, one with the Orc1 IDR deleted (ORC<sup>1ΔIDR</sup>) and the other lacking the Orc2 IDR (ORC<sup>2ΔIDR</sup>). Phase separation for both constructs was then assessed by the depletion assay and fluorescence imaging with Cy5-dsDNA. ORC<sup>1ΔIDR</sup> showed no evidence for phase separation in either assay, whereas the construct lacking the Orc2 IDR exhibited wild-type behavior in both assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). These findings demonstrate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORC phase separates using interactions that require the N-terminal IDR of Orc1 but not Orc2. Given the predicted lack of structure in the Orc1 IDR we were surprised to discover that this region is relatively well-conserved across the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genus (67% identity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and that the composition, length, and pI of this region is conserved across the metazoan phyla (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Although <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Orc1 possesses an N-terminal IDR, this region is shorter than observed in metazoa and also has an acidic pI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Consistent with this observation, budding yeast ORC does not phase separate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>We next asked whether Cdc6 can undergo DNA-dependent LLPS. Similar to budding yeast Cdc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feng et al., 2000</xref>), <italic>Dm</italic>Cdc6 was found to interact with DNA by dsDNA-coupled agarose bead pull-down assays; the presence of ATP had no significant effect on Cdc6 DNA-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Upon testing whether Cdc6 phase separates in the presence of DNA using the depletion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), we observed a reproducible DNA-dependent depletion of Cdc6 from the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> lanes 1–3); however, in contrast to ORC, this depletion was inhibited by the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> lanes 4–5). A recent report that ATP can function as a hydrotrope to enhance intracellular protein solubility may provide an explanation for its effect on Cdc6 phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Patel et al., 2017</xref>). Repeating the assay at higher concentrations of <italic>Dm</italic>Cdc6 shows that unlike <italic>Dm</italic>Cdt1, which appeared to fully partition into phases at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), Cdc6 was only partially depleted from the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). When examined over a range of protein concentrations and DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>), Cdc6 consistently showed phase separating behavior, although the protein never completely partitioned into the pellet. Notably, Cdc6 underwent complete partitioning into the condensed phase in the presence of plasmid DNA, whereas only partial depletion was observed with short oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I</xref>), indicating that for <italic>Dm</italic>Cdc6, LLPS requires longer DNA segments than either <italic>Dm</italic>Cdt1 or <italic>Dm</italic>ORC. Fluorescence microscopy with Cy5-dsDNA confirmed that Cdc6 forms condensates in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), while tests with a Cdc6 mutant lacking the N-terminal IDR (Cdc6<sup>ΔIDR</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>) showed that this construct has no capacity to phase separate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–K</xref>).

Generally speaking, initiator IDRs can be characterized as having: 1) a high degree of sequence complexity, and approximately equal representation of charged, hydrophilic, and hydrophobic residues, 2) a deficiency in aromatic amino acids and glycine, and 3) a net positive charge. This sequence pattern suggested that initiator IDRs might serve as specificity determinants for forming condensates. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the recruitment of eGFP-tagged human FUS (eGFP-FUS) and eGFP-<italic>Dm</italic>Cdt1 into preformed ORC/Cy5-dsDNA droplets. Relative to the bulk phase, a 10-fold enrichment of eGFP-Cdt1 signal intensity is observed within ORC/Cy5-dsdNA droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). Conversely, no enrichment is observed for eGFP-FUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>).

We first addressed this question using a modified form of the depletion assay where we assessed partitioning of FLAG-tagged Mcm2-7 to both the dilute and condensed phases by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). No evidence for phase separation by Mcm2-7 alone was observed under these conditions either in the presence or absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>). Although specific MCM subunits contain predicted disordered domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), these regions are in all cases shorter than the N-terminal IDRs of ORC, Cdc6 and Cdt1, and have a different amino acid composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). The IDRs of Mcm2 and Mcm3, for example, have an acidic pI (pI &lt;6), and although Mcm4 contains an N-terminal IDR with a basic pI (pI = 11.0), this region has fewer charged residues compared to the other initiator IDRs.

To more rapidly sort through different Orc1 mutants and their role in chromatin association, we turned to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> S2 tissue culture cells. A series of eGFP-labeled Orc1 constructs to be used for co-expression analysis were constructed, along with a mCherry-tagged variant of histone H2A to provide a benchmark for timing events of interest. To confirm that the S2 cell culture system recapitulates the behavior of ORC seen in embryos, the dynamics of wild-type Orc1 in mitotic cells were imaged first. Consistent with our observations in embryos, Orc1 loaded onto chromosomes beginning in anaphase (2.5 ± 0.2 fold enrichment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,I</xref>), and mutations within the Orc1 Walker A and B motifs had no effect on the observed recruitment (2.3 ± 0.4 fold enrichment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,I</xref>). A time course analysis of Orc1 enrichment reveals that loading onto chromosomes begins in anaphase and reaches peak intensity in telophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We next tested how deletion of either the Orc1 BAH domain (Orc1<sup>ΔBAH</sup>) or the Orc1 IDR (Orc1<sup>ΔIDR</sup>) altered Orc1 chromatin recruitment in S2 cells (the design of these constructs retained the nuclear localization signal present in the most N-terminal portion of the Orc1 IDR, which directly follows the BAH domain). The Orc1<sup>ΔBAH</sup> construct showed wild-type like association with chromosomes (2.6 ± 0.7 fold enrichment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,I</xref>), demonstrating that the BAH domain is not required for chromatin association in vivo. By contrast, chromosome recruitment of Orc1<sup>ΔIDR</sup> was fully abolished to background levels (1.0 ± 0.2 fold enrichment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>), such that no increase in ORC signal on chromosomes was observed as cells progressed through mitosis. A closer inspection of the data reveals that the chromosome signal for Orc1<sup>ΔIDR</sup> appears to decrease upon entry into anaphase but recovers to background (metaphase) levels in telophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, red line). Finally, we used fly genetics to confirm the essential function of the Orc1 N-terminal IDR, demonstrating that an Orc1<sup>ΔIDR</sup> transgene is incapable of rescuing an Orc1 null allele (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Currently, we know of no other function of ORC that is essential for viability other than its activities in DNA replication. Together, these data demonstrate that the Orc1 N-terminal IDR is both essential for viability and facilities the ATP-independent recruitment of ORC to mitotic chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Initiator phase separation is regulated by CDK-dependent phosphorylation</title><p>Our analysis of Orc1 dynamics in cells shows that the association of the complex with chromatin is regulated and does not occur until anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

An analysis of putative CDK phosphorylation sites shows that Orc1 hosts sixteen such motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), all but one of which localizes to the Orc1 IDR. Of these, seven IDR sites represent full CDK consensus sequences, [S/T]PX[K/R], while the others represent the minimal sequence, [S/T]P.

Cdc6 and Cdt1 have seven and sixteen putative sites, respectively. For Cdc6, all sites reside within the N-terminal IDR and four represent full consensus sequences. For Cdt1, 13/16 sites are within the N-terminal IDR and nine represent the full consensus sequence.

However, we demonstrate here that in the absence of ATP, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ORC can interact with DNA at physiological protein and salt concentrations in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and that the Orc1 ATP-binding and hydrolysis motifs are dispensable for its recruitment to chromatin in vivo, both in the early embryo and in cell culture.

Corroborating these results is previous work that demonstrates a specific role for human and <italic>C. elegans</italic> Orc1 in facilitating ATP-independent ORC/DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Giordano-Coltart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sonneville et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Vashee et al., 2003</xref>) and a direct role for a short DNA-binding motif within the Orc1 IDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bleichert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kawakami et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 2018</xref>). It remains to be determined whether the Orc1 IDR alone is sufficient for proper origin recognition (as opposed to general chromatin recruitment), or whether the action of this element works in concert with other DNA-interaction surfaces of ORC, such as the Orc1 BAH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kuo et al., 2012</xref>) or the TFIIB domains of Orc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The long-standing observation that DNA binding by ORC is enhanced by ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell and Stillman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chesnokov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Vashee et al., 2003</xref>) would at first seem at odds with the ATP-independent DNA association phenomena reported here. This dichotomy can be reconciled by invoking a two-step model wherein (for metazoan ORC at least) the tight, ATP-dependent encirclement of a short segment of DNA occurs after an initial set of weaker interactions takes place between an initiator IDR and a DNA segment or chromatin region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7 A,B</xref>). These dynamic interactions would likely involve contacts between short basic motifs within the Orc1 IDR and DNA, and between the IDRs of ORC molecules as well. The association of ORC with relatively small, diffusible, and nucleosome-free DNAs in this fashion can directly lead to phase separation in vitro, as observed here. By contrast, multivalent ORC-ORC and ORC-DNA interactions in vivo need to contend with a much larger and less pliable chromatin substrate. The nature of the DNA substrate in this context would be expected to resist large-scale condensation by ORC-ORC and ORC-DNA interactions; these associations would instead be expected to help distribute ORC across chromosomes in a manner akin to surface ‘wetting,’ a well-known property of condensate-forming systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Feric et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48562.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The role of IDR- and DNA-dependent initiator co-association in replication initiation.</title><p>Prior to mitosis, ORC exists in an inhibited state incompetent for chromatin recruitment (<bold>A</bold>). At the metaphase to anaphase transition (<bold>A–B</bold>), <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ORC is activated, possibly in part through IDR dephosphorylation, thereby driving the condensation of ORC onto the surface of chromosomes (<bold>B</bold>). The Orc1 IDR likely plays a key role in this event, both interacting with DNA and also participating in intermolecular IDR-IDR interactions that drive ORC enrichment on chromosomes. The spatial patterning of ORC is developmentally regulated and appears correlated with the establishment of chromatin territories and TADs. Before cellularization (top, ‘Pre-cellularization cycles’), the multi-nucleate fly embryo undergoes synchronous divisions that lack a G1 phase. At this stage, ORC shows homogenous chromosome binding. Conversely, ORC is non-uniformly distributed in differentiated cells (bottom, ‘Lineage-dependent cycles’) where replication domain boundaries coincide with underlying features of chromatin architecture. Once ORC is bound to chromosomes, Cdc6 and Cdt1 are co-recruited through direct interactions with DNA and through inter-initiator IDR-IDR interactions (<bold>C</bold>). When the full suite of helicase loading factors are present, the Pre-RC forms and Mcm2-7 loading commences (<bold>D</bold>). Loading is terminated by the phosphorylation of initiator IDRs which displace them from chromatin and inhibit re-association (<bold>E</bold>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48562-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The initial IDR-dependent recruitment of ORC to DNA would poise the complex for the second binding step whereby ORC encircles a nucleic acid duplex using specialized and structurally-defined DNA binding elements that line the ORC central channel. These interactions would rely on a conformational state that is stabilized by ATP binding, rendering the complex competent for catalyzing Mcm2-7 loading. Consistent with this two-step model, an eGFP-tagged Orc1 transgene carrying an ATP binding and hydrolysis mutation loses its ability to complement a null allele of the protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), even though it associates with chromatin in what appears to be a wild-type manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Although the precise link between the association of ORC with chromatin and the specification of a particular locus as a <italic>bona fide</italic> origin is unclear, it is tempting to speculate that some ATP-controlled aspect of DNA encirclement underpins this step.</p><p>The potential for a link between IDR-dependent modes of DNA-binding and higher-order DNA structure/origin organization remains to be established. It will be particularly important to understand whether chromatin or DNA structural elements implicated in origin selection (e.g., G-quadruplex sequences; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cayrou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cayrou et al., 2012</xref>) might play a role in initiator phase separation. Our finding that condensation in vitro is neither sequence-specific nor possible with short DNA fragments (≤ 25 basepairs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) is consistent with the known absence of sequence-defined origins in metazoan species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heinzel et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyrien and Méchali, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Méchali and Kearsey, 1984</xref>) and a lack of sequence specificity observed for metazoan ORCs in binding to DNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Remus et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Vashee et al., 2003</xref>). Whether the DNA length requirement for LLPS by ORC might impact the selection of origin sites is currently unknown, but may influence the preference of ORC for open, nucleosome-free regions of chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">MacAlpine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Miotto et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Formation of the Pre-RC and helicase loading</title><p>An important property of initiator IDRs is that they allow for both self-self and partner protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, as ORC forms local interactions with itself to spread out along chromatin, this condensation would in turn be expected to promote the formation of stable subunit-subunit interactions that are ultimately necessary for helicase loading (such as the proper docking of Cdc6 into the ORC ring, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Importantly, this mechanism of co-association is seen to predominate in vitro at physiological salt and protein concentrations. Moreover, the selective partitioning of Mcm2-7 into initiator/DNA phases is seen only when all three initiation components (ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1) and ATP are present. This stringent requirement for the intact OCC and nucleotide is consistent with what is known to be the minimal set of factors necessary to catalyze the loading of Mcm2-7 complexes onto DNA. Since the pre-RC catalyzes multiple rounds of Mcm2-7 deposition through the reiterative binding and release of individual initiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>), the ‘wetting’ of a swath of DNA loci by a multitude of initiation factors would help keep those factors that cycle on and off of ORC at a relatively high concentration to promote successive Mcm2-7 loading cycles. Such behavior may be particularly useful in the early stages of embryogenesis and in pluripotent stem cells, where cycling times are short and helicase loading occurs rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Matson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Initiator IDRs may serve a role beyond simply increasing the efficiency of chromatin association and helicase loading. It has long been recognized that initiators are under stringent cellular control by CDKs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Parker et al., 2017</xref>). It has also been established that a majority of CDK sites map to unstructured regions of Orc1, Cdc6, and Cdt1; however, how phosphorylation at these sites might regulate initiator function has remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the formation of initiator condensates is disrupted by CDK action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The inability of the phosphorylated initiator proteins to phase separate with DNA provides a ready explanation for how post-translational modifications unique to metazoan ORC could lead these factors to dissociate from chromatin late in the cell cycle and then associate again either in anaphase or G1 when the CDK levels are low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Findeisen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Remus et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Budding yeast ORC is also negatively regulated by CDK-dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nguyen et al., 2001</xref>), although this regulation likely occurs through a distinct mechanism, as we did not observe phase separation of <italic>Sc</italic>ORC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). It is notable that in metazoans Cdt1 inactivation requires the further degradation of the protein through a PCNA-dependent ubiquitination pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias and Walter, 2006</xref>); why this extra level of stringency has evolved remains to be determined. How phosphorylation interferes with phase separation is unknown and will require a more sophisticated understanding of the biophysical interactions underpinning the condensation reaction. Given the overall clustering of positively charged residues in the IDRs, and the DNA dependence of the condensation, charge neutralization of the domain and/or charge repulsion seem likely to play a critical role.</p><p>Beyond cell-cycle regulation, the IDR-dependent recruitment and co-association of ORC molecules with chromatin could also help account for more complex forms of initiator behavior and spatial patterning seen in vivo, such as the non-uniform organization of both replication origins and ORC binding sites across chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cayrou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Miotto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Petryk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Vaughn et al., 1990</xref>). We and others have observed that the distribution of ORC changes throughout the cell cycle, often in a species and cell-type specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldinger and Gossen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McNairn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Méndez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Natale, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Sun et al., 2002</xref>), and seems coincident with underlying changes in chromatin topology. For example, in early <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos, in which the cell cycle proceeds directly from mitosis to S-phase (skipping G1), ORC appears to homogeneously coat mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video2">2</xref>). Human Orc1 shows a similar pattern of binding during mitosis in U2OS cells and, after mitotic exit, recruits other ORC subunits to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kara et al., 2015</xref>). Mirroring the spatial patterning seen for human and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ORC in mitosis, mitotic chromosomes in metazoans are homogeneously organized and lack chromatin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Naumova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Oomen and Dekker, 2017</xref>). Conversely, ORC shows a non-uniform, punctate distribution in interphase in many differentiated cell types of metazoan species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Austin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lidonnici et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Shen et al., 2010</xref>). The switch in cellular ORC patterning between early embryonic and differentiated states appears coincident with the establishment of large-scale chromatin domains and topologically-associated domains (TADs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hug et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 2014</xref>), chromosomal regions that provide a basic level of chromatin organization and that also appear to possess liquid-phase like properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nuebler et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, replication domains appear to substantially overlap with TADs in multiple eukaryotic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Petryk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pope et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to the role observed for the Orc1 IDR in binding mitotic chromosomes, it seems plausible that this region could help regulate large-scale spatial patterning of ORC in the nucleus. In such instances, the self-assembling properties of the Orc1 IDR would be used to reinforce the formation and maintenance of chromatin domains with other resident factors (such as HP1). Further studies will be needed to explore whether initiator self-assembly on chromatin is coordinated with or helps to underpin higher-level replication organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>From a parallel perspective, it is interesting to note that the visualization of both newly-replicated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kennedy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Xiang et al., 2018</xref>) and proteins present at the replication fork during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chagin et al., 2016</xref>) often reveals a non-uniform organization within the nucleus, a feature that has led to the proposal that replisomes may be grouped into ‘factories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cook, 1999</xref>). While speculative, the formation and regulation of these replication foci could be aided by self-assembly mechanisms similar to those proposed here for initiation. Preliminary analyses of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> replication proteins reveals that there is a high prevalence of long IDRs (data not shown). Proteins required at each stage of the replication reaction, from initiation to elongation, contain disordered domains, including Mcm10 and Chiffon (the fly homolog of Dbf4), as well as multiple cyclin proteins, topoisomerases, the clamp loader subunit Rfc1 and various polymerase components. Some of these IDRs have sequence characteristics similar to initiators, while others are clearly distinct. Given the selectivity we observe for initiator condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), it is possible that the phase formed by Pre-RC machineries may represent an evolving structure that, through the fluid exchange of its resident components facilitated by IDR-IDR interactions, drives replication forward, culminating in the spatial co-localization of multiple active forks within a nuclear zone.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Molecular mechanism of initiator phase separation</title><p>Phase transitions in biology are driven by multivalent interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2012</xref>). For protein LLPS, multivalency is achieved in two non-mutually exclusive ways: 1) by the linear and repetitive arrangement of folded interaction modules, and 2) through extended regions of intrinsic disorder that contain short linear interaction motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boeynaems et al., 2018</xref>). Replication initiation factors fall within the latter of the two classes.</p><p>A major family of IDRs that mediate phase separation are the so-called low-complexity domain (LCD) proteins, which include factors such as FUS, Laf1, Ddx4 and hnRNPA1. Studies investigating the biophysical mechanisms of phase separation in these and other proteins have suggested a role for π-π and π-cation contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Vernon et al., 2018</xref>). Aromatic residues are major mediators of these type of interactions and have demonstrated functionality in LCD condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chong et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Qamar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Other sequences are also able to participate in π-π/π-cation bonding pairs, such as repetitive RG/RGG motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chong et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</xref>). Even for non-LCD IDRs, such as the Nephrin intracellular domain (NICD), aromatic residue-mediated π-π contacts are of primary importance in facilitating phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pak et al., 2016</xref>). Given these data, we were surprised to find that both aromatic residues (&lt;3% for Orc1, Cdc6, and Cdt1) and glycine (&lt;4% for Orc1, Cdc6, and Cdt1) are substantially underrepresented in initiator IDR sequences compared to other phase separating LCD proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Initiator IDRs are also devoid of simple repetitive motifs.</p><p>Outside of π-π/π-cation interactions, electrostatics can be another major driver of protein phase separation. This force is particularly relevant in systems that undergo complex coacervation with nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aumiller and Keating, 2016</xref>), such as seen with the tau protein and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wegmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). The process of complex coacervation through the utilization of RNA as a counterion scaffold is mechanistically analogous to how we believe the replication initiators behave in the presence of DNA. Lines of evidence supporting this model include the demonstration that: 1) all <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> initiator IDRs have a pI &gt;9 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), 2) initiator condensation is salt-sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and each initiator has relatively high fraction of charged residues (between 32–35%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), and 3) although similar in overall amino acid composition, the Orc1 IDR (pI = 10.1) but not the Orc2 IDR (pI = 6.0) is necessary for ORC phase separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We envision that initiator IDR interactions with DNA overcome interchain electrostatic repulsion between proximally positioned initiator IDRs, thereby promoting intermolecular interactions between the IDRs. Although at present we possess a minimal understanding of the biophysics of initiator LLPS, the relatively equal representation of hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and charged amino acids within initiator IDRs suggests that intermolecular IDR-IDR interactions may be of multiple types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conservation of initiator IDRs across eukaryotes</title><p>The IDRs of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Orc1, Cdc6, and Cdt1 share a similar sequence composition but no identifiable sequence identity.

It is notable, however, that the Orc1 IDR amino acid sequences are highly conserved across the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genus (representing over 40 M years of evolution; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Drosophila 12 Genomes Consortium et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that there may be presently unrecognized sequence-specific functional information.</p><p>All metazoan homologs of Orc1, Cdc6, and Cdt1 that we have analyzed contain a predicted N-terminal IDR longer than one-hundred amino acids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, including human, mouse, <italic>D. rerio, X. laevis</italic>, and <italic>C. elegans</italic>). Interestingly, for all species Orc1 contains the longest IDR and Cdc6 the shortest. While suggestive, an IDR alone does not unequivocally determine whether a protein will phase separate. Further classification of eighteen homologous metazoan sequences demonstrate that they contain sequence characteristics similar to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> initiator proteins: all possess a basic pI (calculated pIs range from 9.1 to 11.1), a low content of aromatic and glycine residues, and a relatively high fraction of charged residues (ranging from 0.22 to 0.39). Based on our current limited understanding of initiator phase separation, these data suggest that the ability of initiators to undergo DNA-dependent LLPS is likely broadly conserved across metazoa. In line with this idea, we show that human Cdt1, like <italic>Dm</italic>Cdt1, forms condensates in a DNA-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). A recent report demonstrating an essential function for the phosphorylation-regulated conversion of intramolecular IDR interactions in human Orc1 to intermolecular interactions between ORC and Cdc6 IDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hossain et al., 2019</xref>) is similarly supportive with such a proposal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

These observations in turn provide a provocative link between the replication machinery and their function in at least two other cellular structures recently predicted to be impacted by phase separation. One is heterochromatin: recent work has demonstrated that Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1), a major cellular organizer of heterochromatin, undergoes phase separation in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Larson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Strom et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, there is a conserved linkage between the formation of HP1-dependent heterochromatic domains and ORC binding, with the localization of HP1 and ORC to chromatin being interdependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pak et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Prasanth et al., 2004</xref>).

It is tempting to speculate that the formation of heterochromatic domains may involve a condensed phase that forms by the coordinated action of ORC and HP1 (and likely many other proteins), and that this activity may have the dual purpose of excluding transcriptional machineries to maintain a silenced state while enriching ORC in an otherwise inaccessible compartment that must nonetheless be replicated. We anticipate that any mechanism(s) underlying the formation and maintenance of heterochromatic domains may be developmentally regulated, since HP1 domains are clearly visible during interphase in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Strom et al., 2017</xref>), whereas the association of ORC with chromatin appears restricted to mitosis during the same developmental stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Notably, multiple subunits of ORC, including both Orc1 and Cdc6, are targeted to centrosomes where they regulate centrosome copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hemerly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Prasanth et al., 2004</xref>). We speculate that the sequence features which enable initiator phase separation on DNA (e.g. their N-terminal IDRs) may permit their selective partitioning and enrichment on centrosomes. From a mechanistic standpoint, it is interesting to note that the scaffolding protein SPD-5 and its homologs in other metazoans bear a high net negative charge (<italic>Dm</italic>Centrosomin is 30% charged with pI = 5.8), suggesting that initiator recruitment to centrosomes may proceed through a mechanism similar to their condensation on chromatin, that is, by complex coacervation through charge-charge interactions with a poly-anionic scaffold (in this case, protein).</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that replication initiators contain a novel class of IDRs that facilitate phase separation and affect each stage of the initiator functional cycle. This work establishes a new paradigm for understanding metazoan initiation mechanisms and their regulation by CDK activity, and how initiation can be organized at the mesoscale. These findings in turn open up numerous new avenues of cross-disciplinary investigation into how the replication initiation machineries interface with other cellular pathways, such as those involved in chromatin maintenance and establishment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>2Cc-T</td><td>QB3 Macrolab (UC Berkeley)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_37237">Addgene_37237</ext-link></td><td>Ligation independent cloning (LIC); <italic>E. coli</italic> expression vector</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>1GFP</td><td>QB3 Macrolab (UC Berkeley)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_29663">Addgene_29663</ext-link></td><td>LIC cloning; <italic>E. coli</italic> expression vector</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>1b</td><td>QB3 Macrolab (UC Berkeley)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_29653">Addgene_29653</ext-link></td><td>LIC cloning; <italic>E. coli</italic> expression vector</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pFastbac1</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td/><td>Insect cell expression vector</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>438A</td><td>QB3 Macrolab (UC Berkeley)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_55218">Addgene_55218</ext-link></td><td>LIC cloning; insect cell expression vector</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>438B</td><td>QB3 Macrolab (UC Berkeley)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_55219">Addgene_55219</ext-link></td><td>LIC cloning; insect cell expression vector</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>4C</td><td>QB3 Macrolab (UC Berkeley)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_30116">Addgene_30116</ext-link></td><td>LIC cloning; insect cell expression vector</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pattB</td><td/><td/><td>Fragments inserted into MCS by restriction enzyme cloning; transgene vector</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pCopia-LIC</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>LIC cloning; <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> cell culture <break/>expression vector</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>TEV</td><td>QB3 Macrolab (UC Berkeley)</td><td/><td>Used at 1/10 (weight/weight) TEV/substrate ratio</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Flag peptide</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>Rosetta 2(DE3)pLysS</td><td>QB3 Macrolab (UC Berkeley)</td><td/><td>Chemically competent cells</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>DH10bac</td><td>QB3 Macrolab (UC Berkeley)</td><td/><td>Chemically competent cells</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>S2</td><td>UC Berkeley <break/>Cell Culture Facility</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Spodoptera frugiperda)</italic></td><td>Sf9</td><td>UC Berkeley Cell Culture Facility</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Trichoplusia ni)</italic></td><td>High5</td><td>This paper; <break/>UC Berkeley Cell Culture Facility</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity Agarose Gel</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>A2220 <break/>(RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10063035">AB_10063035</ext-link>)</td><td>0.5 mL resin per 1 L expression</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Amylose Resin</td><td>NEB</td><td>E8021L</td><td>5 mL of resin; column format</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>High Capacity Strepatavidin Agarose</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>20357</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Effectene</td><td>Qiagen</td><td>301425</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Cdt1 affinity purified antibody (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>M.

Botchan) followed by incubation with a secondary IRDye800 CW Donkey anti-Rabbit antibody (1,/10,000, LI-COR, 926–32213). Blots were imaged with a LI-COR Odyssey imager.

For the turbidity assays, 20 µM <italic>Dm</italic>Cdt1 was combined with 20 µM dsDNA in microcentrifuge tubes; as controls, samples were prepared that contained only <italic>Dm</italic>Cdt1 or dsDNA. After mixing, the solution became immediately turbid and the tubes were imaged on an Epson Perfection V700 scanner. We asked whether this was a reversible process by adding concentrated KCl (4 M) to a final concentration of 400 mM to the Cdt1/DNA mixture and again imaging the sample. To determine the source of the turbidity, 7 µL of each sample was spotted on a slide, covered with a coverslip, and imaged on a wide-field microscope equipped with DIC optics at a magnification of 63x with an oil immersion objective. For assaying droplet formation by fluorescence microscopy, samples were prepared by mixing protein with Cy5 or Cy3-labeled dsDNA (Cy5- or Cy3-dsDNA) and incubating 2 min prior to spotting 7 µL on a glass slide and covering with a glass coverslip. Subsequently, the samples were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 710 inverted confocal microscope using a 63x oil immersion objective and appropriate filter sets. For multi-color fluorescent imaging, control samples were imaged to ensure no crosstalk was observed between channels. Multi-color droplet recruitment assays were completed by first preparing droplets with ORC and Cy5-dsDNA. Subsequently, fluorescently-tagged proteins were spiked into each reaction and imaged. Quantitation of protein recruitment to preformed ORC droplets was completed in FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). First, regions of interest (ROI) for ORC/Cy5-dsDNA droplets were generated with the auto-threshold function and then the signal intensity for the eGFP channel was measured within these regions, form which a mean and standard deviation was calculated. Finally, depletion assay samples were prepared by mixing protein with an equimolar amount of dsDNA and incubating the samples for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 xg and the supernatant removed for separation by SDS-PAGE analysis and subsequent Coomassie or Silver staining; in all cases, a protein load control was also assessed that had not been centrifuged. Depletion experiments that assayed the effect of DNA length and sequence on initiator phase separation were completed at 2 µM protein concentrations and 0.03 mg/mL of the following generated-randomly dsDNA oligonucleotides:</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Name</th><th valign="top">Sequence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">15mer:</td><td valign="top"> <named-content content-type="sequence">CACAGCGTACTCACA</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">25mer:</td><td valign="top"> <named-content content-type="sequence">CACAGACGCACCAGTTTACACTCAG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">50mer:</td><td valign="top"> <named-content content-type="sequence">CATGCATACACGAGCTGCACAAACGAGAGTGCTTGAACTGGACCTCTAGT</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">60mer:</td><td valign="top"> <named-content content-type="sequence">GAAGCTAGACTTAGGTGTCATATTGAACCTACTATGCCGAACTAGTTACGAGCTATAAAC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">10% GC:</td><td valign="top"> <named-content content-type="sequence">CATTTAATAATTTTGTAATAAAAATTAAGAAAATAATAATAATTATAAATACTATCGTAT</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">25% GC:</td><td valign="top"> <named-content content-type="sequence">AAATGTTTCTTACAATAAAACGATCAAGTACATTTTTATAAAAGGTGATAGAGATTTACG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">50% GC:</td><td valign="top"> <named-content content-type="sequence">GATACTTGGGCTTGATCTCGCCCCGACACCTGCAAACCTCAACTGCCTTAGATTATATGG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">75% GC:</td><td valign="top"> <named-content content-type="sequence">GGTGGTGTCGGGTCAGGGCGGCCCCGCGACCAGTCGTGTGCCTTCCCGAGCTCCGTCCGG</named-content></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Disorder and complexity calculations</title><p>The per-residue disorder score was calculated using the online DISOPRED3 disorder prediction server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jones and Cozzetto, 2015</xref>) and N-terminal IDRs characterized by the longest contiguous stretch of disordered residues (DISOPRED &gt;0.5).

Embryos were dechorionated in 100% bleach for 90 s and placed on the surface of a 5 mm diameter glass coverslip using a fine haired paintbrush. The coverslip surface was made adhesive by applying a small drop of homemade glue solution (prepared by dissolving a roll of double-sided scotch tape in heptane overnight) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mir et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Imaging was performed using a custom built Lattice Light-Sheet Microscope as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mir et al., 2017</xref>). For all experiments a 40 beam square lattice pattern was used with a minimum and maximum excitation numerical aperture of 0.44 and 0.55 respectively. The lattice pattern was dithered in the x direction over a 5 µm range in 0.1 µm steps over the duration of each exposure to generate a uniform excitation pattern. Z-stacks were acquired by synchronously scanning the excitation sheet using a galvo-mirror, and the detection objective using a piezo stage over a 25 µm range in 0.250 µm increments. A 488 nm laser was used to excite eGFP (eGFP-Orc1 or eGFP-Orc1<sup>WalkerAB</sup>) with an exposure time of 50 ms at each slice and a 561 nm laser was to excite RFP (His2A-RFP) with an exposure time of 10 ms at each slice. During Z-stack acquisition an image was acquired for both channels at each z-position before moving to the next. The time interval between each stack was 5.67 s. The excitation laser powers were set to 375 µW and 335 µW for the 488 nm and 561 nm lines respectively as measured at the back focal plane of the excitation objective. Images were recorded using two Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0 digital CMOS cameras. A long-pass dichroic (Semrock FF-560) nm was placed between the two cameras to separate emission wavelengths of above and below 560 nm, and a bandpass emission filter was placed in front of each camera (Semrock FF01-525/50 for eGFP and Semrock FF01-593/46 for RFP).</p><p>Once an embryo of suitable age was found (typically starting in nuclear cycle 12 as determined by examining the His2A-RFP channel) it was continuously imaged as described above until the completion of the mitosis preceding nuclear cycle 14.</p><p>Images of mitotic events, from metaphase to the completion of telophase were analyzed by first segmenting out chromatin using the His2A-RFP channel (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video3">Figure 5—video 3</xref>).

Briefly, first a 3D median filter was applied, followed by 3D Gaussian filtering to each z-stack. A locally adaptive threshold was then calculated, which was then used to generate a binary mask. The binary mask was then filtered by removing regions connected to a border so that only completely imaged nuclei were analyzed, and then filtered for size to remove segmentation errors. A label matrix was then generated from the binary mask for each time point. An implementation of the Hungarian algorithm for tracking (Simple Tracker - File Exchange - MATL...) was then applied to the centroid positions of the individual nuclei in the label matrices to track them through time. The mean intensity values for each nuclei through time were then calculated. Fold enrichment over the background value was calculated for each channel. We found that the local maxima in the eGFP-ORC1 channel intensity corresponded exactly to early telophase in each nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and this peak was then used to align each individual trace for averaging. Data from all cleavage events for each line were averaged together as no difference was found between traces from the 13th and 14th divisions in either the eGFP-ORC1 or eGFP-Orc1<sup>WalkerAB</sup> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

For transfections, S2 cells were seeded in 6-well dishes at a density of 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well. The medium was replaced 24 hr later and the cells were transfected (Effectene, Qiagen) with two plasmids, one expressing mCherry-tagged <italic>Dm</italic>Histone2A (pCopia_mCherry-H2A was a gift from the lab of Dr. Gary Karpen, UC Berkeley) and another expressing eGFP-tagged Orc1 (pCopia_eGFP-Orc1) (400 ng of each plasmid was used for transfections). pCopia_eGFP-Orc1 was generated by separately PCR amplifying eGFP and Orc1, and using Gibson Assembly to clone into a ligation-independent cloning (LIC) site incorporated into the parental pCopia vector (pCopia-LIC). pCopia_eGFP-Orc1 was then used as a template for around-the-horn mutagenesis to generate Orc1 deletions in the BAH domain (<italic>Orc1<sup>ΔBAH</sup></italic>, deletion of amino acids 1–186) and the disordered domain (<italic>Orc1<sup>ΔIDR</sup></italic>, deletion of amino acids 248–549). Two sequential rounds of around-the-horn mutagenesis was used to generate an Orc1 construct with mutations in the Walker A (K604A) and Walker B (D684A/E685A) motifs (<italic>Orc1<sup>WalkerAB</sup></italic>). The transfection mixture was removed 16 hr post-transfection and replaced with fresh medium. After an additional 24 hr incubation, the cells were prepared for imaging by gently resuspending the cells and transferring them to a 35 mm Nunc glass bottom tissue culture dish (ThermoFisher) where they were allowed to adhere for 20 min. After this time, the medium was gently aspirated to remove suspended cells and replaced with fresh ESF 921.</p><p>Image stacks were collected on a Zeiss LSM 710 inverted confocal microscope using a 40x oil immersion objective (NA = 1.4) and filter sets for mCherry and eGFP. Samples were scanned at low magnification (20x) using mCherry-H2A signal to identify mitotic cells (&lt;1% of cell population). When metaphase cells were identified they were positioned at the center of the field of view and magnification increased (40x objective with 3x digital zoom). To assess Orc1 dynamics a z-stack (1 µm spaced images over the entire cell volume) was collected every 1.5 min from metaphase through cytokinesis. Images were processed using FIJI. First, each stack of slices was summed and a gaussian blur (radius = 1) filter applied. Subsequently, the average background intensity was subtracted from each channel and an ROI generated for each time point by auto-thresholding the mCherry-H2A channel. The eGFP-Orc1 intensity was measured for each ROI and the fold-change in intensity relative to metaphase intensity was calculated for each time point. We report the average and standard deviation of the maximum fold-change in Orc1 chromosome intensity (observed in telophase) for at least three individual mitotic cells of each transfected construct.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Phosphorylation assays</title><p>The effect of initiator phosphorylation on phase separation was assessed by both the depletion assay and fluorescence microscopy. For depletion assay analysis, phosphorylation reactions were prepared by mixing 1 µM of either ORC, Cdc6, or Cdt1 with 200 nM CDK1/CycA in the presence and absence of 5 mM MgOAc and 1 mM ATP in Protein Buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM KGlutamate, 10% glycerol, 1 mM BME). The phosphorylation reactions were incubated for 60 mins at room temperature and then, to set up the depletion assay, the reactions were mixed with dsDNA and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The final depletion assay reaction conditions include 500 nM initiator, 125 nM CDK1/CycA, 2.5 mM MgOAc, 500 nM ATP, and 500 nM dsDNA in Assay Buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM KGlutamate, 10% glycerol, 1 mM BME). After incubation, the samples were processed as previously described, assaying protein depletion by SDS-PAGE analysis and Silver staining. For assaying the effect of phosphorylation by fluorescence microscopy, protein concentrations were scaled up 4-fold for the phosphorylation reaction (4 µM ORC and 0.8 µM CDK1/CycA); all other reaction conditions are as described. Subsequently, the phosphorylation reactions were diluted 1:1 with equimolar Cy5-dsDNA in Assay Buffer, incubated for 2 min, and 7 µL were spotted on a glass slide, covered with a glass coverslip, and imaged as described previously.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank past and present members of the Berger and Botchan labs for helpful discussion and advice.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A new class of disordered elements controls DNA replication through initiator self-assembly&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Stephen Bell as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Parker et al. convincingly demonstrates that the proteins required for metazoan origin licensing can phase separate in vitro in a DNA-dependent manner and when present together they phase separate into the same droplets. Interestingly, the Mcm2-7 helicase that drives all DNA unwinding at eukaryotic replication forks can only partition into the so formed droplets if all three of the other proteins required for origin licensing are present. This implies that droplet formation is important for Mcm2-7 recruitment. In addition, the authors observe Orc1 foci in vivo which depends on the protein's disordered region as does phase separation in vitro, thus connecting their biochemical studies with physiology. The authors also identify intrinsic-disordered regions required for this phase separation and find that they have a shared composition. Interestingly, the authors find that cyclin-dependent kinase activation negatively regulates phase separation in vitro Even though the in vivo data is sparse, the in vitro experiments carried out are very convincing and the manuscript is well written. Taken together, the authors shows, for the first time, that phase separation plays a role in DNA replication which can explain some previously made observations. This constitutes a new aspect of DNA replication and integrates well with current knowledge.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Throughout the in vitro experiments, a 60 bp dsDNA is used. The authors should explain why they picked this sequence specifically and include additional experiments showing whether the sequence or length of the added DNA impacts phase separation by ORC, Cdc6 or Cdt1. Whether sequence is important or not, the authors should discuss the implications of these findings with regard to their model.</p><p>2) The authors claim that Orc1 association with chormatin was fully abolished when its IDR is deleted. However, the images shown suggest a residual, albeit weaker, binding during telophase. Which images have been used to generate Figure 5I? Anaphase images? Is the result the same when telophase images are used?</p><p>3) In the Discussion, the authors state &quot;The present work establishes […] that DNA replication […] is regulated by macromolecular phase separation.&quot; While the authors show that ORC localization is altered by the IDR, while likely, more experiments would be necessary to demonstrate that DNA replication as a whole is regulated. The authors should tone this statement down or provide more evidence to support this conclusion.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>1) The authors provide an appropriately nuanced discussion of the meaning of chromatin association of ORC versus the DNA binding required for helicase loading. One suggestion to improve this discussion (and that will be interesting to explore experimentally in the future) is the role of naked versus nucleosomal DNA in driving these phase transitions. Metazoan ORC is thought to localize to nucleosome-depleted DNA and, if naked DNA versus nucleosomal DNA has different abilities to drive phase transitions, it seems possible that the authors' observations might help to explain a preference for non-nucleosomal DNA for ORC DNA binding.</p><p>2) Could these same LLPS possibly be used for the entire DNA replication process?

This factor is essential to replication from yeast to human.

However, in their gel shift assay they clearly measure how much DNA is necessary to induces phase separation of Cdt1 rather than the affinity of Cdt1 to DNA. This is likely true for the fluorescence polarisation assay as well (which the authors incorrectly call fluorescence anisotropy in the text). The authors should clearly state / discuss this point to avoid confusion. In addition, it would be interesting to see if Cdt1 can also interact with DNA outside the context of phase separation and how strong this interaction is.</p><p>7) Figure 2E &amp; G, 3E, 4F &amp; G and others: the authors should help the readers understanding the figures by putting more labels. E.g. in Figure 2E, write DNA next to - +. And in Figure 4F, write something like α-FLAG next to the Western blot.</p><p>8) Figure 2F: the x-axis label is misleading, especially when compared to Figure 2G. Not only is the Cdt1 concentration varied but the DNA concentration and DNA are also present. The reader has to pay a lot of attention to the text to understand this.</p><p>9) The authors mention the use of DISOPRED too late in the text.

The authors should explain why they picked this sequence specifically and include additional experiments showing whether the sequence or length of the added DNA impacts phase separation by ORC, Cdc6 or Cdt1. Whether sequence is important or not, the authors should discuss the implications of these findings with regard to their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up this point. Since metazoan origins and initiator DNA-binding profiles are not sequence specific, we began our studies with a random dsDNA oligonucleotide. We chose 60 bp as a starting point because prior studies have shown that this length is modestly greater than is required for the ATP-dependent binding of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORC (Bleichert et al., 2018) and for OCCM formation (e.g., Yuan et al., 2017). We have now clarified in the main text that this sequence was randomly generated and have included additional experiments examining the effect of both DNA sequence and length on initiator phase separation as the reviewers request (Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). We find that a variety of DNA sequences can induce ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 phase separation to an equal extent. Additionally, we show that optimal phase separation of ORC and Cdt1 requires dsDNA oligonucleotides longer than 25 bp. By comparison, Cdc6 is more sensitive to DNA length, showing weak phase separation with oligonucleotides 25-60 base pairs in length, but more robust LPC formation in the presence of plasmid DNA. These new data are now discussed within the context of our model for initiator DNA/chromatin-binding and with respect to what is known regarding ORC’s preference for nucleosome free chromatin regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors claim that Orc1 association with chormatin was fully abolished when its IDR is deleted. However, the images shown suggest a residual, albeit weaker, binding during telophase. Which images have been used to generate Figure 5I? Anaphase images? Is the result the same when telophase images are used?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there does appear to be a residual amount of ORC<sup>ΔOrc1IDR</sup> present on chromosomes. However, the quantitation shown in Figure 5I reports on the telophase levels of Orc1, when maximum loading is observed in both S2 cells and embryos. To further clarify ORC dynamics at different stages in mitosis, and to aid in the interpretation of these data, we have now included quantitative time course analysis of the recruitment of ORC to chromosomes in mitotic S2 cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). These data reveal that although ORC, ORC<sup>ΔBAH</sup>, and ORC<sup>WalkerAB</sup> are loaded onto chromosomes beginning in anaphase, the levels of ORC<sup>ΔOrc1IDR</sup> actually decrease in anaphase and then recover in telophase to the level observed in metaphase. This recovery to background levels accounts for the residual binding that is seen in the images. In addition to these data, we have also included a better explanation of what and how quantitation was done in both the figure legend and Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the Discussion, the authors state &quot;The present work establishes […] that DNA replication […] is regulated by macromolecular phase separation.&quot; While the authors show that ORC localization is altered by the IDR, while likely, more experiments would be necessary to demonstrate that DNA replication as a whole is regulated. The authors should tone this statement down or provide more evidence to support this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this statement is a bit overly strong, and that additional experimentation is needed to unequivocally demonstrate a role of phase separation in metazoan DNA replication. We have revised the sentence to read:</p><p>“The present work provides strong evidence that DNA replication, a cellular pathway vital to cell proliferation, is impacted by phase separation-promoting elements.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p><p>1) The authors provide an appropriately nuanced discussion of the meaning of chromatin association of ORC versus the DNA binding required for helicase loading.

We have now substantially expanded our discussion of ORC origin selection to speculate on how our observations of ORC phase separation on naked DNA might relate to the in vivo preference of ORC for nucleosome free regions, and to point out that it will be necessary to conduct future studies of LPC formation in the context of single nucleosomes and chromatin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Could these same LLPS possibly be used for the entire DNA replication process? Or do the authors have reason to believe that they exist only in G1, or only for the origin licensing process?</p></disp-quote><p>We again agree that this is a very interesting issue. We initially refrained from commenting on the point in our original draft, as we did not want to be overly speculative. However, it has not escaped our notice that many proteins required for metazoan DNA replication have intrinsically disordered regions (including, as noted in the next point, Mcm10). Given the selectivity we observe for initiator condensates, we think it plausible that the phase formed by the Pre-RC machinery may represent an evolving structure that, through the fluid exchange of its resident components, drives the replication reaction and culminates in the spatial coordination of multiple active replication forks that could serve as replication factories. We have taken the reviewers’ suggestion/comment as a license for speculation and have now added the following paragraph in the Discussion:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“From a parallel perspective, it is interesting to note that the visualization of both newly-replicated DNA (Kennedy et al., 2000; Xiang et al., 2018) and proteins present at the replication fork during S-phase (Chagin et al., 2016) often reveals a non-uniform organization within the nucleus, a feature that has led to the proposal that replisomes may be grouped into ‘factories’ (Cook, 1999). […] Given the selectivity we observe for initiator condensates (Figure 4), it is possible that the phase formed by Pre-RC machineries may represent an evolving structure that, through the fluid exchange of its resident components facilitated by IDR-IDR interactions, drives replication forward, culminating in the spatial co-localization of multiple active forks within a nuclear zone.”</p><p>3) The Mcm10 protein appears to travel with forks, and although not noted to this reviewer's knowledge, it appears to have what appears to be long disordered regions that border both sides the central globular DNA binding region.

Perhaps the authors would like to comment on possible extension of the PreRC LLPS to possible replication within this particle?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree – please see above response to the point above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Phosphorylation inhibits phase separation of ORC especially. Yeast also control ORC function by CDK phosphorylation, but one might assume this is a distinct process since phase separation doesn't apparently occur in budding yeast. A brief comment on this different mechanism but related use of CDK to inhibit ORC function would be helpful for general readership.</p><p>This is a very pertinent point – thank you for bringing it up. The following comment has been added in the Discussion to clarify how the differing abilities of yeast and metazoan ORC to phase separate might influence our understanding of phospho-regulation mechanisms: “Budding yeast ORC is also negatively regulated by CDK-dependent phosphorylation (Nguyen et al., 2001), although this regulation likely occurs through a distinct mechanism, as we did not observe phase separation of ScORC (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E).”</p><p>5) Possibly too speculative – but could there be a correlation between the facts that Sc ORC1 does not phase separate, but that S.c. is unique in ability to recognize specific origin sequences, while higher organisms might utilize phase separation elements instead?</p><p>The reviewers’ comment zeroes in on a fundamental question: what is the biological rationale for evolving the use of phase separation in DNA replication? We agree that one possible explanation is that as multi-cellularity evolved, LPC formation might serve to offset a loss of specific origin sequences, which could be cumbersome to cells with large genomes and more complex and malleable transcriptional profiles. However, we confess that we haven’t found a reasonable way to discuss the issue that doesn’t build on a house of cards. A key line of inquiry that will be important to answering the “why” of initiator phase separation will be to establish when in evolution phase separation appeared – i.e., is it a metazoan-specific phenomenon, or can some “simpler” eukaryotic species (such as <italic>S. pombe</italic>) also utilize such a mechanism? For now, we would prefer not to delve into this point in the present manuscript.</p><p>6) In Figure 1C &amp; D, the authors measure the K<sub>d</sub> of Cdt1 binding to DNA. However, in their gel shift assay they clearly measure how much DNA is necessary to induces phase separation of Cdt1 rather than the affinity of Cdt1 to DNA.

The authors should clearly state / discuss this point to avoid confusion. In addition, it would be interesting to see if Cdt1 can also interact with DNA outside the context of phase separation and how strong this interaction is.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers bring up an interesting experimental issue: to what extent are classic binding protein-DNA equilibria altered by phase separation? These two phenomena could be partly disentangled by using separation of function mutants. We currently lack point mutants for the proteins under investigation here that might be used in such a capacity (one such set might be phospho-mimetic mutants in CDK sites within the IDRs). We might also try to conduct EMSA studies in the presence of hexanediol, which is commonly used to disrupt LPC formation. At the present, systematically conducting such efforts is beyond the scope of the present work. We do now include an additional competition experiment that tests the equilibrium of the system and hence whether the K<sub>d</sub>’s we determined are reasonable approximations (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). These results suggest that equilibrium is maintained and that the calculated K<sub>d</sub>’s are reasonable starting approximations. Nonetheless, we have relabeled all K<sub>d</sub>’s as apparent K<sub>d</sub>’s or “K<sub>d</sub>, app” to reflect the ambiguity of this point.</p><p>As a final response to this point, we edited the main text to correctly read “fluorescence polarization”, not “anisotropy”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 2E &amp; G, 3E, 4F &amp; G and others: the authors should help the readers understanding the figures by putting more labels.
