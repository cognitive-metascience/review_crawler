recognition of diseased cells. The responsiveness of NK cells to acute stimulation is dynamically tuned by steady-state receptor-ligand interactions of an NK cell with its cellular environment. Here, we demonstrate that in healthy WT mice the NK activating receptor NKG2D is engaged in vivo by one of its ligands, RAE-1ε, which is expressed constitutively by lymph node endothelial cells and highly induced on tumor-associated endothelium. This interaction causes internalization of NKG2D from the NK cell surface and transmits an NK-intrinsic signal that desensitizes NK cell responses globally to acute stimulation, resulting in impaired NK antitumor responses in vivo.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30881.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>White blood cells called “natural killer cells” are part of the first line of immune defense. Often called NK cells for short, one job of these cells is to help prevent cancer by killing tumor cells. If an NK cell spots a tumor cell, it must become energized so that it can deliver the killing blow, which comes in the form of a packet of cell-killing “cytotoxic” granules. Yet tumor cells look very similar to healthy cells, and NK cells must be able to tell the difference to be effective.</p><p>Molecules on the outer surface of the NK cell control how the cell recognizes tumors, and deliver the signals the cell needs to become energized. One of these surface molecules is called NKG2D. It interacts with “partner” molecules found on the surface of cancer cells and tells the NK cell to attack. These partner molecules are not usually found on healthy cells, helping the immune system to tell the difference.</p><p>After NKG2D interacts with its partner molecules, it moves inside the NK cell. This makes the cell less able to become energized. If the NK cells do not encounter any partner molecules in healthy mice, blocking the interactions should have no effect on NKG2D levels. But now, Thompson et al. find that blocking one of these interactions increased the levels of NKG2D on the surface of NK cells in healthy mice. Further experiments revealed that NK cells in mice constantly encounter an NKG2D partner molecule called RAE-1ε.</p><p>A search for the source of RAE-1ε in healthy mice pointed to blood vessels inside the lymph nodes. NK cells pass through theses organs as part of their normal path around the body. Thompson et al. also saw that NK cells from healthy mice were less responsive than NK cells from mutant mice that lacked RAE-1ε. As a result of their encounters with RAE-1ε in healthy mice, the NK cells were less able to kill tumor cells. Blocking the interaction between NKG2D and RAE-1ε in mice re-energized their NK cells. More cells were able to enter tumors in these mice and the cells became better at killing tumors.</p><p>Together these findings increase the current understanding of the biological processes that control NK cells. Further research may lead to new treatments for diseases like cancer. But first, scientists need to find out whether NK cells behave in the same way in humans as they do in mice. If so, developing ways to block the interaction could re-energize human NK cells to better kill cancer cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Natural killer cells</kwd><kwd>endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>NKG2D</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA093678</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raulet</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innate Pharma, SAS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raulet</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 CA203262</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Thornton W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Antitumor (natural killer) NK cell responses are negatively regulated by interactions between NK cells and endogenous NKG2D ligands constitutively expressed on lymph node endothelial cells and super-induced on tumor-associated endothelium.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Natural Killer (NK) cells are key effectors in the immune response to pathogens and tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vivier et al., 2008</xref>). NK cells respond to infected or transformed cells by releasing cytotoxic granules and anti-tumor cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFNγ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vivier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marcus et al., 2014</xref>). NK cells recognize unhealthy cells using an array of cell surface receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vivier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marcus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moretta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morvan and Lanier, 2016</xref>). These receptors transmit activating or inhibitory signals upon binding cognate ligands on the target cell, and the net balance of these signals dictates whether the NK cell response is triggered. Tumors are often recognized and killed by NK cells in vitro and in vivo because cancer cells tend to upregulate ligands for activating receptors and downregulate ligands for inhibitory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Waldhauer and Steinle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marcus et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The responsiveness of NK cells to a given stimulus is dynamically tuned by the steady-state receptor-ligand interactions experienced by the NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joncker and Raulet, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brodin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joncker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joncker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shifrin et al., 2014</xref>). Increases in steady-state stimulation cause NK cells to compensate by adopting a less responsive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joncker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kadri et al., 2016</xref>) – a process that will be referred to here as ‘desensitization’ – whereas NK cells receiving lower steady-state levels of stimulation exhibit a state of heightened responsiveness to acute activation. For example, the Ly49 family of inhibitory receptors on NK cells are known to engage host MHC I molecules at steady state, and this interaction is important for regulating NK responsiveness. Mice lacking MHC I molecules or inhibitory Ly49 receptors show dramatically weaker NK responses to a wide variety of acute stimulatory signals in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernandez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anfossi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brodin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joncker et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Desensitization may prevent NK cells from effecting autoreactivity and enable them to adjust to different tissue milieus, and mature NK cells can alter their responsiveness upon encountering a new MHC I environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joncker and Raulet, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elliott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joncker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Narni-Mancinelli et al., 2013</xref>). These dynamics are relevant for antitumor responses, as NK cells in WT mice become desensitized when they infiltrate MHC I-deficient tumors but not when they infiltrate matched MHC-I-positive tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardolino et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, humans receiving HLA-mismatched bone marrow show altered NK responses that match the trends described in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boudreau et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It is presumed that steady-state interactions between MHC I and Ly49 receptors prevent NK desensitization by inhibiting steady-state signals from activating receptors. Indeed, transgenic overexpression of NK activating ligands causes NK desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oppenheim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wiemann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun and Lanier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tripathy et al., 2008</xref>), but the endogenous receptor-ligand systems that transmit these activating signals to NK cells in healthy WT animals remain incompletely defined. In humans, activating KIR appear to be one such endogenous signal involved in steady-state NK cell tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fauriat et al., 2010</xref>). In mice, the activating receptor NKp46 may contribute to NK desensitization because NKp46-KO animals showed heightened NK responses to stimulation in one report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Narni-Mancinelli et al., 2012</xref>), although not in another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sheppard et al., 2013</xref>). SLAM receptors are also reported to regulate NK responsiveness in some contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Veillette, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Very little is understood about which host cell types are responsible for engaging NK cells to regulate responsiveness. A recent study using β2M-KO bone marrow chimeras suggested that MHC-I-deficient nonhematopoietic cells may play a larger role than MHC-I-deficient hematopoietic cells in desensitizing NK cells, although both may participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shifrin et al., 2016</xref>). In humans, different studies have implicated HLA molecules on hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haas et al., 2011</xref>) and nonhematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooley et al., 2011</xref>) as being critical for tuning. Clearly, much remains to be learned about these processes. Elucidating the receptor-ligand and cellular systems that regulate NK responses in homeostasis and cancer may suggest novel therapeutic strategies.</p><p>NKG2D is a C-type lectin-like activating receptor expressed by all NK cells and subsets of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raulet, 2003</xref>). NKG2D binds a diverse array of MHC-like proteins. In mice, these include the RAE-1 family (with α, β, γ, δ, and ε isoforms), the H60 family (a, b, c), and MULT1. Human NKG2D ligands include the ULBP family (with isoforms 1–6) and the MICA and MICB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raulet et al., 2013</xref>). Acute NKG2D engagement transmits powerful activating signals through the adaptor molecules DAP10 and DAP12 to drive cytotoxicity and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raulet, 2003</xref>). NKG2D ligands are thought to be absent from most healthy cells but can be induced consequent to DNA damage, oncogene signaling, and other stresses associated with cancer and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raulet et al., 2013</xref>). Many tumor cells express NKG2D ligands. In tumor transplant and spontaneous cancer models, expression of NKG2D ligand(s) on tumor cells triggers NK activation and protects the host from cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diefenbach et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guerra et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, several recent studies have shown that NK cells in NKG2D-KO mice are hyper-responsive to stimulation when triggered through other activating receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zafirova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sheppard et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, tumor cells engineered to secrete soluble monomeric NKG2D ligands – which block but do not activate NKG2D – increase the responsiveness of tumor-infiltrating NK cells and enhance tumor rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2015</xref>). These data suggest that NKG2D may contribute to NK desensitization at steady state or in tumors.</p><p>In this report, we provide important new findings concerning the cells and molecules that engage NK cells and regulate NK responsiveness, and we clarify the pleiotropic effect of NKG2D on NK activity. Unexpectedly, we show a steady-state interaction between NKG2D and one of its ligands, RAE-1ε, in healthy WT mice. Using bone marrow chimera experiments, we show that non-hematopoietic cells are the primary source of endogenous RAE-1ε. Endothelial cells in lymph nodes were found to be constitutively express RAE-1ε, and RAE-1ε was found to be super-induced on tumor-associated vasculature in transplant and autochthonous cancer models. Importantly, we demonstrate that this interaction between NKG2D and endogenous RAE-1ε desensitizes NK cells and impairs antitumor NK responses and tumor rejection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NKG2D is constitutively engaged by endogenous RAE-1ε</title><p>Cell surface NKG2D ligand expression is usually considered a hallmark of unhealthy cells, but expression on the surface of normal cells in healthy animals has not been exhaustively surveyed in vivo. NKG2D is known to be internalized upon ligand engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lanier, 2015</xref>), so we reasoned that if NKG2D ligands are expressed and interact with NKG2D in healthy WT mice, antibody blockade of the relevant ligand(s) should result in increased levels of NKG2D on the surface of NK cells. Adult C57BL/6 (B6) mice were injected with confirmed blocking antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) specific for NKG2D ligands RAE-1δ, RAE-1ε, or MULT1. NKG2D levels on NK cells were analyzed by flow cytometry 48 hr post-injection. In vivo blockade of RAE-1ε, but not RAE-1δ or MULT1, substantially increased NKG2D surface levels on NK cells in blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), lymph nodes, and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). NKG2D elevation after RAE-1ε blockade occurred as early as 12 hr after antibody injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We subsequently analyzed NKG2D surface levels in RAE-1-KO mice, which contain frameshift mutations (induced by CRISPR/Cas9) in the genes for both RAE-1ε and RAE-1δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2015</xref>). In healthy, unmanipulated animals, NK cells in RAE-1-KO mice showed substantially higher cell surface NKG2D levels than WT controls in all compartments tested, including blood, spleen, lymph nodes, and peritoneal wash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Blocking RAE-1ε in WT mice increased NKG2D to levels comparable to RAE-1-KO mice at steady state, whereas anti-RAE-1ε had no effect on NKG2D levels in RAE-1-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, blockade of RAE-1ε in combination with RAE-1δ in WT mice showed no additional effect on NKG2D levels compared with blocking RAE-1ε alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30881.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NKG2D is engaged and internalized by constitutive interactions with endogenous RAE-1ε in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) NKG2D surface levels measured by flow cytometry of blood NK cells 48 hr after injection of blocking antibody specific for the indicated NKG2D ligand.

We used a standard 5 hr responsiveness assay in which cells were stimulated by plate-bound antibodies that crosslink activating NK receptors, followed by flow cytometry for degranulation (marked by CD107a cell surface presentation) and intracellular IFNγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joncker et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2010</xref>). As is typical with this assay, stimulation through the activating receptor NKp46 triggered robust NK cell degranulation and IFNγ production from WT splenic NK cells, and a significantly greater percentage of NK cells from RAE-1-KO mice responded to stimulation compared with WT NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). NK cells from RAE-1-KO mice also showed elevated responses when stimulated with platebound antibodies that ligate a distinct activating receptor, NK1.1, or that ligate NKG2D itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

We used a radiation dose (600 Gy + 500 Gy split dose) that reliably led to replacement of &gt;99% of cells in the hematopoietic compartment, although we cannot exclude the presence of some radio-resistant bone-marrow-derived cells in the chimeras. After irradiation, WT or RAE-1-KO mice were reconstituted with bone marrow from WT or RAE-1-KO mice, and NKG2D cell surface levels were analyzed on NK cells 8 weeks after reconstitution. As expected, KO → KO chimeras showed substantially higher NKG2D levels compared with WT → WT controls (Figure 4A) (Figure 4-figure supplement 1A). Chimeric mice in which RAE-1ε was present only in hematopoietic cells (WT → KO) showed high NKG2D levels comparable to KO → KO chimeras, indicating that hematopoietic RAE-1ε does not play a major role in engaging NKG2D, although there was a reproducibly small effect in most experiments that failed to reach significance.

Therefore, we used flow cytometry to analyze RAE-1ε on nonhematopoietic cells in various organs encountered by circulating NK cells. Like other lymphocytes, circulating NK cells navigate to and from blood and secondary lymphoid organs. Lymph nodes are central hubs for circulating lymphocytes and have crucial regulatory roles. After gentle enzymatic dissociation of lymph nodes, four populations of nonhematopoietic (CD45-neg) lymph node cells can be delineated by expression of the adhesion molecule CD31 and the transmembrane protein Podoplanin (PDPN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Turley et al., 2010</xref>).

Whereas DN cells and FRCs showed little to no RAE-1ε, we found substantial RAE-1ε expression on BECs and LECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This was not due to promiscuous binding of the RAE-1ε antibody, because the staining completely disappeared in RAE-1-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, we examined whether RAE-1ε was expressed on endothelial cells in other tissues.

B16 tumors can be injected intravenously (metastasis model) or subcutaneously (solid tumor model).

Consistent with our hypothesis, NKG2D-KO mice showed reduced and delayed mortality compared with matched WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Importantly, NK depletion resulted in dramatically accelerated mortality in WT and NKG2D-KO mice, eliminating the protective effect of NKG2D deficiency.

We also found that Rag2/NKG2D double knockout mice resisted B16 tumors better than Rag2-KO mice, indicating that T cells (and B cells) are not required for the protective effect of NKG2D deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A subsequent experiment on the Rag2-KO background showed that treatment of NKG2D-WT mice with anti-NKG2D antibody in vivo starting the day before tumor cell implantation resulted in enhanced control of B16 tumors comparable to the NKG2D-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We then turned to the RMA-S lymphoma transplant tumor model, which is targeted in vivo by NK cells through ‘missing self’ recognition but also does not express NKG2D ligands. NKG2D-KO mice showed better control of subcutaneous RMA-S tumors than did their WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These data indicate that NKG2D expression mitigates in vivo NK responses to tumors that lack NKG2D ligands, and that this desensitizing effect is reversed by acute antibody blockade of NKG2D.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30881.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Endogenous RAE-1ε - NKG2D interactions limit NK responses to tumors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) WT or NKG2D-KO mice (n = 29–30) were challenged with 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> B16 cells i.v. and monitored for morbidity.

MULT1 is a high-affinity NKG2D ligand that stimulates a strong acute NK cell response that enhances tumor rejection in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Despite the NK hyper-responsiveness in NKG2D-deficient animals, NKG2D-KO NK cells cannot recognize MULT1, and the growth of B16-MULT1 tumors was accelerated in NKG2D-KO mice compared with WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These data are consistent with previous studies showing a strong protective role for NKG2D interactions with tumor NKG2D ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cerwenka et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diefenbach et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guerra et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Because we had found that RAE-1-KO mice have elevated NKG2D surface levels and enhanced NK responses, we hypothesized that RAE-1-KO mice would show enhanced protection from NKG2D ligand-positive tumors. Indeed, RAE-1-KO mice challenged with B16-MULT1 tumors exhibited superior tumor rejection compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We then turned to a transplant tumor model with endogenous NKG2D ligand expression, the TRAMP-C2 model of prostate adenocarcinoma. TRAMP-C2 cells express RAE-1δ and RAE-1ε and are sensitive to NK cells, and this sensitivity is partly dependent on NKG2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jamieson et al., 2002</xref>).

We show that the activating receptor NKG2D is engaged by endogenous RAE-1ε in healthy WT mice, causing constitutive downregulation of NKG2D from the NK cell surface, and leads to an intrinsic global desensitization of NK cells to acute stimulation. These effects were evidenced by an increase in the responsiveness of NK cells from NKG2D-KO or RAE-1-KO mice to stimulation through diverse activating receptors. Antibody blockade of RAE-1ε in normal mice also resulted in elevated NKG2D levels and increased NK cell responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Moreover, preventing NKG2D interactions with host RAE-1ε enhanced NK cell antitumor responses in vivo. Bone marrow chimera experiments identified nonhematopoietic cells as the dominant source of RAE-1ε, and endothelial cells were found to express RAE-1ε constitutively in lymph nodes. In tumors, RAE-1ε expression on tumor-associated endothelial cells was super-induced compared to endothelial cells in lymph nodes. These data support a model in which endothelial RAE-1ε interacts with NKG2D to desensitize NK cells and diminish antitumor NK responses.</p><p>NK cell hyper-responsiveness in NKG2D-KO mice has been reported previously by several groups including ours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zafirova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sheppard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2015</xref>), although the trend of increased responsiveness did not reach statistical significance in our original characterization of the NKG2D-KO mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guerra et al., 2008</xref>). The data presented in this study build on those findings by showing that NKG2D engagement of endogenous ligands desensitizes NK cells, reducing antitumor responses. At the same time, our results support the classical view that NKG2D can participate in immune surveillance of cancer by recognizing NKG2D ligands on tumor cells to induce NK cell activation and tumor cell killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diefenbach et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cerwenka et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diefenbach et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jamieson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guerra et al., 2008</xref>). Hence, NKG2D confers opposing effects, both promoting killing of tumor cells that express NKG2D ligands, and desensitizing NK cells through interactions with host ligands.</p><p>We propose that the net outcome of these opposing effects of NKG2D depends on the complement of NK-activating ligands that a given tumor cell expresses, among other factors. For tumor cells that express abundant NKG2D ligands, the ability of NKG2D to promote acute activation against the tumor can outweigh the opposing desensitizing interactions with host cells. In this circumstance, loss of NKG2D results in reduced tumor killing, as exemplified by the observation that NKG2D-deficient mice show reduced killing/rejection of B16-MULT1 tumors and YAC-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jamieson et al., 2002</xref>). We speculate that this situation also applies to previous findings that NKG2D-KO mice were defective in immune surveillance of spontaneous tumors that express NKG2D ligands, such as prostate adenocarcinomas in TRAMP mice and lymphomas in Eu-Myc mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guerra et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, for tumor cells that express abundant other NK-activating ligands, and either do not express NKG2D ligands (e.g. RMA-S and B16 cells), or depend little on NKG2D ligands for NK killing, the global desensitization of NK cells caused by NKG2D interactions with host ligands is predicted to exert a dominant effect. In this situation, NKG2D deficiency results in enhanced tumor killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study reported that in a spontaneous model of hepatocellular carcinoma, NKG2D-KO mice exhibited a reduced tumor incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sheppard et al., 2017</xref>). We speculate that NKG2D-mediated desensitization may be dominant in that model, though the authors offered an alternative explanation for their findings. It is also possible that some tumor environments contain signals that reverse NKG2D-mediated desensitization while preserving NKG2D-mediated activation, or vice versa. Thus, the net effect of NKG2D will likely depend on the activating and inhibitory ligands tumor cells express, as well as the context of the tumor microenvironment.</p><p>Although endogenous RAE-1ε played a significant role in NK desensitization, it does not completely account for the desensitizing activity of NKG2D, based on the finding that NK cells attained higher responsiveness in NKG2D-KO mice than in RAE-1-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). While our data clearly support a model in which endogenous interactions of NKG2D with RAE-1ε cause steady-state NK cell desensitization, we do not rule out other potential mechanisms contributing to hyper-responsiveness of NKG2D-KO cells -- such as interactions of NKG2D with other ligands at steady state, or ‘tonic’ signaling through NKG2D, at steady state or during NK development.</p><p>Perhaps the most surprising finding in this report is the expression and functional relevance of RAE-1ε on endothelial cells. NKG2D ligand expression in adult mice has been thought largely restricted to cells undergoing certain stress responses associated with oncogenesis or infection, but here we show that blood endothelial cells and lymphoid endothelial cells in secondary lymphoid organs of healthy animals express RAE-1ε at steady-state. It was striking that, in the same mice, endothelium in several other tissues was completely negative for RAE-1ε. These findings suggest that the lymphoid tissue environment imparts specific signals that upregulate RAE-1ε on associated endothelial cells. Specific expression on endothelial cells in secondary lymphoid tissue further suggests that the system may be designed to desensitize NK cells that traverse this tissue. It is important to note that our data clearly identify non-hematopoietic cells as the dominant source of RAE-1ε-mediated NK desensitization, but we cannot conclusively establish endothelial cells as relevant desensitizing compartment without an endothelial-specific RAE-1ε-KO mouse. We were also surprised to find that resident liver NK cells (CD49a-neg CD49b+) were engaged by host RAE-1ε. We do not know the cellular source of RAE-1ε responsible for engaging these NK cells, as we detected little to no RAE-1ε in cell suspensions from liver. We speculate that resident liver NK cells might traffic to distinct anatomical structures, perhaps liver-specific lymphoid tissue, that might contain RAE-1ε-expressing cells.</p><p>We found especially high levels of RAE-1ε on endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment. Notably, RAE-1ε was expressed on vasculature in all tumor models tested, including transplant models of melanoma, lymphoma, prostate cancer, and the genetically engineered KP model of autochthonous sarcoma. In all cases, levels of tumor-associated endothelial RAE-1ε were even greater than on endothelial cells in draining and non-draining lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We can only speculate as to the mechanism of RAE-1ε induction on these cells. Vasculature in the tumor microenvironment is extremely dynamic, characterized by extensive angiogenesis. RAE-1 expression has been linked to high levels of cellular proliferation in development and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jung et al., 2012</xref>). Perhaps a similar mechanism is responsible for the super-induced expression of RAE-1ε on neovasculature in tumors. Steady-state RAE-1ε expression on lymph node endothelial cells, but not endothelium in normal non-lymphoid tissues, is more surprising. Clearly, more work is required to fully understand NKG2D ligand regulation in these cells.</p><p>Endothelial cells are sometimes thought of as passive circulatory conduits. Our data and other studies clearly paint a more complex picture. Endothelial cells have recently been shown to produce immunomodulatory cytokines, and lymph node endothelial cells can tolerize peripheral T cells by presenting self MHC – peptide complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rouhani et al., 2015</xref>). The data in our study add to the emerging role of endothelial cells as active regulators in the immune response by suggesting that endothelial cells regulate NK cell activity. In a way, this seems logical, given the inevitable and intimate contact a lymphocyte must make with the vasculature upon entering and exiting lymph nodes and other organs during homeostatic circulation or inflammation. Because multiple NK cell receptors are known to regulate NK cell responsiveness, we are intrigued by the possibility that endothelial cells may also regulate NK cell activity through other receptor-ligand systems. In addition, it is interesting to speculate whether NK cells have effects on the endothelial cell biology, through NKG2D-RAE-1ε or other mechanisms.</p><p>We wonder if endothelial-RAE-1ε-mediated NK desensitization is important in pathological contexts other than cancer. It is tempting to speculate that signals from vasculature may help inform infiltrating NK cells, or other lymphocytes, about the inflammatory state of the tissue. Perhaps NKG2D ligand expression on endothelial cells is advantageous for preventing autoreactivity and/or limiting inflammatory signals during the resolution of infection. Perhaps, tumor microenvironments mimic other physiological states, such as wound healing, for which RAE-1ε induction and NK desensitization is beneficial to the host. Endothelial RAE-1ε clearly regulates NK responses to tumors, but the relevant contribution of lymph node vs. tumor endothelium remains unclear. It is plausible that both environments control NK desensitization. We also speculate that physiological situations may arise in which NK cells transit from a desensitizing environment to one that reverses desensitization. Our data show that at steady state, NKG2D internalization is almost completely reversed as early as 12 hr after antibody blockade of RAE-1ε, and that NK function can be elevated at 48 hr after blockade. Further study is needed to understand how physiological changes in the host’s desensitizing environment might regulate the kinetics of the NK response.</p><p>The differences in intracellular signaling mechanisms that culminate in NKG2D-mediated acute NK activation versus desensitization remain poorly understood. An attractive hypothesis is that receptor engagement in the absence of inflammatory signals results in initial activation followed by desensitization; if inflammatory cytokines are present, as in an infection, the activation response might be sustained. This model fits with evidence that inflammatory cytokines – such as IL-12/1 L-18 or IL-2/15 family cytokines – sustain or reinvigorate desensitized NK responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardolino et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, activation vs. desensitization may be modulated by cell surface signals on the surface of the target cell. It might also be considered that different qualities of the encounter with ligand could result in divergent outcomes. For example, differences in the duration and/or frequency of the receptor-ligand interactions could contribute to opposing outcomes, or perhaps the relative affinity of a given ligand for its receptor, coupled with amount of ligand expressed, could potentially affect the signaling outcome. These and other molecular mechanisms might determine why interactions with some cells but not others results in desensitization.</p><p>It is notable that a previous study did find a role for desensitization of NK cells by tumors lacking MHC I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardolino et al., 2014</xref>), and tumor cells expressing NKG2D ligands can cause global NK cell desensitization in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coudert et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, transgenic over-expression of NKG2D ligands is associated with NK cell desensitization as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oppenheim et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, endothelial cells may not have unique desensitizing activity per se but rather could have an important role in NK desensitization by virtue of expressing NKG2D ligands (which most healthy cells lack) and/or their unique physiological role in extravasation, intravasation, and circulation. Furthermore, it is possible that the impact of endothelial cell RAE-1 on tumor rejection is to desensitize NK cells before they encounter tumor cells, whereas NKG2D ligands on tumor cells might affect NK cells differently after extravasation; these dynamics may also depend on the inflammatory state of the tumor microenvironment. Clearly, more work is needed to better understand the mechanisms that regulate NK cell activation and desensitization and its relation to tumor rejection.</p><p>Our data may have translational implications. We hypothesize that treatments to disrupt interactions between NK cells and NKG2D ligands on vasculature, while preserving interactions with NKG2D ligands on tumor cells, may have powerful therapeutic benefits. This could be accomplished by antibody blockade of ligands expressed by endothelial cells but not tumors. Understanding the mechanisms supporting endothelial NKG2D ligand expression could also reveal targets for specific pharmacological inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and in vivo procedures</title><p>C57BL/6J mice were bred from mice obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).

Specifically, they found that RAE-1ε, which is constitutively expressed on lymph node endothelial cells, negatively regulates NK cell activity through down-modulation of NKG2D under steady state. Thus, blockade of RAE-1ε by antibodies or lack of RAE-1ε augmented NK cell responses, leading to better tumor control.</p><p>Overall, manuscript is well written, and the experiments are carefully performed to support the authors' concept. The findings in this manuscript provide significant insight into NK cell biology.</p><p>Any more data concerning the mechanism of NK cell activation versus desensitization would be welcomed.</p><p>Though authors clearly showed in vivo tumor growth data, using various models, one missing experiment is in vitro cytotoxicity data.</p><p>Do naïve NK cells from RAE-1ε KO more effectively kill target cells (e.g. YAC-1) than WT NK cells?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Thompson et al. from the Raulet group examines NK cell &quot;desensitization&quot; mediated by NKG2D interactions with its ligands, in particular RAE-1ε. The key conclusions from this work are that NKG2D interaction with its ligands tunes NK cell responsiveness level to stimulation, that RAE-1ε is expressed by lymph node endothelium, and these interactions impact responses at the site of tumors. The manuscript is very well written, but some of the summary/discussion that is included in the Results should be moved to Discussion, and the Introduction should be shortened. Limitations that diminish enthusiasm for the study include discrepancies with previously published data by this group, and the lack of human data to support the translational relevance that the authors claim.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows that blockade of RAE-1ε in vivo increased NKG2D surface expression on NK cells in the blood, spleen and lymph nodes, and that RAE-1ε KO mice have increased NKG2D expression on NK cells form the blood, LN, spleen, and peritoneum. Why was the BM excluded, which is a relevant hematopoietic tissue for NK cells, including recirculation? Similarly, what about liver (both conventional and tissue resident) NK cells?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Formal cytotoxicity experiments against tumor targets are missing. While CD107a is a surrogate for degranulation, there are situations where CD107a is not directly correlated with cytotoxicity. Further, the degranulation differences appear modest, and may not result in differences in killing.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. How do the authors reconcile the data included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A and 3B</xref>, with their previous reported (Guerra et al. Immunity 20108) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, where they saw different results with NKG2D KOs? Perhaps I am missing a key aspect of the functional experiment, but in the prior paper NKG2D-KO NK cells had similar IFN-γ responses as wild type mice to these stimuli? Further, killing appeared decreased (not increased) against C1498 and YAC-1 targets? Similarly, killing of tumor targets should be included in this assay as well.</p><p>The BM chimera data looks very clear and is well presented. The expression of RAE-1ε on various cells in C and D look clear, but are there summary data for reproducibility? There appears to be higher signal in the spleen, and not all cells and tissues in a mouse have been examined. Notably, bone marrow is missing. The authors should temper their conclusions that lymph node endothelial cells are the &quot;primary&quot; endogenous source of RAE-1ε, since experimental data is not shown to support this conclusion. For example, clear data from an endothelial cell specific KO of RAE-1ε would better support such a conclusion.</p><p>4) Overall, more discussion of how their results differ from their prior work and explanations of which conclusion is best supported would strengthen the manuscript. For example, their prior paper indicated that mice with Myc-driven lymphomas occur faster in NKG2D KO mice compared to WT mice. This data seems inconsistent with the data being presented in this manuscript about desensitization, with NKG2D KOs having superior survival after challenge with B16 melanoma?</p><p>5) Data demonstrating this is relevant for human tumors would increase enthusiasm and better support the translational impact of these findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper by Thompson identifies a particular NKG2D ligand in HEV in normal lymph nodes and in tumor vasculature. This ligand is shown do desensitize NK cell reactivity, not only to NKG2D-mediated stimulation but also to other non-related receptors. The results are very clear and shed new important light on how NK cell reactivity is regulated.</p><p>From a basic NK cell education perspective, the data is particularly exciting. One key issue is why NKG2D ligands on endothelial cells, but not on tumor cells, downtune NK cell responsiveness? The authors provide some plausible explanations, such as differences in cytokine milieu and the inflammatory environment, but one alternative possibility that comes to mind, given the pivotal role for MHC class I expression levels in NK cell tuning, is if MHC class I molecules influence the tuning effect of NKG2D ligand in the systems described? Is there a difference in MHC class I expression between HEV in normal LN and in tumors, and between endothelial cells and tumor cells? Have the authors looked at the influence of MHC class I in their system and have they excluded that differences in MHC class I expression levels influence RAE-1ε-mediated tuning in normal HEV, tumor cells and HEV in tumor tissue?</p><p>On the same note, is function tuned differentially by RAE-1ε in NK cells carrying self Ly49 receptors versus NK cells expressing non-self-inhibitory receptors?</p><p>Another question is in which way tuning by RAE-1ε is dynamically regulated? The authors show that NKG2D is upregulated 48 hours after adoptive transfer, a timepoint that fits well with the author's previous notion on retuning by MHC class I in vivo, but a notion of such a long time for retuning has always puzzled me. In order for a retuning effect to be of some use, in my mind, it would need to occur much more rapidly. Our earlier data from DL6 mice suggested a very rapid reversibility of NK cell tolerance (4 hours – but we never tester earlier timepoints) and I wonder if the authors tried to perform a kinetic analysis in particular of earlier timepoints, to determine the time it would take, e.g. after adoptive transfer, before the NK cells retune? If an NK cell that had been retuned (e.g. RAE-ε KO NK cell injected into wt mice) were taken out from the new environment again and cultured in vitro, how long time would it take before NKG2D levels would again rise?</p><p>On a more philosophical note, while it is very nice to see evidence for a tuning interaction between an activating receptor and its ligand in vitro, it is not obvious why this interaction should be restricted to HEV in lymph nodes. The argument that NK cells pass thorough lymph nodes is fine, but they also pass through the spleen (probably to a greater extent) and yet spleen endothelial cells do not seem to tune NK cells in the same way. What would be the reason for this?</p><p>The data also opens up these and many additional new avenues for further research and I wish to congratulate the authors on a very nice discovery.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30881.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers and Reviewing Editor have viewed this manuscript favorably but there are some issues that need attention, specifically:</p><p>1) Provide in vitro cytotoxicity assays to verify the degranulation assays as recommended by two reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this helpful suggestion. We performed standard 4- hour <sup>51</sup>Cr cytotoxicity assays using peritoneal wash cells from WT, RAE-1-KO, and NKG2D-KO mice as effectors against YAC-1 target cells. RAE-1-KO effector cells killed YAC-1 targets significantly more efficiently than WT cells, whereas NKG2D-KO cells killed YAC-1 cells less efficiently than WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We carried out another, related, in vitro experiment in which we directly compared NK responses of WT, RAE-1-KO, and NKG2D-KO cells to stimulation with plate-bound anti-NKG2D antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>): as in the cytotoxicity experiment, there was an elevated response of NK cells from RAE-1-KO mice but not of NK cells from NKG2D KO mice (as they lack the receptor for stimulation).</p><p>These data collectively are related to reviewer 2’s comment #4. The key issue in interpreting the tumor killing/rejection experiments is the extent to which the tumor killing is (1) promoted due to direct targeting of tumor cells by NKG2D vs. (2) diminished by desensitization induced by host NKG2D-RAE-1 interactions. In published studies from our group and others, the killing of tumor cells expressing NKG2D ligands is decreased with NKG2D-KO NK cells as compared to WT NK cells, and we describe the same here for B16-MULT1 and YAC-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, the powerful pro-killing effect of direct targeting of tumor cells by NKG2D outweighs the desensitization resulting from NKG2D-host RAE-1 interactions in these contexts. Thus NKG2D-mediated killing can mediate immunosurveillance. In contrast, for tumors that are killed by NK cells but not directly targeted by NKG2D, the desensitizing effect of NKG2D- host RAE-1 interactions causes impairment of tumor killing. Thus, deletion of host RAE-1 reverses NK desensitization while preserving NKG2D targeting of tumor cells, resulting in substantially better killing/rejection of NKG2D-ligand expressing tumor cells by NK cells in RAE-1 KO mice.</p><p>These issues are now discussed in much greater detail in the Discussion as requested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Expression of NKG2D on NK cells from the BM and liver should be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed these experiments and included them in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. We were surprised that resident liver NK cells are also engaged by host RAE-1 molecules, given that we did not detect RAE-1ε expression in the liver. We first considered the hypothesis that RAE-1ε was present in the bloodstream, e.g., in exosome form, but serum from WT mice failed to downregulate NKG2D on NK cells from RAE-1-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We do not know the source of RAE-1ε responsible for engaging resident liver NK cells; one hypothesis is that resident liver cells traffic to local but anatomically distinct structures containing RAE-1ε -expressing cells, perhaps liver-specific lymphoid tissue.
