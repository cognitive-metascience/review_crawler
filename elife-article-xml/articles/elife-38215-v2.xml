The translation from muscle force to limb movement is mediated by internal joint structures that permit movement in some directions but constrain it in others. Although muscle forces acting against constrained directions will not affect limb movements, such forces can cause excess stresses and strains in joint structures, leading to pain or injury. In this study, we hypothesized that the central nervous system (CNS) chooses muscle activations to avoid excessive joint stresses and strains. We evaluated this hypothesis by examining adaptation strategies after selective paralysis of a muscle acting at the rat’s knee. We show that the CNS compromises between restoration of task performance and regulation of joint stresses and strains. These results have significant implications to our understanding of the neural control of movements, suggesting that common theories emphasizing task performance are insufficient to explain muscle activations during behaviors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38215.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Although most of us will never achieve the grace and dexterity of professional ballerina Misty Copeland, we each make sophisticated, complex movements every day. Even simple movements often involve coordinating many muscles throughout the body. Moreover, because we have so many muscles, there are often multiple ways that we could use them to make the same movement. So which ones do we use, and why?</p><p>Many studies into muscle control focus on how the muscles activate to perform a task like kicking a soccer ball. But muscles do more than just move the limbs; they also act on joints. Contracting a muscle exerts strain on bones and the ligaments that hold joints together. If these strains become excessive, they may cause pain and injury, and over a longer time may lead to arthritis. It would therefore make sense if the nervous system factored in the need to protect joints when turning on muscles.</p><p>The quadriceps are a group of muscles that stretch along the front of the thigh bone and help to straighten the knee. To investigate whether the nervous system selects muscle activations to avoid joint injuries, Alessando et al. studied rats that had one particular quadriceps muscle paralyzed. The easiest way for the rats to adapt to this paralysis would be to increase the activation of a muscle that performs the same role as the paralyzed one, but places more stress on the knee joint. Instead, Alessando et al. found that the rats increase the activation of a muscle that minimizes the stress placed on the knee, even though this made it more difficult for the rats to recover their ability to use the leg in certain tasks.</p><p>The results presented by Alessando et al. may have important implications for physical therapy. Clinicians usually work to restore limb movements so that a task is performed in a way that is similar to how it was done before the injury. But sometimes repairing the damage can change the mechanical properties of the joint – for example, reconstructive surgery may replace a damaged ligament with a graft that has a different strength or stiffness. In those cases, performing movements in the same way as before the surgery could place abnormal stress on the joint. However, much more research is needed before recommendations can be made for how to rehabilitate rats after injury, let alone humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motor control</kwd><kwd>muscle coordination</kwd><kwd>optimal control</kwd><kwd>quadriceps</kwd><kwd>patella</kwd><kwd>joint stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS086973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tresch</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The adaptation strategy used by the nervous system following muscle paralysis restores task performance while minimizing the stresses and strains within a joint.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The question of how the central nervous system (CNS) determines motor commands is usually answered in terms of task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guigon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scott, 2004</xref>): the CNS activates muscles according to how they contribute to task goals such as grasping an object or escaping a predator.

Although muscle actions on internal joint structures have been considered in clinical biomechanics or sports medicine in the context of injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farrokhi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Felson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Konrath et al., 2017</xref>), their more general role in the context of the neural control of movement and how they are balanced with task goals remains poorly understood. We examine these issues in this study, evaluating the hypothesis that the nervous system chooses muscle activations to achieve task performance while minimizing internal joint stresses and strains.</p><p>Evaluating whether the CNS regulates stresses and strains within internal joint structures is challenging, primarily because of the complexity of joint mechanics. Since muscles can only affect task performance by acting through joint structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Herzog et al., 2003</xref>), any manipulation affecting joint structures will usually also affect task performance. For example, damage to a ligament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gutierrez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Needle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Connor et al., 1993</xref>) will alter both the distribution of stresses and strains within the joint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gardinier et al., 2013</xref>) as well as how muscle forces are transmitted across the joint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boeth et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, although removal of sensory feedback from joint structures might compromise neural control of joint stresses and strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Connor et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O'Connor et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Salo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Solomonow, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Solomonow and Krogsgaard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johansson et al., 1991</xref>), this sensory feedback can also provide information about task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferrell et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sjölander et al., 2002</xref>). These challenges have made it difficult to reach clear conclusions as to whether the CNS controls internal joint stresses and strains.</p><p>In the experiments reported here, we overcome these challenges by taking advantage of the unique properties of the rat knee joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Activation of the quadriceps muscles vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis (VM) in the rat produces very similar forces at the distal tibia and so will produce similar joint torques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sandercock et al., 2018</xref>). These muscles therefore have redundant contributions to task performance. On the other hand, VL and VM produce opposing mediolateral forces on the patella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sandercock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wilson and Sheehan, 2010</xref>). In the rat, these mediolateral patellar forces are not transmitted to the tibia but are balanced by contact forces between the patella and the femur within the trochlear groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sandercock et al., 2018</xref>). To avoid overloading patellofemoral contact forces and prevent joint pain or injury, the CNS should therefore balance activation of VM and VL to minimize net mediolateral forces on the patella while producing the knee torque necessary to achieve task goals. Since VM and VL in the rat have redundant contributions to task performance but opposing contributions to joint stresses, we can use the rat knee joint to design tractable experiments to evaluate whether the CNS regulates joint stresses and strains.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38215.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Actions of quadriceps muscles on task performance variables and internal joint state variables, and possible adaptation strategies after VL paralysis.</title><p>The left schematic in (<bold>a</bold>) illustrates the anatomical organization of the quadriceps muscles; VI is indicated in gray because it is located underneath RF. The right schematics depict the force directions produced by each of these muscles on the patella (top), the corresponding joint torques (middle), and the mediolateral patellar forces produced by VM and VL (bottom). Note that RF produces torques at both the hip and knee, and produces negligible mediolateral force on the patella. VM and VL have redundant contributions to knee torque (task variables), and opposite contributions to mediolateral patellar forces (internal joint variables). Panel (<bold>b</bold>) illustrates alternate adaptation strategies for compensating to paralysis of VL. The left column shows the consequences of an adaptation strategy prioritizing regulation of task performance variables: increasing VM activation restores joint torques and therefore joint kinematics, but would create an unbalanced mediolateral force on the patella. The middle column shows the consequences of an adaptation strategy prioritizing regulation of internal joint state variables: increasing RF activation and reducing VM activation eliminates mediolateral forces on the patella, but would create aberrant joint torques at the hip. The right column shows the consequences of an adaptation strategy that considers both task performance and internal joint state, preferentially increasing RF to minimize mediolateral patellar forces while maintaining VM activation to limit deviations in joint torques.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-38215-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>We examined neural adaptation strategies following paralysis of VL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). If the CNS prioritizes task performance, the easiest adaptation strategy would be to increase activation of VM. Because VM and VL have redundant contributions to task performance, this strategy would restore joint kinematics without requiring changes in other muscle activations. This straightforward restoration of task performance, however, would come at the cost of unbalanced mediolateral patellar forces. On the other hand, if the CNS prioritizes joint integrity, it should decrease activation of VM and increase activation of rectus femoris (RF) since RF produces minimal mediolateral force on the patella. This strategy to minimize joint stresses, however, would come at the cost of a more complex, potentially incomplete restoration of task performance: increased activation of RF will restore the knee torque lost by VL paralysis but will also introduce an additional hip flexion torque. This strategy will therefore either require compensatory activity in hip extensor muscles or introduce residual deviations in joint kinematics. Finally, if the CNS considers both task performance and internal joint stresses, it might preferentially increase RF activation while maintaining activation of VM. This strategy would minimize mediolateral forces on the patella while also limiting deviations of joint kinematics, reflecting a compromise between control of task performance and internal joint state. Observing either of the last two strategies would demonstrate that the CNS considers internal joint stresses since the preferential increase of RF activation reflects minimization of mediolateral patellar forces. Note that vastus intermedius (VI) is very small in the rat and so is unlikely to contribute substantially to the adaptation following VL paralysis. Our results show that rats compensated for the loss of VL by preferentially increasing activation of RF, consistent with the hypothesis that the CNS chooses muscle activations to minimize stresses and strains to internal joint structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Paralysis of VL by peripheral nerve cut</title><p>Cutting the branch of the quadriceps nerve innervating VL abolished the large majority of VL activation during locomotion, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref>.

We found that animals compensated for VL paralysis by increasing activation of RF while maintaining the activation of VM at levels similar to those observed before the perturbation. This strategy restores the knee extension torque lost after VL paralysis while causing minimal additional mediolateral patellar forces. The increased RF activation resulted in a persistent perturbation in joint kinematics due to the extra hip flexor torque from RF, but global aspects of limb kinematics were restored. These results suggest that the CNS considers internal joint stresses and strains when choosing muscle activations.</p><p>The main result of this study is the observation that animals compensated for VL paralysis by preferentially increasing activation of RF. If one only considers muscle contributions to task performance, this adaptation strategy is counterintuitive; because VM and VL have redundant contributions to knee extension movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sandercock et al., 2018</xref>), restoring task performance would be most easily accomplished by increasing activation of VM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). This strategy would restore the same joint kinematics observed before VL paralysis without requiring any additional compensation. In contrast, increased activation of RF, while restoring the knee extension torque lost by VL paralysis, also introduces an additional flexion torque at the hip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Greene, 1963</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, this strategy would either require additional changes in other muscles across the limb, or introduce residual deviations in joint kinematics. The increased activation of RF we observed is therefore difficult to reconcile with strategies for muscle coordination focused solely on considerations of task performance.</p><p>This strategy is consistent, however, with the hypothesis that the CNS takes into account the effect of muscle activity on the stresses and strains within a joint. Increasing activation of RF restores knee extension function while producing negligible additional mediolateral forces on the patella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). On the other hand, higher activation of VM would increase the medial force on the patella and cause excess patellofemoral loading. Hence, our results suggest that the CNS considers these mediolateral forces when selecting muscle activations to compensate for VL paralysis.</p><p>We also observed a selective increase in the mass of RF that likely reflects a use-dependent strengthening of that muscle, although we did not confirm this by measuring peak forces or myosin content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blaauw et al., 2013</xref>). This result indirectly confirms the preferential increase of RF activity after VL paralysis. Furthermore, it suggests that at late time points of the adaptation, the loss of VL was compensated both by higher neural activity and by additional force generating capability of RF. Finally, this result suggests that the increased RF activation was not specific to treadmill locomotion, but was also used in behaviors we did not measure here; if there was increased VM or VI activation in other behaviors, we would have observed an increase in the mass of those muscles. The observation of no change in the mass of VI also suggests that there was no consistent change in the activation of this muscle during the adaptation period, though we did not record from VI in these experiments due its small size and inaccessibility for implantation.</p><p>We did not observe a complete silencing of VM, even after 7 weeks of adaptation: VM activation levels were on average similar to those observed before VL paralysis. This implies that a residual medial force on the patella persisted throughout the adaptation period. Such residual VM activity might reflect a compromise between unbalanced mediolateral patellar forces and perturbations in joint kinematics caused by the increased activation of RF. In the context of optimization approaches to motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scott, 2004</xref>), this result suggests a cost function that includes terms for task performance as well as internal joint stresses. Alternatively, the residual activation of VM might reflect habitual persistence of the strategy used by the CNS prior to VL paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Rugy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Loeb, 2012</xref>). Although our study cannot distinguish between these two explanations, in either case the fact that RF and not VM activity was increased demonstrates the influence of criteria related to the state of internal joint structures.</p><p>The particular aspects of task performance that drive adaptation are potentially complex. Although muscle paralysis caused persistent changes at individual joint kinematics, we observed restoration of global limb kinematics. This result is consistent with ideas such as those used in uncontrolled manifold analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Latash et al., 2007</xref>) and with previous results examining adaptation following paralysis of triceps surae in rats and cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bauman and Chang, 2013</xref>). In this context, our results suggest a hierarchical control of movement, in which higher level variables related to task goals (i.e. global limb variables) are preserved after VL paralysis while lower level variables related to task execution (i.e. individual joint angles) are allowed to vary.</p><p>Many criteria have been proposed to influence the activation of muscles during behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alessandro, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prilutsky, 2000</xref>), but they generally do not consider the internal state of joints. Although some of these criteria might indirectly minimize joint stresses and strains (e.g. minimum jerk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flash and Hogan, 1985</xref>] or torque change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Uno et al., 1989</xref>]), they would not predict the selective increase in RF activation observed here. Including criteria that explicitly consider the consequences of muscle activation on joint stresses and strains might improve the predictions of such optimization approaches.</p><p>Alternatively, minimization of internal joint stresses and strains in intact subjects might be accomplished without explicit control. The co-evolution of neural control and musculoskeletal anatomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Valero-Cuevas, 2015</xref>) might result in a neuromechanical system such that muscle activations optimizing task performance criteria also optimize internal joint state criteria. For example, when VM and VL are intact, a criterion that minimizes muscle metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kistemaker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prilutsky, 2000</xref>), or that considers signal dependent variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harris and Wolpert, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haruno and Wolpert, 2005</xref>) would predict a distributed activation of VM and VL. This distributed activation of VM and VL might result from optimization over evolutionary time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giszter, 2015</xref>) and be implemented in coordinative structures such as muscle synergies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tresch and Jarc, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alessandro et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alessandro et al., 2013b</xref>) within the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hart and Giszter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Takei et al., 2017</xref>) or other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Overduin et al., 2015</xref>). This distributed activation could in turn balance net mediolateral patellar forces, even though such a balance was not explicitly considered. After injuries that alter limb properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gutierrez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Connor et al., 1993</xref>), this implicit regulation of internal joint state might be compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Needle et al., 2014</xref>). In these situations, the CNS might be forced into a solution that requires a tradeoff between task performance and internal joint stresses and strains, such as that observed in our experiments.</p><p>These results have implications to clinical syndromes affecting joint health, such as knee osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Felson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mahmoudian et al., 2017</xref>) and patellofemoral pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith et al., 2018</xref>) (PFP) in humans. Although many factors have been shown to contribute to PFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fagan and Delahunt, 2008</xref>), one common suggestion is that PFP results from an imbalance in mediolateral patellar forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pal et al., 2012</xref>). Our results show that although the CNS regulates these mediolateral forces, this regulation is imperfect since VM activation persisted after VL paralysis. PFP might result from similarly imperfect regulation of patellar forces, potentially reflecting a compromise between criteria related to task performance and internal joint states. More broadly, our experiments highlight the importance of considering the consequences of rehabilitation on internal joint stresses and strains following injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farrokhi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shull et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simic et al., 2011</xref>), rather than solely focusing on restoration of task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hollands et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Regulation of internal joint stresses and strains, either in intact subjects or following injury, might be accomplished by feedforward or feedback mechanisms. Sensory receptors in the joint can convey information about strains in ligaments or stresses between bones. Activity in these receptors can be conveyed to spinal interneuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Solomonow et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iles et al., 1990</xref>) and other areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sjölander et al., 2002</xref>) to drive rapid feedback control of muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferrell, 1980</xref>) or longer term adaptation of muscle activations in order to avoid potential injury. The CNS could also derive information about internal joint structures indirectly from muscle proprioceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilmink and Nichols, 2003</xref>), combining information about muscle forces and lengths with ‘internal’ models of muscle anatomy to estimate joint stresses and strains. Similarly, predictive models of muscle actions, combined with efference copy of motor commands, could be used to make feedforward predictions of internal joint stresses and strains. The strong coherence between VM and VL across frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laine et al., 2015</xref>) observed in humans is consistent with the importance of coordinated activation of these muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brøchner Nielsen et al., 2017</xref>), whether by feedforward or feedback processes. This coordinated muscle activation is also similar to ideas of muscle synergies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tresch and Jarc, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alessandro et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alessandro et al., 2013b</xref>), so that the balanced activation of muscles within a synergy would reflect regulation of joint stresses and strains. Note that neural control of internal joint states might be relatively coarse, only responding to large deviations in joint states inducing discomfort or pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grigg and Greenspan, 1977</xref>). Such a coarse control of joint state might reflect the ‘good enough’ habitual strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Rugy et al., 2012</xref>) described above, potentially resulting in the residual activation of VM observed in our experiments.</p><p>Further experiments will be necessary to better understand the neural control of joint stresses and strains. Although the muscle paralysis by denervation used in these experiments has been used in many studies to examine neural adaptation strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bauman and Chang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dambreville et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frigon and Rossignol, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouyer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maas et al., 2007</xref>), the loss of sensory information from the paralyzed muscle might contribute to the observed changes in muscle activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akay et al., 2014</xref>). Perturbations directly manipulating patellar forces or paralyzing VM or RF might provide complementary experiments to further evaluate this hypothesis. Cutting the nerves to VM and RF selectively, however, is difficult because they branch extensively immediately after leaving the common quadriceps nerve, making them hard to isolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Greene, 1963</xref>). The nerve to VL was simpler to cut because it persists as a single trunk for a long distance from the common quadriceps nerve.</p><p>Our experiments exploited the unique mechanical properties of the rat knee joint: the clear distinction between muscle contributions to task performance and to patellar forces in the rat allowed us to make simple predictions about adaptation strategies consistent or inconsistent with neural regulation of internal joint stresses and strains. Such distinctions are more difficult to make in humans because the patellar mobility at extended knee angles complicates how quadriceps muscles affect both patellar mechanics and limb kinematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farahmand et al., 1998</xref>). The rat knee joint might therefore provide a tractable experimental model to examine the neural control of joint stresses and strains in both healthy subjects and following injury.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>We performed experiments on female Sprague Dawley rats (n = 6). All the procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Northwestern University.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental protocol</title><p>We first trained rats to maintain a stable gait pattern during treadmill locomotion. We then implanted chronic EMG electrodes in multiple hindlimb muscles and allowed animals to recover for at least 10 days following implantation. We recorded kinematic and EMG activity during treadmill locomotion before (baseline) and at different times after VL paralysis: within one week after the procedure (week 1), within the second week (week 2), and within the seventh week (week 7). At the end of data collection, animals were euthanized, muscle masses weighed, and electrode location verified. The EMG channels corresponding to misplaced electrodes were not included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Implantation of EMG electrodes</title><p>We anesthetized animals with isoflurane (3% in O2 ~ 2 l/min), and prepared them for aseptic surgery. We implanted pairs of electrodes in seven muscles: vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), rectus femoris (RF), semimembranosus (SM), biceps femoris posterior (BFp), tibialis anterior (TA), and caudal gracilis (GRc). Knots placed on either side of the muscle secured the exposed electrode sites within the muscle belly. The electrode leads were tunneled subcutaneously to a connector on the back of the animal. These methods have been described in more details previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tysseling et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Paralysis of VL</title><p>During aseptic surgery (isoflurane, 3% in O2 ~ 2 l/min), we exposed the quadriceps nerve plexus, and isolated the branch to VL. We anesthetized this branch with lidocaine, tied it off in two locations with silk suture to prevent re-innervation, and then cut between the sutures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>EMGs and kinematics during locomotion</title><p>Before each recording session, we applied retro-reflective markers on the shaved skin (see <italic>Data acquisition and processing</italic>) under brief isoflurane anesthesia (2–3% in O2 ~ 2 l/min). Markers were placed on bony landmarks on the hindlimb skin (rostral and caudal tips of the pelvis, hip, knee, ankle and first digit, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The EMG connector was attached via cable to the amplifier, and the animal placed on the treadmill. We waited at least 30 min after anesthesia before collecting behavioral data. Each recording session consisted of two minutes of locomotion at the maximum comfortable speed (12–15 m/min) and incline (usually +25%) to induce strong quadriceps activations. One animal was unable to walk at an incline of +25%, and so for that animal we recorded data from level treadmill walking.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data acquisition and processing</title><p>The 3D position of markers was tracked using a motion capture system (Vicon) at a frequency of 200 Hz. These signals were low-pass filtered offline at a cut-off frequency of 10 Hz (5th order Butterworth). In order to reduce errors due to differential movements of the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Filipe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauman and Chang, 2010</xref>), we estimated the 3D position of the knee by triangulation, using the lengths of the femur and the tibia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauman and Chang, 2010</xref>). Differential EMG signals were amplified (1000X), band-pass filtered (30–1000 Hz) and notch filtered (60 Hz), and then digitalized (5000 Hz). The digitalized signals were further band-pass filtered offline to remove motion artifacts (5–500 Hz, 4<sup>th</sup> order Butterworth), rectified, and envelopes were computed from the rectified signals.</p><p>We segmented both kinematic and EMG envelopes into separate strides, defining the beginning of each stride as the onset of activation of TA during bouts of stable walking. To obtain a consistent dataset that reflected the behavioral condition of the experiment, we only considered strides with durations within 1.5 standard deviations from the mean. We also excluded strides with clear EMG artifacts that could occur when the cable hit the side of the treadmill, as identified using Tukey outlier analysis (i.e. identifying EMG values that were 1.5 interquartiles above the upper quartile of the maxima across steps). Further, we discarded strides that had more than 20% of missing values in the kinematic signals due to malfunctioning of the acquisition system or due to occlusions of the retro-reflective markers. Application of these inclusion criteria resulted in data sets with, on average, 65 strides for each recording session. Strides were then time-normalized to 100 samples for further analysis.</p><p>We characterized each stride by means of several kinematic and EMG features. For kinematic analysis, we calculated the percentage of stance (i.e. duration of the stance phase divided by the duration of the entire stride, with stance phase defined as the interval between foot-strike and foot-off). We calculated local joint angles (hip, knee, and ankle) as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>. Furthermore, we calculated more global features describing overall limb kinematics as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>: the length of the global limb vector (defined as the vector from the hip to the toe), and the limb angle (defined as the angle between the limb vector and the vector from the hip to the rostral pelvis). Finally, we calculated the range of motion of each joint (ROM, i.e. the difference between maximum and minimum joint angles for each stride). All angles were calculated using the projections of the markers onto the sagittal plane of the treadmill, and were defined such that zero degrees reflected complete joint flexion and increasing angles reflected increasing amounts of extension. For the EMG analysis, we computed the integral of the EMG envelopes’ extension burst (i.e. muscle activity related to the preparation and the execution of the stance phase), which represents the muscle activity contributing to limb extension. We normalized this measure to the pre-paralysis mean integrated activity for each muscle and subject, obtaining the relative change of activation with respect to this baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>We employed Linear Mixed Effect Models (LMEM) to analyze both kinematic and EMG data using the nlme package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pinheiro et al., 2017</xref>) in the R environment. The use of LMEMs allows us to exploit the fact that we have large numbers of observations for each animal across the adaptation period, obtaining the maximal statistical power from a relatively small number of animals. LMEMs also allow us to analyze samples of different size (e.g. unequal numbers of strides across days and animals), to cope with missing data (potentially due to the inclusion criteria described above), and to take into account variability at different levels of the dataset (e.g. across strides, across days, and across subjects). To confirm that our dataset met the assumption of Gaussian distribution and independence of residuals and random effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pinheiro and Bates, 2000</xref>), we visually inspected the distributions using qq-plots and histograms. After fitting the LMEMs, we tested our specific hypotheses of interest by performing post-hoc tests on the model parameters and using Bonferroni corrections to adjust the obtained p-values. Note that because of this correction, the adjusted p-values can be equal to 1. We considered tests to be statistically significant if their p-values were lower than the 0.05 significance level.</p><p>For the kinematic analysis, we fit a LMEM for each measure, using the value of the feature as the dependent variable and the timing after VL paralysis as the independent variable. In order to take inter-subject variability into account, we considered <italic>subject</italic> as a random effect on both slope and intercept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pinheiro and Bates, 2000</xref>). This method is essentially a more powerful version of a repeated measures ANOVA, and it has been proven effective at estimating degrees of freedom and standard errors, hence enabling accurate statistical tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barr et al., 2013</xref>). We then performed post-hoc tests to evaluate whether the values of the features at a given week were different from their baseline values.</p><p>To analyze muscle activity, we initially log-transformed the data to reduce the skewness of EMG features. This rendered the distribution of the dataset more symmetrical and the distribution of residuals approximately Gaussian. For the comparison between VM and RF, we fit a LMEM with normalized integrated EMG as the dependent variable, and the timing after VL paralysis as well as muscle identity (i.e. whether the muscle was VM or RF) as independent variables, including in the model also an interaction term between these independent variables. We considered <italic>subject</italic> as a random effect on both intercept and slope, and we nested the variability across strides within each subject and recording session. We performed post-hoc tests to evaluate: (1) whether the normalized activity in RF at any week after VL paralysis was greater than the activity in VM; and (2) whether the normalized activity of each muscle at a given week was different from its baseline value. For the analysis of the other muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we fit a LMEM for each signal using the normalized integrated EMG as the dependent variable, the timing after VL paralysis as the independent variable, and considering <italic>subject</italic> as a random effect on both slope and intercept. Then, we used post-hoc tests to evaluate whether the normalized activity at a given week was different from its baseline value.</p><p>To compare the masses of the quadriceps in the denervated limb to those in the intact limb, we performed paired t-tests for each muscle, and we adjusted the obtained p-values with Bonferroni corrections.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by the NIH grant number NS086973 (MCT).</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: All of the animals were handled according to approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocols (#IS00000628) of the Northwestern University.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Richard Nichols as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor.

The findings are significant in revealing previously underappreciated factors that determine how muscles in redundant groups are recruited. The issue of muscle selection in redundant systems has been considered of major significance in motor control research, and the results of this study provide an important hypothesis in this regard.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It was suggested that the authors might amplify the Discussion by referring to sensory pathways from the joint capsule that could potentially mediate the adaptation to the unbalanced forces within the joint.</p><p>2) An interesting point worthy of discussion is that the mechanisms underlying the observed adaptation might be predictive, since the damage to the joint would develop over time after the injury.</p><p>3) Consider addressing the idea of Young-Hui Chang that stabilization of task-level variables (e.g. whole limb length) might be relevant in the selection process due to the multi-joint actions of some muscles.</p><p>4) Figure 3B, subsection “Preferential increase in RF activation following VL paralysis”: Please clarify whether the EMG was integrated across the whole step cycle, since the activity of RF exhibited two peaks, one in each phase.</p><p>5) Figure 6: It appears that total limb length observed in controls was preserved following the denervation, at least after 7 weeks.

We had noticed this as well and were preparing a separate publication on this point, but at the reviewers’ suggestion have included the analysis here. We analyzed the changes in limb length and limb angle over the adaptation period (Figure 6C). As suggested by the reviewer, we found that although there were changes in these global parameters in the first week following VL paralysis, these parameters returned to baseline, pre-paralysis values by the end of the adaptation period. We have included these analysis in the Materials and methods (subsection “Data acquisition and processing” third paragraph), Results (subsection “Restoration of global limb kinematics following VL paralysis”), and briefly consider their implications in the Discussion (second paragraph). We also added these analyses of global kinematics to Figure 6—figure supplement 1 illustrating kinematic adaptation at mid-stance. We have made edits through the paper to reflect the distinction between ‘local’ joint angles and ‘global’ limb angles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3B, subsection “Preferential increase in RF activation following VL paralysis”: Please clarify whether the EMG was integrated across the whole step cycle, since the activity of RF exhibited two peaks, one in each phase.</p></disp-quote><p>The activity of VM and RF was only integrated over the extension burst.
