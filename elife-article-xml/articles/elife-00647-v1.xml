As the animal traverses a spatial trajectory, individual locations along the trajectory activate these neurons in a unique firing sequence, which yields a memory code representing the trajectory. How this type of memory code is altered in dementia-producing neurodegenerative disorders is unknown. Here we show that in transgenic rTg4510 mice, a model of tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease, hippocampal neurons did not fire at specific locations, yet displayed robust firing sequences as animals run along familiar or novel trajectories. The sequences seen on the trajectories also appeared during free exploration of open spaces. The spatially dissociated firing sequences suggest that hippocampal neurons in the transgenic mice are not primarily driven by external space but by internally generated brain activities. We propose that tau pathology and/or neurodegeneration renders hippocampal circuits overwhelmed by internal information and therefore prevents them from encoding spatial memories.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00647.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00647.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00647.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Patients with Alzheimer's disease often forget where they have been or who they have just met. This happens because the neurons in those areas of the brain where memories are processed are dying. Indeed, by the time Alzheimer's disease has been diagnosed, many of the neurons in these regions have already died. The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are then produced by the remaining neurons. However, the reasons why the remaining neurons cannot make new memories are unknown.</p><p>In normal mice the neurons in the hippocampus, a part of the brain that is important for memory, are called ‘place cells’ because they are turned on when the mouse is in a specific place. As a consequence, when the mice moves around, different neurons are turned on one by one, and this sequence of activation is believed to be a memory code that represents the places the animal has travelled.</p><p>Cheng and Ji have explored this phenomenon in mice that have been genetically engineered so that their neurons contain structures called ‘tau tangles’ that are thought to be involved in the death of neurons. More importantly, these transgenic mice suffer age-dependent neuron loss in a way that is similarly to people with Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>Cheng and Ji implanted tiny sensors into the hippocampus of these mice, and used these sensors to monitor the activity of the remaining hippocampal neurons as the mice moved around while searching for food. They found that the neurons were activated almost everywhere, which indicates that the hippocampal neurons in transgenic mice are no longer working as place cells. However, these neurons were still activated one by one in robust sequences. Moreover, the sequences generated by the transgenic mice were the same in many different surroundings, which suggests that these sequences are not memory codes of the animal's current surroundings. Cheng and Ji propose that the sequences reflect existing memories already stored in the brain, which would suggest that Alzheimer's patients cannot form new memories because the brain is preoccupied by old memories, and thus fails to store the new information that is coming in from the outside world.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00647.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00647.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>learning and memory</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>place cell</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>tau</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21NS075726</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>Daoyun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In a mouse model of neurodegeneration, hippocampal firing sequences that normally encode spatial memories become disengaged from external space.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is behaviorally characterized by cognitive declines such as memory loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlesimo and Oscar-Berman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salmon and Bondi, 2009</xref>), but pathologically defined by β-amyloid plaques and tau pathology including neurofibrillary tangles and tau-mediated neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wenk, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashe and Zahs, 2010</xref>). A current challenge is how to bridge between these two very different aspects of AD. Because memory deficits are necessarily produced by the memory-processing neural circuits in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dickerson and Eichenbaum, 2010</xref>), a key step toward this challenge is to understand the functional alterations in the memory circuits, including the hippocampus (HP), of the living brain with ongoing pathogenesis. Both the β-amyloid and tau pathologies are likely involved in the memory loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chapman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cacucci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashe and Zahs, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Palop and Mucke, 2010</xref>). In particular, tau pathology and subsequent neurodegeneration play a key role in mediating the memory symptoms seen at a mature stage of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashe and Zahs, 2010</xref>). Currently, it is unknown how the mnemonic functions of HP are altered by tau pathology in vivo.</p><p>One well-studied function of HP in vivo is the coding of spatial memories. It is believed that spatial memories in both rodents and humans are encoded by HP place cells that fire at one or a few specific locations of a given space (place fields) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson and McNaughton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burgess and O'Keefe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ekstrom et al., 2003</xref>). When the animal runs along a novel spatial trajectory, external sensory input at individual locations along the trajectory drives place cells to fire one after another in a unique sequence, which yields a memory code for the trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson and McNaughton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006</xref>). After the novel experience, the sequence becomes internally established and can be reactivated during later memory recall and/or consolidation with or without partial external input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buzsaki, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Skaggs and McNaughton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nadasdy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Foster and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diba and Buzsaki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ji and Wilson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gelbard-Sagiv et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karlsson and Frank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carr et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, in theory, on any given trajectory HP could either retrieve stored internal sequences, form new ones, or combine both, based on the external input that HP receives from the environment. It has been proposed that the interplay between internal and external inputs is important to memory processing in HP and abnormal interaction may lead to memory interference and/or intrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakazawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McHugh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colgin et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The availability of tauopathy animal models provides an opportunity to study how tau pathology alters HP mnemonic functions in vivo. To this end, we set out to examine the spatial memory code in the transgenic rTg4510 (Tau) mouse. This model was chosen because its well-characterized pathological and behavioral phenotypes mimic many key features of tau pathology in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramsden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Santacruz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berger et al., 2007</xref>). In Tau mice, the overexpression of a mutated version (P301L) of the human tau gene restricted in the forebrain leads to age-dependent spatial memory deficits, tau neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. In this study, we recorded neurons in the CA1 region of HP using the tetrode recording technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson and McNaughton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzsaki, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ji and Wilson, 2007</xref>) from 7 to 9 month old Tau mice and their control littermates while they performed spatial navigation tasks. We found that HP neurons in Tau mice fail to fire at specific spatial locations and yet maintain robust firing sequences, suggesting that non-spatial, internal brain activities dominate the HP circuits and prevent them encoding external space.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We recorded a total of 497 CA1 neurons from eight Tau and six wildtype (WT) control mice, all at 7–9 months old (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

In contrast, spikes of Tau neurons were not confined to specific locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Close visual inspections revealed that Tau neurons’ spikes were still specific to one or a few locations in each individual lap, but the locations were changed from lap to lap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We described a neuron’s firing profile on a trajectory by a rate curve (the two trajectories were analyzed separately for each neuron), which was the neuron’s firing rate as a function of the position along the trajectory. The rate curve was computed for every lap and then averaged across all laps. Whereas the averaged rate curves of typical WT neurons clearly showed one or a few peaks indicative of well-defined place fields, those of typical Tau neurons did not show such prominent peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, ‘bottom curves’). We quantified the location-specificity using spatial information (SI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Skaggs et al., 1993</xref>). SI was computed for each neuron active on each trajectory at two levels, a lap SI to measure the location-specificity at individual lap level and a trajectory SI to measure the overall location-specificity across all laps based on its averaged rate curve. The median lap SI of WT neurons was only slightly (21%) greater than that of Tau neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; WT 2.03 [1.00 3.09] bits/spike, <italic>N</italic> = 263; Tau 1.68 [0.84 2.34] bits/spike, <italic>N</italic> = 262; p=7.7 × 10<sup>−11</sup>), but the median trajectory SI of WT neurons was much greater (180%) than that of Tau neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; WT: 1.29 [0.55 2.61] bits/spike; Tau: 0.46 [0.15 1.29] bits/spike; p=5.3 × 10<sup>−39</sup>). We also quantified the lap-to-lap location change by rate-stability, defined as the average correlation coefficient between any two laps’ rate curves.

(<bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold>) Second, we determined whether pairs of cells had stable firing relationships based on the stability of their cross-correlations (CCs). For examples, the CCs of a pair of WT (cell <italic>G</italic> and cell <italic>I</italic> in <bold>A</bold>) and a pair of Tau cells (cell <italic>A</italic> and cell <italic>H</italic> in <bold>A</bold>) are shown in (<bold>B</bold>). Each panel shows the color-coded CC for every lap and the bottom curve shows the lap-averaged CC. The color bar is shared by all panels in (<bold>B</bold>) and (<bold>C</bold>). For every lap, a CC was generated by cross-correlating the two cells' binned firing rates (bin size: 100 ms) in the lap. Note the stable peak locations of the lap CCs and the prominent peak of the lap-averaged CC for both the WT and Tau pairs in (<bold>B</bold>). For each cell pair, we computed a CC-stability, defined as the average correlation-coefficient between any two laps' CCs. To evaluate the significance of the CC-stability, we also computed a shuffled version of CCs (<bold>C</bold>) after the two cells' firing rates were circularly slid with independent, random time intervals (slide-shuffling). Note the inconsistent peaks in the lap CCs of both the WT and Tau pairs and consequently small CC-stability values in (<bold>C</bold>). For each cell pair, we generated 1000 shuffled CCs by slide-shuffling and therefore obtained 1000 chance level CC-stability values. A cell pair was considered to have a stable CC if (1) CC-stability is greater than the upper 1% of the chance level (p&lt;0.01) and (2) there was a peak in the lap-averaged CC (the maximum value of the <italic>Z</italic>-transformed CC ≥ 1). Third, we ordered the cells in those pairs with a stable CC. For the pairs in (<bold>B</bold>), because the peak of the lap-averaged CC between cell <italic>G</italic> and <italic>I</italic> occurred at a negative time lag (*), we ordered the pair as <italic>IG.</italic> Because the peak between cell <italic>A</italic> and <italic>H</italic> occurred at a positive time lag (*), we ordered the pair as <italic>AH</italic>. If the peak of a pair occurred at exactly time lag 0, we randomly ordered the cells in the pair. (<bold>D</bold>) Finally, we constructed template sequences that agreed with all the ordered pairs (see ‘Materials and methods’). The derived template sequences for the WT (<italic>XIGQOZ</italic>) and Tau (<italic>FABHD</italic>) cells are shown. Spike raster of the cells, ordered according to the templates, are displayed in the time domain during the same five laps as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. Note the repeated occurrence of the template sequences across laps.

The correlation coefficient of the two ranks was computed and its significance was assessed by using 1000 random shuffles of the letters in the segment (shuffle p). In pilot computations, we found that the p value determined from Pearson's <italic>R</italic> (p<italic>=</italic>0.0103 for this example) was a close approximation of shuffle p (0.0095 for this example).

(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) First, the template sequences were generated by using a threshold to select pairs of cells with consistently high correlations. How did the sequence detection result depend on the particular threshold chosen? The number of templates (<bold>A</bold>) and mean number of detected sequences (in <italic>Z</italic>-score) (<bold>B</bold>) on familiar trajectories in WT (<italic>black</italic>) and Tau (<italic>red</italic>) mice were computed using a wide range of cell selection threshold (0.05–0.4). <italic>Arrows</italic>: actual thresholds (black: WT, red: Tau). Different actual thresholds were used for WT and Tau mice because the thresholds were computed from chance-level correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which differed between WT and Tau cell pairs. <italic>Dashed horizontal lines</italic>: actual <italic>Z</italic>-scores at the actual thresholds. *p&lt;0.05 from the actual <italic>Z</italic>-scores. The <italic>Z</italic>-scores changed very slowly as the threshold was decreased. Only when the threshold became extremely low (&lt;0.08), did the <italic>Z</italic>-scores drop significantly. (<bold>C</bold>) Second, Tau cells fired more broadly on the track, which might have increased temporal overlap in their firing patterns and yield more opportunities for sequence detection. Were the <italic>Z</italic>-scores sensitive to the possible overlapped firing of Tau cells? To address this, we systematically down-sampled the spike trains during trajectory running and re-computed the <italic>Z</italic>-scores. We binned spikes of each cell into 1-s long bins and removed spikes within randomly chosen bins. This manipulation reduced the temporal overlap among cells at a time scale of our sequence detection. The result is plotted similarly as in (<bold>B</bold>). It is clear that the actual <italic>Z</italic>-scores were insensitive to the down-sampling. Only when more than 60% spikes removed, did <italic>Z</italic>-scores start to drop significantly below the actual values. Therefore, although the absolute number of detected sequences on the track inevitably depended on the exact parameters chosen, the normalization (<italic>Z</italic>-scoring relative to the chance level) in our sequence detection method resulted in a robust quantification of the sequential structure in the multicell spiking patterns.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00647.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00647.010</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00647-fig3-figsupp4-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>To quantitatively demonstrate this, we analyzed the high-order (≥4 neurons) firing sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ji and Wilson, 2007</xref>) of WT/Tau neurons on the familiar track. We first assigned letter identities to those neurons active on a trajectory. We arranged pairs of neurons according to their firing orders identified by their cross-correlations. We then derived a template sequence for the trajectory that agreed with all the ordered pairs. For example, for the five Tau neurons shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the cross-correlation between the second (assigned as neuron <italic>A</italic>) and the fourth (neuron <italic>H</italic>) had a positive peak at 0.8 s. We ordered them as <italic>AH</italic>. By ordering all pairs among the five neurons in this manner, we derived a template sequence <italic>FABHD</italic> for this trajectory. A total of 13 template sequences were derived from WT mice and 8 from Tau mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). For a template sequence on a trajectory, we then detected the firing sequences in the spiking patterns of all laps that matched with the template. To evaluate the significance of the detection, we generated 1000 shuffled copies of the spike patterns by randomly swapping neuron identities and then detected the number of sequences in each copy. The number of detected sequences in the real spike patterns was expressed as a <italic>Z</italic>-score computed from the mean and standard deviation of the shuffling-generated counts. We found a significant number of detected sequences for 9 out of the 13 WT templates and 6 of the 8 Tau templates (p&lt;0.05, <italic>Z</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The mean (±SEM) <italic>Z</italic>-scores for all WT and all Tau templates were similarly high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; WT: 2.5 ± 0.3; Tau: 2.3 ± 0.3; p=0.67, one tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, same below unless specified otherwise). Both WT and Tau template sequences were detected in almost every lap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Although it appeared that Tau sequences occurred more frequently than WT sequences in a given lap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), this difference was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; WT: 1.0 ± 0.1 times per lap; Tau: 1.4 ± 0.3 times per lap; p=0.10).

As illustrated by their rate maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), firing rate color-plotted at each position of the two dimensional (2D) open box, firing activities of Tau neurons covered a much larger portion of the box (meaning less location-specific) than those of WT neurons.

However, when we arranged the neurons according to their firing orders in the template sequences derived during track running, it became apparent that Tau neuron sequences, but not WT sequences, during the track running also appeared frequently during the open box sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We quantified this observation by searching through the spike patterns of open box sessions for sequences that matched with the trajectory template sequences. Here we refer ‘a search’ as to matching one open box session to one trajectory template. We found a significant number of sequences in 10 out of the 16 searches in Tau mice, whereas only in 2 of the 24 searches in WT mice (p&lt;0.05, <italic>Z</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The mean <italic>Z</italic>-score of all searches in Tau mice was significantly higher than that in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; WT: −0.1 ± 0.3; Tau: 1.4 ± 0.4; p=0.001). Therefore, Tau sequences, but not WT sequences, seen on the track trajectories also appeared robustly during the open box sessions.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00647.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Tau, but not WT, sequences seen on the familiar trajectories also appeared in the familiar open box.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spike patterns of the same WT and Tau neurons as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> within two time periods of an open box session.

To examine this possibility, we plotted the animal’s paths between the start and end times of all detected Tau sequences in a search. These paths appeared to be randomly distributed in the box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that the detected sequences were not linked to particular locations or a particular path. To quantitatively demonstrate this, we drew a vector from the start to the end location of each path. We then plotted all the vectors resulted from a search with their starting positions aligned at the origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). If the paths were not randomly distributed, the vectors should show a preferred direction. However, the vectors of a typical search were randomly orientated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). For each search in Tau mice where a significant number of sequences were found, we computed a Rayleigh p value, which tested a null hypothesis that the vectors had no preferred direction. None of the p values for all the 10 searches was significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, p≥0.07), indicating that the null hypothesis could not be rejected. Therefore, the detected Tau sequences in open box sessions were not due to repetitive running behavior. Together with the low location-specificity of Tau neurons in the open box sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we concluded that Tau sequences seen in the open box were not primarily driven by spatial locations. Even further, these Tau sequences seen in the open box were the same as those during the track running. Therefore, Tau sequences did not distinguish two completely different spaces during two very different behaviors. This is a striking result given the well-known phenomenon of ‘remapping’ of place cell activities between different environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muller and Kubie, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leutgeb et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colgin et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Robust firing sequences of CA1 neurons in Tau mice also appeared in novel environments</title><p>We have demonstrated that Tau neurons displayed robust firing sequences on a familiar track and in a familiar open box despite their apparent lack of spatial specificity. To understand whether this peculiar feature of Tau neurons requires spatial experience, we also recorded CA1 neurons while mice explored a novel open box for one to two sessions and then ran back and forth (two trajectories) on a novel track for one to two sessions in a novel room. The findings were similar as those seen in the familiar environments.</p><p>On the novel track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), 79 WT neurons and 92 tau neurons were active on at least one of its trajectories. Their median firing rates during the novel track running sessions were not significantly different (WT: 1.4 [0.4 2.7] Hz, Tau: 1.1 [0.4 3.3] Hz, p=0.71). Whereas the firing locations of WT neurons became stabilized quickly on the novel trajectories, those of Tau neurons stayed unstable from lap to lap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As a result, the median trajectory SI of Tau neurons was much lower than that of WT neurons (WT 0.69 [0.23 1.5] bits/spike, Tau 0.28 [0.086 0.68] bits/spike, p=5.9 ×1 0<sup>−31</sup>), despite a similar median lap SI (WT 1.2 [0.58 1.8] bits/spike, Tau 1.2 [0.46 1.6] bits/spike, p=0.62). The rate-stability of Tau neurons was much lower than that of WT neurons (WT 0.47 [0.17 0.85], Tau 0.10 [0.03 0.28], p=1.6 × 10<sup>−51</sup>). In the novel open box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), 74 WT neurons and 61 Tau neurons were active in at least one session. The median firing rates of these WT and Tau neurons during the novel box sessions were not significantly different (WT: 1.1 [0.4 2.9] Hz, Tau: 1.0 [0.5 2.6] Hz, p=0.38). The rate maps of Tau neurons showed much broader firing areas than those of WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting a reduced location-specificity in Tau neurons. This was confirmed by the result that the median open SI of Tau neurons was significantly lower than that of WT neurons (WT: 0.28 [0.06 0.71] Hz, Tau: 0.08 [0.02 0.32] Hz, p=1.3 × 10<sup>−12</sup>). These results show that Tau neurons fired with little location-specificity either on the novel trajectories or in the novel open box.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00647.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Tau neurons formed robust firing sequences on a novel track and in a novel open box, despite their low location-specificity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The L-shaped novel track. <italic>F</italic>: food wells.

But unlike WT neuron sequences, Tau sequences on the novel trajectories were not anchored to specific locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) and same sequences also appeared in the novel open box sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). We derived 15 high-order template sequences on the novel trajectories from WT mice and 8 from Tau mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The mean <italic>Z</italic>-scores of WT and Tau template sequences on the novel trajectories were similarly high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, WT: 2.5 ± 0.2, Tau: 2.4 ± 0.4, p=0.91), but the mean location shift of Tau sequences among laps was greater than that of WT ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>; WT: 9.2 ± 0.9 cm, Tau: 18.5 ± 3.6 cm, p=0.0038). The mean location shift values of both WT and Tau sequences shown here were smaller than those on the familiar track, probably due to the shorter length of the novel track. Finally, Tau template sequences were detected in the novel open box sessions significantly more often than WT templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, mean <italic>Z</italic>-scores: WT: 0.5 ± 0.2, <italic>N</italic> = 30 searches; Tau: 1.5 ± 0.3, <italic>N</italic> = 12; p=0.0029). Here we emphasize that the novel open box sessions preceded the novel track running. Therefore, Tau sequences seen on the novel trajectories were already preexistent in the prior open box sessions. These findings suggest that the formation of Tau sequences did not primarily depend on spatial experience in an environment.<table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><object-id

id="s2-5"><title>External space contributed to the firing activities of CA1 neurons in Tau mice</title><p>Does the lack of location-specificity and experience-dependence mean that external space made no contribution to Tau neurons’ firing activities at all? To answer this, we first examined whether the firing locations of Tau neurons were completely random. Visual inspection of the lap-by-lap spike trains of Tau neurons revealed that the firing locations of Tau neurons were often consistent among a few laps on both the familiar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and novel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) trajectories, suggesting that the locations were not completely random. Indeed, randomly sliding rate curves of individual laps further significantly reduced the median rate-stability of Tau neurons on both familiar (−0.0020 [−0.034 0.042], p=9.3 × 10<sup>−49</sup> compared with actual rate-stability) and novel (−0.0020 [−0.032 0.049], p=1.8 × 10<sup>−60</sup>) trajectories, indicating that spatial locations still modulated Tau neurons’ firing activities.</p><p>Second, we examined whether Tau neuron sequences were trajectory-selective. On both the familiar and novel tracks, most animals ran two different trajectories (back and forth between two food wells) in each of the two running sessions. For each template sequence derived on a trajectory in a session, we counted the occurrence of the sequence (in <italic>Z</italic>-scores) not only on the trajectory itself (Self), but also on the same trajectory (ST) in the other session and on the other trajectory (OT) in the same session. On the familiar track, the mean <italic>Z</italic>-scores of Self and ST were similar for both WT (Self 2.5 ± 0.3, <italic>N</italic> = 13 templates; ST 2.3 ± 0.2, <italic>N</italic> = 13; p=0.53) and Tau (Self 2.3 ± 0.3, <italic>N</italic> = 8; ST 1.6 ± 0.5, <italic>N</italic> = 8; p=0.27) sequences, but there was a significant difference between Self and OT for both WT (OT 0.29 ± 0.3, <italic>N</italic> = 13; p=5.8 × 10<sup>−6</sup>) and Tau (OT 0.10 ± 0.2, <italic>N</italic> = 8; p=6.1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The result shows that Tau sequences, like WT sequences, occurred consistently on same trajectories across different sessions and distinguished between different trajectories within same sessions. On the novel track, whereas the mean <italic>Z</italic>-scores of Self and ST remain comparable for both WT (Self 2.5 ± 0.2, <italic>N</italic> = 15; ST 1.7 ± 0.3, <italic>N</italic> = 15; p=0.06) and Tau (Self 2.4 ± 0.4, <italic>N</italic> = 8; ST 2.6 ± 0.6, <italic>N</italic> = 4; p=0.79) sequences, there was a significant difference between Self and OT only for WT (OT −0.26 ± 0.2, <italic>N</italic> = 15; p=3.0 × 10<sup>−9</sup>), but not for Tau (OT 1.9 ± 0.5, <italic>N</italic> = 8; p=0.51) sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting that Tau sequences, unlike WT sequences, did not distinguish the two trajectories on the novel track. This analysis shows that Tau sequences were originally not trajectory-selective on the novel track, but became so on the familiar track. Therefore, although Tau neuron’s firing activities were not location-specific and Tau sequences were not primarily driven by space, there was still a modulation of Tau neuron’s firing activities by spatial experience and spatial trajectory.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00647.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Tau sequences were trajectory-selective on the familiar track, but not on the novel track.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Mean number of sequences on three types of trajectories (<italic>Self</italic>, <italic>ST</italic>, <italic>OT</italic>) of the familiar (<bold>A</bold>) and novel (<bold>B</bold>) track.

For all the sequences matched with a template in a session, we visualized the spatial/temporal gaps between neighboring sequences by a raster plot and computed the spatial/temporal auto-correlogram of the sequences using their locations/times to examine the periodicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Neighboring WT sequences in track sessions displayed a consistent spatial gap and there were periodic peaks in their spatial auto-correlograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). The spatial period was the same as the track length (∼2 m for the familiar track, ∼1 m for the novel track), which was expected, given the repetitively running of same track trajectories. The periodicity was much less obvious in the temporal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <italic>right</italic>), because the amount of time that animals spent running and at the food sites varied from lap to lap. In contrast, Tau sequences during track sessions did not show any consistent spatial or temporal gaps in their raster plots and no obvious, periodic peaks were observed in either the spatial or temporal auto-correlograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The spatial periodicity at the track length disappeared apparently because Tau sequences were not anchored to track locations. The average auto-correlogram across all sessions confirmed this observation on both the familiar and novel tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>). Using the same analysis, Tau sequences in open box sessions did not show apparent spatial or temporal periodicity either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,E</xref>).

As seen in these raw plots, the overall behavior of the WT and Tau mouse was similar. We then quantified the behavior using the following parameters. The first, most straightforward parameter is the running speed during the running of a track trajectory or during an open box session. In addition, for each trajectory of a track, we measured the animal’s performance by the number of laps on the trajectory and quantified the quality of the running by computing the cumulative travel distance per lap, the number of stops (defined as speed &lt;4 cm/s lasting ≥2 s) per lap, and the stopping duration per lap. These parameters were computed for 54 familiar (WT: 22, Tau: 32) and 46 novel (WT: 20, Tau: 26) trajectories and 27 familiar (WT: 11, Tau: 16) and 25 novel (WT: 12, Tau: 13) open box sessions.

On familiar trajectories, Tau mice completed less number of laps and ran with a slower speed than WT mice, but their running quality as measured by stopping and travel distance was similar. On novel trajectories, Tau mice behaved similarly as WT mice or even better on one measure (less number of stops per lap). In open boxes, Tau mice in general ran slightly faster than WT mice, but the difference was significant only in the novel open box. Since robust Tau sequences were found on both the familiar and novel tracks and these sequences appeared in both the familiar and novel open boxes, it is unlikely that the running behavior per se was responsible for the differences between WT and Tau sequences.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00647.019</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Behavioral quantifications of WT and Tau mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The accumulative running paths of a WT and Tau mouse on the familiar rectangular track.

Between those neurons recorded from male and those from female WT mice, there was no significant difference in the mean rate-stability either on familiar (male 0.70 [0.33 0.88], female 0.65 [0.29 0.86], p=0.21) or novel (male 0.54 [0.19 0.83], 0.46 [0.16 0.86], p=0.22) trajectories.

For both genders and on both the familiar and novel trajectories, the mean rate-stability of WT neurons was always much greater than that of Tau neurons (p≤1.3 × 10<sup>−14</sup>).

Our data show that CA1 neurons in the transgenic mice do not fire at specific locations, but still form robust firing sequences. These sequences are not anchored to precise locations of spatial trajectories and do not even distinguish between two very different spatial environments. The sequences seen on novel trajectories already exist in a prior session of free exploration in an open box. Therefore, CA1 firing sequences in the transgenic mice become so rigid that they no longer primarily respond to spatial environments or spatial experience, and therefore no longer capable of encoding spatial memories.</p><p>The lack of both spatial specificity and experience-dependence indicates that external spatial input in Tau mice is incapable of taking control of Tau neurons. Nevertheless, Tau neurons do not fall into disorganized firing patterns, but fire with robust sequences. If not external space, what could be the driven force that assembles Tau neurons into these sequences? It has been recently shown that internal brain activities, those related to memory recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gelbard-Sagiv et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pastalkova et al., 2008</xref>) and those encoding time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacDonald et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eichenbaum, 2013</xref>), can produce CA1 firing sequences similar to those shown here. Therefore, here we propose that internal activities underlie the rigid firing sequences in the transgenic mice. On the other hand, although the firing activities of CA1 neurons in the transgenic mice were not location-specific, they are still modulated by external space and spatial experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The existence of this external modulation together with the rigid firing sequences paint a picture of ‘cued false activation’. When the transgenic mice are placed in a space, instead of forming/retrieving the space's memory code, CA1 neurons are cued to activate those internally driven activity patterns irrelevant to the current space. According to this interpretation, the reason why these mice cannot form new spatial memories is because the HP network is dominated by internal brain activities.</p><p>This interpretation implies that there exists a direct competition between external and internal inputs in HP. Therefore, our data provide evidence that abnormal external-internal interaction may contribute to memory deficits in neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have shown that CA1 firing sequences can occur during immobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Foster and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diba and Buzsaki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karlsson and Frank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carr et al., 2011</xref>) or when the animal is spatially restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pastalkova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacDonald et al., 2011</xref>). These sequences are believed to be internally generated because external spatial input stays stationary in these situations. In our experiments, the animals’ paths between the start and end times of Tau sequences spanned a distance on the tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig6">Figures 3A and 6E</xref>) and in the open boxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), clearly showing that the animals were moving when Tau sequences occurred. The sequences also occurred in accompany with prominent theta oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,H</xref>). Therefore, the non-spatially driven firing sequences were found even when animals were actively moving through space. In this case, the external spatial input associated with the movement is overtaken by internal input in the control of CA1 neurons’ firing activities. This further extends the recent findings that pre-existing neuronal sequences may influence future memory codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</xref>).</p><p>What changes in the neural circuits of Tau mice could produce the abnormal completion between internal and external input? Internal activities could originate in CA3, an area where neurons can drive each other via its extensive recurrent connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lisman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakazawa et al., 2002</xref>). External sensory input reaches CA1 likely through the direct pathway via the entorhinal cortex. In Tau mice, there is evidence that tau pathology starts earlier in the cortex including the entorhinal cortex than in HP, and within HP, neuronal loss is more prominent in CA1 than in CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramsden et al., 2005</xref>). It is likely that the external input to CA1 through the entorhinal cortex is weakened by the pathology, but the internal input from CA3 is relatively spared. In the entorhinal cortex, grid cells fire spikes in a spatially periodic fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>). In our data, although Tau sequences sometimes occurred repeatedly in a running lap, there was no evidence for either spatial or temporal periodicity in Tau sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Also Tau cells’ firing activities were not tied to specific locations on the tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and did not show obvious periodic patterns in the open boxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Therefore, Tau sequences are unlikely resulted from periodic firing of entorhinal grid cells. Other potentially relevant changes in Tau mice could include interneurons and theta oscillations, since they greatly shape the firing activities of HP place cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O’Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buzsaki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006</xref>). In Tau mice, the CamKII gene that induces tau pathology and neurodegeneration is not expressed in interneurons and thus should mainly affect pyramidal neurons in HP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mayford et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sik et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramsden et al., 2005</xref>). However, interneurons could still die or alter their properties as adaptive changes to the tau pathology and loss of pyramidal neurons. In our datasets, we only recorded 11 putative interneurons from WT mice and 12 from Tau mice. There was a trend that Tau interneurons fired with a lower rate than WT ones (WT: 24.2 [11.7 46.7] Hz, Tau: 14.8 [8.8 27.2] Hz, p=0.05). This rate change could be one of the adaptive changes in Tau mice to keep the overall activity of remaining HP pyramidal neurons at normal level. Regarding theta oscillations, although the medium septum, the structure important for theta generation in HP, could be affected by tau pathology, based on the known expression pattern of CamKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Odeh et al., 2011</xref>), our data show that prominent theta oscillations are still present in the CA1 LFPs of Tau mice. In particular, the proportion of theta power in the total LFP power is in many cases similar between WT and Tau mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E,H</xref>). Therefore, theta oscillation unlikely plays a major role in the generation of abnormal Tau sequences. Based on these considerations, we propose that the internal input from CA3, by winning over the external input via the direct pathway from the entorhinal cortex, is the main driving force for producing the rigid Tau sequences. As such, Tau sequences mainly reflect the internal information such as old memories stored in the CA3 recurrent connections.</p><p>Our data reveal a subtle but significant difference between male and female Tau mice: The firing stability of CA1 neurons on familiar trajectories in female is greater than that in male mice. This is somewhat unexpected, given a previous report that female tau mice show higher level of abnormally phosphorylated tau and worse performance in the Morris water maze task (MWM) than male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yue et al., 2011</xref>). Other previous studies on another tau-related mouse model have found more extensive β-amyloid, but not tau, pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirata-Fukae et al., 2008</xref>) and more severe impairments on MWM in females than in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clinton et al., 2007</xref>). One possible explanation for the discrepancy is the age of animals used in our study. The sex difference of Tau mice was previously examined at 5.5 months old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yue et al., 2011</xref>). At much older ages (7–9 months) as in our study, tau pathology becomes much more extensive and possibly saturated and thus the sex difference may become less significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramsden et al., 2005</xref>). Another possibility is that tau pathology may not only affect spatial memory representation, but also other factors important for MWM. For example, it has been proposed that behavioral testing produces more stress in females than males and thus greater behavioral deficits under pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clinton et al., 2007</xref>). In our experiments, the animals had been handled for at least 1 month (for tetrode adjustment and maze training) before recordings began. The mice in our study might have a reduced level of stress, which exposed the subtle advantage of females in the firing stability of CA1 cells. This advantage in females could be compensated by a stronger stress response to MWM, producing an overall greater impairment on task performance.</p><p>What pathological features in the transgenic mice are responsible for the observed rigid firing sequences? Our recordings were conducted on the transgenic mice at 7–9 month old, which is a late, mature stage of tau pathology that displays all typical pathological features including hyperphosphorylated tau, tau tangles, and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramsden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Santacruz et al., 2005</xref>). Previous experiments show that stopping the production of the transgenic tau is sufficient to halt the memory deficits at the behavioral level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramsden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Santacruz et al., 2005</xref>), pointing to a role of the hyperphosphorylated tau protein itself. Another possibility is that neurodegeneration reduces the neuron number in HP and cortex and result in a limited capacity for memory storage. Future studies on tauopathy models at various pathological stages may uncover the exact features of tau pathology and/or neurodegeneration that cause the observed abnormalities. Nevertheless, the current study allows us to identify the functional alterations of CA1 neurons at a mature stage of tau pathology and lay the foundation for probing their pathological causes.</p><p>Currently, no animal models can fully recapitulate the pathological changes in human AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashe and Zahs, 2010</xref>). The limitation in the animal model calls for caution in applying the finding to the human disease. However, tau pathology is a key feature of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wenk, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashe and Zahs, 2010</xref>) and plays a key role in its behavioral phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashe and Zahs, 2010</xref>). This model does mimic key features of human tauopathy including its age-dependent progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramsden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Santacruz et al., 2005</xref>). The functional changes at the cellular level in HP identified in this animal model, such as the low location-specificity and rigid firing sequences, possibly also occur in the human brain with similar tau pathological features. Interestingly, our interpretation that internally generated activities obstruct the formation of new memories is consistent with two typical memory symptoms seen in AD patients: the inability to form new memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlesimo and Oscar-Berman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salmon and Bondi, 2009</xref>) and the intrusion of old memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butters et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Anna et al., 2008</xref>). This illustrates that studying the functional changes in memory circuits of animal models can generate novel insight into the memory symptoms of human neurodegenerative diseases including AD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The mouse colony was maintained by an activator and a responder mouse lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramsden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Santacruz et al., 2005</xref>).

Over the course of 2–4 weeks post surgery, tetrodes were slowly moved down to the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of HP. Starting about one week post surgery, the animal was food-deprived, with weight maintained above 85% of the <italic>ab libitum</italic> level, and trained in a familiar room to run back and forth (two trajectories) on a ∼2 m long rectangular track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) for food reward (liquid condensed milk) and to freely explore in a 50 × 30 cm open box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The animal was trained for at least 3 weeks and 15–30 min in each apparatus each day.</p><p>Recording in the familiar room started when multiple, stable single-units (neurons) had been obtained in CA1 and the animal achieved a performance of at least 10 laps per trajectory on the track. The daily recording procedure consisted of two sessions on the track, followed by one to two sessions in the open box. Each session lasted about 15 min and there was a 15-min break between any two sessions, during which the animal rested on an elevated dish (25 cm high, 18 cm in diameter) inside an enclosed box. The recording was repeated 3–10 days.</p><p>After completing the recordings in the familiar room, recording continued in a novel, different room while the animal freely explored a novel open box (30 × 50 cm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and ran back and forth on a novel ∼1 m long L-shaped track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The animal had never been in the novel room or in the novel apparatuses before. The recording schedule was one to two open box sessions, followed by one to two sessions on the L track. Each session lasted about 15 min and there was a 15-min break between any two sessions.</p><p>After the recording, the animal was sacrificed using pentobarbital overdose (200 mg/kg, IP injection). Electrical current (30 µA, 6–10 s) was passed through the tetrodes to create small lesions at the recording sites. The animal’s brain was dissected out and fixed in 10% formalin for 24 hr. After its weight and size were measured, the brain was then sectioned for immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Surgery</title><p>The animal was fixed on a stereotaxic device with body temperature maintained at 36–38 °C and anesthetized with continuous flow of 0.5–2% inhalation anesthetic isoflurane. The flow was adjusted to keep the animal’s breathing rate at 40–80 per min. Ten anchor screws were mounted onto the skull. An exposure was made at the coordinates anteroposterior −2.0 mm, mediolateral 1.5 mm from Bregma. The hyperdrive cannula containing eight tetrodes was lowered to the exposure just above the brain. The drive was fixed in place by dental acrylic. Analgesic (ketoprofen, 5 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously before the animal recovered from the anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In vivo electrophysiological recording</title><p>Tetrode recording was made using a DigitaLynx acquisition system (Neuralynx, Bozeman, MT) and followed the published procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ji and Wilson, 2007</xref>). For spike recording, voltage signals from four channels of a tetrode were digitally band-pass filtered between 600 Hz and 9 kHz. Spikes were detected with any of the four channels crossing a pre-set triggering threshold (50–70 μV) and were sampled at 32 kHz. Broad band (0.1 Hz–1 kHz) local field potentials (LFPs) were sampled at 2 kHz sampling rate. Two color diodes (red, green) were mounted over the animal's head to track its positions. Positions were sampled at 33 Hz with a resolution approximately 0.2 cm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cresyl violet staining</title><p>Coronal sections with 20–70 μm thickness were stained using 0.2% Cresyl violet and cover-slipped for storage.

For each animal, one day’s data in the familiar room (the day with most neurons recorded) and one day’s data in the novel room (the first day of exposure) were included in the analysis. Neurons were manually sorted using xclust (Matthew A Wilson, MIT). In total, 333 CA1 neurons in the familiar room and 327 in the novel room were obtained. Among them, 246 in the familiar and 221 in the novel room were classified as putative pyramidal neurons active either on a trajectory of a track or in an open box session (mean firing rate: ≥0.5 Hz and &lt;7 Hz). 11 in the familiar and 12 in the novel room were classified as putative interneurons (mean rate ≥ 7 Hz).

We assigned letter identifications to active neurons on a trajectory. For example, if eight neurons were active, we assigned them to <italic>A B C D E F G H</italic>. Then, we determined whether any pairs of neurons had a stable CC and if so, we used their CC peak times to order the neurons within the pairs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for details). Next, we derived a sequence that agreed with all the ordered pairs. For example, if ordered pairs were found to be <italic>AB, FA, BH, BD, HD,</italic> we arrived at a sequence <italic>FABHD</italic>. However, it was not always as straightforward as this, because of the following complications. (1) Sometimes contradictory orders, for example <italic>AB, BC, CA</italic> occurred, due to the noisy nature of spike trains, especially when multiple neurons fired close in time. (2) There were often many undetermined orders, because not all pairs were found to have a stable CC. This resulted in too much freedom in template sequences and too many different sequences could agree with the ordered pairs to the same degree (as defined below).</p><p>Our strategy was to use the following algorithm to derive a template sequence from all ordered pairs of a trajectory:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Determine the number of neurons (<italic>k</italic>) that participated in the ordered pairs. If <italic>k</italic> ≤ 10, generate all possible sequences of these neurons. Otherwise, randomly generate 500,000 sequences.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Search through these initial sequences to identify the best sequences, which are those agree with the ordered pairs the most. The degree of agreement is determined by an ordered-pair score <italic>s</italic>: the percentage of all ordered pairs that match the orders in the sequence.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Check if the best sequences meet the template criteria: First, only one best sequence is resulted or multiple equivalent best sequences co-exist only because some ordered pairs have peaks at 0 s. Second, they need to satisfy either (i) <italic>s</italic> &gt; 80% and the all-pair score <italic>q</italic> &gt; 90%, where <italic>q</italic> is the percentage of all possible pairs in the sequence that match with the ordered pairs, or (ii) the nearest-neighbor score <italic>b</italic> &gt; 90%, where <italic>b</italic> is the percentage of all nearest neighbor pairs in the sequence that match with the ordered pairs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>If the template criteria are met, a template sequence is obtained (if multiple equivalent sequences exist, randomly pick one) and the process is terminated. If not, eliminate from the best sequences and the ordered pairs the neuron that had stable relationship with the least number of other neurons. Use the remaining best sequences as initial sequences and repeat from step (2).</p></list-item><list-item><p>If the number of remaining neurons is less than four, the process is terminated and no template is obtained.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Given that there were insufficient numbers of active neurons on some trajectories and that many neurons did not have stable CCs, not all trajectories resulted in a successful template sequence.

Briefly, we transformed a multi-cell spike pattern into a long sequence, according to each neuron’s firing peak times. We then identified segments of the sequence that matched with the template by a rank-order correlation.</p><p>To illustrate the detected sequences, we arranged neurons according to their orders in the template and plotted their spike patterns in the spatial (vs positions on a trajectory, e.g., as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) or temporal (vs time, e.g., as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) domain. For illustration purposes only, peak times/positions of the neurons within each detected sequence were linear-regressed with their ranks in the template. The result was plotted as an angled line to highlight the sequence.</p><p>The absolute number of detected matches with a template sequence depends on the number of neurons in the template, the parameters that transform spike patterns to sequences, and how strict the rank-order correlation criterion is. Therefore, we expressed the number of detected sequences (<italic>n</italic>) as a <italic>Z</italic>-score relative to the chance-level, determined by the following shuffling procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ji and Wilson, 2007</xref>). We randomly shuffled the neurons’ identities and generated 1000 copies of shuffled spike patterns. For each copy, we counted the number of sequences matched with the template. We computed the mean (<italic>m</italic>) and standard deviation (<italic>σ</italic>) of the counts for all the copies. The <italic>Z</italic>-score of <italic>n</italic> is <italic>Z</italic> = <italic>(n</italic> − <italic>m)</italic>/<italic>σ</italic>. The number <italic>n</italic> was considered significant if <italic>Z</italic> &gt; 1.645 (corresponding to p&lt;0.05, <italic>Z</italic>-test). This <italic>Z</italic>-score normalization was a robust measurement of number of sequences, insensitive to the particular choice of a key parameter in the template generation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-5"><title>Sequence location shift</title><p>For each detected matching sequence, we mapped the animal’s locations on the trajectory between the start and end times of the sequence and computed the center between the start and end locations as the sequence’s center location.

If multiple sequences existed in any of the two laps, the distance was computed for every sequence and then averaged as the location shift between the two laps. The location shifts were computed as such for all combinations of laps and their mean value was determined as the location shift for the template sequence on its trajectory.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6"><title>Sequence auto-correlation</title><p>For all sequences identified as matches with a template during a track running and open box session, we computed a temporal and a spatial auto-correlation to examine the periodicity of the sequence occurrence.

This frequency range was chosen because most PSDs in our data showed a peak centered at 8–10 Hz and spanning this range. The PSD values were normalized by the total power at frequencies &gt;2 Hz. The power at ≤2 Hz was not included in the normalization because it was sensitive to the animal’s movement artifacts. The normalized theta power was the integration of the normalized PSD values within 6–12 Hz.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an outstanding and valuable study that provides new evidence on two major issues: A) the findings show that firing sequences of hippocampal principal cells are independent of the external stimuli (locations and other cues) to which they can become bound with experience; B) and the results highlight that, in an AD mouse model, the sequence structure is retained, but the ability to bind the sequences to behavior and location is diminished. The methods are largely straightforward recording and analysis methods for place cells. The analyses for sequence coding are creative and logical, and nicely controlled for a comparison to random sequences. So, the methods are appropriate, and the contrast between poor spatial coding and strong and rigid sequence coding is compelling.</p><p>1) The authors state in the Introduction: “on any given trajectory HP either retrieves stored internal sequences or forms new ones…” Are there data that support this statement? Are these two processes necessarily mutually exclusive, especially on the large scale of a “trajectory”? If not, this should be modified.</p><p>2) The data suggest that the rigid sequences in the mutants are not spatially anchored and thus repeat themselves independent of position. Do the current data allow the authors to estimate the spatial period of this repetition? If so, is there a fixed distance across environments and mice?</p><p>3) The last section of the Results deals with sex differences found in the mutants (males were worse than females). This is surprising given the 2011 Yao et al papers (Neurobio Aging) that found females had greater memory impairments and increased hyperphosphorylation of Tau compared to males. This discrepancy should be discussed.</p><p>4) Is there any evidence of what type of neurons are lost in the mutant’s CA1 (inhibitory vs pyramidal cells)? If so, how does this color your interpretation of the data?</p><p>5) The firing sequence templates used in the study are time templates, not spatial templates, detected via an algorithm based on cell-pair cross-correlation. This algorithm is actively searching for the temporally rigid sequences and we have two related concerns. First, the algorithm selects for animals and sessions that have a better representation of temporal sequences and detects 13 templates in 6 WT mice (2.1/animal) and 8 templates in 8 Tau mice (1/animal), twice more in WT. Given that detection of templates has a stage that eliminates neurons that are not reliably cross-correlated with other neurons, we wonder whether this method artificially enhances the detection of rigid sequences by excluding neurons and consequently sessions from the analysis. Second, the neurons of Tau mice seem to fire over more extended periods of time, while animals explore spatial environments which could give more opportunities for short sequences of 4–5 neurons to be detected, particularly given the case that multiple peaks from CA1 neurons are being considered in the template construction. The authors should address these concerns and show that their method does not artificially enhance the detection of sequences in Tau mice.</p><p>6) The authors should carefully evaluate/discuss which brain areas are affected in the Tau transgenic mice. Alzheimer's disease affects the cholinergic system and the entorhinal cortex, two areas crucial for theta generation and place field expression. Are entorhinal cortex and medial septum affected in these transgenics? The authors should quantify the theta oscillation in WT, Tau, and additional control animals. What does the EEG activity look like during the expression of the rigid sequences in the Tau mice? Related to this, how is the overall activity of CA1 interneurons in the Tau mice? The authors mention that the rigid sequences could be generated in the CA3. Is the CA3 area spared in the Tau animals?</p><p>7) Is there any regularity in the occurrence of the rigid sequences in time?</p><p>8) Aside from movement velocity, differences in the overall behavior of the Tau mice could potentially affect the results. Tau animals could be more confused and turn around more, which would preserve temporal sequences but would affect place cell activity. The authors should analyze animals’ trajectories on the linear tracks and show there are no differences between genotypes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00647.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors state in the Introduction: “on any given trajectory HP either retrieves stored internal sequences or forms new ones…” Are there data that support this statement?

This is surprising given the 2011 Yao et al papers (Neurobio Aging) that found females had greater memory impairments and increased hyperphosphorylation of Tau compared to males. This discrepancy should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>We are grateful for the reference provided (Yue et al., Neurobiol Aging, 2011). We have added the reference and the corresponding paragraph in the Discussion section has been modified. This is a very important reference that provides direct evidence for a sex difference in the transgenic rTg4510 mice. We propose two possible reasons for the discrepancy between this reference and our results. (1) The mice in our study were much older than those in the reference. (2) Tau pathology may affect memory-unrelated factors, such as stress, in female rTg4510 mice more than those in males.</p><p><italic>4) Is there any evidence of what type of neurons are lost in the mutant's CA1 (inhibitory vs pyramidal cells)? If so, how does this color your interpretation of the data</italic>?</p><p>There is evidence that the CamKII gene used to control the transgene expression is not expressed in interneurons. Therefore, although it has not been explicitly studied, the tau pathology and cell death processes are expected to take place only in pyramidal neurons. However, this does not necessarily mean that there would be no changes in interneurons. There could be still adaptive changes. We have computed the firing rates of the limited number of interneurons in our datasets to show that interneurons in Tau mice fired with a lower rate. This type of adaptive change could maintain the overall firing rate of remaining pyramidal neurons at a relatively normal level. The interneuron firing rate result and related discussion are included in the Discussion section, because this is a side result and it is appropriate for the topic at place.</p><p><italic>5) The firing sequence templates used in the study are time templates, not spatial templates, detected via an algorithm based on cell-pair cross-correlation. This algorithm is actively searching for the temporally rigid sequences and we have two related concerns. First, the algorithm selects for animals and sessions that have a better representation of temporal sequences and detects 13 templates in 6 WT mice (2.1/animal) and 8 templates in 8 Tau mice (1/animal), twice more in WT. Given that detection of templates has a stage that eliminates neurons that are not reliably cross-correlated with other neurons, we wonder whether this method artificially enhances the detection of rigid sequences by excluding neurons and consequently sessions from the analysis. Second, the neurons of Tau mice seem to fire over more extended periods of time, while animals explore spatial environments which could give more opportunities for short sequences of 4–5 neurons to be detected, particularly given the case that multiple peaks from CA1 neurons are being considered in the template construction. The authors should address these concerns and show that their method does not artificially enhance the detection of sequences in Tau mice</italic>.</p><p>These are very important concerns. Since we do not know which sequences are “real”, it is hard to measure the “enhancement” of sequence detection. Therefore, we addressed the concerns by analyzing how our sequence detection results depend on (A) the threshold used in the cell-pair selection and (B) the temporal overlap of spikes of multiple cells (especially in Tau mice). The results of this analysis have been presented in Figure 3–figure supplement 4. As the threshold is reduced from a stringent to a low, more relaxed value for cell-pair selection, the number of templates is expectedly increased. However, the mean number of detected sequences (in Z-score) is hardly changed for a wide range of threshold values. Only when the threshold is very low (&lt; 0.08) does the Z-score start to change significantly. Second, to probe the effect of temporal overlap of spiking activities, we binned each spike train in 1-s bins and eliminated spikes within randomly chosen bins. We then computed the number of detected sequence (in Z-score) with the down-sampled spike patterns. The down sampling is to systematically vary the level of spiking overlaps among neurons at a time scale of the sequences detected. We found that the resulted Z-score changes very slowly as more and more spikes are removed. Even with only 40% spikes remaining, the mean Z-scores of WT and Tau mice do not significantly change from the values computed using the original spike patterns. Therefore, although the number of templates and the number of detected sequences inevitably vary with the particular threshold chosen and the specific details in the firing patterns, the normalization (Z-scoring relative to the shuffle-generated number of sequences) provides a robust measure of the sequential structure in the multicell spiking patterns.</p><p><italic>6) The authors should carefully evaluate/discuss which brain areas are affected in the Tau transgenic mice. Alzheimer's disease affects the cholinergic system and the entorhinal cortex, two areas crucial for theta generation and place field expression. Are entorhinal cortex and medial septum affected in these transgenics? The authors should quantify the theta oscillation in WT, Tau, and additional control animals. What does the EEG activity look like during the expression of the rigid sequences in the Tau mice? Related to this, how is the overall activity of CA1 interneurons in the Tau mice? The authors mention that the rigid sequences could be generated in the CA3. Is the CA3 area spared in the Tau animals</italic>?</p><p>(A) We have now added to the Discussion that entorhinal cortex is affected by the pathology more than CA3. The medial septum has not been specifically examined, but should be affected based on the expression pattern of CamKII-tTA (Odeh, et al., Neuroimage, 2011). [Our own histology data could not confirm this without the staining of identified septal cholinergic neurons using antibodies specific to phosphorylated tau.] (B) In the Discussion, we have added that interneurons in Tau mice have lower firing rates than those in WT mice. See the response to point #4. (C) We have now quantified theta oscillations in WT and Tau mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). We found that prominent theta is still present in the local field potentials (LFPs) of Tau mice. Although the absolute LFP power is lower in Tau mice, as expected by the cell loss, the proportion of theta power is comparable between WT and Tau mice. Restricting the analysis to LFPs within rigid sequences returned a similar result. (D) Based on the result of EEG analysis and the structural differences in the pathology, we propose that CA3 plays a major role in driving the rigid sequences in Tau mice.</p><p><italic>7) Is there any regularity in the occurrence of the rigid sequences in time</italic>?</p><p>We have examined the temporal periodicity of Tau sequences and found no sign of periodic occurrence of Tau sequence in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). See also the response to point #2.</p><p><italic>8) Aside from movement velocity, differences in the overall behavior of the Tau mice could potentially affect the results. Tau animals could be more confused and turn around more, which would preserve temporal sequences but would affect place cell activity. The authors should analyze animals’ trajectories on the linear tracks and show there are no differences between genotypes</italic>.</p><p>Besides number of laps completed per session and running speed, we have added several additional parameters to quantify the animals’ trajectories: the total travel distance per lap (which captures the turning around behavior), the number of stops per lap, and the mean duration of stopping per lap. The results, as well as example raw running trajectories, are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. The total travel distance and stopping duration were found to be similar between WT and Tau mice.</p></body></sub-article></article>
