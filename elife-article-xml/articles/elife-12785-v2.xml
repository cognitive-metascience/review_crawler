This decision involves delaying expression of Cyclin E that promotes DNA replication. ORC1, the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) large subunit, is inherited into newly born cells after it binds to condensing chromosomes during the preceding mitosis. We demonstrate that ORC1 represses Cyclin E gene (<italic>CCNE1</italic>) transcription, an E2F1 activated gene that is also repressed by the Retinoblastoma (RB) protein. ORC1 binds to RB, the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 and to its repressive histone H3K9me3 mark. ORC1 cooperates with SUV39H1 and RB protein to repress E2F1-dependent <italic>CCNE1</italic> transcription. In contrast, the ORC1-related replication protein CDC6 binds Cyclin E-CDK2 kinase and in a feedback loop removes RB from ORC1, thereby hyper-activating <italic>CCNE1</italic> transcription. The opposing effects of ORC1 and CDC6 in controlling the level of Cyclin E ensures genome stability and a mechanism for linking directly DNA replication and cell division commitment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12785.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12785.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12785.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells must replicate their DNA before they divide so that the newly formed cells can each receive an identical copy of the genetic material. Before DNA replication can begin, a number of proteins must come together to form so-called pre-replicative complexes at many locations along the DNA molecules. These protein complexes then serve as landing pads for many other DNA replication proteins.</p><p>One component of the pre-replicative complex, a protein called ORC1, helps to recruit another protein called CDC6 that in turn acts with Cyclin E to promote the replication of the DNA. Cyclin E is a protein that is only expressed when cells commit to divide. Previous research has shown that a lack of ORC1 causes the levels of Cyclin E to rise in human cells, but it was not understood how cells regulate the levels of Cyclin E.</p><p>Now, Hossain and Stillman show that the ORC1 protein switches off the gene that encodes Cyclin E early on in newly born cells, and therefore prevents the Cyclin E protein from being produced. The experiments show that ORC1 does this by binding near one end of the gene for Cyclin E and interacting with two other proteins to inactivate the gene. Thus, ORC1 establishes a period when Cyclin E is absent from a newly formed cell. This essentially gives the cell time to ‘decide’ (based on external cues and its own signaling) whether it will divide again or enter into a non-dividing state.</p><p>When a cell does decide to divide, the levels of CDC6 rise. CDC6 is another component of the pre-replicative complex and Hossain and Stillman find that CDC6 works to counteract the effects of ORC1 and reactivate the gene for Cyclin E. This activity leads to a dramatic increase in the production of Cyclin E, which in turn allows the cells to commit to another round of DNA replication and division.</p><p>The opposing effects of ORC1 and CDC6 control the levels of Cyclin E and provide a link between DNA replication and a cell’s decision to divide. Further work is now needed to see whether ORC1 inactivates other genes in addition to the one that encodes Cyclin E.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12785.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12785.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DNA Replication</kwd><kwd>transcription repression</kwd><kwd>histone methyltransferase</kwd><kwd>retinoblastoma protein</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>restriction point</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA13106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stillman</surname><given-names>Bruce</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA45508</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stillman</surname><given-names>Bruce</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two related DNA replication initiation proteins contribute to the decision of whether to enter a new round of the cell division cycle or enter into a period of proliferative quiescence.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In addition to its role in the initiation of DNA replication, ORC1, the largest subunit of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) controls Cyclin E-dependent duplication of centrosomes and centrioles in cells by acting as an inhibitor of Cyclin E-CDK2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hemerly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hossain and Stillman, 2012</xref>).

This decision is made by a complex regulatory process known as START in yeast and the restriction point in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson and Skotheim, 2013</xref>). Key among these regulators are the Cyclin D-CDK4/6 kinases that mono-phosphorylate the retinoblastoma (RB) protein and contributes to the release of repression of E2F-transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Narasimha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ewen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hinds et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lundberg and Weinberg, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Resnitzky et al., 1994</xref>).

Here, we demonstrate that ORC1 is required for repression of the gene encoding Cyclin E and that CDC6 is involved in relieving the repression in cooperation with Cyclin E-CDK2.

RB binds other binding partners dependent on a canonical LxCxE motif and although ORC1 has a conserved LPCR<sup>D</sup>/<sub>E</sub> sequence, it was not required for the interaction between ORC1 and RB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Consistent with this finding, two pocket mutants within RB (R661W and N757F) that are defective in binding to LxCxE containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Wang, 2000</xref>) showed no defect in binding to ORC1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) or in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In fact, the mutant RB proteins bound ORC1 better than the wild type, perhaps due to loss of competition between ORC1 and other RB binding proteins or due to conformational changes in RB. When Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-RB fusion protein was expressed in cells with ORC1-Flag-tagged protein, the ORC1-Flag protein bound WT and pocket mutant RB, but other ORC subunits did not bind to RB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We confirmed this observation by showing that immunoprecipitation with anti-ORC2 or anti-ORC3 antibodies failed to precipitate GFP-RB or its mutants, but did bind ORC1-Flag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Given that the ORC1-RB interaction is independent of other ORC subunits, it suggests that ORC1 has additional functions that are separate from its role in DNA replication.</p><p>The phosphorylation of RB is an important step that relieves repression of E2F target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rubin, 2013</xref>).

Specifically, it has been suggested that RB binds to the SUV39H1 histone methyltransferase that tri-methylates histone H3K9 and then HP1α binds to histone H3K9me3 and that these direct interactions contribute to repression of <italic>CCNE1</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nielsen et al., 2001</xref>). It is important to note, however, that others suggested that another protein mediates the RB-SUV39H1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vandel et al., 2001</xref>). Since ORC1 interacts with both RB and HP1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>), we tested whether ORC1 also interacts with SUV39H1. Using purified proteins we found that both RB and ORC1 directly bound to SUV39H1, and ORC1 directly bound to CDC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saha et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Under these conditions, ORC1 bound to HP1α weakly, but the binding increased when higher levels of GST-HP1α were added, consistent with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>). Although both RB and ORC1 directly interacted with SUV39H1, ORC1 bound SUV39H1 much better than RB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Consistent with the in vitro data, we observed that anti-SUV39H1 antibodies precipitated ORC1 and RB in the RB-positive cells (U2OS and MCF7), with ORC1 being the predominant interacting protein in MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, the interaction between SUV39H1 with ORC1 protein did not require RB because anti-ORC1 antibodies co-precipitated SUV39H1 from RB-negative SaOS-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This observation was confirmed when GFP-RB or GFP-ORC1 were transiently expressed with T7-SUV39H1 in 293 cells; ORC1 more readily bound to SUV39H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), whereas higher levels of GFP-RB were required to observe an interaction with SUV39H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Domain mapping demonstrated that SUV39H1 interacted with ORC1 through its SET domain containing C-terminus, which is required for its histone methyltransferase (HMT) activity. Moreover, SUV39H1 interacted with ORC1 and ORC1 mutants that could not be phosphorylated by Cyclin-CDK and did not interact in a complex with other ORC subunits, similar to the ORC1-RB interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>). These data suggest that the ORC1-SUV39H1 interaction does not require other ORC subunits or CDK phosphorylation of ORC1, and therefore ORC1 plays a role independent of its role in DNA replication.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12785.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ORC1 binds SUV39H1 to control Cyclin E gene transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Purified MBP-ORC1 and various GST-fused proteins were mixed and proteins bound in a GST-pull down were detected by immunoblotting with anti-MBP antibodies.

In fact, the Cdc6 'Cy' mutant acted as a dominant negative to prevent normal Cyclin E expression. Consistent with these results, overexpression of CDC6 wild type but not its 'Cy' mutant further enhanced E2F1-DP1 activated transcription from the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Based on these data, we suggest that CDC6 co-operates with Cyclin E-CDK2 kinase to abolish the interaction between RB and ORC1, contributing to alleviating the repression imposed by RB on the <italic>CCNE1</italic> gene, leading to <italic>CCNE1</italic> gene transcription.</p><p>Data presented so far suggests that ORC1-mediated <italic>CCNE1</italic> transcriptional repression also requires SUV39H1. We therefore transfected into RB<sup>+</sup> U2OS cells a <italic>CCNE1</italic>-luciferase reporter plasmid with E2F1-DP1 and depleted ORC1, SUV39H1 or CDC6 using siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Depletion of either ORC1 or SUV39H1 with two different siRNAs led to significant increases in <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter activity above its basal, E2F1/DP1-dependent level. In contrast, depletion of CDC6 protein had no effect on the basal, E2F1/DP1-dependent promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We further investigated the binding to the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter of SUV39H1 and the presence of its product, the histone H3K9me3 mark, upon depletion of ORC1 protein in asynchronously growing U2OS cells by ChIP assay. Upon depletion of ORC1 compared to control siRNA the methyltransferase activity of SUV39H1 was drastically reduced on the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter as evident by a dramatic reduction in the histone H3K9m3 mark at the promoter, while the binding of SUV39H1 was only slightly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The reduced binding of H3K9me3 was most evident within the region -280 to -143 of the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter, where ORC1 binding was centered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Depletion of ORC1 also resulted in reduced levels of the histone H3K9me3 mark as well as a slight reduction in the level of SUV39H1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Our results support the hypothesis that ORC1 is involved in transcription repression by recruiting the SUV39H1 protein, which thereby creates the histone H3K9me3 transcriptional repressor mark on <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12785.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>ORC1 depletion decreases association of SUV39H1 and H3K9me3 with the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter and increases <italic>CCNE1</italic> gene transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>CCNE1</italic>-luciferase reporter assay in U2OS cells.

In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and animal cells, ORC, including human ORC1, binds the HP1 proteins that are often involved in transcriptional repression, but a direct link between this interaction and transcription repression has not been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badugu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lidonnici et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pak et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sasaki and Gilbert, 2007</xref>). In this report, we have established opposing roles for ORC1 and CDC6 in control of transcription of the Cyclin E gene <italic>CCNE1</italic>. ORC1, with RB and SUV39H1, bind to the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter adjacent to the E2F1 transcription factor binding sites and repress the E2F1-dependent promoter and this repression is relieved by CDC6 that is bound to Cyclin E-CDK2 kinase. Consistent with this model, CDC6 binds to the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter transiently, just at the time during G1 phase when Cyclin E levels increase dramatically. We suggest that low levels of both Cyclin E and CDC6, both E2F1-controlled genes, appear upon activation of Cyclin D-CDK4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Narasimha et al., 2014</xref>). The expression of CDC6-Cyclin E-CDK2 provides positive feedback, disrupting the repressive RB-ORC1 interaction. The disruption of RB-ORC1 interaction further weakens ORC1 association the with promoter and results in a dramatic reduction in the repressive histone H3K9me3 mark at the promoter, increasing <italic>CCNE1</italic> gene transcription and amplifying the levels of CDC6 and Cyclin E-CDK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, bottom panel). The opposing expression levels of ORC1 and CDC6 during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, top panel) are consistent with this model. The production of higher levels of Cyclin E-CDK2 and CDC6 can then function in pre-RC assembly, as they are known to do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cook et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coverley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hateboer et al., 1998</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12785.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model showing contrasting roles of DNA replication proteins ORC1 and CDC6 in the regulation of <italic>CCNE1</italic> transcription and commitment to pre-RC assembly and cell division.</title><p>Top panel summarizes the cycle levels of ORC1 and CDC6.

Interestingly, HP1 is known to bind both SUV39H1 and ORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stewart et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, ORC1 participates in multiple protein-protein interactions to ensure stable repression of <italic>CCNE1</italic> and perhaps other E2F1-regulated genes during early G1 phase.</p><p>In this way ORC1, which binds mitotic chromosomes and is then inherited into the daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Okuno et al., 2001</xref>), creates an opportunity to repress <italic>CCNE1</italic> gene transcription and allow the newborn cells time to integrate information to decide whether to proliferate or exit the cell division cycle. If proliferation and cell division are destined to occur, Cyclin D-CDK4/6 mono-phosphorylates RB and primes it for Cyclin E-dependent activation of E2F regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Narasimha et al., 2014</xref>). We show that low levels of CDC6-Cycin-E-CDK2 can, in a feedback loop, amplify this commitment by antagonizing ORC1-RB interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Consistent with the model, we demonstrated that over-expression of CDC6, but not a CDC6 that cannot bind Cyclin E, enhances the levels of endogenous Cyclin E during the very earliest period of G1 phase. Cell-cycle regulated Cyclin E is essential for maintenance of genome stability since cancer cells that have de-regulated Cyclin E fail to produce sufficient pre-RCs during G1 phase and as a consequence have problems in S phase and accumulate DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ekholm-Reed et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Odajima et al., 2010</xref>). Of interest is our observation that at the time CDC6 is recruited to the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter, ORC1 binding to the promoter declines.</p><p>In human cells, ORC1 shows a dynamic, temporally regulated nuclear localization pattern such that in early G1 phase it is distributed in a punctate pattern throughout the nucleus, but in late G1 phase, ORC1 predominantly binds to regions of the genome that replicate late in the subsequent S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kara et al., 2015</xref>). We suggest that the events that occur at the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter, ORC1 binding first and recruitment of SUV39H1 and RB, followed by recruitment of Cyclin E-CDK2 and CDC6, may occur at many ORC1 binding sites in the genome, even those sites that are destined to assemble the entire ORC protein and promote pre-RC formation. SUV39H1 binding to ORC1 may influence its temporally dynamic nuclear localization during G1 phase. Such a scenario may also explain observations that have implicated a role for RB in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosco et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kennedy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sterner et al., 1998</xref>).

Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter luciferase plasmid (p10-4), 50 ng E2F1 plasmid, 50 ng of DP1 plasmid and 20 ng LacZ plasmid. Together with above plasmids, the cells were also transfected either with ORC1-Flag or its mutants, ORC3-Flag, ORC4-Flag, T7-SUV39H1, GFP-SUV39H1 or its mutant, GFP-CDC6 or its mutant for overexpression at the indicated amounts in micrograms. The cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) for 24 hr. For GAL4-based luciferase assay, the U2OS cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of GAL4-UAS-Luciferase promoter plasmid and 20 ng of LacZ plasmid along with GAL4-DBD fused ORC1 or SUV39H1 at the indicated amounts. In each of the experiments, the amount of plasmid was kept constant by the addition of empty vector DNA. For siRNA-mediated depletion of proteins and luciferase measurement, 100 nM of specific siRNAs targeting ORC1, SUV39H1 or CDC6 were used together with p10-4, E2F1/DP1 and LacZ plasmids. GFP siRNA is used as negative control. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smale, 2010</xref>), while luciferase activity was measured using luciferase (Promega) luminescent assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activities and denoted as relative light units (RLU). Expression or depletion of proteins was confirmed by Western blot. All the experiments were done in triplicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation</title><p>MCF7 and U2OS cells were used for chromatin immunoprecipitation. The cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed with cold PBS. The cells (3.0x10<sup>7</sup>) were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The cross-linking was stopped by addition 125 mM of glycine for 5 min on ice. The fixed cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed for 10 min on ice with buffer containing 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.4% NP40, 1 mM DTT, 10% Glycerol, protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that ORC1 was most efficiently extracted from the resulting cells by digestion of the cross-linked chromatin with micrococcal nuclease (MNase; Sigma) and extraction with high salt (300–600 mM NaCl). Thus, the nuclei were treated with MNase with 1 mM CaCl2 at 37°C (so that most of the extracted DNA ran on an agarose gel as ~1–4 nucleosome length), the reaction was quenched with 2 mM EGTA and washed with buffer containing 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 10% Glycerol, protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The pelleted residual nuclei were further lysed in buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.05% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% IGE-PAL, 1 mM PMSF and protease/phosphatase inhibitors for 30 min at 4°C with rotation. The lysate was further diluted to bring the salt concentration to 200 mM and sonicated very briefly. The lysate was centrifuged (20,800 X g in an Eppendorf centrifuge) at 4°C to pellet down the debris and supernatant was used for pre-clearing with protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 2 hr 4°C. The antibodies were bound to protein G Dynabeads for 5 hr at 4°C in PBS containing 0.5% BSA. The antibodies used for chromatin immunoprecipitation were as follows: mouse monoclonal ORC1 [78-1-172; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kara et al., 2015</xref>)], mouse RB (#9309, Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal SUV39H1 (A302-128A; Bethyl Laboratories), rabbit polyclonal CDC6 (CS1881), rabbit polyclonal histone H3K9me3 (ab8898, Abcam) as well as control mouse and rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). Pre-cleared nuclear extracts was incubated with antibody-bound beads overnight with rotation at 4°C. 0.4 ml of the nuclear extract was used for each IP and 0.1 ml was kept aside for 'Input' in Q-PCR analysis. Beads were then washed with three times with low-salt buffer (20 mM Tris pH8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.05% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% IGE-PAL, 1 mM PMSF), three times high-salt buffer (20 mM Tris pH8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.05% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% IGE-PAL, 1 mM PMSF), three times with lithium chloride buffer (20 mM Tris pH8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.05% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% IGE-PAL, 1 mM PMSF) and twice with TE buffer (10 mM Tris pH8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Chromatin was eluted from beads twice with 100 ul elution buffer (100 mM sodium bicarbonate, 1% SDS) at room temperature. Protein-DNA crosslinks in the IP samples as well as in input samples were reversed overnight by addition of 300 mM NaCl and 2 ug RNase A at 65°C. The ChIP and input samples were then incubated with 60 ug of proteinase K for 2 hr at 42°C. The samples were further extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alchol [IAA] (once for ChIP and twice for input) and once with chloroform extraction. The ethanol precipitation were done by adding 10 ug of glycogen, washed with 70% ethanol, air dried and then re-suspended in 50 ul of RNase-DNase free water. The purified DNA was used as template in different PCR amplifications (Applied Biosystems Thermocycler). The sequences of the various primers is listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Due to very high GC content of human <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter, the number of PCR cycles was extensively and independently optimized with different DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>) for each primer set to maintain linear amplification in all experiments. PCR products were resolved by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Images of ethidium bromide-stained DNAs were acquired using an UV trans-illuminator equipped with a digital camera. Intensities of the amplified PCR bands were quantitated by ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data are shown as the average ± the standard deviation (SD) of results of at least three independent experiments. In the luciferase assay, the statistical differences between cells overexpressing ORC1 and/or SUV39H1 or CDC6 or no E2F1/DP1 were compared to E2F1/DP1 alone without overexpression, and statistically evaluated by Student’s t test analysis. The lines above the bar graph were used to indicate the statistical differences between overexpressing samples. In the luciferase assay with depletion of specific proteins, the statistical differences between siRNAs against the ORC1, SUV39H1 or CDC6 were compared to control GFP siRNA using the Student’s t test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Patty Wendel for technical assistance and Jaclyn Jansen for commenting on the manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Michael Botchan, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript builds on a deep vein pursued for many years in the Stillman laboratory focused on the functions of the ORC-1 protein in human cells. As the central ATPase and the major DNA binding subunit of the ORC complex, ORC1 is of course key for the initiation of DNA replication; the protein also functions in the regulation of centrosomes and centrioles in direct ways through its negative regulation of Cyclin E-dependent CDK activity. The present story ostensibly is about the roles of ORC1 in negative regulation of the transcription of the Cyclin E gene (<italic>CCNE1</italic>) through the recruitment of SUV39H1, binding directly to the proximal regulatory regions of the gene. The model put forward is that together with Rb, E2F1/DP and HP1 the transcription is turned down. The work then builds upon the finding that Cdc6 interferes in many of their assays with this negative regulation. All together a fascinating and potentially exciting proposal is made that links all of this into a model for how an autocatalytic stimulatory cascade, starting with cyclin D/Cdk activity in early G1 might feed into a control for a switch to enough Cyclin E expression to execute progression through the restriction point. We believe that the work is at present not yet ready for a publication in <italic>eLife</italic> but would be with further critical new studies that substantiate the overarching and exciting new ideas.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The work does present many experiments that support the conclusions and certainly the biochemical studies establish many of the protein/protein interactions critical for the models. Si RNA to ORC1 does lead to enhanced Cyclin E gene mRNA and <italic>CCNE1</italic> reporter constructs transfected with ORC1 or mutants of ORC1 respond as predicted and are antagonized by CDC6 expression. Many other such experiments are consistent with the central proposals as are the scholarly arguments tying together points from the literature. However, one finds most of the cell-based findings dependent upon over-expression of recombinant proteins and acute transfection protocols.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Depletion of ORC1 protein does lead to more mRNA for <italic>CCNE1</italic> but might that result be indirect? ORC1 can bind to many proteins, including the targets defined here. Therefore it is essential for this work to show directly that, under normal progression, ORC1 binds to the endogenous gene (where?), along with Rb, the methylase – or HP1 and E2F1, and that, upon progression, the CDC6 protein actually replaces the repressive components with a loss of local Rb.</p><p>2) There are no chromatin binding experiments (ChIP), which would be required to make definitive conclusions. In particular, the authors would need to show using ChIP that ORC1, RB, and Suv39h1 are recruited at the appropriate stage of the cell cycle and that the result of such binding is transcriptional repression. This comment from reviewer #2 overlaps with #1 but adds the following: functional, gene ablation experiments should also be performed, again, by studying physiological levels of each protein without protein over-production.</p><p>3) From reviewer #3: The paper has many luciferase reporter assays to show the repression of a transiently transfected CCNE promoter by over-expressed Rb+ORC1+SUV39H1. What is missing is a clear demonstration that (a) the endogenous CCNE promoter is epigenetically repressed by the recruitment of this ORC1-dependent complex under normal levels of expression of E2F1/DP1, Rb, ORC1 and SUV39H1 and (b) that the physical interaction of endogenous levels of ORC1 with Rb and SUV39H1 is essential for this regulation. If this deficit is rectified, there could be two papers: &quot;ORC1 inhibits CCNE by epigenetic modification of the CCNE promoter&quot; and &quot;CDC6 together with Cyclin E-CDK2, disrupts an ORC1-RB-SUV39H1 repressor complex to activate the CCNE promoter&quot;. While we do not suggest writing two papers the authors should in a revision more completely describe how CDC6 actually works for activation (see below #9).</p><p>4) siORC1 increases cyclin E mRNA 1.3-1.4X. This is the result that put the investigators on the way to this interesting hypothesis. However, the hypothesis makes some clear predictions that have not been tested: does siORC1 decrease H3K9me3 marks on the CCNE promoter? Does siORC1 decrease the association of Rb and of SUV39H1 at the CCNE promoter?</p><p>5) If ORC1 represses the CCNE promoter in early G1 by facilitating the Rb-SUV39H1 complex, another important test will be to show that ORC1 ChIPs to the CCNE promoter, in an Rb dependent manner at the E2F1/DP1 ChIP sites. This experiment is of course another suggestion for testing a major conclusion and other approaches may suffice.</p><p>6) The interaction of ORC1 with RB or with SUV39H1 is at the center of this hypothetical repressor complex. To prove this hypothesis the authors need to find a well defined amino acid change or mutant in ORC1 that disrupts this interaction and demonstrate that such a mutant ORC1 fails to repress the cyclin E promoter in the reporter assays used. Even better, if an ORC1 resistant to Si RNA is available and used, then such a mutant ORC1 should fail to restore normal expression of CCNE when endogenous ORC1 has been knocked down by siRNA.</p><p>7) Since the ORC1-SUV39H1 interaction occurs in the absence of Rb, does siORC1 still de-repress CCNE mRNA in Rb- cells such as SaOS-2. In other words, is Rb required for the repression by ORC1 on the endogenous CCNE promoter?</p><p>8) 293 cells express adenovirus E1A, believed to inactivate Rb. Despite this, overexpressed of GFP-Rb interacts with ORC1. Is this sufficient to repress the endogenous CCNE promoter despite the presence of E1A? Will this increase H3K9me2 to the CCNE promoter?</p><p>9) Similar experiments are necessary to show that endogenous CDC6 de-represses the endogenous CCNE promoter by disrupting the endogenous Rb-ORC1-Suv39H1 complex, but as said above, this might require writing two papers if the experiments are difficult and time consuming.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12785.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Depletion of ORC1 protein does lead to more mRNA for CCNE1 but might that result be indirect?

At the time of initial submission of this paper to <italic>eLife</italic>, we tried to do conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays for ORC1 protein but our attempts failed due to highly GC-rich region of <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter. The region -363 to +63 of <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter is 85% GC rich, where all of the E2F1 sites lie and RB protein binds. Thus conventional ChIP-seq experiments did not work. Because of the reviewers’ comments, we invested considerable time in designing specific primer pairs that would allow detection of protein binding using ChIP and PCR. We also optimized the immunoprecipitation protocol using a monoclonal anti-ORC1 antibody that we made that specifically immunoprecipitates human ORC1 and found that ChIP using this antibody best worked with chromatin fragmented by micrococcal nuclease, followed by salt extraction from nuclei (ORC1 is known to bind tightly with a nuclear structure). Using this new protocol and synchronization of cells into early G1 phase, we were able to detect binding of ORC1, SUV39H1 and RB to the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter in early G1 phase and transient CDC6 binding to the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter precisely at the time when the promoter is activated in vivo. In the revised manuscript, we provide the data for binding ORC1, RB, SUV39H1, H3K9me3 and CDC6 proteins to the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter in asynchronously growing MCF7 cells as well as in synchronized U2OS cells.</p><p><italic>2) There are no chromatin binding experiments (ChIP), which would be required to make definitive conclusions.

The U2OS cells were arrested with nocodazole and released for different times (as indicated in manuscript) and the fragmented chromatin immunoprecipitated using ORC1, RB, SUV39H1 and CDC6 antibodies to determine both the location and time of binding to the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter. We have also performed functional gene ablation experiments by depletion of ORC1 in U2OS cells and investigated the binding of histone H3K9me3 and SUV39H1 to the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter. Our new results show that upon ORC1 depletion, the H3K9me3 mark is drastically reduced at the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter, as well as slight reduction in SUV39H1 binding.</p><p><italic>3) From reviewer #3: The paper has many luciferase reporter assays to show the repression of a transiently transfected CCNE promoter by over-expressed Rb+ORC1+SUV39H1. What is missing is a clear demonstration that (a) the endogenous CCNE promoter is epigenetically repressed by the recruitment of this ORC1-dependent complex under normal levels of expression of E2F1/DP1, Rb, ORC1 and SUV39H1 and (b) that the physical interaction of endogenous levels of ORC1 with Rb and SUV39H1 is essential for this regulation.

While we do not suggest writing two papers the authors should in a revision more completely describe how CDC6 actually works for activation (see below #9).</italic></p><p>We do not suggest that there is “epigenetic” repression because this would imply inheritance for multiple generations, but we suggest that this system is reset every cell cycle so that a decision can be made about expression of Cyclin E. We suggest that repression is caused by DNA binding proteins recruited to the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter and establishment of a histone H3K9me3 mark that can bind HP1. The combination of ORC1, RB and SUV39H1 results in the repressive histone H3K9me3 mark at the promoter. We provide new data that shows that this repressive mark on the endogenous promoter is dependent on ORC1. Furthermore, our new data from synchronized U2OS cells shows binding of ORC1, RB, SUV39H1 to the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter in early G1 phase and then at the time when Cyclin E levels increase, CDC6 is transiently recruited to the endogenous <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter. These data are entirely consistent with our model that ORC1 and CDC6 have opposing roles in control of <italic>CCNE1</italic> gene transcription. The experiments were done under normal levels of expression of E2F1/DP1, RB, ORC1 and SUV39H1 proteins. The significance of CDC6 in transcriptional activation is more elaborated in the revised manuscript. Entirely consistent with the model, we showed that increased expression of CDC6 actually causes increases in endogenous Cyclin E protein levels very early in G1 phase. We prefer to keep all the data in a single paper, albeit it now has increased in size due to the new data.</p><p><italic>4) siORC1 increases cyclin E mRNA 1.3-1.4X. This is the result that put the investigators on the way to this interesting hypothesis. However, the hypothesis makes some clear predictions that have not been tested: does siORC1 decrease H3K9me3 marks on the CCNE promoter? Does siORC1 decrease the association of Rb and of SUV39H1 at the CCNE promoter?</italic></p><p>We have now performed ChIP with H3K9me3 and Suv39h1 antibodies on the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter following siRNA mediated depletion of endogenous Orc1 protein. There is a dramatic reduction in the repressive H3K9me3 mark at the promoter following ORC1 depletion. The results are presented in the revised manuscript and its significance discussed.</p><p><italic>5) If ORC1 represses the CCNE promoter in early G1 by facilitating the Rb-SUV39H1 complex, another important test will be to show that ORC1 ChIPs to the CCNE promoter, in an Rb dependent manner at the E2F1/DP1 ChIP sites. This experiment is of course another suggestion for testing a major conclusion and other approaches may suffice.</italic></p><p>In the original manuscript we did not emphasize that ORC1 is recruited in an RB dependent manner, but we have stressed that ORC1 protein binds more strongly to SUV39H1 and is responsible, in part, for recruiting SUV39H1 to the <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter.</p><p><italic>6) The interaction of ORC1 with RB or with SUV39H1 is at the center of this hypothetical repressor complex. To prove this hypothesis the authors need to find a well defined amino acid change or mutant in ORC1 that disrupts this interaction and demonstrate that such a mutant ORC1 fails to repress the cyclin E promoter in the reporter assays used. Even better, if an ORC1 resistant to Si RNA is available and used, then such a mutant ORC1 should fail to restore normal expression of CCNE when endogenous ORC1 has been knocked down by siRNA.</italic></p><p>We have spent considerable time and effort mapping the interactions between RB and ORC1 on one hand and ORC1 and SUV39H1 on the other. We prefer not to put this data in the paper since it has proven to be really complicated and is not yet complete for publication. For example, we have the mapped the region in ORC1 required for binding the SUV39H1 protein using in vitro interactions, but when mutant versions were used in vivo, it was not as straight forward as the in vitro data. We suspect that this might be due to the fact that RB interacts also with SUV39H1. We also mapped the regions of ORC1 that interacts with RB and found that the N-terminus of ORC1 binds the C-terminus of RB, but in addition, the C-terminus of ORC1 binds the N-terminus of RB. Thus the interaction between ORC1 and RB involves two separate domains in both proteins. Thus, in the present study, it was difficult to map the minimal interaction region in ORC1 required to bind either SUV39H1 or RB proteins and do the experiments suggested. We are continuing to study these protein-protein interactions, but think the new additional data strengthens our paper without this protein interaction data.</p><p><italic>7) Since the ORC1-SUV39H1 interaction occurs in the absence of Rb, does siORC1 still de-repress CCNE mRNA in Rb- cells such as SaOS-2. In other words, is Rb required for the repression by ORC1 on the endogenous CCNE promoter?</italic></p><p>In order to address the effect of ORC1 depletion in RB negative SaOS-2 cells, we first compared protein levels of the two osteosarcoma cell lines, U2OS (RB<sup>+/+</sup>) and SaOS-2 (RB<sup>-/-</sup>). To our surprise, compared to U2OS cells, the level of cyclin E was extremely low in the RB negative SaOS-2 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>), while we detect comparable levels of ORC1, SUV39H1, Cyclin A, ORC3 and tubulin proteins in both cell lines. This data shows that apart from RB, other proteins in SaOS-2 cells must control the level of cyclin E or that the Cyclin E gene promoter is altered by mutation. Furthermore, upon ORC1 depletion, the <italic>CCNE1</italic> mRNA increased slightly by 48hr in asynchronously growing SaOS-2 cells. We chose not to include this data in the revised manuscript because it looks as if the SaOS2 cells have very low levels of Cyclin E independent of RB and figuring this out will be a distraction from the main point of our paper.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12785.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Protein levels in U2OS cells and SaOS-2 cells detected by immunoblot.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12785.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12785.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-12785-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>8) 293 cells express adenovirus E1A, believed to inactivate Rb.

There is a paper published in 2014 by Park et al. (PMID: 24728993), wherein they have shown that phosphorylation of SUV39H1 by CyclinE-CDK2 (or CyclinA-CDK2) preferentially dissociates it from chromatin. Thus CDC6/Cyclin E-CDK2 cooperation might also lead to SUV39H1 phosphorylation and ultimately leading to falling apart of critical proteins involved in repressor complex. We have shown in our paper that CDC6 expression can activate the endogenous <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter in very early G1 phase and that this activation requires CDC6 binding to Cyclin E-CDK2. This is entirely consistent with our model.</p></body></sub-article></article>
