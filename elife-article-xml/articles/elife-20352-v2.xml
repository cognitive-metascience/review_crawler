pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20352.001</object-id><p>Many cancers overexpress one or more of the six human pro-survival BCL2 family proteins to evade apoptosis. To determine which BCL2 protein or proteins block apoptosis in different cancers, we computationally designed three-helix bundle protein inhibitors specific for each BCL2 pro-survival protein. Following in vitro optimization, each inhibitor binds its target with high picomolar to low nanomolar affinity and at least 300-fold specificity. Expression of the designed inhibitors in human cancer cell lines revealed unique dependencies on BCL2 proteins for survival which could not be inferred from other BCL2 profiling methods. Our results show that designed inhibitors can be generated for each member of a closely-knit protein family to probe the importance of specific protein-protein interactions in complex biological processes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20352.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20352.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

tightly controlled process, involving both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic proteins that regulate permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. As cells enter apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane permeability increases, releasing mitochondrial factors such as cytochrome <italic>c</italic> that initiate destructive protease cascades in the cytosol. The key regulators of mitochondrial outer membrane permeability are B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) family proteins which are categorized functionally by their effect on cell fate, and structurally by the presence of BCL2 homology (BH) motifs. Pro-apoptotic effector proteins Bak and Bax have four distinct BH motifs and homo-oligomerize upon activation to form pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane, committing the cell to apoptosis. Pro-survival homologs (six in humans: Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, Bfl-1 and Bcl-B) are structurally similar, but oppose apoptosis by binding and inhibiting Bak and Bax, as well as sequestering pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins (BOPs). BOPs can also activate effectors directly through transient binding interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Walensky et al., 2006</xref>) or indirectly by binding pro-survival proteins and out-competing bound effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ku et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Willis et al., 2007</xref>) or other direct activator BOPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuwana et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Letai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Interactions between BCL2 members are mediated by an amphipathic, helical BH3 motif that recognizes a conserved hydrophobic cleft present in the effectors and pro-survival proteins. The balanced network of interactions between pro-apoptotic and pro-survival members can be tipped toward cell death by cellular stress signals that induce transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Essafi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakano and Vousden, 2001</xref>) or post-translational modification of BOPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Desagher et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fricker et al., 2010</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shamas-Din et al., 2011</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20352.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of BCL2 family interactions.</title><p>BCL2 proteins are categorized by their net effect on cell fate and the presence of shared structural domains. BH3-only proteins (BOPs) are sequestered by pro-survival homologs (labels <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>), and some BOPs may activate the direct effectors Bak and Bax by disrupting their inhibition by pro-survival proteins (<bold>3a</bold>) and/or promoting their homo-oligomerization (<bold>3b</bold>).

An SSM library based on M-CDP02 was sorted as described above (sort conditions in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1E</xref>). Mutations that enhance the affinity of M-CDP02 for BCL2 members other than Mcl-1 include prolines in the first and third helical segments, substitutions of apolar to polar amino acids in the hydrophobic core, and premature stop codons in the third helix. These mutations likely cause unfolding of the helix bundle and expose the Bim-BH3-like motif in the second helix, thus converting a protein that binds Mcl-1 with high affinity and partial specificity to a pan-specific high-affinity binder similar to the Bim-BH3 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, none of these destabilizing mutations were enriched during the evolution of the individual computational designs explicitly targeting each BCL2 homolog. Thus, using our experimental approach, computational design is necessary to provide partially-specific starting points for evolution which are superior to a non-specific construct.</p><p>For X-CDP07, W-CDP03, F-CDP01 and B-CDP01, combinatorial libraries were constructed containing the mutations that produced the greatest increase in specificity (highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1F</xref>), and sorted by FACS for multiple rounds under increasingly stringent conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1E</xref>). Each library converged on a small number of enriched combinatorial mutants (ECMs), which were screened by BLI. We anticipated that only a small number of substitutions in the moderately-specific 2-CDP06 design would be necessary to achieve high specificity for Bcl-2. Thus, in lieu of generating a combinatorial library, single amino acid mutants were screened with BLI, and three mutations improving both specificity and affinity were combined in αBCL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1F</xref>).</p><p>While X-ECM04 and W-ECM01 (hereafter called αBCLXL and αBCLW) have high affinity and excellent specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–I</xref>), F-ECM04 and B-ECM01 exhibited less than 100-fold specificity for their targets. These sequences were therefore diversified by error-prone PCR, evolved and screened as previously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1E</xref>). Three additional specificity-enhancing mutations were identified per construct and combined in the final variants αBFL1 and αBCLB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1F</xref>). Overall, the optimized designs exhibit slight to moderate decreases in stability compared to their predecessors based on chemical denaturation, but unfolding remains cooperative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>), suggesting a well-packed core.</p><p>We carried out computational docking experiments on partially specific CDPs and optimized variants to assess the robustness of our computational protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>). Each CDP and optimized inhibitor was docked into the canonical binding groove of each BCL2 homolog, and thousands of docked configurations were sampled both locally (low RMSD to input configuration) and globally (entire protein surface). Overall, both the partially-specific CDPs and optimized, specific inhibitors exhibit more favorable absolute binding energy (local minimum ddG) and relative binding energy (local minimum versus global minimum ddG) when docked to on-target homologs compared to off-target homologs. These calculations resemble trends in the experimental binding data, but they do not discriminate between the highly specific, optimized inhibitors and partially specific precursors. Thus, while adding computational docking or multi-state design to computationally select against off-target homologs to our design protocol may improve the initial success rate of achieving high affinity and at least partially specific binding, the resolution of these calculations limits discrimination between variants with low versus high specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Determinants of specificity</title><p>The crystal structure of the αBCL2•Bcl-2 complex at 2.1 Å resolution together with the αMCL1•Mcl-1 complex described above illuminate the structural basis for affinity and specificity achieved by both computational design and evolution.

For example, the binding mode of αBCL2 in the hydrophobic cleft of Bcl-2 differs significantly between the crystal structure and backbone-constrained design model; after Bcl-2 alignment, Cα backbones of the αBCL2 crystal and design models deviate by 4.0 Å RMSD (average amongst the two complexes observed in the asymmetric unit; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). The SSM-guided mutation of 2-CDP06 core residue G107R is likely responsible, requiring the first and third helices of αBCL2 to shift relative to the BH3-mimetic helix and positioning the third helix much further from Bcl-2 than the αMCL1•Mcl-1 binding mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The αBCL2 binding mode enables electrostatic interactions between αBCL2 R107 and Bcl-2 residues D111 and E114.</p><p>Mutations within the hydrophobic center of the interface, formed by the BH3-like region of the designs, were generally conservative, but occasionally included substitutions of hydrophobic to polar residues. In particular, the position analogous to a conserved isoleucine within natural BH3 motifs (h3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) is mutated to a polar residue in αBCL2 (N57), αBCLXL (H57), αBCLW (E61) and αBFL1 (H57). Mutation of this residue was not allowed during the design of αMCL1 or the design and evolution of αBCLB, which therefore both preserve the isoleucine hotspot. The αBCL2•Bcl-2 crystal structure reveals that Bcl-2 residue D111 makes a hydrogen bond with αBCL2 N57, satisfying a polar atom that is likely buried in the interface when binding other homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Specificity appears to be achieved in part by introducing a small number of mutations that universally reduce binding affinity but improve specificity at the interface center, like αBCL2 N57 which can be tolerated by Bcl-2 but likely reduces binding to other homologs, coupled with many specific, affinity-enhancing mutations at the interface periphery.</p><p>Engineered BH3-mimetic peptides span residues analogous to the BH3-like core interface of the designed inhibitors. The specificity of small peptides thus depends on mutations within this limited region. Like αMCL1, αBCL2 expands the classic BH3 interface by 452 Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). While the designed proteins share some specificity-enhancing residues with designed peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dutta et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2013</xref>), they also conserve non-specific residues at these positions; for example, aspartate at position h2 + 1 of the MB1 peptide is thought to confer specificity to Mcl-1, but αMCL1 retains arginine as in pan-specific BOP Bim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Further, several positions that contribute to the specificity of designed peptides and some BOPs are restricted in the designed proteins to conserved hydrophobic residues as they fall within the helix bundle’s core (h1 + 2, h2 + 2, and h3 + 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Consistent with binding profiles and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release data, large effects were only seen with αMCL1 in the Mcl-1-dependent line, causing a 90 ± 11% decrease in survival, and with αBFL1 in the Bfl-1-dependent line, causing a 85 ± 6% decrease in survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Minimal effects on cell survival were observed in lines expressing non-cognate pro-survival proteins. These data validate the specificity of the designed proteins and their capacity to functionally engage BCL2 family members in a cellular milieu.</p><p>While engineered MEFs provided an excellent model system to study our designed proteins, we sought further mechanistic validation in a context relevant to their primary application: probing BCL2 family interactions and generating functional BCL2 dependency profiles in cancer. A representative cancer cell line (HeLa) was engineered to overexpress Mcl-1, Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, and we assayed the activity of the designed inhibitors in each setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Previous studies revealed that HeLa cells are resistant to the expression of Noxa (which targets Mcl-1 and Bfl-1) and ABT-737 (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) independently, but are potently killed with the combination of Noxa with ABT-737 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Delft et al., 2006</xref>). Likewise, single designed inhibitors had little effect on survival. More substantial cell death was induced by combinations of αMCL1 with αBCL2 (29 ± 9% survival) and αMCL1 with αBCLXL (38 ± 17%) than αBCL2 with αBCLXL (75 ± 7%). These data, and similar results in Mcl-1-overexpressing (Mcl-1+) HeLa cells, suggest that Mcl-1 plays a more crucial role in wild-type HeLa survival than Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL.</p><p>Compared to wild-type and Mcl-1+ HeLa cells, Bcl-xL-overexpressing (Bcl-xL+) cells are more resistant to the combination of αMCL1 with αBCL2, and likewise, Bcl-2-overexpressing (Bcl-2+) cells are more resistant to the combination of αMCL1 with αBCLXL. Thus, increased expression of a given BCL2 protein can compensate for the inhibition of others. The triple combination of αMCL1, αBCL2, and αBCLXL had greater efficacy than double combinations, indicating a contribution of each pro-survival protein to basal survival. Bcl-xL+ cells were generally more resistant than all other cell lines; the inability to completely inhibit Bcl-xL’s survival function in Bcl-xL+ cells suggests that in this context, Bcl-xL may interact with proteins that are not displaced efficiently by αBCLXL.</p><p>To investigate potential mechanisms underlying these results, we assessed the binding profile of a representative BOP, Bim, to pro-survival homologs with co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments in wild-type and over-expressing cell lines, with and without added αMCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In wild-type HeLa cells, Bim associated primarily with Mcl-1. Introduction of αMCL1 resulted in displacement of Bim from Mcl-1, with modest compensatory sequestration of Bim by Bcl-2. In Bcl-2+ cells, Bim is redistributed and preferentially binds Bcl-2 rather than Mcl-1, likely due to the stoichiometric excess of Bcl-2, and αMCL1 has no effect. The cell-killing activity of αMCL1 with αBCL2 in wild-type, Mcl-1+ and Bcl-2+ cells is consistent with these data; inhibition of both Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in these settings likely overwhelms BOP sequestration, and a higher proportion of Bim and other activator BOPs may be free to interact with Bak and Bax, inducing apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Designed inhibitors elucidate the dependence of human cancer cell lines on pro-survival BCL2 homologs</title><p>Next, we set out to define functional BCL2 dependency profiles of other cancer cell lines using a larger set of our designed inhibitors.

Further, oncogenic EGFR mutations in glioblastoma are associated with apoptotic resistance via increased Bcl-xL expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Latha et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, melanoma and EGFR-modified glioblastoma cell lines provide diverse contexts to test the BCL2-profiling capacity of the designed proteins.</p><p>In all cell lines, single inhibitors again were unable to induce apoptosis. While SK-MEL-5 were overall more resistant to apoptosis, LOX-IMVI melanoma cells were sensitive to double combinations that included αMCL1 and triple combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). αBFL1 with αBCL2 or αBCLXL had less effect, indicating that Mcl-1 plays a more critical role in survival than Bfl-1 in LOX-IMVI, in contrast to mRNA profiling suggesting the opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hind et al., 2015</xref>). All glioblastoma cell lines showed similar trends in response to all combinations, while EGFR variants were in some instances more resistant than parental (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Sensitivity to many different double combinations suggests that in these contexts, pro-survival homologs may have more redundant biological function and resist apoptosis via 'mode 1' interactions with the pan- or partially-specific BOPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Llambi et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20352.021</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Determination of functional BCL2 profiles in melanoma and glioblastoma cell lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Melanoma and (<bold>B</bold>) glioblastoma cell lines were transduced with constructs for designed inhibitor expression and viability was assayed after 72 hr (mean ± SD; for melanoma, n = 2 to 4; for glioblastoma, n = 4).

In previous studies, colon cancers showed a variable response to small-molecule-mediated Bcl-xL inhibition, and RNAi experiments identified Mcl-1 as a resistance factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). To determine whether the Mcl-1 antagonism could render colon cancers sensitive to Bcl-xL neutralization and assess the influence of other pro-survival homologs on survival, we modified a panel of seven colon cancer lines to inducibly express either αMCL1 or αBFL1, and treated them with small molecules to selectively inhibit Bcl-2 (ABT-199), Bcl-xL (A-1331852), or Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL simultaneously (ABT-263).</p><p>Inhibiting a single pro-survival homolog had little effect on short-term survival; only SW48 cells showed greater than a 50% decrease in viability after treatment with A-1331852, consistent with a previous study showing SW48 is sensitive to Bcl-xL inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Combined inhibition of both Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL caused nearly complete cell death after 24 hr in all colon cancers except HCT-116; further analyses showed that αMCL1-mediated Mcl-1 inhibition strongly sensitizes most colon cancers to A-1331852 (and to a lesser extent ABT-263), with a 4.6-fold or greater decrease in EC<sub>50</sub> values observed in all cell lines except HCT-116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). All other combinations had much smaller effects. Thus, in contrast to gliobastoma where pro-survival proteins appeared largely redundant, inhibition of two pro-survival proteins was required and sufficient for cell killing. These results suggest that in context of colon cancer, pro-survival proteins may resist apoptosis primarily via 'mode 2' inhibition of the direct effector Bak, which interacts preferentially with Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Llambi et al., 2011</xref>). As αMCL1 targets Mcl-1 in a manner more akin to a drug (i.e. antagonism) compared to RNAi, our data provide further evidence that treatment strategies involving Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL inhibition could be effective in these malignancies.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20352.023</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Determination of functional BCL2 profiles in colon cancer cell lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Colon cancers were treated with small molecule drugs (2 µM) and/or doxycycline to induce expression of designed inhibitors, as indicated, and viability was assayed after 24 hr (mean ± SD; n = 3).

Our designed inhibitors exhibit greater specificity and in many cases higher affinity than small molecule alternatives, and have advantages unique to their protein composition. For example, the designed proteins can be easily modified for added functionality, such as adding a mitochondrial targeting sequence, or fusing an E3 ligase to each design to catalyze degradation of their target BCL2 proteins. The designed protein inhibitors can be genetically encoded, enabling spatial and temporal control of expression, and have distinct advantages over broadly eliminating the target BCL2 protein using CRISPR- or RNAi-mediated knockdown or knockout. The designs can be used to probe mechanism; we show that specific inhibitors cause the redistribution of a representative BOP, Bim, and the approach can be used to probe other BOPs and compare 'mode 1' versus 'mode 2' inhibition of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Llambi et al., 2011</xref>). Some BCL2 proteins translocate from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane in response to apoptotic stimuli, and the effect of inhibition in these different compartments can be probed by localizing the designed inhibitors with the appropriate targeting sequences and inducing expression before and after apoptotic stimuli. The designed proteins can also be used to distinguish interactions at sites other than the BH3-binding groove; for example, Bcl-xL is thought to interact with p53 at a site opposite the BH3-binding groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petros et al., 2004</xref>), and Bcl-2 is reported to interact with the IP3 receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum via Bcl-2’s BH4-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rong et al., 2009</xref>). These studies are simply impossible with CRISPR or RNAi strategies.</p><p>Our computational design calculations using the stable de novo designed protein BINDI as a starting point enabled us to achieve, in the cases of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, high specificity and affinity immediately following design, and in the cases of Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Bfl-1 and Bcl-B, superior starting points for optimization compared to a single, pan-specific construct. Our success in designing not one but six specific inhibitors demonstrates the generality of the design method. We are not aware of any precedent among designed proteins or indeed in nature for two sets of six closely related proteins in which each protein in one set has the extremely high specificity (100–100,000 fold) for a unique member of the other set.</p><p>As confirmed by biochemical analyses and X-ray crystal structures, the designed proteins engage the BH3-binding grooves of their specific target pro-survival BCL2 family members. The designs were used to determine the BCL2-dependence of different cancers, providing a more direct guide for therapy than knockdown/knockout strategies or mRNA analysis by mimicking the mechanism of action of BCL2-targeting small molecule drugs. While mRNA profiling suggests that Bfl-1 confers apoptotic resistance in SK-MEL-5 and LOX-IMVI melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hind et al., 2015</xref>), our combinatorial antagonism of pro-survival homologs indicates that Mcl-1 plays a more critical role and further discriminates between sensitive LOX-IMVI and resistant SK-MEL-5. We also provide further evidence that many colon cancers are dependent on Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL for survival; mRNA profiling indicates Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL are indeed more prevalent than other BCL2 homologs in many colon cancers, but resistant HCT-116 is indistinguishable from sensitive lines like Caco-2 and HT-29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Placzek et al., 2010</xref>). Further, the detection of RKO sensitivity to Bfl-1 inhibition highlights the capacity of the designed inhibitors to illuminate unique BCL2 profiles, even among cancers with similar general characteristics.</p><p>More generally, computationally designed inhibitors enable the investigation of the biological roles of specific protein interactions with the high spatio-temporal control that can be achieved with tissue-specific and inducible promoters. Competing approaches offer less control. The distribution of small molecules is difficult to spatially or temporally control in vivo, and broadly eliminating the protein of interest with CRISPR or RNAi cannot probe interactions with a specific interface or capture mechanistic intricacies. This work demonstrates that high affinity and specificity protein inhibitors can be designed for each member of a closely-knit protein family, providing a unique opportunity to probe the importance of individual protein interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein design and purification</title><p>Proteins were designed using the ROSETTA software suite, and genes for designed proteins and target Bcl-2 homologs were synthesized by oligo assembly or by commercial suppliers.

The Bcl-w sequence was threaded onto structurally analogous positions in existing crystallographic models of other BCL2 homologs. Only models bound to helical motifs were used: 1PQ1, 2BZW (Bcl-xL•Bad-BH3), 2YJ1 (Bcl-xL•α/β-Puma-BH3), 2YQ6, 2YQ7, 3FDL (Bcl-xL•Bim-BH3), 4A1U (Bcl-xL•designed α/β-foldamer), 4A1W (Bcl-xL•designed α/β-foldamer), 4BPK, 4HNJ (Bcl-xL•Puma-BH3), and 4OYD (BHRF1•BINDI). The TM-align software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang and Skolnick, 2005</xref>) was used to generate structural alignments. Each new Bcl-w model then underwent constrained backbone and side chain minimization in the presence of the bound helical motif borrowed from the initial crystallographic model. The Bcl-w•helix complex was then aligned to a common 20-amino-acid truncated BH3-motif (truncatedBH3.pdb; KEKYIAAMLRAIGDIFNAIM) using PyMOL (Schrödinger). New PDB files of each Bcl-w model positioned to bind the common BH3-motif were saved and input as ‘context’ in the automated motif grafting protocol described below.</p><p>Additional conformations of the partially-nonspecific Mcl-1-targeting binder, M-CDP02, were sampled by submitting the M-CDP02 sequence to ROSETTA’s ab initio structure prediction protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rohl et al., 2004</xref>). Of 30,200 generated models, any having greater than 2.5 Å RMSD relative to the starting model of M-CDP02 were discarded. 250 models with the most favorable (lowest) total score in ROSETTA energy units were input as ‘scaffolds’ for the automated motif grafting protocol described below.</p></sec><sec id="s25"><title>Manual side-chain grafting on a fixed backbone</title><p>A suitable helical region of the BINDI protein (PDB 4OYD chain B) was aligned to the BH3-motif ligand in crystallographic models of each BCL2 pro-survival homolog, using PyMOL (Schrödinger; PDB IDs noted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). If the target structure was bound to an unnatural ligand, such as a small molecule or α/β-foldamer, the model of the pro-survival homolog was first aligned to an alternative structure bound to a helical BH3 motif, which then served as a guide for structural alignment of BINDI. The structural alignment was visually inspected, and any docked configurations with backbone clashes between the scaffold protein and BCL2 homolog were discarded. Side chain clashes were tolerated, as they may be resolved later by sequence design of the scaffold and by rotamer repacking on the target. Important interfacial residues from each BH3-motif were transferred, or grafted, to the aligned BINDI scaffold and kept fixed during the subsequent design protocol; these ‘hotspot’ residues per model are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>. A new PDB file containing the partially mutated scaffold bound to the target homolog was saved and used as the input for ROSETTA-based design.</p></sec><sec id="s26"><title>Computational motif grafting on a fixed backbone</title><p>Grafting is a ‘seeded interface’ protein design approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Correia et al., 2010</xref>), in which a small motif of known structure that binds to a target site of interest is used to initiate the protein design process. The motif is then grafted (i.e. embedded) into a larger protein scaffold, which both stabilizes the structure of the small motif and contributes additional favorable interactions with the target protein. We have implemented a new computational grafting protocol as the MotifGraft mover in RosettaScripts, described in detail by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Silva et al. (2016)</xref>. The input of MotifGraft is composed of three structures: (1) the motif, which is a protein fragment that is intended for grafting in a new protein scaffold; (2) the context, which is the macromolecule interacting with the motif; and (3) the target scaffolds, which are protein scaffolds that the protocol will use to search insertion points for the motif. The goal of MotifGraft is to find fragments in the target scaffolds that are geometrically compatible with the specified motif(s), and then replace those fragments with the motif(s) itself. In this case, the parameters of grafting were settled to perform full backbone alignment of the input motif, with a maximum RMSD of the backbone of 3.0 Å and RMSD for the endpoints of 2.0 Å. For the input motif ‘truncatedBH3.pdb’ the hotspot residues were defined as: LEU-9, ILE-12, GLY-13, ASP-14, PHE-16 and ASN-17. The protocol was instructed to revert all other residues to their native identities in the target scaffold. No clashes between the grafted design and the context protein were allowed. The following mover was added to the XML script to implement this protocol within the RosettaScripts framework:<code>&lt;MotifGraft name=&quot;motif_grafting&quot;

This work serves as a good example of how computational design can be used with experimental screening and selection to engineer specific binders against individual members from a family of proteins that share high sequence and structure similarity. The target proteins, pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins, have been the subject of numerous previous studies aimed at designing peptide and small molecule inhibitors. This study presents specific inhibitors for all six homologs and shows how the panel of inhibitors can be used to probe cross-talk and redundancy between BCL-family proteins in human cancer cell lines. The set of probes generated by this work will be very useful for future studies aimed at profiling the roles of BCl-2 family proteins in disease, especially cancers.</p><p>While recognizing the quality of the manuscript, the reviewers indicated a number of minor concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) In the Abstract there should be a brief mention of the protein engineering strategies that were used to design the specific binders.</p><p>2) One interesting thing about the design pipeline is that no explicit negative design (except for the fact that &quot;native&quot; binding residues were kept in some cases) was used during the computational design step, but competition experiments were used at the bench to evolve greater specificity.

Overall, both the partially-specific computational designs and very specific optimized inhibitors exhibit more favorable absolute binding energy (minimum ddG of local docking trajectories) and relative binding energy (minimum ddG of local docking compared to minimum of global docking) when docked to on-target homologs compared to off-target homologs. These calculations resemble trends in the experimental binding data, but they do not discriminate between the highly specific, optimized inhibitors and partially specific precursors. Thus, while additions to the design protocol such as computational docking or multi-state design against off-target homologs may improve the initial success rate of achieving high affinity and at least partially specific binding, the resolution of these calculations limits discrimination between variants with low versus high specificity. These data and accompanying explanation have been added to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) It is challenging to figure out what is being shown in the various panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.
