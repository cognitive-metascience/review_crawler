intact nuclear pore complexes is critical for successful infection. The host protein cleavage-and-polyadenylation-specificity-factor-6 (CPSF6) has been implicated in different stages of early HIV-1 replication. Applying quantitative microscopy of HIV-1 reverse-transcription and pre-integration-complexes (RTC/PIC), we show that CPSF6 is strongly recruited to nuclear replication complexes but absent from cytoplasmic RTC/PIC in primary human macrophages. Depletion of CPSF6 or lack of CPSF6 binding led to accumulation of HIV-1 subviral complexes at the nuclear envelope of macrophages and reduced infectivity. Two-color stimulated-emission-depletion microscopy indicated that under these circumstances HIV-1 complexes are retained inside the nuclear pore and undergo CA-multimer dependent CPSF6 clustering adjacent to the nuclear basket. We propose that nuclear entry of HIV-1 subviral complexes in macrophages is mediated by consecutive binding of Nup153 and CPSF6 to the hexameric CA lattice.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41800.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses are miniscule parasites that hijack the resources of a cell to make more of themselves. For many, this involves getting inside the nucleus, the fortress that protects the cell’s genetic information. To do so, viruses need to first find a way through a double-layered membrane called the nuclear envelope, which only opens up when a cell divides.</p><p>Yet, the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can infect cells that no longer divide, and in which the nucleus’ walls never come down. The virus cores then head for the nuclear pores, heavily guarded holes in the nuclear envelope that allow the cell's own molecules to go in and out of the nucleus. But HIV-1 is too big to fit through, as its genetic information is encased in a capsid, a coat made of a complex assembly of proteins. However, research shows that these capsid proteins can bind to host proteins at the pore or even inside the nucleus. For example, the capsid protein can recognize the pore protein Nup153, or the nuclear protein CPSF6. These interactions could help the virus make its way in, but how these events unfold is still unclear.</p><p>To explore this, Bejarano, Peng et al. attached fluorescent labels to HIV-1 and watched as it infected non-dividing cells. Rather than completely get rid of their capsid before they crossed the pores, the virus particles hung on to a large part of their lattice. This remaining coat then attached to CPSF6; when this protein was missing or could not bind to capsid proteins, the viral complexes got stuck in the nuclear pores. This suggests that the capsid lattice could first interact with Nup153 inside the pores: then, CPSF6 would take over, knocking Nup153 away and pulling HIV-1 into the nucleus.</p><p>Armed with this knowledge, virologists and drug developers could try to block HIV-1 from entering the cell’s nucleus; they could also start to dissect how drugs that target the HIV-1 capsid work. Ultimately, HIV-1 may serve as a model to unravel how large objects can pass the nuclear pore, which may help us understand how molecules are constantly trafficked in and out of the nucleus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Human immunodeficiency virus</kwd><kwd>CPSF6</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>pre-integration complex</kwd><kwd>nuclear pore complex</kwd><kwd>nuclear import</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Heidelberg Biosciences International Graduate School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bejarano</surname><given-names>David Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009139</institution-id><institution>Deutsches Zentrum für Infektionsforschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TTU HIV</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laketa</surname><given-names>Vibor</given-names></name><name><surname>Kräusslich</surname><given-names>Hans-Georg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name><name><surname>Kräusslich</surname><given-names>Hans-Georg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP1923</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kräusslich</surname><given-names>Hans-Georg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interaction of HIV capsids with the cellular protein cleavage-and-polyadenylation factor 6 at the inner side of nuclear pores promotes nuclear entry of the viral replication complex in primary human macrophages.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reverse transcription of the viral single-stranded RNA genome into double-stranded cDNA, followed by integration into the host genome, are defining features of retrovirus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu and Hughes, 2012</xref>). These events occur in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the newly infected cell within ill-defined nucleoprotein complexes, termed reverse transcription (RTC) and pre-integration complex (PIC), respectively. Accumulating evidence indicates that the viral capsid structure plays an essential role in early replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Campbell and Hope, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamashita and Engelman, 2017</xref>). Mutations in the HIV-1 CA (capsid) protein have been shown to cause defects in post-entry stages, and various cellular proteins binding CA exhibit positive or negative effects on early HIV-1 replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hilditch and Towers, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ambrose and Aiken, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Campbell and Hope, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamashita and Engelman, 2017</xref>). Accordingly, CA and/or the structure of the viral capsid have been implicated in reverse transcription, cytoplasmic trafficking, evasion from the cell-autonomous immune response and nuclear entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ambrose and Aiken, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hilditch and Towers, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamashita and Engelman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Campbell and Hope, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Neither the exact composition of the HIV-1 RTC/PIC nor the functional role of host cell dependency or restriction factors that interact with CA during early replication is currently well understood. Furthermore, the time of capsid uncoating during early HIV-1 replication is not well established, and may differ depending on the target cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arhel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hulme et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Individual viruses entering a host cell may follow different - productive and non-productive – pathways, and it is crucial to identify productive phenotypes correlating with infection. It is generally accepted that incoming capsids remain intact after cytoplasmic entry and during the initial stages of reverse transcription, while different reports suggest uncoating in the cytoplasm or at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mamede et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Francis and Melikyan, 2018</xref>). Nuclear HIV-1 PIC have been observed to contain at least some CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hulme et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stultz et al., 2017</xref>), but the amount of residual CA and whether it maintains the lattice structure are unknown. Furthermore, the size of the conical viral capsid (~60 nm at the broad end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Briggs et al., 2003</xref>)) is larger than the width of the NPC transport channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2004</xref>), indicating that (partial) capsid disintegration or at least capsid or NPC remodeling is needed for HIV-1 nuclear translocation in non-dividing cells.</p><p>Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 6 (CPSF6) was initially identified as an HIV-1 restriction factor when exogenously expressed in a truncated form. The truncated protein is enriched in the cytoplasm, interacts with HIV-1 CA and impairs HIV-1 replication prior to nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, neither overexpression of full length CPSF6, which is almost exclusively nuclear, nor knock-down of CPSF6 significantly affected HIV-1 infectivity in cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hori et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fricke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Iaco et al., 2013</xref>). Structural analyses identified a CPSF6-interacting interface and an overlapping site interacting with the nucleoporin Nup153 on the hexameric form of CA, the basic building block of the viral capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Price et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Price et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>). An HIV-1 derivative carrying a point mutation within this CPSF6-binding motif in CA (N74D) exhibited impaired CPSF6 binding in vitro and escaped restriction by truncated CPSF6, but displayed full infectivity in reporter cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schaller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambrose et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, both CPSF6 knock-down and the N74D exchange impaired HIV-1 infection in post-mitotic primary human macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schaller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambrose et al., 2012</xref>), and this effect was attributed to induction of an interferon response triggered by viral DNA sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rasaiyaah et al., 2013</xref>). Based on these results, it was speculated that cytoplasmic CPSF6 binds incoming viral capsids and blocks reverse transcription during cytoplasmic transport to prevent recognition of newly synthesized cDNA by cytoplasmic DNA sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rasaiyaah et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>More recently, CPSF6 was suggested to affect HIV-1 nuclear entry in a HeLa-based reporter cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chin et al., 2015</xref>) and to be an important factor in targeting HIV-1 integration in infected primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sowd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rasheedi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achuthan et al., 2018</xref>). Strikingly, a later study described another point mutation in the CPSF6-binding interface of HIV-1 CA (A77V), which also abolished interaction with CPSF6 but did not appear to affect replication in primary cells (i.e. primary human macrophages and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells), although it was negatively selected after passaging in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saito et al., 2016b</xref>). Taken together, it is clear that CPSF6 has an important, CA dependent function in early HIV-1 infection of macrophages, which may not be fully recapitulated in HeLa- or 293T-based reporter cell lines. This may reflect differences between cell lines and primary cells, but also between different cell types. The mechanism(s) of action of CPSF6 is not fully defined, and the relative contribution of cytoplasmic versus nuclear CPSF6 as well as the reason for the apparent cell-type specific differences are not resolved.</p><p>We have previously established a microscopy-based approach for quantitative analysis of HIV-1 post entry events on a single particle level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2014</xref>). Labeling nascent RT products by incorporation of the thymidine analog EdU followed by click labeling, in conjunction with fluorescent labeling of the <italic>bona fide</italic> RTC/PIC component IN, identified reverse transcription competent HIV-1 RTC/PIC in the cytoplasm and nucleus of infected cells and enabled direct visualization of viral and cellular proteins associated with these complexes. Employing this system to investigate CPSF6 recruitment, we had observed weak or no CPSF6 signals on cytosolic RTC/PIC in model cell lines; pronounced-co-localization was only observed when transportin 3 (TNPO3), which is needed for CPSF6 nuclear import, was depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2014</xref>). We have now used this approach for a detailed analysis of CPSF6 recruitment and its role for HIV-1 nuclear import in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). CPSF6 was strongly enriched on nuclear complexes, and depletion of CPSF6 or the A77V mutation in CA reduced HIV-1 infectivity in MDM. RTC/PIC accumulated close to the nuclear envelope in these cases. Two-color Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy revealed that CA-containing HIV-1 complexes directly co-localized with NPCs, and CPSF6 was associated with the nuclear basket at these sites in a CA-dependent manner. These results indicate that CPSF6 facilitates nuclear entry of HIV-1 in post-mitotic human macrophages in a CA–dependent manner at the level of the NPC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CPSF6 binding of the RTC/PIC does not impair reverse transcription</title><p>The poor association of cytoplasmic RTC/PIC with CPSF6 observed in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2014</xref>) argued against the model that CPSF6 regulates viral reverse transcription during cytoplasmic trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rasaiyaah et al., 2013</xref>). Our experimental system allowed us to directly address this issue by correlating the presence of CPSF6 on cytosolic RTC/PIC with the EdU/click signal intensity as a measure of reverse transcription products. These experiments were performed in a HeLa-derived TNPO3 knock-down cell line which displays a high cytosolic level of CPSF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thys et al., 2011</xref>). Cells were infected with HIV-1 carrying IN.eGFP as RTC/PIC marker, subjected to EdU incorporation, and fixed and click-labeled 4.5 hr post infection. IN.eGFP/EdU positive objects were classified according to whether or not they were associated with CPSF6 immunofluorescence. In accordance with our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2014</xref>), the majority of cytoplasmic RTC/PIC (95/121; 78.5%) was positive for CPSF6 in this cell line with high cytoplasmic CPSF6 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). EdU signal intensities on individual CPSF6-positive complexes were found to be significantly higher on average compared to those on CPSF6-negative, but IN.eGFP-positive objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), implying that CPSF6 association with cytoplasmic RTC/PIC did not inhibit reverse transcription. To analyze further whether CPSF6 affects reverse transcription, CPSF6 was depleted in MDM followed by infection and RTC/PIC quantification. The number of reverse-transcription competent RTC/PIC (i.e. EdU positive signals co-localizing with IN.eGFP) in CPSF6 depleted MDM was comparable with that of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results are inconsistent with an inhibitory effect of cytoplasmic CPSF6 on HIV-1 reverse transcription. We therefore focused on the characterization of CPSF6 in the nucleus and at the NPC in primary human MDM in the following experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CPSF6 is strongly recruited to nuclear subviral HIV-1 complexes in infected macrophages</title><p>Reverse transcription of HIV-1 in MDM is much slower than in reporter cell lines or activated T-cells, presumably due to the low dNTP levels in these non-dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diamond et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore performed inhibitor time-of-addition experiments to define the appropriate time window for RTC/PIC detection in this cell type. MDM were prepared from healthy blood donors and infected with HIV-1 carrying an R5-tropic Env protein derived from a primary human isolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schnell et al., 2011</xref>). The non-nucleosidic reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor efavirenz (EFV) or DMSO was added at different time points post single-round infection (p.i.), and the percentage of infected cells was determined by CA immunostaining 6d p.i.. Only minor resilience against EFV inhibition was observed at 24 h p.i. and this increased until 72 h p.i., where EFV inhibition was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). These results confirmed that completion of reverse transcription occurs late in MDM (supporting a recent more detailed analysis of replication dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bejarano et al., 2018</xref>)) and defined the time window for detection of HIV-1 RTC/PIC.</p><p>MDM were infected with R5-tropic HIV-1 carrying IN.eGFP followed by detection of RTC/PIC <italic>via</italic> click-labeling of EdU incorporated into nascent viral DNA.

In contrast, CPSF6 was strongly enriched on almost all nuclear HIV-1 complexes (75/77; 97.4%) in infected MDM, and strong punctate CPSF6 signals co-localizing with nuclear HIV-1 complexes were easily detected above the diffuse nuclear background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since the signal intensities of HIV-1 associated CPSF6 punctae were clearly much higher than those of the small nuclear CPSF6 speckles observed in both non-infected and infected cells, we consider it likely that this reflects CPSF6 recruitment by subviral complexes rather than recruitment of HIV-1 derived structures to pre-existing CPSF6 clusters. CPSF6 signal intensities were much higher on nuclear HIV-1 subviral complexes compared to those on complexes localized near the nuclear envelope. CPSF6 levels on the latter structures were generally close to the detection level, and cytoplasmic RTC/PIC were almost always CPSF6-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, cells transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing a non-targeted shRNA exhibited similar characteristic CPSF6 clusters in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), while this was not observed in mock-transduced cells. We attribute these signals to nuclear complexes of the lentiviral vector. These results clearly show that CPSF6 association with RTC/PIC occurs mainly in the nucleus in MDM and leads to strong CPSF6 clustering on the subviral complex.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41800.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CPSF6 is enriched on nuclear HIV-1 complexes in infected macrophages.</title><p>MDM were mock-infected (<bold>A</bold>) or infected with HIV-1 <sub>NL4-3</sub>4059 (IN.eGFP) at an MOI of 14.5 (<bold>B–G</bold>) in the presence of 10 µM EdU (<bold>A–G</bold>), and 5 µM Efavirenz (<bold>D</bold>) or 5 µM Ral (Raltegravir) (<bold>E</bold>) for 48 hr, click-labeled and immunostained with anti-CPSF6 antibody (magenta).

Quantifying localization and CPSF6/CA association of HIV-1 complexes in a total of 92 infected MDM at 48 h p.i., we observed a large majority of IN.eGFP positive structures outside the nucleus (7,904/8,403; 94%). These structures mostly lacked detectable EdU signals (7558/7904; 95.6%), in agreement with the assumption that the majority of particles in the cytosolic area represent virions taken up into endosomes (inaccessible to EdUTP) and non-productive particles. In contrast, the majority of IN.eGFP positive objects within the nucleus were EdU positive (328/499; 65.7%). The observation that a subset of complexes detected in the nucleus was EdU negative confirms that reverse transcription is not a prerequisite for nuclear import of HIV-1 complexes, as reported by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burdick et al., 2017</xref>). In a recent study on HIV-1 replication dynamics in macrophages, we observed higher EdU intensities associated with nuclear complexes compared to complexes near the nuclear envelope, however, suggesting that reverse transcription may promote efficiency of nuclear entry or that reverse transcription can even be completed in the nucleus in this cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bejarano et al., 2018</xref>). 325 of the 328 EdU-positive complexes in the nucleus (99%) were associated with detectable CA signals, and a similar CA signal was also observed on 85% of the EdU-negative nuclear IN.eGFP-positive complexes (146/171).</p><p>Mean CA signal intensity of individual RTC/PIC differed only modestly between cytoplasmic and nuclear CA-positive HIV-1 structures, suggesting that nuclear RTC/PIC in HIV-1 infected MDM retain the majority of CA molecules.

CPSF6 is part of the cellular CF Im complex involved in pre-mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gruber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hardy and Norbury, 2016</xref>). Two forms of this tetrameric complex have been described. They are composed of two CPSF5 molecules, associated with two molecules of either CPSF6 or CPSF7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gruber et al., 2012</xref>). MDM were infected with HIV-1 for 48 hr and co-immunostained with antibodies against CPSF6 and CPSF5, or against CPSF7 and CPSF5. We observed clear co-localization of CPSF5 and CPSF6 on almost all nuclear complexes analyzed (42/44), while CPSF7 was only detected on one of 82 nuclear complexes analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the CPSF5<sup>2</sup>-CPSF6<sup>2</sup> form of the CF Im complex is recruited to nuclear HIV-1 complexes.</p><p>Given the role of the CF Im complex in cellular pre-mRNA processing, we investigated whether CPSF6 accumulation on nuclear HIV-1 complexes depends on their transcriptional activity. To this end, MDM were infected with a transcriptionally impaired HIV-1 variant carrying a deletion in the viral Tat transactivator (HIV-1<sub>NL4-3ΔTat</sub>). Alternatively, wild-type HIV-1 infected MDM were treated at 96 h p.i. with the transcription inhibitor flavopiridol for 12 hr. HIV-1 transcription and infectivity were strongly impaired by either, Tat deletion or flavopiridol treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Impairment of HIV-1 RNA transcription did not affect CPSF6 recruitment to nuclear HIV-1 complexes, however. CPSF6 enrichment on nuclear replication complexes of HIV-1<sub>NL4-3ΔTat</sub> infected MDM (54/58; 93%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) was comparable with wild-type HIV-1, and this was also true for flavopiridol treatment (63/64; 98%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). CPSF6 recruitment to transcriptionally inactive nuclear HIV-1 complexes was confirmed by immunostaining in combination with RNA FISH at 108 h p.i.. This analysis revealed that CPSF6-positive nuclear punctae in wild-type HIV-1 infected MDM mostly co-localized with viral RNA signals (50/69; 72.5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating some transcriptional activity. On the other hand, nuclear CPSF6 punctae in MDM infected with the Tat-defective HIV-1 variant (72/98; 74%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) or in the presence of Flavopiridol (29/34; 85%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) mostly lacked detectable FISH signals for viral RNA. These results indicate that recruitment of CPSF6 to HIV-1 nuclear replication complexes does not require active transcription of the HIV-1 genome and does thus not result from CPSF6 function in pre-mRNA processing.</p><p>The p75 isoform of the host cell factor Lens Epithelium-Derived Growth Factor (LEDGF/p75) has been reported to be important for HIV-1 integration and to influence integration site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kvaratskhelia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Debyser et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore analyzed nuclear HIV-1 complexes for the presence of LEDGF. Co-immunostaining of HIV-1 infected MDM with antibodies against LEDGF (detecting both the p75 and p52 isoform) and CPSF6 revealed all nuclear complexes to be CPSF6-positive in this experiment and ~80% to contain detectable LEDGF as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CPSF6 is important for HIV-1 infectivity in macrophages</title><p>In order to determine whether enrichment of CPSF6 on nuclear HIV-1 complexes is functionally relevant for HIV-1 replication, we performed CPSF6 knock-down experiments and employed a CPSF6 binding deficient virus. Mutation A77V in CA has previously been reported to impair CPSF6 interaction without affecting replication in MDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saito et al., 2016b</xref>), and thus to be more specific compared to the N74D mutation used in other studies. MDM from three donors each were transduced with either lentiviral or adeno-associated virus (AAV) based vectors expressing a combination of three shRNAs against CPSF6 or a non-targeted shRNA. CPSF6 signal intensities in the nucleus were quantitated to determine the level of knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While both approaches yielded ca. 50–60% reduction of mean CPSF6 signal intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, compare top panels to bottom panels), transduction with lentiviral vectors resulted in the appearance of nuclear CPSF6 punctae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) indistinguishable from those associated with HIV-1 derived complexes. We therefore employed AAV vectors for all imaging experiments, while lentiviral knock-down was used in some infection experiments as well.</p><p>Transduced MDM were infected with non-labeled R5-tropic HIV-1 in a single-round infection at an MOI of 3.5 (based on titration in HeLa-based reporter cells) and scored for productive infection at day 6 p.i.. Knock-down of CPSF6 modestly, but significantly reduced wild-type HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A similar decrease in infectivity was seen for the A77V variant without CPSF6 silencing, different from a previous report where this variant appeared to be unimpaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saito et al., 2016b</xref>). CPSF6 depletion had no additional effect on infection by the A77V variant, indicating that its phenotype is indeed due to loss of CPSF6 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, bottom panels show data for AAV mediated depletion). Since CPSF6 knock-down levels varied between individual cells, we analyzed the correlation between CPSF6 signal intensity and HIV-1 infection at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Stratification of cells into quartiles according to CPSF6 staining intensity revealed a correlation between HIV-1 infection and CPSF6 staining intensity for wild-type HIV-1, but not for the A77V variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Single-cell analysis further revealed that a certain threshold level of CPSF6 was apparently required for MDM to become productively infected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This phenotype was more obvious in CPSF6 depleted MDM, but exhibited significant donor-to-donor variation. Taken together, these observations suggest that a threshold level of CPSF6 is required for efficient infection of MDM with wild-type HIV-1, and that CPSF6 facilitates HIV-1 infection in a CA-dependent manner.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41800.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Effect of CPSF6 depletion on HIV-1 infection in primary macrophages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MDM from six donors in three independent experiments were transduced with either lentiviral vectors or AAV expressing a non-targeted shRNA (NS control) or shRNAs against CPSF6 (K/D) as described in Materials and Methods.

Various viral and host cell factors have been implicated in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matreyek and Engelman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bin Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamashita and Engelman, 2017</xref>), but the exact mechanism of nuclear import remains unclear and may be cell-type dependent. We have analyzed nuclear entry of HIV-1 and productive infection in post-mitotic human MDM with a focus on the viral CA and the cellular CPSF6 protein. Applying quantitative microscopy of RTC/PIC, we detected CPSF6 primarily on nuclear complexes; cytoplasmic RTC/PIC were only found to be positive when CPSF6 was artificially targeted to the cytoplasm. No impairment of reverse transcription was observed in the latter case, arguing against the hypothesis that CPSF6 binding to the viral capsid arrests viral DNA synthesis to avoid recognition of viral DNA by DNA sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rasaiyaah et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, CPSF6 strongly associated with nuclear HIV-1 complexes, and bright nuclear punctae of CPSF6 could be used to identify subviral complexes following HIV-1 infection or lentiviral vector transduction even against the abundant background of CPSF6 in the nucleus. In agreement with a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rasheedi et al., 2016</xref>), we observed that CPSF6 is recruited to HIV-1 replication complexes as component of the CPSF5<sup>2</sup>-CPSF6<sup>2</sup> CF Im complex. This complex is normally involved in pre-mRNA processing, but active transcription was not required for CPSF6 recruitment to HIV-1 PIC. We could also demonstrate that most nuclear subviral complexes co-localized with a signal from LEDGF immunostaining. Our results thus provide direct microscopic support for the model that LEDGF/p75 is recruited to the HIV-1 PIC (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engelman and Singh, 2018</xref>), with the caveat that the antibody used did not allow us to discriminate between the two major isoforms of LEDGF.</p><p>Imaging of RTC/PIC revealed that CPSF6 knock-down or the A77V mutation had little or no effect on trafficking of the RTC/PIC to the nuclear envelope, while nuclear import was severely impaired in both cases. HIV-1 RTC/PIC accumulated close to the nuclear envelope under these conditions, indicating that the viral replication complexes were impeded or arrested at this site. RTC/PIC accumulation at the nuclear envelope was also observed for WT HIV-1 infection with normal CPSF6 levels at early, but not at late time points p.i., indicating that transfer across the nuclear envelope is a rate-limiting step as recently suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burdick et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with several recent studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burdick et al., 2017</xref>), nuclear import of the HIV-1 post-entry complex did not require reverse transcription, but was affected by depletion of CPSF6 or lack of CPSF6 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambrose et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Price et al., 2012</xref>). Few nuclear subviral complexes were observed in these cases and reverse transcription positive complexes were largely retained at nuclear pores. Infection of macrophages was only two- to threefold reduced under these conditions, however. This relatively modest effect may be due to the presence of residual CPSF6, since HIV-1 infection preferentially occurred in cells retaining a threshold level of CPSF6. Furthermore, infectivity was scored on the bulk population of macrophages with incomplete CPSF6 knock-down, while low CPSF6-expressing cells were selected in the imaging experiments.</p><p>It should also be considered that HIV-1 RTC/PIC arrested at or close to the nuclear pore in the absence of sufficient CPSF6 recruitment may eventually integrate into chromosomal DNA even without release from the nuclear basket, thus contributing to the observed infection rate. Integration at the NPC and possibly without full release from the nuclear basket is supported by accumulation of HIV-1 proviral DNA in the nuclear periphery for HIV-1 variants with defective CPSF6 binding and for CPSF6 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achuthan et al., 2018</xref>). It may also explain the altered integration site profile observed for CPSF6 binding defective HIV-1 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schaller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saito et al., 2016b</xref>) and upon CPSF6 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sowd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rasheedi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achuthan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Both Nup153 and CPSF6 bind preferentially to the CA hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Price et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that at least some capsid lattice is retained upon transfer through the NPC in MDM. This is consistent with our observation that a strong CA signal is observed on almost all nuclear HIV-1 complexes in these cells. Several recent studies have reported absent or low CA immunostaining on nuclear HIV-1 structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hulme et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mamede et al., 2017</xref>), and we were unable to detect a clear CA signal on nuclear complexes in HeLa-based reporter cell lines as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, CA was easily detected on almost all nuclear RTC/PIC of HIV-1 infected MDM, and signal intensities were similar or only slightly reduced when compared to cytoplasmic HIV-1 derived structures detected in the same cell. While this does not prove the presence of an intact HIV-1 capsid, the presence of CA on almost all nuclear complexes, the intensity of the CA signal and the known dependence of CPSF6 binding on the assembled CA hexamer suggest that nuclear HIV-1 replication complexes in infected MDM retain at least a large fraction of their CA coat and expose hexameric binding sites to interacting cellular factors. Whether this complex comprises the entire capsid, a partially uncoated capsid, or a capsid-derived structure stabilized by other factors needs to be investigated by ultrastructural analyses. Stabilization of an incomplete capsid by host factor binding is supported by the recent observation that PF74, binding to the same interface as CPSF6 and Nup153, can stabilize partially disassembled capsids in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Márquez et al., 2018</xref>). Using a slightly different imaging-based approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Francis and Melikyan (2018)</xref> recently reported HIV-1 capsid uncoating at the nuclear envelope, preceding nuclear import of subviral complexes. However, there are pronounced differences in the detection of CA signals on nuclear HIV-1 replication complexes in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2014</xref>), and this apparent discrepancy may simply reflect cell-type specific differences in the mechanism of HIV-1 nuclear import.</p><p>Using two-color 2D and 3D STED microscopy, we provide direct proof that HIV-1 RTC/PIC at the nuclear envelope are associated with NPC in almost all cases. Accordingly, lack of CPSF6 interaction arrests or delays the HIV-1 replication complex at or within the NPC. A recent report suggested that CPSF6-capsid interactions allow subviral complexes to penetrate deeper into the nucleus of HEK293T- and primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells for integration, while loss of CPSF6 interaction led to integration into transcriptionally repressed lamina-associated heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achuthan et al., 2018</xref>). This may be due to integration of arrested PICs adjacent to the nuclear basket or may indicate an additional role of CPSF6 in intranuclear trafficking of viral PIC. The distance between the peak CA and Nup153 signals in our study was ca. 70 nm, with the CA signal oriented towards the cytoplasmic side. CPSF6, on the other hand, accumulated adjacent to Nup153, but clearly localized towards the nucleoplasm; this CPSF6 clustering was dependent on CA. Taken together, these results suggest that a strongly CA-positive HIV-1 replication complex retaining at least a partial hexameric lattice is arrested inside the pore of the NPC. The central pore is ca. 40–90 nm long, with filaments extending 50–75 nm on both sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2004</xref>). Accordingly, a single HIV-1 capsid or capsid-derived structure of ca. 100 nm in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Briggs et al., 2003</xref>) could span the pore. It can concomitantly present numerous CA epitopes at a peak distance of 70 nm from the nuclear basket towards the cytoplasm and induce strong CA hexamer dependent CPSF6 binding on the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear basket. Tight association with the pore channel and the CPSF6 cluster may partially obscure antibody detection of CA, but the strong CA signal on nuclear complexes indicates that CA is largely retained after NPC passage. CPSF6 recruited to this capsid-derived structure at the nuclear basket might displace Nup153, thereby freeing Nup153 molecules of this NPC to progressively bind to upstream CA hexamers and thus promote nuclear import. Accordingly, abundant nuclear CPSF6 competing Nup153 from the common interface results in the observed large CPSF6 clusters on HIV-1 complexes at the nuclear basket and may eventually cause their release into the nucleoplasm. This model thus proposes consecutive and competitive binding of Nup153 and CPSF6 to the CA lattice on HIV-1 replication complexes as driving force for their nuclear entry; a graphic depiction of the model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41800.026</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for the interaction of Nup153 and CPSF6 with the incoming HIV-1 capsid at the NPC of primary macrophages.</title><p>HIV-1 subviral complexes (depicted as a cone) at the NPC interact with Nup153 (represented as blue dots) at the nuclear basket <italic>via</italic> a capsid-derived structure.

Further studies applying (correlative) cryo-electron microscopy will be needed to define the ultrastructure of this HIV-1 capsid-derived structure at the NPC and to determine whether the NPC structure changes during nuclear translocation of such a large cargo. The experimental system described in this report seems ideally suited to address these important questions, which are relevant not only for HIV-1 biology, but for understanding nuclear transport of large cargo and the flexibility of the NPC in general.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa fluor <break/>conjugated secondary antibodies</td><td valign="top">Thermo <break/>Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">IF (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat anti-mouse IgG Abberior <break/>STAR RED</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich; <break/>Cat# 52283</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">IF (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat anti-rabbit IgG Atto 594</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich; <break/>Cat# 77671</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">IF (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat polyclonal HRP anti-rabbit IgG</td><td valign="top">Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs; Cat# 111-035-144</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2307391">AB_2307391</ext-link></td><td valign="top">ELISA (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-hCPSF5</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich; Cat# SAB1404890</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10739397">AB_10739397</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-hFG repeats (Nuclear Pore Complex)</td><td valign="top">Abcam; Cat# ab24609</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_448181">AB_448181</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF(1:300)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-hLamin A/C</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz <break/>Biotechnology; <break/>Cat# sc-7292</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_627875">AB_627875</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-hLEDGF</td><td valign="top">BD Biosciences; <break/>Cat# 611714</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_399192">AB_399192</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-hNup153</td><td valign="top">Abcam; <break/>Cat# ab24700</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2154467">AB_2154467</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:250)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-hCPSF6</td><td valign="top">Atlas Antibodies; <break/>Cat# HPA039973</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10795242">AB_10795242</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF(1:250)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-hCPSF7</td><td valign="top">Atlas Antibodies <break/>Cat# HPA041094</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10794187">AB_10794187</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-HIV-1 CA</td><td valign="top">In-house</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">IF(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Sheep polyclonal anti-HIV-1 CA</td><td valign="top">In-house</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">IF (1:1200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(<italic>H. sapiens)</italic></td><td valign="top">HeLaP4 TNPO3-KD</td><td valign="top">Z Debyser <break/>(University of <break/>Leuven, Belgium); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thys et al.

TNPO3-KD cells were seeded in the presence of 6 µM aphidicolin (Sigma Aldrich) and infected on the following day with HIV-1 (IN.eGFP) at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 25 in medium containing 10 µM EdU (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 6 µM aphidicolin. Cells were pre-incubated at 16°C for 30 min and then shifted to 37°C. After 2 hr, medium was removed and replaced by fresh pre-warmed medium containing 10 µM EdU and incubation was continued at 37°C. To stop infection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, USA) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were washed and permeabilized with 0.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 for 15 min.

In analyses of the distribution of IN.eGFP objects, a non-paired two-tailed Z-test (α = 0.05) was performed to assess statistical significance of two proportions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Anna Cereseto, Zeger Debyser, Dirk Grimm, Michael Malim, Thorsten Müller, Greg Towers and Ronald Swanstrom for providing cell lines or plasmid constructs.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;HIV-1 nuclear import in macrophages is regulated by CPSF6-capsid interactions at the Nuclear Pore Complex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wes Sundquist as Reviewing Editor and Wenhui Li as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alan Engelman (Reviewer #1); Gregory J Towers (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>This manuscript is a tour de force analysis of role of CPSF6 in HIV-1 infection of macrophages, rooted in cutting edge fluorescence imaging. The study follows a previous study from this group which established the methods and suggested that CPSF6 was unlikely to be recruited to HIV cores in the cytoplasm. The novel findings in this manuscript are that: 1) cytoplasmic CPSF6 does not restrict HIV-1 reverse transcription in macrophages, as proposed previously by others, and 2) that the CPSF6-CA interaction, which occurs in close association with the nuclear pore complex (NPC), promotes nuclear entry of capsid-containing cores.</p><p>The results shed important new light onto mechanism of HIV-1 nuclear translocation in this experimental system, highlighting the CPSF6-CA binding nexus, and surely will be of general interest to <italic>eLife</italic> readers.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In general, the study does a nice job of using single cell measurements to manage and interpret poor knock down efficiencies in a very convincing way. However, a longstanding issue with image-based virology is the question of how one knows whether any particular image represents an actual infectious event (which is non-trivial with HIV owing to the known low particle-to-infectivity ratio). The Hope and Melikyan labs have now published procedures that correlate imaged foci with cell infection through reporter gene readouts. In the current paper, authors do not have such a correlation between images and infected cells, and it is therefore very important to clarify which datasets strictly correlate with infectious measures. For example, the authors quantify CPSF6 knockdown and HIV-1 infection Figure 3—figure supplement 1, but do not explain how such measures correlate. In some cases, they would not seem to: e.g., donor 2 had marginal (30%?) CPSF6 depletion, yet the infection reduced 4-fold; donor 4, ~4-fold protein depletion, yet a less than 2-fold infection defect. Perhaps rank analysis (such as Spearman) of all 6 donor responses would reveal a positive correlation? Please conduct the analysis and report the results.</p><p>2) A related issue is the MOI in each experiment. For example, when the authors discuss quantifying the localization and CPSF6/CA association of ~8400 HIV-1 complexes in a total of 92 infected MDM at 48h p.i. (third paragraph of subsection “CPSF6 is strongly recruited to nuclear PIC in infected macrophages”), it would be helpful to know the expected MOI (can it be stated here and elsewhere?). This issue is important because readers will want to know how many of the observed complexes are expected to be infectious.</p><p>3) Another related issue is the lack of clarity of CPSF6 knockdown levels across the different imaging experiments. Does Figure 3—figure supplement 1 encompass all study-wide donors and CPSF6 knockdowns? If so, please indicate in the figure legends which donor samples were used for that experiment. If imaging experiments used other donors (and knockdowns), then it is important know the extents of CPSF6 knockdown and HIV-1 infection defects in each case.</p><p>4) Cells express two major isoforms of LEDGF, p75 and p52, but only p75 interacts with HIV-1 integrase. It would therefore clarify things if &quot;LEDGF&quot; were amended to &quot;LEDGF/p75&quot; throughout. More significantly, the antibody being used detects both p52 and p75 and this should be noted. Unlike the work with CPSF6, the work with LEDGF/p75 lacks specificity controls through use of virus or cellular constructs that are known to be defective for the protein-protein interaction. LEDGIN/ALLINI inhibitors of LEDGF/p75-IN interaction could have been used for this. While the additional work is not critical, it is important to at least soften the tone of conclusions since both p52 and p75 would have been visualized in these experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41800.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In general, the study does a nice job of using single cell measurements to manage and interpret poor knock down efficiencies in a very convincing way.

In some cases, they would not seem to: e.g., donor 2 had marginal (30%?) CPSF6 depletion, yet the infection reduced 4-fold; donor 4, ~4-fold protein depletion, yet a less than 2-fold infection defect. Perhaps rank analysis (such as Spearman) of all 6 donor responses would reveal a positive correlation? Please conduct the analysis and report the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Overall, the reduction in infectivity by either CPSF6 knock-down or A77V substitution was significant, but relatively modest compared to the strong phenotype observed in the imaging experiments. We attribute this difference mainly to the following reasons, while additional factors may contribute as well:</p><p>i) Knock-down efficiency was variable between donors and generally in the range of ca. 60% reduction of staining intensity with a high cell-to-cell variation as shown in the figures. Infectivity was scored on the bulk population of cells, while imaging analyses were done on cells selected for low CPSF6 expression (generally &gt;80% knock-down). Thus, one would expect a stronger phenotype in the imaging compared to the infectivity experiments if the two parameters are correlated. We have clarified this aspect in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>ii) CPSF6 clustering was observed on HIV-1 RTC/PIC even in CPSF6-low cells and the CPSF6 signal localized towards the nucleoplasm compared to the Nup153 signal. These observations indicate that such subviral HIV-1 complexes have gained access to the nucleoplasm despite being arrested or delayed within or close to the nuclear basket. We speculate that these complexes may be competent for chromosomal integration and thus contribute to the observed infectivity. This hypothesis is consistent with the recent publication by Achuthan et al., 2018, as mentioned in the revised discussion.</p><p>To directly address the reviewers´ comments, we have performed Spearman analysis correlating reduction in infectivity by CPSF6 knock-down with the overall knock-down efficiency for the respective donor. To increase sample size, we have now performed an additional infection experiment with three donors applying both AAV-based and LV-based knock-down of CPSF6. The figure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> depicts the ratio of percent infected cells under silencing versus non-silencing conditions (multiplied by 100) against the reduction of CPSF6 signal in the knock-down cell population compared to the non-silencing control.</p><p>Despite strong variability between donors and experimental variability for the same donor (with some outliers), a significant correlation was observed (r: -0.6235; p&lt;0.0001). Little or no reduction in infectivity was observed for knock-down efficiencies &lt;30%, while infection is reduced two- to threefold at a knock-down efficiency of 40-60%. This result is consistent with our previous analysis scoring HIV-1 infectivity against CPSF6 signal intensities distributed in quartiles (Figure 3B). Furthermore, single cell analysis suggested a threshold of CPSF6 for efficient HIV-1 infection with few infected cells in the very low CPSF6 population (Figure 3C). We have not added the figure to the revised version since we believe that the two arguments above (which are discussed in the manuscript) are more pertinent for the observed difference.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Relative infectivity in CPSF6 knock-down cells normalized to infectivity in non-silencing control cells vs. bulk CPSF6 knock-down efficiency determined for the respective sample.</title><p>Different symbols represent different donors.

This phenotype is consistent with our proposed model suggesting CPSF6 accumulating on the incoming subviral complex once it has reached the nuclear basket (Figure 8), but not affecting targeting of the subviral complex to the nuclear envelope or into the nuclear pore.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A related issue is the MOI in each experiment. For example, when the authors discuss quantifying the localization and CPSF6/CA association of ~8400 HIV-1 complexes in a total of 92 infected MDM at 48h p.i. (third paragraph of subsection “CPSF6 is strongly recruited to nuclear PIC in infected macrophages”), it would be helpful to know the expected MOI (can it be stated here and elsewhere?). This issue is important because readers will want to know how many of the observed complexes are expected to be infectious.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We agree that it is helpful for the reader to provide MOI instead of ng CA values as indicator of input of infectious virus. We have thus added this information and explained in the Materials and methods and legends how infectivity relates to antigen level (thus providing information on total virus input).</p><p>Since infectability of primary macrophages shows a strong donor-to-donor variation, the infectivity of particle preparations was routinely characterized by titration on TZM-bl indicator cells. The MOI values presented for unlabeled and IN.eGFP labeled HIV-1 in the revised version of the manuscript refer to this reporter cell titration.</p><p>Experiments determining HIV infection rates on macrophages were performed using unlabeled virus. Since TZM-bl cells are more readily infected than macrophages, an MOI of 3.5 was used in most experiments (unless otherwise indicated), while actual infection rates in macrophages were lower. For imaging experiments, we used a higher MOI of 14.5 in order to maximize detection of intracellular viral complexes. We did not perform parallel infection experiments with the IN.eGFP labelled virus in macrophages, however. It should be noted that the ~fourfold higher MOI corresponds to a ~sevenfold higher amount of virus particle input since the IN.eGFP-complemented virus exhibits a ~twofold reduced specific infectivity (Peng et al., 2014). This information is now given in the revised Materials and methods and the MOI values as well as the antigen amounts are stated in the respective figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another related issue is the lack of clarity of CPSF6 knockdown levels across the different imaging experiments. Does Figure 3—figure supplement 1 encompass all study-wide donors and CPSF6 knockdowns? If so, please indicate in the figure legends which donor samples were used for that experiment. If imaging experiments used other donors (and knockdowns), then it is important know the extents of CPSF6 knockdown and HIV-1 infection defects in each case.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 1 does provide information on all donors with CPSF6 knock-down that were used in the imaging experiments. These were the donors with the numbers 4-7.</p><p>While this figure shows the distribution of CPSF6 signal intensities and thus confirms the knock-down, it also reveals the strong heterogeneity in CPSF6 levels even after knock-down. However, imaging experiments allowed selection of CPSF6-low cells for the analysis of HIV-1 RTC/PIC localization and composition. Therefore, providing overall knock-down efficiencies for the respective donor would be misleading since CPSF6-low cells were analyzed in all cases, and knock-down simply increased the population size of CPSF6-low cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Cells express two major isoforms of LEDGF, p75 and p52, but only p75 interacts with HIV-1 integrase. It would therefore clarify things if &quot;LEDGF&quot; were amended to &quot;LEDGF/p75&quot; throughout. More significantly, the antibody being used detects both p52 and p75 and this should be noted. Unlike the work with CPSF6, the work with LEDGF/p75 lacks specificity controls through use of virus or cellular constructs that are known to be defective for the protein-protein interaction. LEDGIN/ALLINI inhibitors of LEDGF/p75-IN interaction could have been used for this. While the additional work is not critical, it is important to at least soften the tone of conclusions since both p52 and p75 would have been visualized in these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment and have softened the conclusions accordingly. We now state that the antibody binds both isoforms, but that only p75 has been shown to interact with IN. Since the antibody is not specific for the p75 isoform, we have not altered the term to LEDGF/p75 when referring to the imaging results, however. As stated in the review, LEDGF was not the main focus of our work, and we have thus refrained from extensive controls in this case.</p></body></sub-article></article>
