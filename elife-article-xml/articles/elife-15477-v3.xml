reprograming in intact organisms. In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, reprograming germ cells into somatic cells requires chromatin perturbation. Here, we describe that such reprograming is facilitated by GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway. This is surprising, since this pathway is best known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors. Through a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes, we uncovered a possible explanation for this unexpected role of GLP-1/Notch. We propose that GLP-1/Notch promotes reprograming by activating specific genes, silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and identify the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GLP-1/Notch target facilitating reprograming. These findings have wide implications, ranging from development to diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15477.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15477.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15477.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The DNA in genes encodes the basic information needed to build an organism or control its day-to-day operations. Most cells in an organism contain the same genetic information, but different types of cell use the information differently. For example, many of the genes that are active in a muscle cell are different from those that are active in a skin cell.</p><p>These different patterns of gene activation largely determine a cell’s identity and are brought about by DNA-binding proteins or chemical modifications to the DNA (which are both forms of so-called epigenetic regulation). Nevertheless, cells occasionally change their identities – a phenomenon that is referred to as reprograming. This process allows tissues to be regenerated after wounding, but, due to technical difficulties, reprograming has been often studied in isolated cells grown in a dish.</p><p>Seelk, Adrian-Kalchhauser et al. set out to understand how being surrounded by intact tissue influences reprograming. The experiments made use of <italic>C. elegans</italic> worms, because disturbing how this worm’s DNA is packaged can trigger its cells to undergo reprograming. Seelk, Adrian-Kalchhauser et al. show that a signaling pathway that is found in many different animals enhances this kind of reprograming in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>On the one hand, these findings help in understanding how epigenetic regulation can be altered by a specific tissue environment. On the other hand, the findings also suggest that abnormal signaling can result in altered epigenetic control of gene expression and lead to cells changing their identity. Indeed, increased signaling is linked to a major epigenetic mechanism seen in specific blood tumors, suggesting that the regulatory principles uncovered using this simple worm model could eventually provide insights into a human disease.</p><p>A future challenge will be to determine precisely how the studied signaling pathway interacts with the epigenetic regulator that controls reprograming. Understanding this interaction in molecular detail could help to devise strategies for controlling reprograming. These strategies could in turn lead to treatments for people with conditions that cause specific cells types to be lost, such as Alzheimer’s disease or injuries.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15477.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15477.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Notch</kwd><kwd>PRC2</kwd><kwd>reprograming</kwd><kwd>utx-1</kwd><kwd>glp-1</kwd><kwd>mes-2</kwd><kwd>mes-3</kwd><kwd>mes-6</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>germ cell</kwd><kwd>T-ALL</kwd><kwd>leukemia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2014-STG #637530 - REPROWORM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tursun</surname><given-names>Baris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-PEOPLE-2012-CIG #333922- REPROL53U48</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tursun</surname><given-names>Baris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000921</institution-id><institution>European Cooperation in Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SBFI C15.0038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ciosk</surname><given-names>Rafal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Increased Notch signaling enhances germ cell reprograming in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by antagonizing PRC2-mediated repression, which results in the activation of UTX-1 and other reprograming-promoting genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell-fate decisions are controlled, on the one hand, by intercellular signaling and, on the other hand, by intrinsic mechanisms such as epigenetic chromatin modifications. The Notch signaling pathway is a highly conserved and widespread signaling mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenwald and Kovall, 2013</xref>), which has been implicated in key cell-fate decisions such as the decision between proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Notch signaling has also been implicated in cellular reprograming. Upon inhibition of Notch signaling, the oncogenic genes KLF4 and cMyc become dispensable for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from mouse and human keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ichida et al., 2014</xref>). In this setting, Notch inhibits reprograming. Conversely, Notch signaling promotes transdifferentiation of pancreatic acinar cells to ductal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sawey et al., 2007</xref>), or the conversion of hepatocytes into biliary cells in liver primary malignancy intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sekiya and Suzuki, 2012</xref>). Notch signaling can also affect reprograming in normal development. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, signaling through the GLP-1 and LIN-12 Notch receptors impedes reprograming during embryogenesis and, during larval development, signaling through LIN-12 is required for the conversion of a rectal epithelial cell into a motorneuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jarriault et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Djabrayan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The role of epigenetic regulators in cell-fate decisions has been studied mostly in pluripotent cells cultured outside of their normal tissue environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meshorer and Misteli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spivakov and Fisher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lessard and Crabtree, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orkin and Hochedlinger, 2011</xref>). Therefore, the epigenetic regulation of stem cell identity in intact tissues remains poorly understood. Additionally, the impact of external cues, for example signaling from a stem cell niche to the recipient cell’s chromatin remains equally unresolved. By contrast, <italic>C. elegans</italic> has been used as a model to study reprograming in an intact organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukushige et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukushige and Krause, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciosk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jarriault et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yuzyuk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riddle et al., 2013</xref>). In this model, germ cells can be directly reprogrammed into neurons by depleting specific chromatin modifiers such as LIN-53 (Rbbp4/7) or components of PRC2, and by concomitant overexpression of the transcription factor CHE-1, which induces glutamatergic neuronal fate in a process which we refer to as Germ cell Conversion (GeCo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tursun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patel et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we identify the Notch signaling pathway as a critical player in this reprograming model. This was unanticipated, since signaling through the Notch receptor GLP-1 (henceforth GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup>) from the somatic gonadal niche is known to maintain germline stem cell/progenitor fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kimble and Crittenden, 2007</xref>). To understand this novel, reprograming-promoting role of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup>, we combined genetics with tissue-specific expression profiling. We identified genes regulated by GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup>, including genes recently shown to maintain the germline stem/progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kershner et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, and unexpectedly, we found that many genes activated by GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling were also repressed by the cell fate-stabilizing chromatin regulator PRC2. We show that GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> and PRC2 have an antagonistic effect on germ cell-fate decisions and demonstrate co-regulation of their common target, <italic>utx-1.</italic> Importantly, UTX-1 is a histone demethylase known to erase the gene-silencing methylation of histone H3 dependent on PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maures et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vandamme et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, we propose that the GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup>–dependent induction of UTX-1 facilitates reprograming by alleviating PRC2-mediated repression of alternative cell fates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> enhances conversion of germ cells into neuron-like cells</title><p>Germ cells can be converted into neuronal cells in intact <italic>C. elegans</italic> upon overexpression of the neuronal transcription factor CHE-1, simply by depleting the chromatin modifier LIN-53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tursun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patel et al., 2012</xref>). This GeCo phenotype can be followed in living animals by monitoring a reporter GFP expressed from the <italic>gcy-5</italic> promoter, which otherwise is induced in glutamatergic ASE neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altun-Gultekin et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast to the spontaneous teratomatous differentiation of meiotic germ cells, observed in the absence of specific RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciosk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biedermann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tocchini et al., 2014</xref>), GeCo is preferentially observed in the pre-meiotic, proliferating germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tursun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patel et al., 2012</xref>). Consistently, removing the proliferating germ cells, by inhibiting GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling, prevents GeCo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tursun et al., 2011</xref>). However, because the proliferating germ cells were eliminated, these experiments did not address a possible direct effect of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling on GeCo. We began addressing this issue by examining the gonads of animals carrying the gain-of-function <italic>glp-1</italic> allele (<italic>ar202</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pepper et al., 2003</xref>). These gonads are filled with proliferating germ cells and, upon depleting LIN-53 and overexpressing CHE-1, we observed that significantly more germ cells converted to ASE neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We refer to this enhanced GeCo as 'GeCo+'. Detailed quantification revealed that the GeCo+ gonads contained more than twice the number of converted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The nuclei of these converted cells were reminiscent of neuronal nuclei and the cells displayed axo-dendritic projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tursun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patel et al., 2012</xref>). To confirm that the GeCo enhancement depends on the canonical Notch signaling pathway, rather than an independent function of the GLP-1<sup>Notch </sup>receptor, we RNAi-depleted the transcriptional effector of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling, LAG-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christensen et al., 1996</xref>). We exposed animals only after hatching to <italic>lag-1</italic> RNAi in order to avoid sterility, which is caused when animals are subjected to <italic>lag-1</italic> RNAi earlier (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplemental file 1</xref>). RNAi-mediated knock-down of <italic>lag-1</italic> strongly inhibited GeCo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Importantly, under these experimental conditions, we did not observe any obvious reduction of germ cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), suggesting a proliferation-independent effect of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling on cell-fate conversion. To investigate this further, we tested GeCo efficiency on germ cells proliferating independently of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling. We took advantage of mutants in which, in the absence of two meiosis/differentiation-promoting factors GLD-1 and GLD-2, germ cells proliferate independently of GLP-1<sup>Notch </sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kadyk and Kimble, 1998</xref>). Specifically, we examined GeCo in the loss-of-function <italic>gld-1(q497) gld-2(q485)</italic> mutants, which carried either wild-type <italic>glp-1</italic> or the loss-of-function <italic>glp-1(q175)</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Austin and Kimble, 1987</xref>). Both mutant combinations have previously been described to have tumorous germlines and impaired meiotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kadyk and Kimble, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansen et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast to efficient GeCo observed in the <italic>gld-1(q497) gld-2(q485)</italic> gonads, GeCo was strongly diminished in the <italic>gld-1(q497) gld-2(q485); glp-1(q175)</italic> gonads, despite the ongoing germ cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Counting the number of germ cells in these gonads revealed only a slight difference (a 15% increase in the numbers in the double vs. triple mutant gonads), suggesting that the strong enhancement of GeCo by GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling cannot be explained by the increased number of germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Since it has been proposed that dividing cells have a higher propensity for cellular reprograming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Egli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanna et al., 2009</xref>), we also tested whether blocking the cell cycle would affect the observed GeCo enhancement in <italic>glp-1(gf)</italic> gonads. As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fox et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patel et al., 2012</xref>), we used hydroxyurea (HU) treatment to block the cell cycle in the S phase. Blocking the cell cycle by HU did not diminish the GeCo+ phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Combined, these results suggest that GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> enhances GeCo independently from its role in promoting germ cell proliferation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15477.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling promotes reprograming of germ cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> enhances germ cell conversion (GeCo) into neuronal-like cells.

The double <italic>mes-2</italic> M+Z-; <italic>glp-1(ar202)</italic> mutants, however, displayed distal and proximal tumors at the same temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; 32/32 examined gonads). PRC2 and GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> thus interact functionally, and they appear to do so in a germ cell autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Given the striking enrichment of Notch-activated genes on the X chromosome, and the genetic interaction between PRC2 and GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup>, we speculated that GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> and PRC2 act on similar genes. To determine whether Notch-activated genes are also PRC2-repressed, we first determined putative PRC2 targets by expression analyses on isolated wild-type, M+Z- <italic>mes-2</italic> or <italic>mes-6</italic> mutant gonads (GEO accession number GSE49395). Consistent with the joint function of MES-2 and MES-6 in the PRC2 complex, a very similar set of genes was upregulated upon the loss of either protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>; henceforth ‘PRC2 repressed’ genes; also see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaydos et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, those PRC2-repressed genes overlapped strongly with Notch-activated genes, particularly those linked to the X chromosome. Nearly all of the X-linked Notch-activated genes were also derepressed upon the loss of PRC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This is consistent with the observed genetic interaction and suggests that increased GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling can induce expression of specific PRC2-repressed genes. This activation of the PRC2-repressed genes is not due to a global loss of the repressive tri-methylation of Histone H3 at lysine residue 27 (H3K27me3), since, upon examining gonads of different GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> mutants, we observed no global loss of H3K27me3 in the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling enhances reprograming</title><p>Germ cell conversion to neurons can be triggered not only by LIN-53 depletion but also by the depletion of PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patel et al., 2012</xref>).

Considering the antagonistic relation between GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> and PRC2 on cell proliferation and gene regulation, we wondered whether GeCo triggered by the depletion of PRC2 would be sensitive to Notch signaling.

This construct was also single-copy integrated into a defined genomic location.

By contrast, both the UTX-1 fusion protein and the <italic>putx-1</italic> reporter were little or not expressed in the distal-most, proliferative part of the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Concomitantly with progression through meiosis, their expression increased toward the proximal end of the gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>).

Here, we report an unexpected role of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling in promoting cell fate reprograming. To understand this phenomenon, we identified genes activated upon increased GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling. While the identified genes include the physiological GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> targets, <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic>, many other genes, including <italic>utx-1</italic>, appear to be only weakly or not expressed in the distal-most region of the wild-type gonad, where both <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic> are induced by GLP-1<sup>Notch </sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kershner et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the wild-type levels of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling are either insufficient to induce expression of many potential target genes (see below), or their expression is controlled by additional mechanisms, perhaps similarly to <italic>lip-1</italic> mRNA, which, while induced by GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup>, is post-transcriptionally degraded in the distal-most gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hajnal and Berset, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to its major proliferation-promoting function, GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> has been suggested to have a lesser role in promoting germ cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansen et al., 2004</xref>). Some of the identified Notch-activated genes appear to promote germ cell differentiation, potentially explaining the proposed differentiation-promoting function of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup>. However, whether these genes are activated by GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> and promote differentiation under physiological conditions remains to be determined.</p><p>Many of the Notch-activated genes are repressed by PRC2, suggesting that the expression of these genes is determined by the crosstalk between the extrinsic intercellular signaling pathway, Notch, and the intrinsic chromatin modifier PRC2. Indeed, at least in the case of <italic>utx-1</italic>, PRC2 appears to prevent its inappropriate expression in the distal-most gonad, which, nevertheless, can be overcome upon increased GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling. Our findings suggest that GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> antagonizes PRC2, at least in part, by stimulating expression of the H3K27 demethylase UTX-1, which is essential for the enhancement of cellular reprograming. Previously, it was suggested that UTX-1 influences the germline by functioning in the somatic gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vandamme et al., 2012</xref>). However, by using the <italic>rrf-1</italic> background, which displays defective RNAi in the somatic gonad, including the DTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumsta and Hansen, 2012</xref>), we found that the reprograming-promoting role of UTX-1 is unlikely to depend on its function in the somatic gonad. Although we cannot fully exclude the possibility that the reprograming-facilitating role of UTX-1 depends on its expression in another somatic tissue (such as the intestine, in which RNAi remains functional in the <italic>rrf-1</italic> mutant; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumsta and Hansen, 2012</xref>), the germline expression of UTX-1 reported here suggests a germline-autonomous function. Consistent with this hypothesis, manipulating either PRC2 or GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> affected the germline expression of <italic>utx-1</italic>.</p><p>Although additional factors, such as the uncharacterized C07G1.6 and the ortholog of the human aldolase A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuwabara and O'Neil, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shaye and Greenwald, 2011</xref>) might contribute to reprograming, they appear to be less critical. In addition to UTX-1, another H3K27/H3K9-demethylating enzyme, JMJD-1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al., 2010</xref>), is required for enhanced reprograming. Similar to UTX-1, JMJD-1.2 is likely to be directly involved in regulating chromatin accessibility, since its depletion results in increased levels of the repressive H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al., 2010</xref>). The reprograming-promoting role of JMJD-1.2 might indicate that, besides further demethylation of H3K27me2, perhaps also the removal of H3K9me2 facilitates GeCo. Future studies will shed light on this interesting question.</p><p>UTX-1 orthologs in other species contribute to tissue-specific chromatin signatures, for example during myogenesis or in cardiac development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seenundun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), and have been implicated in germ-cell and somatic reprograming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mansour et al., 2012</xref>). Together with our data, these findings underscore the importance of UTX-1 in cellular reprograming. Here, we suggest that one way the activity of UTX-1 may be stimulated to promote reprograming is through its Notch signaling-dependent transcriptional activation. Interestingly, an antagonistic relationship between Notch and PRC2 has also been observed in T-cell leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ntziachristos et al., 2012</xref>). A fascinating possibility is that a regulatory principle described here could help explain the etiology of this and perhaps other human diseases linked to a pathological increase in Notch signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Nematode culture and mutants</title><p>Standard procedures were used to maintain animals.

Slides were then washed three times for 5 mins in PBS 0.1% Tween-20 at room temperature and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Transgenic animals and reporter GFP quantifications</title><p>The transcriptional reporter gene <italic>putx-1::gfp-h2b (rrrSi185)</italic> was constructed from the 1302 bp putative promoter region of the gene <italic>utx-1</italic> (<italic>human UTX (Ubiquitously transcribed TPR on X) homolog - 1</italic>) fused to sequences encoding for GFP-H2B and the ubiquitously expressed <italic>tbb-2</italic> 3’UTR using the Gateway Reporter Cloning System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Merritt et al., 2008</xref>).

For GFP quantification, gonads were dissected from live animals in M9 buffer containing levamisole and mounted to glass microscopy slides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frøkjaer-Jensen et al., 2008</xref>). Fluorescent micrographs were recorded with Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope and a Zeiss Axioncam MRm REV 2 CCD camera was used to capture images. Fluorescence intensities were quantified using ImageJ. GFP intensities were normalized to the picture background and corrected with the average autofluorescences measured in wild type (N2) gonads at the corresponding temperatures. Images subject to direct comparison were taken at identical exposure times and were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS4 in an identical manner. The numbers of analyzed gonads were as follows: n = 44 for wild-type reporter; n = 36 for <italic>glp-1(gf <sup>ts</sup>)</italic>; n = 55 for wild-type reporter on control RNAi; n = 48 for <italic>mes-2(RNAi)</italic>; n = 15 for <italic>mes-3(RNAi)</italic>; n = 29 for <italic>mes-6(RNAi)</italic>, and n = 20 for LAG-1 binding sites deleted reporter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Genetic interaction of <italic>glp-1</italic> and <italic>mes-2</italic></title><p>Alleles used were <italic>glp-1(ar202)</italic> and <italic>mes-2(bn11)</italic>.

In a first round, a low number of gonads were examined to identify whether the double mutant had a phenotype and to define phenotypic categories to score. Based on the observation of a clear and penetrant phenotype, gonads were scored in a second round according to the categories defined in the first round.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Sergej Herzog, Alina El-Khalili, Mei He, Sandra Muehlhaeusser and Iskra Katic for technical assistance, and the following FMI technology platforms: functional genomics, bioinformatics, advanced imaging and microscopy.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Notch signaling antagonizes PRC2-mediated silencing to promote reprograming of germ cells into neurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Julie Ahringer as the Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study the authors investigate the reprogramming of germ cells into neurons in the adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line upon removal of certain chromatin modifiers, an in vivo reprogramming process they refer to as GeCo. Here they show a requirement for Notch signalling in this process, and suggest that this role of Notch is independent of its role in promoting proliferation. They also identify targets of Notch, one of which is an H3K27 demethylase, UTX-1, suggesting a mechanism by which Notch-directed transcription may counteract PRC2-dependent repression.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The claim that the antagonism between GLP-1 Notch signaling and PRC2 that you study here is functionally relevant in the germline, or conceptually, in reprogramming, is not substantiated. In particular, the X-linked GLP-1 transcriptional targets you studied (e.g., <italic>utx-1</italic>) do not appear to be GLP-1 transcriptional targets in normal germline development, although they may become GLP-1 targets in the absence of PRC2. The data seem consistent with GLP-1 signaling acting within an abnormal permissive context generated by loss of PRC2. The paper should be reframed to address this point or the claim should be justified.</p><p>2) The authors assume that genetic perturbations employed are germline autonomous, but do not experimentally demonstrate that this is the case. The <italic>mes</italic> genes function in the soma (Ross and Zarkower, 2003). It has also been shown that loss of gene activity in the somatic gonad can result in enhancement of the <italic>glp-1(ar202</italic>) tumorous germline phenotype (McGovern et al., 2009). Therefore, the authors should show that the <italic>mes</italic> gene mutant enhancement of <italic>glp-1(ar202)</italic> is germ cell autonomous, which is required based on the mechanism proposed. Similarly, the authors use RNAi of Notch upregulated genes to substantiate the argument that the genes are relevant for germ cell proliferation. While data from others has shown that some of the identified genes function in the germline (for example, Kershner et al., 2014; Doyle et al., 2000) it is also well known that loss of function of genes that function only in the soma can result in reduced proliferation (for example, Dalfo et al., 2012). Note that for <italic>utx-1</italic>, its function in reprogramming is interesting whether it acts in the germline or the soma, although models for its action would be different.</p><p>3) The authors conclude that the GeCo phenotype requires Notch signaling, independent of proliferation. To be confident in the conclusion, the following issues should be addressed.</p><p>A) As <italic>lag-1</italic> is the transcriptional effector of Notch signaling in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> does not give confidence that the <italic>lag-1</italic> RNAi is working as the <italic>lag-1</italic> RNAi should cause the <italic>glp-1</italic> gain of function germ cells to enter meiosis, resulting in fewer germ cells and a different germline morphology compared to the mock treated (Berry et al., 1997).</p><p>B) From the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, it appears that the HU treatment may have not been effective. HU should inhibit mitosis in the germ line, leading to fewer germ cell nuclei, and it should induce cell cycle arrest, leading enlarged germ nuclei. Although the HU image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> shows a lack of Edu positive nuclei, there is no evidence of enlarged germ cell nuclei or of reduced germ cell number, which is expected for HU treatment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in Gartner et al., 2004). The control for HU treatment is also not adequately explained.</p><p>C) What developmental or cell cycle state are the germ cells with more or less Notch activity? This is important since Notch regulates the proliferative state of germ cells. Cells that are pre-meiotic may not be able to convert readily compared to proliferative germ cells.

In particular:</p><p>The authors use <italic>rrf-1</italic> to address whether genes function within the germ line. The logic is that a germline autonomous regulator should not be perturbed by the addition of an <italic>rrf-1</italic> mutation.

And why do <italic>mes-3</italic> and <italic>mes-6</italic> look different from <italic>mes-2</italic>?</p><p><italic>rrf-1</italic> appears to modify the tumorous phenotype on its own. Why do <italic>rrf-1</italic> mutants suppress <italic>glp-1</italic> Tumors?</p><p>Finally, it is unclear how the authors are calling the cut off for germline autonomous vs. somatic effects.

This is most critical for <italic>utx-1</italic>, in my opinion.</p><p>The conclusion that UTX-1 acts in the germ line is also not convincing for three reasons.</p><p>First, Seelk et al. use the promoter of <italic>utx-1</italic> with a histone GFP readout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). While this shows changes in <italic>glp</italic> and <italic>mes</italic> mutants, it is convincing with regard to UTX activity because the germ line relies heavily on post-transcriptional regulation. To ensure that the protein reflects RNA levels, the authors need to look at the endogenous protein or a single copy, rescuing reporter that has the whole protein and regulatory sequences.</p><p>Second, Vandamme 2012 argued that UTX-1 activity in the soma influenced the germ line, perhaps through the distal tip cell. The distal tip cell signals through the Notch pathway, so this is a reasonable idea.</p><p>Third, Vandamme 2012 did not show endogenous UTX-1 expression in the germ line, as stated by Seelk et al.</p><p>The key question is whether UTX and H3K27me3 function in the germ line and downstream of Notch to control reprogramming via target gene regulation. It may be that some events occur in the soma, so I don't think the authors need to test everything for cell autonomy, but <italic>utx-1</italic> would be useful, particularly given previous publications suggesting at distal tip cell focus.</p><p>The H3K27me3 stains appear to have been done without controls, so it is impossible to judge if there are any changes in different strain backgrounds. (If there were, it would be more convincing that <italic>utx</italic> was acting in the germ line.) A well-controlled experiment would include an on-slide control (e.g. a marked N2) and a germline control (e.g. histone H3).

The failure to do so makes the paper hard to understand for readers outside the immediate <italic>C. elegans</italic> field.</p><p>B) The expected pattern based on the work of Kershner et al., 2015, is that GLP-1 dependent transcripts are limited to the distal most 5 to 10 cell diameters, consistent with ligand expression limited to the distal tip cell. The authors interpretation of the <italic>putx-1::gfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and <italic>putx-1::FLAG-GFP::utx-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) is that there is weak expression in the distal-most region of the germline where GLP-1 targets are expected to be expressed. However, this reviewer cannot see any <italic>putx-1</italic> GFP signal above background, and this view is supported by the absence of mRNA in the distal-most germline from the in situ hybridization experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, the sentence &quot;Consistent with the expression patterns of the endogenous <italic>utx-1</italic> (Vandamme et al. 2012) and of a GFP used, functional <italic>utx-1</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), the <italic>utx-1</italic> reporter was weakly expressed in the distal-most, proliferative part of the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-C</xref>).&quot; should be changed to indicate that there is &quot;little or no expression in the distal-most, proliferative part of the germline&quot;.</p><p>C) The sentence &quot;However, a similar expression pattern has been reported for another reported GLP-1Notch target gene, <italic>lip-1</italic> (Hajnal and Berset 2002; Lee et al. 2006).&quot; should be removed. Hajnal and Berset 2002 showed that <italic>lip-1</italic> is a <italic>lin-12</italic> transcriptional target in vulval development, with no information on <italic>glp-1</italic> or the germline. Lee et al. 2006 did not perform the <italic>glp-1</italic> dependence experiment comparing <italic>gld-1 gld-2</italic> with <italic>gld-1 gld-2; glp-1</italic>, which the authors in this manuscript performed, and thus it is uncertain if <italic>lip-1</italic> is a germline target of GLP-1 in distal-most germ cells.</p><p>D) In the first two paragraphs of the subsection “UTX-1 is required for GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup>-mediated GeCo enhancement”. There is no evidence that GLP-1 signaling occurs in the medial/proximal gonad, as GLP-1 protein is not found in this region (Crittenden et al., 1994). Therefore, the expression of the 33 genes indicated is either an indirect consequence of GLP-1 signaling (another transcription factor that is transcribed in the distal-most germline stem cells in response to GLP-1 signaling which then acts to induce transcription much later in development, in pachytene cells) or is not regulated by GLP-1 signaling at all. The sentence needs to be changed to indicate that the observed expression is <italic>not</italic> consistent with direct GLP-1 transcriptional regulation.</p><p>2) In the subsection “Both GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> and PRC2 regulate expression of the H3K27 demethylase UTX-1”. &quot;Deleting those sites drastically reduced reporter expression in the medial and proximal portions of the gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).&quot; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> indicates that the decrease is at most 25%. The sentence should be &quot;Deleting those sites reduced reporter expression by approximately 25% in the medial and proximal portions of the gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).&quot;</p><p>3) The last paragraph of the subsection “Both GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> and PRC2 regulate expression of the H3K27 demethylase UTX-1”.</p><p>&quot;Overall, our observations suggest that PRC2 and GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling have antagonistic effects on <italic>utx-1</italic> transcription. However, the endogenous levels of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling are apparently insufficient to overcome PRC2-mediated repression in the distal part of the gonad&quot; does not emphasize the findings in the manuscript and should be rewritten in the following way:</p><p>&quot;Overall, our observations suggest that PRC2 and GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling have antagonistic effects on <italic>utx-1</italic> transcription that can be observed in a PRC2 mutant background. However, in wild type the endogenous levels of GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling are apparently insufficient to overcome PRC2-mediated repression in the distal part of the gonad&quot;.</p><p>4) Discussion. While the sentence &quot;This suggests that the identified set of genes may contain additional physiological GLP-1Notch targets.&quot; may be true, of the genes analyzed in this manuscript, none have been shown to be convincing GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> targets in wild type animals.</p><p>The Discussion should instead focus on their novel findings – that PRC2 is apparently acting antagonistically to prevent certain GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> targets from being expressed in the germline, which makes sense as it is likely important to block the expression of some somatic GLP-1 targets from being expressed in germ cells, and that these include <italic>utx-1</italic> which promotes reprogramming.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>I think in general the study stands up as providing evidence that there is some antagonism between Notch activation and PRC2-mediated repression of genes, and that enhancement of Notch activity in germ cells yields similar transcriptional consequences to loss of PRC2 repression in germ cells – enhanced X-linked gene expression. Similarly, these conditions also both make it easier to drive germ cells towards somatic differentiation upon ectopic activation of somatic fate drivers, such as <italic>che-1</italic>.</p><p>The question still stands whether this is informative for either normal germ cell development or for understanding the balance of activation and repression controlling early embryo development or programming/reprogramming.</p><p>I think it's clear that the processes studied are artificial in terms of germ cell development – but not entirely so. I think the authors do show that the balance of Glp-1 signaling and PRC2 repression are essential for normal germ cell development. I also think they've shown they can uncouple some of the Glp-1-dependent effects from proliferation phenotypes. This probably underlies the differences in absolute phenotypes between Glp-1 gof and PRC2 mutants (which are presumably maternally rescued mutants): proliferation defects in the former compared to little visible defects in the maternally rescued germ cells. It's formally interesting that raising the level of Notch activity has the same effect on transcriptional regulation as lowering PRC2 activity in these cells. It's interesting that this seems to be separate from any need for proliferation to be dysregulated.</p><p>I think the authors have adequately addressed the technical concerns about this conclusion.</p><p>There still is a bit of what I view as semantic issues with how some things are phrased that can be over-interpreted by the reader, or may indeed still be overstatements by the authors:</p><p>For example, the subsection “GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> and PRC2 have antagonistic functions in the germline” states &quot;that, in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad, specific PRC2-repressed genes are activated via GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling.&quot; This certainly implies that <italic>glp-1</italic> activation of genes like <italic>utx-1</italic> is part of normal germ cell function, which is unlikely to be true.</p><p>Lastly, the description of the <italic>mes</italic> mutants used needs to be clarified. I am assuming that when the authors are referring to <italic>mes-2(bn11)</italic> mutants, etc. they are actually referring to the F1 maternally rescued homozygote offspring (e.g., M Z ). It is important to clarify that these animals and their germ cells are not completely devoid of a history of PRC2 activity, which is why they have germ cells to count and look at in the first place. Absent maternal MES protein, there wouldn't be but a few dying germ cells in the adult gonads to look at.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15477.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The claim that the antagonism between GLP-1 Notch signaling and PRC2 that you study here is functionally relevant in the germline, or conceptually, in reprogramming, is not substantiated. In particular, the X-linked GLP-1 transcriptional targets you studied (e.g., utx-1) do not appear to be GLP-1 transcriptional targets in normal germline development, although they may become GLP-1 targets in the absence of PRC2. The data seem consistent with GLP-1 signaling acting within an abnormal permissive context generated by loss of PRC2. The paper should be reframed to address this point or the claim should be justified.</italic> </p><p>We would like to point out that, despite using compound mutants to uncover putative GLP-1 targets, these strains contain wild-type PRC2. Thus, <italic>utx-1</italic>, along with at least some other identified genes, such as the confirmed targets <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic> (Kershner et al. 2014), is regulated in the context of normal PRC2. In agreement with GLP-1– dependent regulation of <italic>utx-1</italic> in normal development, <italic>utx-1</italic> is bound by LAG-1 and the deletions of LAG-1 binding sites in the <italic>utx-1</italic> promoter, expressed in the wild-type background, impair its expression.</p><p>It is true, however, that whether normal levels of Notch signaling are sufficient to antagonize PRC2 repression in normal development remains uncertain. We made this point clear at the end of the Results section, stating: “However the endogenous levels of GLP-1/Notch signaling are apparently insufficient to overcome PRC2-mediated repression (of <italic>utx-1</italic>) in the distal part of the gonad.”</p><p><italic>2) The authors assume that genetic perturbations employed are germline autonomous, but do not experimentally demonstrate that this is the case. The mes genes function in the soma (Ross and Zarkower, 2003). It has also been shown that loss of gene activity in the somatic gonad can result in enhancement of the glp-1(ar202) tumorous germline phenotype (McGovern et al., 2009). Therefore, the authors should show that the mes gene mutant enhancement of glp-1(ar202) is germ cell autonomous, which is required based on the mechanism proposed. Similarly, the authors use RNAi of Notch upregulated genes to substantiate the argument that the genes are relevant for germ cell proliferation. While data from others has shown that some of the identified genes function in the germline (for example, Kershner et al., 2014; Doyle et al., 2000) it is also well known that loss of function of genes that function only in the soma can result in reduced proliferation (for example, Dalfo et al., 2012). Note that for utx-1, its function in reprogramming is interesting whether it acts in the germline or the soma, although models for its action would be different.</italic> </p><p>To address this valid concern, we used the <italic>glp-1(ar202); rrf-1(pk1417)</italic> strain to re-screen <italic>mes</italic> genes and several enhancers/suppressors for germ cell autonomy. The <italic>rrf-1</italic> mutant strains have impaired somatic RNAi response, while the germline RNAi response is still robust (Sijen et al., 2001).</p><p>While some enhancers, such as <italic>mbk-1</italic> and B0416.5 seem to work from the somatic tissues (i.e. enhance the tumorous phenotype <italic>in glp-1(ar202)</italic> but not in <italic>glp-1(ar202); rrf-1(pk1417)</italic> mutants), other enhancers and suppressors, such as <italic>puf-9</italic>, are germ cell autonomous (see <bold>F</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">igure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Importantly, while <italic>mes-2</italic> and <italic>mes-3</italic> RNAi knockdowns were not very efficient (this has been observed in the lab before) and did not enhance the tumorous phenotype in either strain, RNAi-mediated depletion of MES-6 did enhance the phenotype in both <italic>glp-1(ar202)</italic> and <italic>glp-1(ar202); rrf-1(pk1417)</italic> strains. Thus, while there may be a somatic role for some of the enhancers or suppressors, the genetic interaction between GLP-1 and PRC2 is autonomous to the germline.</p><p><italic>3) The authors conclude that the GeCo phenotype requires Notch signaling, independent of proliferation. To be confident in the conclusion, the following issues should be addressed.</italic> </p><p><italic>A) As lag-1 is the transcriptional effector of Notch signaling in C. elegans, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> does not give confidence that the lag-1 RNAi is working as the lag-1 RNAi should cause the glp-1 gain of function germ cells to enter meiosis, resulting in fewer germ cells and a different germline morphology compared to the mock treated (Berry et al., 1997).</italic> </p><p>As pointed out, efficient depletion of LAG-1 will result in precocious differentiation of germ cells or suppress <italic>glp-1</italic> gf tumors. Indeed, <italic>lag-1</italic> RNAi was our control in the screen for <italic>glp-1</italic> gf tumor suppressors. However, a weaker <italic>lag-1</italic> RNAi was precisely the strength of our experiments, separating the effect on GeCo from the effect on proliferation. Our protocol involved <italic>lag-1</italic> RNAi only after hatching (P0 RNAi). By this, we bypassed the L1 lethality as well as the <italic>glp-1(lf)-</italic>like phenotype (loss of mitotic germ cells). Additionally, our use of double RNAi combinations (either with control vector or <italic>lin-53</italic> RNAi) in the <italic>lag-1</italic> assay effectively diluted the RNAi 1:1. Thus, we did not observe a fully penetrant <italic>lag-1</italic> phenotype for germ cell proliferation. Avoiding the <italic>glp-1(lf)-</italic>like phenotype was important, since we showed previously that the <italic>glp-1(lf)</italic> mutant background results in the loss of GeCo (Tursun et al. 2011). We apologize that we failed to explain this sufficiently. We state now explicitly in the Results section that “We exposed animals only after hatching to <italic>lag-1</italic> RNAi in order to avoid sterility[…]”</p><p><italic>B) From the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, it appears that the HU treatment may have not been effective. HU should inhibit mitosis in the germ line, leading to fewer germ cell nuclei, and it should induce cell cycle arrest, leading enlarged germ nuclei. Although the HU image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> shows a lack of Edu positive nuclei, there is no evidence of enlarged germ cell nuclei or of reduced germ cell number, which is expected for HU treatment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in Gartner et al., 2004). The control for HU treatment is also not adequately explained.</italic> </p><p>The protocol by Gartner, 2004 uses a 12 h incubation and subsequent EdU staining, which results in both, loss of EdU staining and the enlargement of germ cells. We have performed a new experiment shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>using 12 h incubation with HU. We can see the enlargement of nuclei based on DAPI as described by Gartner, 2004 and Fox et al., 2011. We also performed H3Ser10ph (pH3) antibody staining and the loss of pH3 staining in the HU treated <italic>glp-1(gf)</italic> germline suggests that the germ cells undergo cell cycle arrest, indicating that HU treatment is, also in our hands, effective.</p><p>Importantly, Fox et al. 2011 have described that five hours of HU treatment are sufficient to abolish EdU staining, while germ cells do not yet enter a premeiotic stage. In a previous study using the exact same conditions, we could see the depletion of EdU incorporation but no obvious nuclei enlargement after 5 h (Patel et al. 2012). Therefore, we decided to use a 5 h exposure for imaging the cell cycle arrest in our original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> panel B. While we cannot see obvious changes in germ cell nuclei size in the <italic>glp-1(gf)</italic> background after 5 h, we are confident that we have effectively induced cell cycle arrest by that time. We have further clarified our experimental procedure in Materials and methods / Cell cycle arrest by HU treatment and EdU staining.</p><p><italic>C) What developmental or cell cycle state are the germ cells with more or less Notch activity? This is important since Notch regulates the proliferative state of germ cells. Cells that are pre-meiotic may not be able to convert readily compared to proliferative germ cells. Note that this is independent of cell numbers, but relies on markers and morphology of the germ line. Conversely, in the HU block experiment, do the germ cells enter the meiosis pathway?</italic> </p><p>We agree that GeCo diminishes when germ cells prematurely enter meiosis as we have shown before using the <italic>glp-1(lf)</italic> background (Tursun et al., 2011). The <italic>glp-1(lf)</italic> background is known to cause a premature entry into meiosis while <italic>glp-1(gf)</italic> causes a tumorous germ line due to increased proliferation and expansion of the meiotic zone. The tumorous germlines of <italic>gld-1 gld-2</italic> and of <italic>gld-1 gld-2; glp-1(lf)</italic> mutants have been characterized previously by Kadyk et al., 1998 and Hansen et al., 2004 using pH3, REC- 8, and HIM-3 antibodies. While wild-type germlines or <italic>glp-1(lf)</italic> germlines show 100% entry into meiosis, in the double or triple mutants, only 10 – 20% of cells express early meiotic markers. This argues against the possibility that the loss of GeCo in <italic>gld-1 gld-2; glp-1(lf)</italic> triple mutant germlines is caused by increased meiotic entry because these cells actually barely enter into meiosis. We added this information to the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>D) Although they should be related, the assessment of total germ cell number is not a measure of mitotic germ cell number, which is the key measure of proliferation. To determine whether the increase in conversion is a consequence of an increase in number of mitotic germ cells, the authors should quantify the number of mitotic germ cells (e.g., using phospho histone H3 staining) rather than total germ cell number.</italic> </p><p>In order to disentangle whether ‘increased proliferation’ versus ‘Notch signaling per se’ is required for GeCo enhancement, we made use of the triple mutant background <italic>gld-1 gld-2; glp-1(lf),</italic> in which germ cells proliferate independently from GLP-1. This strain has been extensively documented to have a tumorous germline due to over-proliferation of the germ cells (Kadyk et al., 1998; Hansen et al., 2004; Fox et al., 2011). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, GeCo is almost lost in this triple mutant due to the absence of GLP-1. Hence, an increase in mitotic germ cells is not sufficient to result in the increase of conversion. Also, inhibiting the cell cycle with HU (which abolishes PH3-positive cells as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>using phospho histone H3 staining) did not abolish GeCo, which suggests that the GLP-1 dependent enhancement is cell cycle independent.</p><p><italic>4) It would improve the paper to show a stain of H3K27me3 in the different cellular environments (Notch single and triple mutants) and to compare the location of H3K27me3 with locations that can respond to heterologous regulators.</italic> </p><p>Based on communication with the Editor, we have performed H3K27me3 staining of gonads from different <italic>glp-1</italic> backgrounds. We did not detect any obvious changes in the global staining, consistent with GLP-1-dependent activation of a subset of PRC2-repressed genes. We provided this data in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) H3K27me3 might be predicted to silence transgenes introduced into worms, such as those involved in reprogramming. The authors should check the level of CHE-1 expression in the different cellular environments to make sure that the changes they track reflect the response of the tissue and not the expression of the inducer.</italic> </p><p>To address this valid concern, we performed HA antibody staining for the 3xHA-tagged CHE-1 protein, which is being induced after heat-shock treatment in the different genetic backgrounds. We could not detect obvious changes in the induction of CHE-1::3xHA in the germlines of the different genetic backgrounds. Hence, the different effects on GeCo does not seem to be due to changes in the CHE-1 expression levels. We provide this data in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) The authors should improve the citations for previous C. elegans studies on Notch, PRC2, and reprogramming in C. elegans (e.g. from the Mango, Rothman, Krause, Priess labs such as Djabrayan et al., Genes &amp; Development, 2012, Yuzyuk et al., Dev Cell, 2009).</italic> </p><p>We apologize for incorrect citations and have corrected them throughout the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. Two are particularly important:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Your new experiments do not convincingly show that the interaction between Notch and PRC2 is germ line autonomous, so it remains uncertain where PRC2 and utx-1 are acting in glp-1(ar202) proliferation and conversion into neurons. Gene activity in the soma can modify glp-1(ar202) overproliferation in the germline.</italic> </p><p><italic>2) Second, the conclusion that UTX-1 is a germ line target of Notch is not convincing.</italic> </p><p><italic>These and the other points raised in the attached reviews all need to be addressed, either by experiments or by changing your text. Please note that we can offer no further opportunities for additional work or modification thus the binding decision must be made on your next revised submission.</italic> </p><p><italic>Additionally, points in your paper overstated or incorrect as described in the reviews. For example, Vandamme et al. 2012 did not show endogenous UTX-1 expression in the germ line, contrary to what is stated in your paper. In other places there is insufficient information provided to allow readers outside of the immediate field to understand what is already known and what then is an expected result.</italic> </p><p>As explained in our detailed response to the Reviewers, we thoroughly re-wrote the manuscript to eliminate errors, overstatements, and to improve clarity. As for the two major points, we could answer them by improving writing and performing a new experiment.</p><p>Firstly, while using the somatic RNAi-deficient <italic>rrf-1</italic> mutant to probe germline autonomy has limitations, which we now explain, we can use this background to eliminate the possibility, brought up by Reviewer 1, that the examined effects originate from the somatic gonad. As published by Kumsta and Hansen 2012, RNAi is in fact defective in the somatic gonad, including in the distal tip cell (DTC), allowing this type of analysis. We now provide new data, using the <italic>rrf-1</italic> background, supporting the germline- autonomy of UTX-1 in reprograming. Nevertheless, as requested by Reviewers, we have softened our conclusions as explained below.</p><p>Secondly, while indeed Vandamme et al. 2012 did not show the germline expression of <italic>utx-1</italic> – we are sorry for this inaccuracy – this was most likely so because extrachromosomal arrays, which they used to express UTX-1, are typically silenced in the germline. In fact, one of our supplemental figures showed exactly the germline expression of single copy-integrated, FLAG and GFP tagged, rescuing UTX-1, strongly arguing that the UTX-1 protein is normally expressed in the germline. We suspect this data was misunderstood because of unclear labeling, which we have now changed, as explained below. Finally, by using the <italic>utx-1</italic> promoter-driven reporter, we showed that the expression of this reporter in the germline responded to the alterations in either PRC2 or GLP-1/Notch.</p><p>Our new data on UTX-1-dependent reprograming in the <italic>rrf-1</italic> background, combined with the germline expression of tagged, rescuing UTX-1, and the <italic>utx-1</italic> promoter reporter studies, corroborate now the notion that UTX-1 functions in the germline. Nevertheless, we were careful to avoid overstatements and discussed alternative scenarios, as explained below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The investigation of the cell cycle vs Notch effects is carefully done and convincing.</italic> </p><p><italic>The question of cell autonomy is not convincing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In particular:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors use rrf-1 to address whether genes function within the germ line. The logic is that a germline autonomous regulator should not be perturbed by the addition of an rrf-1 mutation. This is a weak line of reasoning as rrf-1 is required in some somatic tissues but not others: See Kumsta and Hansen 2012.</italic> </p><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing this out. Indeed, while the <italic>rrf-1</italic> mutation was used by others to examine germline autonomy (for example Wang et al. 2012, Developmental Dynamics; Killian and Hubbard 2004, Development; Chen and Greenwald 2015, Genes Genomes Genetics; Fox et al. 2011, Development), the study by Kumsta and Hansen reported ongoing RNAi in the intestine, and residual RNAi in some hypodermal cells.</p><p>Importantly, they confirmed deficient RNAi in the somatic gonad, including the distal tip cell (DTC). Thus, while this approach is not perfect, we still consider it as our best option to address germline autonomy. Nevertheless, to avoid overstatements, we now explain the limitation of this assay.</p><p>In the paragraph “GLP-1<sub>Notch</sub> activates genes mainly on X chromosomes”:</p><p>“While some of these genes may function autonomously in the germ line, others could affect the germ line indirectly from the soma. […] While depleting most candidates in the <italic>rrf-1</italic> background had similar effects on the germ line as in the wild type (suggesting germ line- autonomous function), in some cases the effects were abolished, suggesting that these genes function in the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2–source data 1</xref>).”</p><p>In the paragraph “UTX-1 is required for GLP-1<sub>Notch</sub>-mediated GeCo enhancement”: “Because UTX-1 was suggested to effect gonadal development by functioning in the somatic gonad (Vandamme et al. 2012), we re-examined GeCo efficiency upon <italic>utx-1</italic> RNAi in the <italic>rrf-1 (pk1417)</italic> background. […] Because the suppression of GeCo upon <italic>utx-1</italic> RNAi was observed also in the <italic>rrf-1</italic> background, UTX-1 does not seem enhance GeCo by functioning in the somatic gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).”</p><p><italic>In addition, mes-2 looks affected by rrf-1 mutations. So is this actually a germ-line role of PRC2? Or could it be somatic? And why do mes-3 and mes-6 look different from mes-2?</italic></p><p>We apologize for the confusion. Apparently, our remark in the legend that, in this experiment, RNAi against <italic>mes-2</italic> and <italic>-3</italic> were ineffective, did not stand out. Since MES- 2, -3 and –6 function in a complex, and to avoid confusion, we have removed now the <italic>mes-2</italic> and <italic>–3</italic> RNAi data from the graph and re-wrote the legend accordingly (see the modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p> <italic>rrf-1 appears to modify the tumorous phenotype on its own. Why do rrf-1 mutants suppress glp-1 Tumors?</italic> </p><p>This indeed appears to be the case, perhaps indicating a role for somatic endoRNAi. We presented the <italic>glp-1(gf)</italic> single mutant data nonetheless, to show that depleting chosen genes by RNAi had the expected effects on germline tumors (enhancement or suppression). However, the main point of this experiment was to compare the effects between different RNAi conditions in the <italic>rrf-1</italic> background. So, to avoid confusion, we decided to split the graphs between <italic>glp-1(gf)</italic> and <italic>glp-1(gf); rrf-1</italic> backgrounds (though we still remark in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> that the tumors were affected in the <italic>rrf-1</italic> background for an unknown reason):</p><p>“We observed that, for an unknown reason, the <italic>rrf-1(pk1417); glp-1(ar202)</italic> double mutants were less likely to produce tumors at the semi-permissive temperature of 20°C.”</p><p><italic>Finally, it is unclear how the authors are calling the cut off for germline autonomous vs. somatic effects. Not only for mes-2 but for all genes.</italic> </p><p>With the caveat of the residual RNAi in the intestine, we considered an RNAi-induced effect to indicate germline autonomy when the effect was observed in both <italic>glp-1(gf)</italic> and <italic>glp-1(gf); rrf-1</italic> backgrounds. If the effect was observed in only the <italic>glp-1(gf)</italic> background (but not the <italic>glp-1(gf); rrf-1</italic> background), we considered it indicative of a somatic effect. Clearly, with increased numbers of animals, we would be able to evaluate additional borderline cases and provide statistics. However, <italic>glp-1(gf)</italic> animals grow very slowly (need to be propagated at 15º), so performing more replicates was, due to the revision deadline, not doable. While we may have missed minor effects, we would like to point out that the main purpose of the experiment was to demonstrate that somatic effects may play a role for <italic>s</italic>ome of these genes, which is the case, and that, for PRC2, somatic effects do not play a major role (which we show for <italic>mes-6</italic>). We hope that restructuring the figure and our explanations will satisfy the Reviewer. We now emphasize that some of the Notch activated genes may function in the soma in the paragraph “GLP-1<sub>Notch</sub> activates genes mainly on X chromosomes”:</p><p>“While some of these genes may function autonomously in the germ line, others could affect the germ line indirectly from the soma. […] While depleting most candidates in the <italic>rrf-1</italic> background had similar effects on the germ line as in the wild type (suggesting germ line- autonomous function), in some cases the effects were abolished, suggesting that these genes function in the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2–source data 1</xref>).”</p><p><italic>A simpler way to address this question would be to express a rescuing construct in the germ line alone. E.g. a mini Mos construct. This is most critical for utx-1, in my opinion.</italic> </p><p>We would love to perform this experiment, and have tried hard to achieve a germline specific rescue. Unfortunately, <italic>utx-1</italic> is an essential gene. Therefore, expressing a rescuing <italic>utx-1</italic> construct only in the germline will lead to severe developmental defects of the animals due to the lack of <italic>utx-1</italic> in other tissues (Vandamme et al. 2012, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Nonetheless, and as stated in our previous response letter, we did try to express <italic>utx-1</italic> from <italic>pie-1</italic> or <italic>gld-1</italic> promoter but the animals turned sterile. Therefore, we resorted to the use of the <italic>rrf-1</italic> background. In <italic>rrf-1</italic> animals, neither the somatic gonad nor the DTC are able to stage an RNAi response. This is important with regard to the concern below.</p><p>While this approach has certain limitations – for example, <italic>rrf-1</italic> worms are able to stage an RNAi response in the intestine – it is the best we can do to investigate the autonomous versus non-autonomous roles of <italic>utx-1</italic> in GeCo (this new data is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p><italic>The conclusion that UTX-1 acts in the germ line is also not convincing for three reasons.</italic> </p><p><italic>First, Seelk et al. use the promoter of utx-1 with a histone GFP readout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). While this shows changes in glp and mes mutants, it is convincing with regard to UTX activity because the germ line relies heavily on post-transcriptional regulation. To ensure that the protein reflects RNA levels, the authors need to look at the endogenous protein or a single copy, rescuing reporter that has the whole protein and regulatory sequences.</italic> </p><p>We would like to point out that this experiment has been already done (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We expressed a single copy-integrated, FLAG and GFP-tagged UTX-1 protein from the endogenous promoter and under the control of the endogenous <italic>utx-1</italic> 3'UTR. This fusion protein rescued the <italic>utx-1</italic> mutant and was expressed in the germline in the same pattern as the <italic>utx-1</italic> promoter reporter. We realized that the labeling of this figure could have been misleading and changed it (from <italic>putx-1::FLAG-GFP::utx-1</italic>) to <italic>&quot;putx-1::flag-gfp-tev::utx-1::utx-1 3’utr&quot;.</italic></p><p><italic>Second, Vandamme 2012 argued that UTX-1 activity in the soma influenced the germ line, perhaps through the distal tip cell. The distal tip cell signals through the Notch pathway, so this is a reasonable idea.</italic> </p><p>As discussed above, Kumsta and Hansen, 2012 showed that RNAi is defective in the somatic gonad, including DTC, in <italic>rrf-1</italic> mutants. We now show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> that <italic>utx-1</italic> RNAi in the <italic>rrf-1</italic> background still inhibited GeCo , arguing against a role for UTX-1 in DTC or other cells of the somatic gonad.</p><p><italic>Third, Vandamme 2012 did not show endogenous UTX-1 expression in the germ line, as stated by Seelk et al.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for this obvious mistake. Indeed, Vandamme et al., 2012 showed with antibody staining that UTX-1 is present in the germline precursor cell at the 4-cell stage. For other tissues, they used extrachromosomal arrays, which, as a rule, are silenced in the germline. With the citation removed, the paragraph “GLP-1<sub>Notch</sub> and PRC2 regulate</p><p>expression of the H3K27 demethylase UTX-1” now reads:</p><p>“To test the potential expression of <italic>utx-1</italic> in the germ line, we constructed a strain expressing single copy-integrated, FLAG and GFP-tagged, functional UTX-1 (expressed from the endogenous <italic>utx-1</italic> promoter under the control of endogenous <italic>utx-1</italic> 3'UTR). We found that this protein was indeed expressed in the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p><italic>The key question is whether UTX and H3K27me3 function in the germ line and downstream of Notch to control reprogramming via target gene regulation. It may be that some events occur in the soma, so I don't think the authors need to test everything for cell autonomy, but utx-1 would be useful, particularly given previous publications suggesting at distal tip cell focus.</italic> </p><p>As discussed above, Kumsta and Hansen, 2012 showed that RNAi is defective in the DTC in <italic>rrf-1</italic> mutants. We now show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> that <italic>utx-1</italic> RNAi in the <italic>rrf-1</italic> background inhibited GeCo enhancement, arguing against a role for UTX-1 in DTC (or other cells of the somatic gonad).</p><p><italic>The H3K27me3 stains appear to have been done without controls, so it is impossible to judge if there are any changes in different strain backgrounds. (If there were, it would be more convincing that utx was acting in the germ line.) A well-controlled experiment would include an on-slide control (e.g. a marked N2) and a germline control (e.g. histone H3). The ratio of H3K27me3:H3 would give an indication of whether levels are changing.</italic> </p><p>We would like to point out that we did include a wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). The stainings were performed independently by both Ciosk and Tursun labs, using whole worms or dissected gonads. The wild-type samples were not stained on the same slide as mutants, but were processed in the same batch and staining was always consistent. The genomic data suggested that increased GLP-1<sub>Notch</sub> signaling actives a subset of PRC2-repressed genes, so the purpose of this experiment was to confirm that there was no global loss of H3K27me3 upon increased GLP-1<sub>Notch</sub> signaling. Indeed, we found that, in the tested mutants, the levels and overall appearance of H3K27me3 were not obviously altered compared to controls.</p><p><italic>References to be added:</italic> </p><p><italic>Introduction, second paragraph: add Horner et al., 1998 as one of the first examples of reprogramming in an intact organism and of timing of competence.</italic> </p><p><italic>Introduction, second or third paragraph: add Yuzyuk 2009 for PRC2 -dependent termination of plasticity and promotion of cell fate stabilization.</italic></p><p><italic>Introduction, third paragraph: add Maures 2011, Jin 2011, maybe Vandamme 2012 for identification of utx-1 as a regulator of H3K27me3.</italic> </p><p>We added these citations at the suggested positions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>A number of changes need to be made to the manuscript so that the results and possible conclusion are more transparent.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Paragraph with heading “Both GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> and PRC2 regulate expression of the H3K27 demethylase UTX-1”:</italic></p><p><italic>A) The authors should first explain what is the expected expression pattern for a GLP-1 transcriptional target, based on the known and experimentally validated direct transcriptional targets of GLP-1 Notch in the gonad, lst-1 and sygl-1, described in Kershner et al. 2015. The failure to do so makes the paper hard to understand for readers outside the immediate C. elegans field.</italic> </p><p>We re-wrote this paragraph and, before describing the <italic>utx-1</italic> expression pattern, introduce the patterns of <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic>, as suggested:</p><p>“With both the UTX-1 fusion protein and the putx-1 reporter, we expected expression patterns similar to that of other reported GLP-1<sub>Notch</sub> target genes (Lamont et al. 2004; Lee et al. 2006; Kershner et al. 2014). […] By contrast, both the UTX-1 fusion protein and the <italic>putx-1</italic> reporter were little or not expressed in the distal-most, proliferative part of the germ line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p><italic>B) The expected pattern based on the work of Kershner et al., 2015, is that GLP-1 dependent transcripts are limited to the distal most 5 to 10 cell diameters, consistent with ligand expression limited to the distal tip cell. The authors interpretation of the putx-1::gfp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and putx-1::FLAG-GFP::utx-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) is that there is weak expression in the distal-most region of the germline where GLP-1 targets are expected to be expressed. However, this reviewer cannot see any putx-1 GFP signal above background, and this view is supported by the absence of mRNA in the distal-most germline from the in situ hybridization experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, the sentence &quot;Consistent with the expression patterns of the endogenous utx-1 (Vandamme et al. 2012) and of a GFP used, functional utx-1 transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), the utx-1 reporter was weakly expressed in the distal-most, proliferative part of the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-C</xref>).&quot; should be changed to indicate that there is &quot;little or no expression in the distal-most, proliferative part of the germline&quot;.</italic> </p><p>This sentence has been modified accordingly:</p><p>“By contrast, both the UTX-1 fusion protein and the <italic>putx-1</italic> reporter were little or not expressed in the distal-most, proliferative part of the germ line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p><italic>C) The sentence &quot;However, a similar expression pattern has been reported for another reported GLP-1Notch target gene, lip-1 (Hajnal and Berset 2002; Lee et al. 2006).&quot; should be removed. Hajnal and Berset 2002 showed that lip-1 is a lin-12 transcriptional target in vulval development, with no information on glp-1 or the germline. Lee et al. 2006 did not perform the glp-1 dependence experiment comparing gld-1 gld-2 with gld-1 gld-2; glp-1, which the authors in this manuscript performed, and thus it is uncertain if lip-1 is a germline target of GLP-1 in distal-most germ cells.</italic> </p><p>This sentence has been removed, as requested. We mention now the expression pattern of <italic>lip-1</italic> in the Discussion, citing Lee et al., 2006.</p><p><italic>D) In the first two paragraphs of the subsection “UTX-1 is required for GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup>-mediated GeCo enhancement”. There is no evidence that GLP-1 signaling occurs in the medial/proximal gonad, as GLP-1 protein is not found in this region (Crittenden et al., 1994). Therefore, the expression of the 33 genes indicated is either an indirect consequence of GLP-1 signaling (another transcription factor that is transcribed in the distal-most germline stem cells in response to GLP-1 signaling which then acts to induce transcription much later in development, in pachytene cells) or is not regulated by GLP-1 signaling at all. The sentence needs to be changed to indicate that the observed expression is not consistent with direct GLP-1 transcriptional regulation.</italic> </p><p>The sentence has been changed as recommended:</p><p>&quot;When examining the existing mRNA hybridization patterns of GLP-1<sub>Notch</sub>-activated and PRC2-repressed genes (33 genes), we noticed that half of these (18, all X-linked) are similarly expressed in the medial and/or proximal, but not the distal-most, gonads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), arguing against direct transcriptional activation of these genes by GLP-1<sub>Notch</sub> in the wild type.&quot;</p><p><italic>2) In the subsection “Both GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> and PRC2 regulate expression of the H3K27 demethylase UTX-1”. &quot;Deleting those sites drastically reduced reporter expression in the medial and proximal portions of the gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).&quot; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> indicates that the decrease is at most 25%. The sentence should be &quot;Deleting those sites reduced reporter expression by approximately 25% in the medial and proximal portions of the gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).&quot;</italic> </p><p>The sentence has been changed as recommended:</p><p>&quot;[…]the activation of the <italic>utx-1</italic> promoter by Notch signaling was depended on the putative LAG-1/CSL binding sites within the promoter (Yoo et al. 2004), as deleting those sites reduced reporter expression by approximately one-fourth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).&quot;</p><p><italic>3) The last paragraph of the subsection “Both GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> and PRC2 regulate expression of the H3K27 demethylase UTX-1”.</italic> </p><p><italic>&quot;Overall, our observations suggest that PRC2 and GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling have antagonistic effects on utx-1 transcription.

While the sentence &quot;This suggests that the identified set of genes may contain additional physiological GLP-1Notch targets.&quot; may be true, of the genes analyzed in this manuscript, none have been shown to be convincing GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> targets in wild type animals.</italic> </p><p><italic>The Discussion should instead focus on their novel findings – that PRC2 is apparently acting antagonistically to prevent certain GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> targets from being expressed in the germline, which makes sense as it is likely important to block the expression of some somatic GLP-1 targets from being expressed in germ cells, and that these include utx-1 which promotes reprogramming.</italic> </p><p>We have re-written the Discussion, according to these suggestions, to our best ability.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>I think in general the study stands up as providing evidence that there is some antagonism between Notch activation and PRC2-mediated repression of genes, and that enhancement of Notch activity in germ cells yields similar transcriptional consequences to loss of PRC2 repression in germ cells – enhanced X-linked gene expression. Similarly, these conditions also both make it easier to drive germ cells towards somatic differentiation upon ectopic activation of somatic fate drivers, such as che-1.</italic> </p><p><italic>The question still stands whether this is informative for either normal germ cell development or for understanding the balance of activation and repression controlling early embryo development or programming/reprogramming.</italic> </p><p>We are happy to hear that our Reviewer likes the evidence we provide for the antagonistic relationship of Notch and PRC2 in the germline.</p><p>As also requested by Reviewer 2, the Discussion now hopefully states clearly that, at this point, the connection to the wild-type development remains an open question.</p><p><italic>I think it's clear that the processes studied are artificial in terms of germ cell development – but not entirely so. I think the authors do show that the balance of Glp-1 signaling and PRC2 repression are essential for normal germ cell development. I also think they've shown they can uncouple some of the Glp-1-dependent effects from proliferation phenotypes. This probably underlies the differences in absolute phenotypes between Glp-1 gof and PRC2 mutants (which are presumably maternally rescued mutants): proliferation defects in the former compared to little visible defects in the maternally rescued germ cells. It's formally interesting that raising the level of Notch activity has the same effect on transcriptional regulation as lowering PRC2 activity in these cells. It's interesting that this seems to be separate from any need for proliferation to be dysregulated.</italic> </p><p><italic>I think the authors have adequately addressed the technical concerns about this conclusion.</italic> </p><p><italic>There still is a bit of what I view as semantic issues with how some things are phrased that can be over-interpreted by the reader, or may indeed still be overstatements by the authors:</italic> </p><p><italic>For example, the subsection “GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> and PRC2 have antagonistic functions in the germline” states &quot;that, in the C. elegans gonad, specific PRC2-repressed genes are activated via GLP-1<sup>Notch</sup> signaling.&quot; This certainly implies that glp-1 activation of genes like utx-1 is part of normal germ cell function, which is unlikely to be true.</italic> </p><p>We have rephrased this sentence to: &quot;… suggests that increased GLP-1 signaling can induce expression of specific PRC2-repressed genes.&quot;</p><p><italic>Lastly, the description of the mes mutants used needs to be clarified. I am assuming that when the authors are referring to mes-2(bn11) mutants, etc. they are actually referring to the F1 maternally rescued homozygote offspring (e.g., M Z ). It is important to clarify that these animals and their germ cells are not completely devoid of a history of PRC2 activity, which is why they have germ cells to count and look at in the first place. Absent maternal MES protein, there wouldn't be but a few dying germ cells in the adult gonads to look at.</italic> </p><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing this out. Indeed, we used M Z- animals. We now indicate it in the main text:</p><p>&quot;At 20°C, both the temperature-sensitive gain-of-function <italic>glp-1(ar202)</italic> and the homozygous loss-of-function <italic>mes-2(bn11)</italic> mutants, derived from heterozygous mothers providing maternal MES-2 (<italic>mes-2</italic> M Z- mutants), were viable and produced gonads with nearly wild-type appearance.
