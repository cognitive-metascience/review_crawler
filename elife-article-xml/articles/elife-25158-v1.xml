Understanding their regulation is thus important for studying biology and human diseases. Here, we report that a novel posttranslational mechanism, reversible lysine fatty acylation, regulates R-Ras2, a member of the Ras family. SIRT6, a sirtuin with established tumor suppressor function, regulates the lysine fatty acylation of R-Ras2. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), <italic>Sirt6</italic> knockout (KO) increased R-Ras2 lysine fatty acylation. Lysine fatty acylation promotes the plasma membrane localization of R-Ras2 and its interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase PI3K, leading to activated Akt and increased cell proliferation. Our study establishes lysine fatty acylation as a previously unknown mechanism that regulates the Ras family of GTPases and provides an important mechanism by which SIRT6 functions as a tumor suppressor.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25158.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25158.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25158.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Proteins that cause and promote cancer are called oncoproteins. Other proteins, called tumor suppressors, counteract the oncoproteins but are frequently inactive or not present in cancer cells.</p><p>SIRT6 is a tumor suppressor protein that has been studied in many different types of cancer. In 2013, researchers found that SIRT6 can remove chemical groups known as fatty acyl groups from the lysine residues of proteins. However, it was unclear whether and how this activity of SIRT6 contributes to its role as a tumor suppressor.</p><p>Zhang et al. – who are part of the research group who performed the 2013 study – have now compared mouse cells that lack SIRT6 with normal mouse cells to find out which proteins SIRT6 removes fatty acyl groups from. A biochemical technique that makes use of synthetic fatty acids, which get incorporated into the mouse cells, showed that SIRT6 removes fatty acyl groups from a protein called R-Ras2. This protein is part of a large family of oncoproteins.</p><p>Zhang et al. discovered that when R-Ras2 is tagged with the fatty acyl group it moves to the cell’s membrane and causes the cell to divide more rapidly. Hence, this promotes the growth and spread of cancerous tumors. SIRT6 acts as an eraser, removing the fatty acyl group, and therefore slows down the growth of cancer cells.</p><p>Future experiments will aim to find out whether fatty acyl groups also control the activity of other oncoproteins that are similar to R-Ras2. If that is the case, drugs that can regulate the removal of fatty acyl groups from oncoproteins may eventually form new cancer treatment options.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25158.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25158.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Ras</kwd><kwd>acylation</kwd><kwd>sirtuin</kwd><kwd>defatty-acylation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM098596</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Hening</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK107868</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Hening</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM008500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>Ornealla D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Student Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jing</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A posttranslational regulatory mechanism for a Ras family small GTPase could open up new directions to understand and control the Ras family of proteins that are important for physiology and diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>SIRT6 (sirtuin 6) belongs to the Sir2 (silencing information regulator 2) family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>)-dependent protein lysine deacylases. It plays important roles in a variety of biological processes, including DNA damage and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaidi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Toiber et al., 2013</xref>), glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhong et al., 2010</xref>), and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sebastián et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Sirt6</italic> knockout (KO) mice display multiple defects and die a few weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mostoslavsky et al., 2006</xref>). Underlying its biological functions, SIRT6 has multiple enzymatic activities. It can deacetylate histone H3 lysine 9 (Ac-H3K9), lysine 18 (Ac-H3K18), and lysine 56 (Ac-H3K56) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Michishita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Michishita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tasselli et al., 2016</xref>), to suppress target gene expression of several transcription factors, including NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kawahara et al., 2009</xref>), HIF-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhong et al., 2010</xref>), c-Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sundaresan et al., 2012</xref>), and c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sebastián et al., 2012</xref>). SIRT6 has also been reported to be an adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liszt et al., 2005</xref>). We have recently identified SIRT6 as an efficient lysine defatty-acylase that regulates the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>). Mechanistically, lysine fatty acylation promotes TNFα targeting to lysosome and thus decreases its secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether SIRT6 regulates other proteins by defatty-acylation.</p><p>The Ras family of proteins plays important roles in numerous biological pathways, including signal transduction, membrane trafficking, nuclear export/import, and cytoskeletal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wennerberg et al., 2005</xref>). Five branches of the Ras superfamily (Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf, and Ran) are classified according to sequence similarity. Ras proteins can exist in two conformational states: a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state. In the GTP-bound state, Ras proteins can recruit effector proteins and turn on specific signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hancock, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karnoub and Weinberg, 2008</xref>). Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) play important roles in regulating the Ras family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahearn et al., 2011</xref>). Ras and Rho families of GTPases are modified by prenylation (farnesylation or geranylgeranylation) on their C-terminal CaaX motif at the cysteine residue. Some proteins from Ras and Rho families, such as H-Ras and N-Ras, contain cysteine palmitoylation as a second lipidation. Both prenylation and palmitoylation serve as important membrane targeting signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahearn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Linder and Deschenes, 2007</xref>). Other proteins from Ras and Rho families, such as K-Ras4B, do not have cysteine palmitoylation and are thought to use a C-terminal polybasic sequence for membrane targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahearn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Linder and Deschenes, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that a Ras family protein, R-Ras2 (also called TC21 because it was cloned from a human teratocarcinoma cDNA library) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Drivas et al., 1990</xref>), which is able to transform cells and is up-regulated in several human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gutierrez-Erlandsson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Erdogan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Murphy et al., 2002</xref>), is regulated by a novel PTM, lysine fatty acylation. Importantly, SIRT6 is identified as the defatty-acylase of R-Ras2. SIRT6 defatty-acylates R-Ras2 and attenuates its plasma membrane localization, therefore inhibits its ability to activate PI3K signaling pathway and cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Defatty-acylation contributes to SIRT6’s tumor-suppressor function</title><p>SIRT6 has been reported to be a tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sebastián et al., 2012</xref>). Decreased SIRT6 expression level is found in several human cancers. Enhanced glycolysis is observed in SIRT6-deficient cells and tumors, which is thought to drive tumor formation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sebastián et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the tumor formation promoted by the loss of SIRT6 is oncogene <italic>HRAS</italic>-independent. However, the exact role of SIRT6 in cancer is still not well understood. In particular, which enzymatic activity is important for the tumor suppression function is not clear.</p><p>We have recently identified a single point mutation (G60A) of SIRT6 that maintains the defatty-acylase activity but exhibits no detectable deacetylase activity in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Utilizing this mutant, we first investigated whether the defatty-acylase activity of SIRT6 contributes to tumor suppression and aimed to identify the defatty-acylation substrate protein that is important for this function. We stably expressed SIRT6 wild type (WT) (exhibits both deacetylase and defatty-acylase activities), G60A (exhibits only defatty-acylase activity in cells), or H133Y (exhibits neither activity in cells) into <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and tested their effects on cell proliferation. <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs expressing SIRT6 WT showed decreased cell proliferation compared to those without SIRT6 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), consistent with the reported role of SIRT6 in suppressing cell proliferation. In contrast, expressing the H133Y mutant had no significant effect on cell proliferation. Interestingly, expression of the G60A mutant, which only exhibits the defatty-acylase activity in cells, also decreased cell proliferation, similar to the expression of SIRT6 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The suppression of cell proliferation by SIRT6 WT was only slightly better than that by the G60A mutant. This suggests that although both deacetylase and defatty-acylase activities of SIRT6 contribute, the defatty-acylase activity plays a major role in regulating cell proliferation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25158.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of defatty-acylation targets of SIRT6 that contribute to its function in cell proliferation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cell proliferation of <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs stably expressing pCDH empty vector, SIRT6 WT, G60A, or H133Y.

We used fatty acid analogs to metabolically label fatty acylated proteins and enriched these proteins by incorporating a biotin tag through the copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (typically called click chemistry) followed by streptavidin pull-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Two fatty acid analogs were used for cross comparison: Alk12 which better mimics myristic acid and Alk14 which better mimics palmitic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Charron et al., 2009</xref>). When processing the samples, we used IpaJ, a cysteine protease from <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> that has been reported to hydrolyze the peptide bond after N-myristoylated glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burnaevskiy et al., 2013</xref>), to reduce the labeling background from N-myristoylation. We also used hydroxylamine (NH<sub>2</sub>OH) as a nucleophile to remove fatty acylation on cysteine residues.</p><p>There were 865 proteins identified in Alk12 SILAC and 1285 proteins identified in Alk14 SILAC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">2</xref>). To narrow down the target lists, we filtered the data using four criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>): (1) Protein score ≥10, and the number of unique peptide ≥2; (2) The target was present in both SILAC experiments, which could decrease the <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation background (proteins present only in Alk12 SILAC) and <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation background (proteins present only in Alk14 SILAC); (3) Heavy/Light ratio ≥1.5, which allowed us to pick proteins that exhibited higher lysine fatty acylation in <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs than in <italic>Sirt6</italic> WT MEFs; (4) The target had similar protein levels in <italic>Sirt6</italic> WT and KO MEFs by comparing the data from a total protein SILAC experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>), which was to make sure that proteins with higher Heavy/Light ratios in Alk12 and Alk14 SILAC were not due to increased protein levels. With these criteria, we narrowed down the target lists to five proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, a Ras-related small GTPase, R-Ras2, was one of the possible defatty-acylation targets of SIRT6. R-Ras2, like its cousins (H-, N-, and K-Ras), is known to be highly relevant to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Erdogan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clark et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rosário et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rong et al., 2002</xref>). We thus hypothesized that the tumor suppressing function of SIRT6 could be through regulating R-Ras2. To test this hypothesis, we knocked down R-Ras2 in <italic>Sirt6</italic> WT and KO MEFs and examined the cell proliferation. Knockdown of R-Ras2 in both <italic>Sirt6</italic> WT and KO MEFs by two different shRNAs significantly decreased cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that R-Ras2 is important for cell proliferation in MEFs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>R-Ras2 is SIRT6 defatty-acylation target and fatty acylated on C-terminal lysine residues</title><p>We then validated whether R-Ras2 had lysine fatty acylation. We first examined R-Ras2 mRNA and proteins levels in <italic>Sirt6</italic> WT and KO MEFs. The results showed that SIRT6 did not affect the transcription and translation of R-Ras2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We then used the fatty acid analog Alk14 to metabolically label an overexpressed FLAG-tagged R-Ras2. After FLAG immunoprecipitation, we conjugated a fluorescent dye (520-BODIPY-azide) through click chemistry to allow visualization of fatty acylated R-Ras2 by in-gel fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We used NH<sub>2</sub>OH to remove potential cysteine fatty acylation. Thus, the in-gel fluorescence signal should be mainly attributed to fatty acylation on lysine residues. R-Ras2 exhibited increased lysine (NH<sub>2</sub>OH-resistant) fatty acylation in <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs than in WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

We treated the cells with Alk14, and then incorporated a biotin tag on fatty acylated proteins (including R-Ras2) through click chemistry. We pulled down the fatty acylated proteins using streptavidin beads and then removed <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation from the streptavidin beads by NH<sub>2</sub>OH treatment. The proteins on beads were then resolved by gel electrophoresis and the level of R-Ras2 was detected by FLAG western blot.

Endogenous R-Ras2 labeled with Alk14 was conjugated to biotin and pulled down with streptavidin beads. More fatty-acylated endogenous R-Ras2 was pulled down from <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs than from WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that endogenous R-Ras2 contained more lysine fatty acylation in <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs.</p><p>To confirm that SIRT6 could defatty-acylate R-Ras2 directly, we overexpressed FLAG-tagged R-Ras2 in <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs, metabolically labeled with Alk14, and then purified R-Ras2 protein from total cell lysates. We then incubated R-Ras2 with SIRT6 in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup> and subsequently performed click chemistry to detect R-Ras2 lysine fatty acylation. In the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup>, SIRT6 removed most of the lysine fatty acylation signal from R-Ras2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We also used a previously established <sup>32</sup>P-NAD<sup>+</sup> assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Du et al., 2011</xref>), in which the newly generated fatty acyl adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPR) product could be easily detected on thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate, to detect lysine fatty acylation on R-Ras2. SIRT6 WT, but not the catalytic mutant SIRT6 H133Y, generated the fatty acyl ADPR spot in the presence of R-Ras2 isolated from <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs and NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These data suggested that R-Ras2 was fatty-acylated on lysine residues and SIRT6 could directly remove the fatty acylation in vitro.</p><p>Next, we set out to identify which lysine residues of R-Ras2 were fatty acylated. We noticed that there are four lysine residues in the C-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of R-Ras2: K192, K194, K196, and K197 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This region is known as a C-terminal polybasic sequence and is generally believed to help anchor Ras proteins to the membrane through electrostatic interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahearn et al., 2011</xref>). We suspected that some of these lysine residues might be fatty acylated. We thus mutated these four lysine residues to arginine (the 4KR mutant), which should maintain the positive charge and thus, should not disrupt the membrane association provided by the positive charge. We examined the lysine fatty acylation of R-Ras2 WT and 4KR in <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs and found that the 4KR mutant significantly decreased the lysine fatty acylation signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>We then utilized mass spectrometry (MS) to directly identify the modification site using FLAG-tagged R-Ras2 purified from Alk14 treated <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs. A peptide (residue 193–197) carrying Alk14 modification on K194 was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, when we mutated each of these four lysine residues to arginine and detected their Alk14 labeling by in-gel fluorescence, the hydroxylamine-resistant labeling of all the single mutants was similar to that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). This result suggested that K192, K194, K196, and K197 are likely to be fatty acylated redundantly, although the MS result implied that K194 is preferentially fatty acylated on WT R-Ras2 protein.</p><p>R-Ras2 is known to have palmitoylation on cysteine 199, which is close to the fatty acylated lysine cluster. It is possible that lysine fatty acylation occurs via acyl transfer from the nearby acylated cysteine. To test this possibility, we mutated cysteine 199 to serine (the C199S mutant) and assayed its Alk14 labeling in HEK 293T cells. Alk14 labeling still occurred on R-Ras2 C199S mutant, which was NH<sub>2</sub>OH resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>), suggesting that cysteine fatty acylation of R-Ras2 is not required for the occurrence of its lysine fatty acylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Lysine fatty acylation targets R-Ras2 to plasma membrane</title><p>To investigate the function of R-Ras2 lysine fatty acylation, we first examined the subcellular localization of R-Ras2 WT and 4KR in both <italic>Sirt6</italic> WT and KO MEFs by confocal imaging. In <italic>Sirt6</italic> WT MEFs, both R-Ras2 WT and 4KR were localized in the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs, R-Ras2 WT was mainly localized in the plasma membrane, while R-Ras2 4KR was localized in both the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Considering that R-Ras2 WT in <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs has the highest lysine fatty acylation level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and G</xref>), this data suggests that lysine fatty acylation helps targeting R-Ras2 to the plasma membrane.</p><p>In addition, we performed subcellular fractionation of HEK 293T cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged R-Ras2. Under normal conditions, SIRT6 was present and removed most fatty acyl group from R-Ras2 lysine residues, and thus we did not observe obvious difference in plasma membrane and cytosolic localizations between WT R-Ras2 and the 4KR mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). When we treated the cells with palmitic acid (to increase R-Ras2 lysine fatty acylation) or SIRT6 inhibitor TM3 (to inhibit SIRT6 defatty-acylase activity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">He et al., 2014</xref>), we observed decreased cytosolic localization of WT R-Ras2, but not the 4KR mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). This data also supports that lysine fatty acylation of R-Ras2 targets it to the plasma membrane.</p><p>To further confirm that SIRT6 regulates R-Ras2 by defatty-acylation and not deacetylation, we expressed SIRT6 G60A, which exhibits no detectable deacetylase activity in cells, in <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs and examined the lysine fatty acylation and subcellular localization of R-Ras2. Expressing the G60A mutant in <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs decreased R-Ras2 lysine fatty acylation to the same level as expressing WT SIRT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In vitro, the G60A mutant removed fatty acylation from R-Ras2 similar to WT SIRT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Confocal imaging results showed that in <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs, expression of the G60A mutant promoted R-Ras2 dissociation from the plasma membrane, similar to the expression of WT SIRT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

There are two well-studied effector pathways of R-Ras2, the PI3K/Akt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rosário et al., 2001</xref>) and the Raf/MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rosário et al., 1999</xref>). We first examined whether R-Ras2 can activate the Raf/MAPK pathway in MEFs. We used Raf RBD-conjugated argarose beads to pull-down the active GTP-bound form of R-Ras2. The endogenous total Ras (H-Ras, N-Ras and K-Ras), but not the overexpressed or endogenous R-Ras2, was pulled down by Raf RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that in MEFs, R-Ras2 was unlikely to activate the Raf/MAPK pathway.

Using a proteomics approach, we identified a small GTPase, R-Ras2, as a defatty-acylation target of SIRT6. R-Ras2 has a higher lysine fatty acylation level in <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs than that in <italic>Sirt6</italic> WT MEFs. Lysine fatty acylation targets R-Ras2 to the plasma membrane, facilitates its interaction with p110α, and activates the Akt signaling pathway. This is important for the proliferative phenotype of <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs because when we knocked down R-Ras2 or decreased its lysine fatty acylation in <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO MEFs, the p-Akt Thr308 level and cell proliferation became similar to those in <italic>Sirt6</italic> WT MEFs.</p><p>Previously, the function of SIRT6 was mainly explained through transcriptional regulation, which typically occurs at the end of signal transduction pathways. Now we showed that SIRT6 can also function at the top of the signal transduction pathway by regulating a GTPase in the Ras family. SIRT6 is known to be a tumor suppressor and down-regulated in many different human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sebastián et al., 2012</xref>). Our study suggests that <italic>Sirt6</italic> KO increases lysine fatty acylation of R-Ras2 and activates the PI3K-Akt pathway, leading to higher cell proliferation. Thus, the defatty-acylation and suppression of R-Ras2 is a major contributor to the tumor suppressor role of SIRT6.</p><p>For the Ras proteins that do not have palmitoylated cysteine (such as K-Ras4B), they are thought to use polybasic sequences for membrane targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hancock, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cox et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, in addition to palmitoylation on Cys199 and farnesylation on Cys201, R-Ras2 contains several lysine residues at the C-terminus (Lys192, 194, 196, 197). One question is, if these lysine residues also help to target R-Ras2 to membranes via electrostatics, why cells use lysine instead of arginine? Our study has shed lights onto this question and identified a novel regulatory mechanism for this family of proteins, which may help to develop new strategies to pharmacologically target R-Ras2 to treat human diseases. In a recent paper, the lysine residues at the C-terminal of K-Ras4B have been shown to play important roles for phospholipid binding and K-Ras4B signal output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). The lysine to arginine mutant had distinct lipid-binding capacity, suggesting that simple electrostatic interaction may not be the mechanism how polybasic sequences target to the membrane. It is possible that the lysine residues at the C-terminal of K-Ras4B are similarly regulated by fatty acylation, which could explain the distinct lipid-binding capacity of the lysine-to-arginine mutant. However, we could not completely rule out that the lysine residues at the C-terminal of R-Ras2 may also function in phospholipid binding and thus affect its signaling output, in addition to being regulated by lysine fatty acylation and SIRT6.</p><p>Many Ras family of small GTPases contain polybasic sequences at the C-termini. It is possible that lysine fatty acylation also occur on these GTPases and regulate their localization and activities. If so, study how these GTPases are regulated by lysine fatty acylation and whether sirtuins also serve as deacylases for these proteins is an ongoing direction in our laboratory.</p><p>Our study also expands the biological significance of protein lysine fatty acylation. Protein lysine fatty acylation was first reported in 1992 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stevenson et al., 1992</xref>). Since then, only a few proteins were known to have this modification and whether this PTM has important biological functions or not was not known. We previously identified that lysine fatty acylation regulates protein secretion (e.g. TNFα and ribosomal proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). The finding that lysine fatty acylation regulates the Ras family of proteins suggest that this PTM may have very broad and important biological functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Anti-FLAG affinity gel (#A2220, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10063035">AB_10063035</ext-link>) and anti-FLAG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (#A8592, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_439702">AB_439702</ext-link>) were purchased from Sigma.

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>Both reviewers and the Reviewing Editor found your manuscript to be interesting and its findings of sufficient general interest for the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, some concerns were raised about interpretation of the results that we expect would require additional experimentation to satisfactorily address. In particular, both reviewers asked about the relationship between cysteine and lysine fatty acylation, in terms of potential for transacylation as well as their individual and respective contributions to R-Ras2 localization and function. There were also some questions about proteomics data processing and analysis that should be addressed. The full reviews are provided below for your benefit in preparing a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The work by Zhang et al. describes the use of a chemical probe to discover lysine fatty acylation of R-Ras2 and biochemical data that shows that SIRT6 can remove this modification. They then use a combination of shRNA and overexpression of R-Ras2 and SIRT6 mutants to show a relationship between the presence of the acylated lysine residues on R-Ras2, SIRT6 expression, and cellular viability and proliferation. The conclusions of the paper are partially supported by the presented data, in particular the evidence that SIRT6 can de-acylate R-Ras2. However, I feel that the paper would be well served by a more extensive exploration of the palmitoylation on R-Ras2 itself, as this is co-equally important to the SIRT6 activity.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) I'm curious about the relationship between palmitoylation on the cysteine residue at residue 199 and the four different lysine residues that were explored in this paper. The authors use NH<sub>2</sub>OH to remove the cysteine palmitoylation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and see some residual modification in SIRT6 knockout cells. However, they do not show a control to show that all cysteine palmitoylation is removed. The authors should blot for the loss of a control protein like H-Ras to confirm that all of the cysteine palmitoylation is removed in their conditions. These data could be readily added to a replicate of the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, which would be straight forward.</p><p>2) Furthermore, the proximity of the lysines in this study to the cysteine in R-Ras2 raises the possibility that cysteine palmitoylation occurs enzymatically and then the acyl-chain is chemically transferred to one or more lysine residues. The authors should explore this possibility by examining the palmitoylation of R-Ras2 containing a cysteine to serine mutant at residue 199.</p><p>3) Finally, the authors should explore the individual K to R mutants to determine which of the lysine residues is the major site of acylation. Maybe they are all equally important, which would be fine, but this should be directly tested. These data in comments 2 and 3 could be added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and would not require significant additional experimentation.</p><p>4) Many of the conclusions are based on quantification of Western blotting. There is nothing wrong with this, but some of the differences are quite small by eye. For example, the differences in phosphorylated Akt in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. The authors should show all of their replicate blots that they used for quantification as supporting figures. These replicates should be biological replicates and the authors should make this clear in their figure legends. This should be done for all quantified Western blots and not just <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. The authors should already have these data for their quantification.</p><p>5) The Introduction section is quite short and would benefit from a more lengthy description of R-Ras function, and modification. More information about the sirtuins would also be helpful. Some of this is at the beginning of the Results section, but I believe this should be moved to the Introduction. Without this additional information and description, it is quite hard to place this work into the larger context of Ras and SIRT6. I think this is important for the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Zhang and Lin describe their findings that SIRT6 regulated the de-acylation of R-Ras2, a Ras-family small GTPase involved in cell growth and PI3K signaling. They begin by demonstrating the SIRT6-G60A mutant is sufficient to restore growth suppression in SIRT6 KO cells, suggesting long-chain fatty acylation of cellular substrates is directly involved in proliferation. They then carry out proteomics analysis on alk-12, alk-14, and unenriched samples. This SILAC analysis should be more clearly summarized in the supplemental tables, particularly since most of the identified proteins were not even used in the analysis (2 or more peptides, enriched by both alk-12 and alk-14, and not differentially expressed). In the current submission, the data appears to be just the Proteome Discoverer output files without any filtering. It would help to add a summary spreadsheet that shows the most critical information (peptides #, SILAC ratio, and statistics) across each experiment. They somehow arrived at a short list of candidate proteins, but how they got there is lost in the supplemental tables. They go to show that R-Ras2 knockdown reduces cell proliferation in both SIRT6-KO and WT cells, and carry out a series of elegant biochemical experiments to validate that R-Ras2 is a SIRT6 substrate that requires NAD+ and generates fatty acyl-ADPR.</p><p>Furthermore, metabolic labeling with reporter fatty acids confirmed enhanced acylation of R-Ras2. They then replaced the 4 lysines in the C-terminal HVR with 4 arginines, and showed this mutant had reduced PM localization. A recent report by Hancock (Zhou et al., 2017, Cell 168, 239-251) on K-Ras showed that the positive charge in the HVR of K-ras is not the whole story, and that K to R mutants do not fully restore proper membrane binding. Instead, the poly-Lys HVR adopts a precise conformation that achieves phospholipid binding. Thus, the differential localization could be due to decreased phospholipid interactions rather than changes in lysine acylation. The manuscript should discuss this recent publication, and adapt their conclusions (particularly in regards to why R doesn't complement K). They should also include some discussion of how their data could be extrapolated to other Ras variants, like m-Ras, K-ras, or R-Ras that use a polybasic second signal to promote membrane localization. Can the authors comment on these other Ras variants? Is this a general phenomenon of small GTPases? What is the effect of mutating the cysteine in the HVR? Does it block Lys acylation? It would also be useful to present some statistical analysis or at least show more than 1 cell from their confocal microscopy analysis. There is no mention of how many cells were analyzed.</p><p>Overall this study adds more depth to the role of Lys fatty acylation, and suggests this could be more common than initially thought. While site-specific proteomic analysis would be the most direct method to annotate these PTMs, the current study is an important step in this direction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25158.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] 1) I'm curious about the relationship between palmitoylation on the cysteine residue at residue 199 and the four different lysine residues that were explored in this paper. The authors use NH<sub>2</sub>OH to remove the cysteine palmitoylation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and see some residual modification in SIRT6 knockout cells. However, they do not show a control to show that all cysteine palmitoylation is removed. The authors should blot for the loss of a control protein like H-Ras to confirm that all of the cysteine palmitoylation is removed in their conditions. These data could be readily added to a replicate of the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, which would be straight forward.</italic></p><p>We agree that fluorescence labeling signal after NH<sub>2</sub>OH treatment may be due to the incomplete removal of cysteine palmitoylation by NH<sub>2</sub>OH. One experimental result that can rule out this concern is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>: before NH<sub>2</sub>OH treatment, R-Ras2 WT and 4KR showed comparable Alk14 labeling signals. NH<sub>2</sub>OH treatment removed almost all labeling signals from R-Ras2 4KR but not R-Ras2 WT. Considering that R-Ras2 4KR does not have lysine fatty acylation, this result suggested that NH<sub>2</sub>OH treatment can efficiently remove cysteine fatty acylation on R-Ras2.</p><p>Furthermore, to more convincingly demonstrate the existence of lysine fatty acylation, we have carried out mass spectrometry experiments on R-Ras2. Tandem MS/MS identified Lys194 as one of the major lysine fatty acylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Furthermore, the proximity of the lysines in this study to the cysteine in R-Ras2 raises the possibility that cysteine palmitoylation occurs enzymatically and then the acyl-chain is chemically transferred to one or more lysine residues. The authors should explore this possibility by examining the palmitoylation of R-Ras2 containing a cysteine to serine mutant at residue 199.</italic></p><p>We performed this experiment as the reviewer suggested. The new data and corresponding description are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref> and the main text. R-Ras2 C199S mutant can still be labeled by Alk14 (although the labeling is weaker compared WT), suggesting that cysteine fatty acylation of R-Ras2 is not essential for the occurrence of lysine fatty acylation, but it may affect lysine fatty acylation.</p><p><italic>3) Finally, the authors should explore the individual K to R mutants to determine which of the lysine residues is the major site of acylation. Maybe they are all equally important, which would be fine, but this should be directly tested. These data in comments 2 and 3 could be added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and would not require significant additional experimentation.</italic></p><p>We performed this experiment as the reviewer suggested. The new data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>. Interestingly, the NH<sub>2</sub>OH resistant labeling of all the single mutants was similar to that of WT, suggesting that K192, K194, K196, and K197 are likely to be fatty acylated redundantly. In the revised manuscript, we also performed mass spectrometry and identified Lys194 as the fatty acylation site on WT R-Ras2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). The data suggests that each signal lysine can be modified redundantly, but on WT R-Ras2 protein, Lys194 may be the major fatty acylation site.</p><p><italic>4) Many of the conclusions are based on quantification of Western blotting. There is nothing wrong with this, but some of the differences are quite small by eye. For example, the differences in phosphorylated Akt in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. The authors should show all of their replicate blots that they used for quantification as supporting figures. These replicates should be biological replicates and the authors should make this clear in their figure legends. This should be done for all quantified Western blots and not just <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. The authors should already have these data for their quantification.</italic></p><p>We added all of the replicate western blots that were used for quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) The Introduction section is quite short and would benefit from a more lengthy description of R-Ras function, and modification. More information about the sirtuins would also be helpful. Some of this is at the beginning of the Results section, but I believe this should be moved to the Introduction. Without this additional information and description, it is quite hard to place this work into the larger context of Ras and SIRT6. I think this is important for the broad readership of eLife.</italic></p><p>As the reviewer suggested, we moved the introduction of SIRT6 from the Results section to the Introduction section. We also added more description of R-Ras2 and sirtuins in the Introduction section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>Zhang and Lin describe their findings that SIRT6 regulated the de-acylation of R-Ras2, a Ras-family small GTPase involved in cell growth and PI3K signaling. They begin by demonstrating the SIRT6-G60A mutant is sufficient to restore growth suppression in SIRT6 KO cells, suggesting long-chain fatty acylation of cellular substrates is directly involved in proliferation. They then carry out proteomics analysis on alk-12, alk-14, and unenriched samples. This SILAC analysis should be more clearly summarized in the supplemental tables, particularly since most of the identified proteins were not even used in the analysis (2 or more peptides, enriched by both alk-12 and alk-14, and not differentially expressed). In the current submission, the data appears to be just the Proteome Discoverer output files without any filtering. It would help to add a summary spreadsheet that shows the most critical information (peptides #, SILAC ratio, and statistics) across each experiment. They somehow arrived at a short list of candidate proteins, but how they got there is lost in the supplemental tables. They go to show that R-Ras2 knockdown reduces cell proliferation in both SIRT6-KO and WT cells, and carry out a series of elegant biochemical experiments to validate that R-Ras2 is a SIRT6 substrate that requires NAD+ and generates fatty acyl-ADPR.</italic></p><p>In the revised manuscript, we added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) showing how the SILAC data was analyzed. We also included the peptide #, SILAC ratio, and statistics in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, metabolic labeling with reporter fatty acids confirmed enhanced acylation of R-Ras2. They then replaced the 4 lysines in the C-terminal HVR with 4 arginines, and showed this mutant had reduced PM localization. A recent report by Hancock (Zhou et al., 2017, Cell 168, 239-251) on K-Ras showed that the positive charge in the HVR of K-ras is not the whole story, and that K to R mutants do not fully restore proper membrane binding. Instead, the poly-Lys HVR adopts a precise conformation that achieves phospholipid binding. Thus, the differential localization could be due to decreased phospholipid interactions rather than changes in lysine acylation. The manuscript should discuss this recent publication, and adapt their conclusions (particularly in regards to why R doesn't complement K).</italic></p><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out this recent paper, which emphasize the distinct role of lysine from that of arginine. We added the following discussion in the manuscript:</p><p>“In a recent paper, the lysine residues at the C-terminal of K-Ras4B have been shown to play important roles for phospholipid binding and K-Ras4B signal output (Rodriguez-Viciana, Sabatier and McCormick, 2004). […] However, we could not completely rule out that the lysine residues at the C-terminal of R-Ras2 may also function in phospholipid binding and thus affect its signaling output, in addition to being regulated by lysine fatty acylation and SIRT6.”</p><p><italic>They should also include some discussion of how their data could be extrapolated to other Ras variants, like m-Ras, K-ras, or R-Ras that use a polybasic second signal to promote membrane localization. Can the authors comment on these other Ras variants?</italic></p><p>We added more discussions about other Ras proteins. We had the same speculation that other Ras variants possessing polybasic sequence might be regulated by lysine fatty acylation. Indeed, we have preliminary data suggesting several other Ras variants are fatty acylated on lysine residues at the C-terminal HVR region. We have two manuscripts in preparation focusing on the functional study of lysine fatty acylation of these Ras proteins.</p><p><italic>Is this a general phenomenon of small GTPases? What is the effect of mutating the cysteine in the HVR? Does it block Lys acylation?</italic></p><p>We believe this is a general phenomenon that occurs to many small GTPases, as mentioned above. Mutating the palmitoylated cysteine does not block lysine acylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>), but slightly decreased lysine acylation.</p><p><italic>It would also be useful to present some statistical analysis or at least show more than 1 cell from their confocal microscopy analysis.</italic></p><p>We have added this information in the revised manuscript (Figure legends 2J and 3C). We also included the other images used in supplementary figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
