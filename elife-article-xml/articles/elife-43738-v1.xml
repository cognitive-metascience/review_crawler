each generation. However, the mechanisms governing this initiation of meiosis remain poorly understood. Here, we examined cells undergoing meiotic initiation in mice, and we found that initiation involves the dramatic upregulation of a transcriptional network of thousands of genes whose expression is not limited to meiosis. This broad gene expression program is directly upregulated by STRA8, encoded by a germ cell-specific gene required for meiotic initiation. STRA8 binds its own promoter and those of thousands of other genes, including meiotic prophase genes, factors mediating DNA replication and the G1-S cell-cycle transition, and genes that promote the lengthy prophase unique to meiosis I. We conclude that, in mice, the robust amplification of this extraordinarily broad transcription program by a common factor triggers initiation of meiosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>germ cells</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>Stra8</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Page</surname><given-names>David C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kojima</surname><given-names>Mina L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The switch from mitotic cell cycles to the one meiotic cell cycle in each generation is triggered through dramatic upregulation of a broad gene expression program by transcriptional regulator STRA8.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A key feature of sexual reproduction is meiosis, a specialized cell cycle in which one round of DNA replication precedes two rounds of chromosome segregation to produce haploid gametes. In most organisms, meiotic chromosome segregation depends on the pairing, synapsis, and crossing over of homologous chromosomes during prophase of meiosis I. These chromosomal events are generally conserved across eukaryotes and have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Handel and Schimenti, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Despite being a critical pivot point in the life cycle, <italic>meiotic initiation</italic> — the decision to embark on the one and only one meiotic program per generation — has been less studied, perhaps because the regulation of meiotic initiation is less conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kimble, 2011</xref>). Because dissecting this transition requires access to cells on the cusp of meiosis, meiotic initiation has been studied most in budding yeast, which can be induced to undergo synchronous meiotic entry; there the transcription factor Ime1 upregulates meiotic and DNA-replication genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kassir et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smith et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van Werven and Amon, 2011</xref>). In multicellular organisms with a segregated germ line, cells entering meiosis are difficult to access for detailed molecular study; they are found only within gonads, surrounded by both somatic cells and germ cells at other developmental stages. However, with recent tools enabling purification of large numbers of the specific cell type initiating meiosis, the male mouse now represents a tractable model for studying meiotic initiation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hogarth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Romer et al., 2018</xref>). We can use pure populations of meiosis-initiating cells for biochemical assays to determine how germ cells transition to the meiotic cell cycle.</p><p>For the study of meiotic initiation in multicellular organisms, the mouse also has the advantage of an existing genetic model with clear defects starting from the very first steps of meiosis, including meiotic S phase, which begins in the middle of the preleptotene stage, and the initiation of homolog pairing in the leptotene stage. In mice, the germ cell-specific gene <italic>Stimulated by retinoic acid 8</italic> (<italic>Stra8</italic>) is induced by rising retinoic acid levels at the start of meiosis, resulting in <italic>Stra8</italic> expression from the middle of the preleptotene stage through early in the leptotene stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bowles et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Endo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koubova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oulad-Abdelghani et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Genetic studies have revealed <italic>Stra8</italic>’s key role in meiotic initiation. First, proper meiotic S phase depends on <italic>Stra8</italic>: on the C57BL/6 background, <italic>Stra8</italic>-deficient germ cells in females show no evidence of meiotic DNA replication; in males, they reach the preleptotene stage and show signs of DNA replication but do not exhibit the hallmark sign of meiotic S phase, which is loading of the meiotic cohesin REC8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baltus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dokshin et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Stra8-</italic>deficient cells do not robustly express meiotic factors, or progress to the leptotene stage and begin the chromosomal events of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baltus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Soh et al., 2015</xref>). These genetic studies of <italic>Stra8</italic> deficiency suggest that the decision to initiate meiosis occurs in the middle of the preleptotene stage, upstream of meiotic S phase. [Note that the strict <italic>Stra8</italic> requirement for male meiotic initiation was not observed in mice of mixed genetic background, in which <italic>Stra8-</italic>deficient male germ cells initiated meiosis but could not complete meiotic prophase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mark et al., 2008</xref>).]</p><p>Curiously, however, genes involved in the chromosomal events of meiotic prophase I are often expressed and translated long before initiation of the meiotic cell cycle, in diverse species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christophorou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pasierbek et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Soh et al., 2015</xref>). For example, REC8 and synaptonemal complex proteins are expressed in mouse spermatogonia, which undertake several mitotic divisions before reaching the preleptotene stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Evans et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). This early expression of meiotic genes must be reconciled with the seemingly contradictory observation that meiosis is only initiated during the preleptotene stage.</p><p>Here, we isolate preleptotene stage germ cells — the cells initiating meiosis — to study how meiosis is triggered. We find that meiotic initiation coincides with upregulation of thousands of transcripts. Remarkably, this large ensemble of genes is upregulated by a common factor, STRA8, which we demonstrate is a transcriptional activator that directly binds their promoters. The STRA8-activated program of at least 1,351 genes includes not only canonical meiotic prophase genes but also many genes that have been extensively studied in the context of the mitotic cell cycle, including those critical for the G1-S transition and for DNA replication. We suggest that the robust amplification of such genes, together with factors that maintain the meiosis-specific extended prophase, triggers the one meiotic cell cycle in each generation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptional changes at the start of the meiotic cell cycle</title><p>To better understand how mouse germ cells initiate meiosis, we sought to identify transcriptional changes occurring at meiotic initiation in vivo. For this, we isolated male germ cells entering meiosis using developmental synchronization of spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Romer et al., 2018</xref>). By chemically modulating the levels of retinoic acid, which is required for spermatogonial differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Endo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Pelt and de Rooij, 1990</xref>), we can induce synchronous progression of germ cells through spermatogenesis and collect testes enriched for preleptotene cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hogarth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Romer et al., 2018</xref>). By histologically ‘staging’ a small tissue biopsy, we verified enrichment of desired cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Romer et al., 2018</xref>) and found that, in properly <underline>s</underline>ynchronized and <underline>s</underline>taged (‘2S’) testes, preleptotene cells expressing the meiotic initiation marker STRA8 account for ~44% of all cells; they comprise only an estimated ~1.4% of cells in unperturbed adult testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Synchronization thus yields 31-fold enrichment in vivo of meiosis-initiating cells, enabling biochemical analyses of meiotic initiation with improved signal and decreased background noise. Importantly, preleptotene-enriched samples are not contaminated with any later stage germ cells, which might complicate efforts to understand meiotic initiation. By adding a sorting step to the 2S protocol — together called ‘3S’ — we can isolate preleptotene cells with &gt;90% purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Romer et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43738.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcriptional changes in the preleptotene stage population at meiotic initiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic for synchronization of spermatogenesis by WIN18,446 and retinoic acid (RA) to enrich for preleptotene cells.

To do this, we purified preleptotene cells from <italic>Stra8</italic>-deficient and <italic>Stra8<sup>+/-</sup></italic> testes using the 3S method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Romer et al., 2018</xref>); preleptotene cells from <italic>Stra8<sup>+/-</sup></italic> testes were further categorized as displaying ‘low STRA8’ (early preleptotene stage, directly before meiotic initiation) or ‘high STRA8’ levels (mid or late preleptotene stage, after meiotic initiation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In total, we profiled three biological replicates of <italic>Stra8-</italic>deficient, two of ‘low-STRA8,’ and two of ‘high-STRA8’ preleptotene samples. STRA8 protein level differences in the preleptotene samples paralleled <italic>Stra8</italic> mRNA level differences (average expression in ‘low-STRA8’ samples = 275 transcripts per million [TPM], and in ‘high-STRA8’ samples = 1,173 TPM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Altogether, 12,545 genes were expressed at greater than one TPM in at least one preleptotene sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>To identify transcriptional changes at meiotic initiation, we first identified genes differentially expressed between high-STRA8 and <italic>Stra8-</italic>deficient preleptotene cells. The initiation of meiosis coincided with profound changes in transcript levels within the preleptotene population. Among expressed genes, 2,361 genes were upregulated, showing significantly higher expression in high-STRA8 cells compared to <italic>Stra8-</italic>deficient preleptotene cells; another 2,278 genes were significantly downregulated (FDR &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>). We verified that these changes were due to differences in developmental progression through the preleptotene stage by comparing the genes’ expression in <italic>Stra8<sup>+/-</sup></italic> preleptotene samples with low and high STRA8 levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Overall, expression fold-changes in the low-STRA8/high-STRA8 comparison strongly correlated with expression fold-changes in the <italic>Stra8-</italic>deficient/high-STRA8 comparison (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>, 0.70; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). In addition, of the genes up or downregulated at meiotic initiation, 93.9% and 89.2% were also up or downregulated, respectively, between <italic>Stra8<sup>+/-</sup></italic> preleptotene cells expressing low or high levels of STRA8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). These results confirm dramatic changes in the preleptotene stage transcriptome at meiotic initiation.</p><p>To further characterize changes in the preleptotene cells, we asked how many of the upregulated genes were ‘off’ in the absence of meiotic initiation. To our surprise, we discovered that 97% of upregulated genes were expressed (at TPM levels greater than one; median expression level 38 TPM) in <italic>Stra8-</italic>deficient preleptotene cells that had not initiated meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This suggests that transcriptional upregulation at meiotic initiation mostly entails amplification of gene expression, rather than ‘turning on’ genes that were previously not expressed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identifying the targets of a meiotic initiation factor</title><p>We sought to determine whether the transcriptional changes we discovered at meiotic initiation were direct consequences of STRA8 action.

Although STRA8 is both nuclear and cytoplasmic in wild-type preleptotene cells, the protein was predominantly cytoplasmic in mice expressing only the short isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Thus, the first 111 amino acids, unique to the long isoform, are required for STRA8’s function and nuclear localization in vivo (see Appendix 1). This critical region contains the putative bHLH domain, suggesting that STRA8 regulates transcription.</p><p>To test whether STRA8 regulates transcription through direct binding of genomic regulatory elements, we performed ChIP-seq, using the FLAG antibody to immunoprecipitate chromatin from <italic>Stra8<sup>FLAG/FLAG</sup></italic> testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For ChIP, we used 2S testes in which &gt;90% of tubules contained STRA8-expressing preleptotene cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). We sequenced three biological replicates, each representing chromatin from one mouse. We also sequenced three FLAG ChIP replicates using chromatin from 2S wild-type (<italic>Stra8<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) testes, which controls for non-specific antibody binding. [Note that STRA8 is also expressed in type A spermatogonia, where it plays a role in spermatogonial differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Endo et al., 2015</xref>). However, our 2S testis samples were carefully selected following IHC and staging to ensure that most of the STRA8 ChIP-seq signal comes from cells at meiotic initiation. Of all cells that express STRA8 in our in our 2S samples, ~88% are initiating meiosis and ~12% are spermatogonia. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, STRA8 levels are also much higher in preleptotene cells than in spermatogonia. The cellular compositions of 2S samples used for ChIP-seq are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>.]</p><p>Our ChIP-seq analyses reveal that, in preleptotene cells, STRA8 binds genomic regulatory regions. Peaks of heightened read density, reflecting likely STRA8 binding sites, were abundant in <italic>Stra8<sup>FLAG/FLAG</sup></italic> samples but not in wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). 83.0% of such peaks were within 1 kb of an annotated transcription start site (TSS), and across all genes, ChIP-seq read density was highest at the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C,D</xref>), suggesting that STRA8 binds primarily at promoters. This promoter enrichment was not a consequence of non-specific antibody binding, because only 11.5% of ChIP-seq peaks in wild-type control were at promoters, and TSS read density was low in these controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C–E</xref>). We explored whether the remaining STRA8 binding sites (in <italic>Stra8<sup>FLAG/FLAG</sup></italic> samples) could be at enhancers, which are also sites of transcriptional regulation. Here we cross-referenced ENCODE consortium adult testis ChIP-seq data for H3K4me1, an enhancer-associated histone modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heintzman et al., 2009</xref>). Only 4.8% of STRA8 binding sites overlapped with H3K4me1-marked regions not at gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Altogether, these results reveal that STRA8 primarily acts as a promoter-proximal transcriptional regulator.</p><p>To define the scope of the STRA8-regulated transcriptional program, we catalogued the STRA8-bound genes.

Even genes that were bound in only one replicate are likely true STRA8 targets; their promoters display ChIP-seq signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4G</xref>). However, to ensure robust conclusions regarding the effects of STRA8 binding, we focus our analyses on target genes that overlapped between ChIP-seq biological replicates (p&lt;1×10<sup>−320</sup> for all pairwise overlaps between replicates, one-tailed hypergeometric tests).

This prediction was also met: each additional motif at the promoter, from zero to five motifs total, was associated with increased STRA8 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Third, genes with more motifs should be more highly upregulated at meiotic initiation. This third prediction was met: greater numbers of CNCCTCAG motifs were associated with greater fold-changes in expression at meiotic initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Altogether, these observations provide strong evidence that binding of STRA8 to the CNCCTCAG motif leads to upregulation of gene expression.</p><p>We note that upregulation at meiotic initiation is associated with CpG islands (CGI), stretches of DNA with high CpG dinucleotide frequency. 97% of STRA8-bound genes have CGI promoters, and the effect of the CNCCTCAG motif on transcriptional upregulation is accentuated in the vicinity of a CGI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Amplification of a broad gene expression program at meiotic initiation</title><p>To understand the biological ramifications of the transcriptional changes at meiotic initiation, we explored the functions of the upregulated genes.

Using a published RNA-seq dataset spanning nine adult male mouse tissues (eight somatic tissues plus testis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>), we considered a gene to be ‘testis-biased’ if its testis expression constituted more than half of its total expression summed across all nine tissues.

Thus, this factor plays a key role in amplifying a program that includes but is not limited to meiosis genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Transcriptional amplification of meiotic prophase factors at meiotic initiation</title><p>Our analyses suggested that a common factor upregulates the program orchestrating meiotic chromosomal events.

To address this question, we compared STRA8 binding data against a published list of meiotic prophase genes, comprising 103 protein coding genes upregulated during meiotic prophase I in fetal ovarian germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Soh et al., 2015</xref>). We find that, in males, 76 of these 103 genes are STRA8-bound, and 68 are STRA8-activated (p&lt;1.2×10<sup>−28</sup> and p&lt;8.2×10<sup>−38</sup>, respectively, one-tailed hypergeometric test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Additionally, STRA8 activates the transcription factor <italic>Pparg</italic>, whose function has been extensively studied in adipose tissue; it is not germ cell specific.

Enrichment of E2F transcription factor motifs suggests STRA8’s role in regulating a cell cycle-associated transcriptional program. Note that the E2F6 motif enrichment could also reflect the known role of E2F6, a non-canonical E2F factor, in regulating the expression of meiotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kehoe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pohlers et al., 2005</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43738-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Motivated by previous findings that <italic>Stra8</italic> is genetically required for meiotic S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baltus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dokshin et al., 2013</xref>), we asked whether STRA8 directly regulates the G1-S transition of the cell cycle. We found evidence for its upregulation of G1-S regulators and DNA-replication genes. STRA8 bound and amplified by 3.0-fold the expression of <italic>E2f1</italic>, a key transcription factor that induces G1-S gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bracken et al., 2004</xref>).

Furthermore, STRA8 upregulates components of the pre-replicative complex for DNA replication: members of the origin recognition complex (ORC4 and ORC6), subunits of the replicative helicase (MCM4, MCM5, and MCM6), and CDC6. Genes that encode DBF4 and CDC7, which together stimulate the MCM complex to initiate DNA replication, are also upregulated by STRA8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>These observations led us to test whether STRA8 regulates a broader cell cycle-associated transcriptional program. Specifically, we asked whether STRA8-activated genes also are targets of the transcription factors E2F1 and E2F4, which drive a broad gene expression program for dividing cells, including genes required for DNA replication, cell-cycle control, DNA damage repair, and chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bracken et al., 2004</xref>); or targets of the FOXM1 transcription factor, which regulates many genes required for the G1-S and G2-M transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Laoukili et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). We identified targets of these factors by analyzing ENCODE consortium ChIP-seq data from various non-meiotic cell lines. We found that more than half of STRA8-activated genes were also targets of one or more of these other cell cycle transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Furthermore, at the TSS of STRA8-activated genes, the most enriched known motifs were those for E2F transcription factors, which suggests that the genes are regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Together, our findings demonstrate that a broad cell cycle-associated transcriptional program is amplified by STRA8 at the onset of meiotic initiation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Prior to the studies reported here, how germ cells in multicellular organisms initiate meiosis was not well understood. By specifically examining mouse germ cells entering meiosis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Romer et al., 2018</xref>), we now show that meiotic initiation entails the robust upregulation of a broad gene ensemble in the preleptotene stage. We demonstrate that STRA8, a transcriptional activator, triggers the unique meiotic cell cycle by amplifying the expression of meiotic prophase I genes, G1-S cell-cycle genes, and factors that specifically inhibit the mitotic program.</p><p>We were able to explore the switch to a meiotic cell cycle in unprecedented detail because we could measure transcriptional changes directly within the preleptotene population before and after meiotic initiation. We found that most genes upregulated at meiotic initiation, including canonical meiotic prophase genes, are also expressed in preleptotene cells in the absence of meiotic initiation, providing context for earlier, anecdotal reports of meiotic gene expression in pre-meiotic germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Evans et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). Expression of these genes alone is therefore not enough to trigger meiotic initiation, and should not be taken as evidence of successful meiotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Handel et al., 2014</xref>). Rather, what triggers meiotic initiation may be the coordinated upregulation of most canonical meiotic prophase I genes during the preleptotene stage. A common factor, STRA8, likely upregulates their expression past threshold levels required to support the events of homolog pairing, synapsis, and meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We find, for example, that STRA8 upregulates key meiotic genes <italic>Prdm9</italic>, <italic>Dmc1</italic>, and <italic>Hormad1</italic> more than 4-fold, and the meiotic telomere complex factor <italic>Majin</italic> by 23-fold. Also critical for triggering meiosis may be the small subset of STRA8-activated genes that are initially ‘off’ in the absence of meiotic initiation, such as <italic>Rad51ap2</italic> and <italic>Pparg</italic>, whose meiotic functions remain unexplored. In addition, meriting further investigation are STRA8-activated, testis-biased genes of unknown function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43738.026</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model for upregulation of the transcriptional program that triggers the meiotic cell cycle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Upregulation of meiotic prophase genes at meiotic initiation. Shown are hypothetical meiotic genes and their expression levels across developmental time. Many meiotic genes are expressed at detectable levels before meiotic initiation. We propose that their upregulation above a threshold level (dotted blue line) required for events such as synapsis and meiotic recombination triggers the execution of the chromosomal events of meiotic prophase I. In preleptotene spermatocytes, STRA8 directly upregulates this ensemble of genes. (<bold>B</bold>) A model of STRA8-mediated gene expression changes at meiotic initiation. First, retinoic acid induces expression of <italic>Stra8.</italic> STRA8 then activates a broad transcriptional program by directly binding promoters of both meiotic genes and cell-cycle genes. Among STRA8-activated cell cycle genes is <italic>E2f1</italic>, which is known to drive the G1/S transition. E2F1 upregulates its own expression as well as a broad ensemble of cell cycle-associated genes, including those involved in a positive feedback loop to reinforce cell-cycle entry. STRA8 also binds its own promoter, potentially establishing a feedback loop that further commits germ cells to the meiotic cell cycle.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43738-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Our work highlights STRA8 as a key transcriptional regulator for initiation of meiosis. Although its CNCCTCAG binding motif differs from the typical bHLH binding motif CANNTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Massari and Murre, 2000</xref>), our results are consistent with STRA8 functioning as a bHLH transcription factor. We find that a STRA8 isoform lacking the bHLH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baltus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tedesco et al., 2009</xref>) cannot initiate meiosis or localize to the nucleus in vivo, paralleling a prior in vitro finding that its bHLH domain directs nuclear localization (see Appendix 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tedesco et al., 2009</xref>). Because HLH domains mediate dimerization, we propose that STRA8’s HLH domain heterodimerizes with that of another HLH factor before it translocates to the nucleus to bind gene promoters. STRA8’s promoter specificity stands out; few transcription factors exhibit such a preponderance (84%) of binding at promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Neph et al., 2012</xref>). Perhaps it regulates transcription by releasing promoter-paused RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) into productive elongation, which in many developmental contexts facilitates rapid and synchronous gene upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adelman and Lis, 2012</xref>). Alternatively, STRA8 may facilitate transcription by recruiting RNAPII, the pre-initiation complex, or chromatin modifiers such as histone acetyltransferases. STRA8 is unlikely to be a pioneer transcription factor, because its preference for promoters of already-expressed genes indicates that it primarily binds open chromatin regions.</p><p>We suggest that meiotic initiation involves the amplification of a broad gene regulatory network that drives not only the chromosomal events of meiotic prophase I but also cell-cycle entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In mice, STRA8 activates DNA-replication and G1-S genes, corroborating and extending previous genetic evidence that meiotic initiation takes place upstream of meiotic S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baltus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dokshin et al., 2013</xref>). STRA8 directly activates <italic>E2f1</italic>, which drives the G1-S cell-cycle transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bracken et al., 2004</xref>). In primary human fibroblasts, activation of the E2F1-CCNE1/2-CDK2 positive feedback loop signals passage through the ‘restriction point’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schwarz et al., 2018</xref>), a point-of-no-return indicating commitment to the cell-cycle program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertoli et al., 2013</xref>). STRA8’s coordinated upregulation of these feedback-loop genes suggests that initiation of the meiotic program (encompassing meiotic DNA replication to the meiotic divisions) involves passage through a meiotic version of the ‘restriction point.’ STRA8 also binds its own promoter, suggesting potential positive feedback to promote robust upregulation of meiotic S-phase and prophase genes, together with cell-cycle transcription factors such as <italic>E2f1</italic>. As in mitotic G1-S, positive feedback during meiotic G1-S may be followed by negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertoli et al., 2013</xref>): fetal ovarian germ cells downregulate <italic>Stra8</italic> after meiotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Soh et al., 2015</xref>), and STRA8 levels in male germ cells decline precipitously after the leptotene stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The upregulation of general cell-cycle genes begs the question, how does the preleptotene cell know to induce a meiotic (and not a mitotic) program? Specificity for meiosis may result in part from upregulation of genes that ensure a meiosis-specific cell-cycle state. First, STRA8 directly upregulates the genes encoding the post-transcriptional regulators MEIOC and YTHDC2, which are critical for the unique meiotic cell cycle state; they prevent aberrant expression of mitotic genes during meiotic prophase I and help meiotic germ cells maintain the extended prophase unique to meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abby et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soh et al., 2017</xref>). [Note that our RNA-seq analyses provide no insight into post-transcriptional regulation of meiosis, which is known to be pervasive in yeast meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brar et al., 2012</xref>).] Second, we find that <italic>Ccnb3,</italic> a meiosis-specific cyclin that prevents precocious progression through meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nguyen et al., 2002</xref>), is 6.9-fold upregulated at meiotic initiation. Finally, the STRA8-regulated genes <italic>Ccne2</italic> and <italic>Cdk2</italic>, which are considered ‘general’ cell-cycle genes, may have meiosis-specific roles. These genes are not strictly required for mitotic proliferation but are necessary for proper homolog pairing and synapsis in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martinerie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ortega et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The far-reaching role of a common factor – STRA8 – in coordinating broad transcriptional changes raises the possibility of whether it alone is sufficient to initiate the meiotic program. We would argue that it is not sufficient, and that triggering meiosis instead entails amplification of a transcriptional program that exists only in the early preleptotene stage. In fact, STRA8 is expressed in, but does not induce meiosis in, early (type A) spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, ectopic STRA8 expression in intermediate type spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Endo et al., 2015</xref>) (only two cell divisions prior to the preleptotene stage) or in vitro-derived germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miyauchi et al., 2017</xref>) is not alone sufficient to trigger meiosis. Competency for meiotic initiation may thus require a chromatin or transcriptional state established in preceding mitotic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), including the observed lower-level expression of meiotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Evans et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Soh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). We suggest that this preleptotene-specific competency intersects with STRA8’s function as a transcriptional activator to amplify and orchestrate the unique gene regulatory network that drives meiosis. In other multicellular organisms, transcriptional regulators of meiotic initiation remain to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kimble, 2011</xref>). However, the combination of pre-existing transcriptional programs together with a dramatic amplification of a broad meiosis-associated gene ensemble may be a common strategy to trigger the one meiotic cell cycle between successive generations with precision, only at the proper time and place.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Briefly, an oligonucleotide pair targeting exon 2 of <italic>Stra8</italic> was cloned into the guide RNA (gRNA) cassette of the vector pX330 (Addgene, Cambridge, MA), which also contains a Cas9 expression cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cong et al., 2013</xref>). gRNA and Cas9 RNAs were transcribed in vitro using the MEGAshortscript T7 kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) and mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 ULTRA kit (Thermo Fisher), respectively, and purified using the MEGAclear kit (Thermo Fisher). RNAs were eluted in RNase free water. To obtain embryos for injection, superovulated female B6/129 mice (~9 weeks of age) were mated to B6 stud males. Fertilized one-cell embryos were injected cytoplasmically with a mixture of gRNA (50 ng/μL), Cas9 (50 ng/μL), and a 200 bp single-stranded oligo (100 ng/μL) for homology directed repair (HDR) following Cas9-mediated double-strand break (DSB) formation.

The injected embryos were cultured at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> until 3.5 days post coitum (dpc), at which time they were at blastocyst stage.

Briefly, male mice were injected daily from postnatal day (P) two to P8 with WIN18,446 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 0.1 mg/gram body weight) and on P9 with retinoic acid (RA) (MilliporeSigma; 0.0125 μg/gram body weight). All injections were performed subcutaneously over the shoulders. Mice were euthanized ~6.75 days (d) after the RA injection to obtain testes enriched for preleptotene cells. Each pair of synchronized testes yielded roughly five million cells. From each mouse, a small tissue biopsy was reserved for histology to confirm proper enrichment of preleptotene stage spermatocytes, and the rest was used for ChIP-seq or cell sorting followed by RNA-seq.</p><p>To quantify the extent of preleptotene cell enrichment, testis tissue was fixed in Bouin’s solution for 3 hr. Testis sections were stained with STRA8 antibody (Abcam ab49405) and counter-stained with hematoxylin. For each sample, all cells in five microscope fields (100X magnification) were counted and classified according to morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Russell, 1990</xref>) and STRA8 expression status. The fraction of all cells that are STRA8-expressing preleptotene cells was obtained by dividing the number of preleptotene cells with robust STRA8 staining by the total number of cells (somatic and germ cells combined).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Estimating the fraction of cells initiating meiosis in the adult testis</title><p>The fraction of all cells in the unperturbed adult testis that are STRA8-expressing preleptotene spermatocytes was estimated using known parameters for testis cell-type composition and the duration of various states within germ-cell development. First, the total number of cells in an adult mouse testis was estimated by summing the numbers of individual testis cell types (from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tegelenbosch and de Rooij, 1993</xref>: 3×10<sup>6</sup> Sertoli cells, 2.8×10<sup>6</sup> spermatogonia, 25×10<sup>6</sup> spermatocytes, 99×10<sup>6</sup> spermatids; from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vergouwen et al., 1993</xref>: 3.5×10<sup>6</sup> interstitial cells), yielding 133.3×10<sup>6</sup> cells per testis. Spermatocytes comprise 18.8% of this total.</p><p>Next, the proportion of preleptotene spermatocytes among all spermatocytes was estimated by noting that, in an adult testis, this proportion is approximated by the length of time a cell spends as a preleptotene spermatocyte relative to the total time spent as a spermatocyte. The total spermatocyte lifespan is 326 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oakberg, 1956</xref>). Preleptotene cells are present in the later half of stage VI, all of stage VII, and the first half of stage VIII in the cycle of the mouse seminiferous epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Russell, 1990</xref>). Given the duration of these three stages (18.1 hr, 20.6 hr, and 20.8 hr, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oakberg, 1956</xref>)), the lifespan of a preleptotene spermatocyte is estimated to be ~40 hr. Thus, preleptotene cells comprise 40/326 = 12.3% of all spermatocytes and 2.3% of all cells in the testis, resulting in ~3.1×10<sup>6</sup> preleptotene cells per testis.</p><p>Finally, the proportion of cells expressing STRA8 among all preleptotene cells was estimated. STRA8-positive spermatocytes are found in 0% of stage VI tubules, 71% of stage VII tubules, and 100% of stage VIII tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Endo et al., 2015</xref>). The duration of STRA8 expression can be estimated as (0.71 × (length of stage VII)) + (0.5 × (length of stage VIII)) = ~25 hr. Thus, STRA8-positive cells represent 25/40 = 62.5% of all preleptotene cells. The total number of STRA8-expressing preleptotene cells is therefore 0.625 × 3.0×10<sup>6 </sup>= 1.88×10<sup>6</sup> per testis. We use these numbers to estimate that STRA8-expressing preleptotene spermatocytes comprise 1.88×10<sup>6 </sup>/133.3×10<sup>6</sup> = ~1.4% of all cells in the adult testis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Isolation of sorted preleptotene cells</title><p>Purified preleptotene cell populations for RNA-seq were obtained following the ‘3S’ protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Romer et al., 2018</xref>). With this system, the estimated purity of sorted preleptotene cells is ~90%. Germ-cell lineage sorting was achieved with the <italic>Ddx4<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Rosa26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> alleles: <italic>Rosa26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> contains a loxP-STOP-loxP-tdTomato construct at the endogenous <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus, such that the STOP codon is excised in the presence of Cre recombinase. When combined with the <italic>Ddx4<sup>Cre</sup></italic> allele, the <italic>Rosa26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> allele yields mice with tdTomato expression only in germ cells. We mated <italic>Ddx4<sup>Cre</sup></italic><sup>/+</sup><italic>Stra8<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>mice with <italic>Rosa26<sup>tdTomato/tdTomato</sup> Stra8<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, and we then treated their male offspring with WIN18,446/RA to synchronize spermatogenesis. We used synchronized testes from <italic>Ddx4<sup>Cre</sup></italic><sup>/+</sup><italic>Rosa26<sup>tdTomato/+</sup></italic> mice that were either heterozygous (<italic>Stra8<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) or homozygous (<italic>Stra8<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) for the <italic>Stra8</italic>-deficient allele. Testes were collected ~6.75 d after injecting RA and reduced to a single-cell suspension using collagenase, trypsin, and DNaseI. DAPI was added to cells prior to cell sorting on the FACSAria SORP (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Single cells were first gated based on light scatter (forward and side scatter), and high DAPI fluorescence (dead) cells were excluded. We then used tdTomato fluorescence intensity to sort only the preleptotene stage spermatocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cell culture</title><p>v6.5 embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM β–mercaptoethanol, and 1,000 U/mL leukemia inhibitory factor (ESGRO, MilliporeSigma). Cells were initially cultured on mitocyin C-treated CF6Neo mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MTI-GlobalStem). To induce STRA8 expression, ESCs were transferred to gelatin-coated culture dishes and treated with culture medium containing 10 μM retinoic acid dissolved in DMSO. For an uninduced negative control, an equivalent volume of DMSO was added to the culture medium.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>To prepare protein lysates, testes (snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently thawed) or ESCs were homogenized in lysis buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% NP-40] supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics, Risch-Rotkreuz, Switzerland) and Benzonase nuclease (MilliporeSigma), incubated at 4°C with rotation for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 20000 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4°C. The soluble fraction was used as the lysate. Proteins were denatured in sample buffer for 10 min at 70°C, resolved on a NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in 5% BSA/Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 hr at room temperature and then incubated with a primary antibody solution prepared in 5% BSA/TBST. STRA8 antibodies (ab49602 or ab49405, Abcam) were used at a 1:1000 dilution with an overnight incubation at 4°C, followed by a 1 hr room-temperature incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Primary antibody incubation with FLAG-HRP (1:1000; A8592, MilliporeSigma) was performed overnight at 4°C. Incubation with alpha tubulin-HRP (1:5000; ab40742, Abcam) was performed at room temperature for 1 hr.

Synchronized testes were dissected into PBS and dissociated into a single-cell suspension in 0.25% trypsin + 0.1 mM EDTA with collagenase (type 1) (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) and 0.1% hyaluronidase (MilliporeSigma). Dissociated cells were washed in PBS and crosslinked for 8 min in 1% formaldehyde at room temperature. Crosslinking was quenched by addition of glycine (to a concentration of 0.125 M) for 5 min at room temperature. Cell pellets were frozen at −80°C. To perform ChIP, frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice for 5 min and resuspended in 100 μL of ChIP lysis buffer [1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)]. ChIP dilution buffer [0.01% SDS, 1.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 167 mM NaCl] was then added to achieve a total volume of 300 μL. Samples were sonicated in a Bioruptor (Diagenode, Liege, Belgium) for 12 min, 30 s on/30 s off. For each, the volume was then brought up to 1 mL with dilution buffer plus protease inhibitors, and 50 μL of this reaction was set aside as an input chromatin control. To prepare antibody-bound beads for ChIP, 25 μL of Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo Fisher) were washed three times in block solution (0.5% BSA in PBS), resuspended in 100 μL of block solution, and incubated with antibody [2.5 μg of FLAG M2 antibody (F1804, MilliporeSigma)] for 8 hr at 4°C with rotation. These beads were then washed three times in 200 μL of block solution, resuspended in 50 μL dilution buffer, and added to sonicated chromatin. The immunoprecipitation reactions were incubated overnight, rotating, at 4°C. After overnight incubation, beads were washed two times in 700 μL low-salt immune complex wash buffer [0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 150 mM NaCl], two times in LiCl wash buffer [0.25 M LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.1)], and two times in TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Unbound fractions were used to evaluate fragmentation. Bound chromatin was eluted twice (for 10 min each elution) in 125 μL elution buffer (0.2% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 5 mM DTT in TE) at 65°C. Crosslinking was reversed by incubation for 8 hr at 65°C with 400 rpm shaking. ChIP and input samples were treated with 0.2 mg/mL RNase A for 2 hr at 37°C and with 0.1 mg/mL proteinase K for 2 hr at 55°C. The DNA samples (from ChIP and input chromatin) were purified using the ChIP Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) and eluted in 13 μL of the kit’s elution buffer.</p><p>ChIP-seq with the FLAG antibody was performed on three biological replicates for each condition (<italic>Stra8<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Stra8<sup>FLAG/FLAG</sup></italic>) with ~5 million cells for each replicate. For ChIP-seq, we chose our sample size of three replicates before beginning our study, because this number exceeds the suggested ENCODE guideline of two replicates. To minimize batch-specific variation, each <italic>Stra8<sup>FLAG/FLAG</sup></italic> ChIP replicate was processed in parallel with a <italic>Stra8<sup>+/+</sup></italic> ChIP replicate: the two ChIP experiments were performed in parallel, the sequencing libraries (from the two samples and their corresponding two input controls) were prepared in parallel, and a pool of the four barcoded libraries was run on a single flow cell. The three biological replicates were processed in three different batches. Libraries for ChIP samples and input controls were prepared using the TruSeq ChIP Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) (replicates 1 and 2) or the Accel-NGS 2S Plus DNA Library Kit (Swift Biosciences, Ann Arbor, MI) (replicate 3) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The counts were normalized to reads per million (rpm) by scaling to the total number of unduplicated reads in each dataset, and the normalized input chromatin read count was subtracted from the normalized ChIP-seq read count.</p><p>To visualize the average ChIP-seq density at the TSS of genes, we employed ngs.plot v2.61 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). We removed all potential PCR duplicates from bam files prior to plotting. To show average ChIP-seq read density across all replicates, the bam files from all three replicates were concatenated into a single file before plotting. We supplied either a list of all genes, or the lists of genes identified as STRA8-bound in specified numbers of replicates.</p><p>To visualize the input-subtracted normalized ChIP-seq signal, we generated a bigWig file with the input chromatin reads subtracted from the ChIP sample reads using the bamcompare tool v2.5.3 from deepTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ramírez et al., 2016</xref>) (options: --ratio subtract, --normalizeUsingRPKM, --ignoreDuplicates, --smoothLength 100, and --binSize 10). The ChIP-seq signal was visualized using the mm10 genome assembly on the UCSC Genome Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">http://genome.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>). The ChIP-seq tracks shown represent individual replicates where indicated, or pooled signal from all three <italic>Stra8<sup>FLAG/FLAG</sup></italic> ChIP-seq samples.</p><p>To determine whether the promoters of STRA8-bound genes were enriched for CpG islands (CGIs), the coordinates of CpG islands in the mouse genome (mm10) were downloaded using the UCSC Table Browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karolchik et al., 2004</xref>) at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/.">http://genome.ucsc.edu/.</ext-link> A gene was considered to have a CGI promoter if a CGI overlapped the 2 kb window surrounding the TSS for at least one of its transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>RNA-seq sample preparation</title><p>For RNA extraction, preleptotene cells were sorted into 500 μL of PBS with 1% BSA, plus 3.5 μL of RNAseOut (Thermo Fisher). RNA extraction was performed using a QIAshredder homogenizer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and RNeasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen), and RNA was eluted in 14 μL of RNase-free water. Prior to library preparation, RNA was stored at −80°C so that all RNA-seq libraries could be prepared together. RNA-seq libraries were prepared with the TruSeq Stranded mRNA kit (Illumina) with poly-A selection. To avoid batch effects, all seven barcoded libraries were pooled together, and this pool was sequenced with 40 bp single-end reads across two flow-cell lanes on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 machine. For each library, sequencing reads from the two lanes were combined prior to data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Data analysis: RNA-seq</title><p>For RNA-seq analysis, high-quality reads were first filtered using the FASTX-Toolkit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html">http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html</ext-link>). Expression levels of all transcripts in the Ensembl release 90 annotation (GENCODE basic subset, with the addition of mouse <italic>Gcna</italic> [Genbank accession KX981576.1]) were estimated using Kallisto v0.43.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bray et al., 2016</xref>) with sequence-bias correction. Expression levels for protein-coding transcripts on reference chromosomes (mm10) were extracted, summed by gene using tximport v1.6.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Soneson et al., 2016</xref>), and re-normalized to transcript-per-million (TPM) units. To calculate fold-changes in expression level between different genotypes/conditions, the estimated count values from kallisto were supplied to DESeq2 v1.18.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Love et al., 2014</xref>) with default parameters. An FDR cutoff of <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05 was used to determine statistically significant gene expression changes.</p><p>To calculate the degree of testis-biased expression for each gene, RNA-seq datasets from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Merkin et al. (2012)</xref> were downloaded for nine adult mouse tissues: brain, colon, heart, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, spleen, and testis. Expression levels for all cDNA transcripts annotated in Ensembl release 84 were estimated with kallisto. Genes from Ensembl release 84 were matched to genes in release 90 by Ensembl gene ID. The expression level of each gene in each tissue was estimated as its median expression level (in TPM units) across three individuals. A gene was considered to be testis-biased if its expression level in the testis was greater than its summed expression level across the eight remaining tissues (i.e., TPM in the testis &gt; 0.5 of summed TPM values across all tissues).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Data analysis: ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets</title><p>To identify potential enhancer sites, we downloaded replicated H3K4me1 peaks from adult mouse testis from the ENCODE Consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>) and removed peaks that overlap blacklist regions. H3K4me1 peaks were called as enhancer sites if they did not overlap the promoters of protein-coding genes, which were defined as the 2 kb window surrounding the TSS. TSS coordinates were the same as those in the STRA8 ChIP-seq analysis.</p><p>To identify cell-cycle transcription factor targets, ENCODE ChIP-seq data for E2F4 (mouse), E2F1 (human), and FOXM1 (human) were used. To obtain a high-confidence list of target genes, we downloaded the coordinates of IDR-thresholded peaks (optimal or pseudoreplicated), removed any peaks that overlapped blacklist regions, and identified the transcripts whose promoters overlapped the summits of the ChIP-seq peaks. For human, all hg19 genome coordinates were first converted to GRCh38 coordinates using the UCSC Genome Browser LiftOver tool. Peaks were mapped to transcripts/genes using TSS coordinates downloaded from Ensembl release 90 (GRCh38.p10), limiting the analysis to protein-coding transcripts on the reference chromosomes in the ‘GENCODE basic’ annotation. One-to-one mouse orthologs of human genes were identified using the BioMart database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smedley et al., 2015</xref>) (Ensembl release 90).

To determine whether non-meiotic cell cycle genes were overrepresented, a custom Gene Ontology category was generated by subtracting all terms that mapped to the process ‘meiotic cell cycle’ (GO: 0051321) from the terms that mapped to the process ‘cell cycle’ (GO: 0007049). To determine whether STRA8-activated genes are enriched for representative cell-cycle genes, we used the one-to-one mouse orthologs of the human cell-cycle genes in Table S2 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McKinley and Cheeseman (2017)</xref>. The <italic>P</italic>-value for this enrichment was calculated using a one-tailed hypergeometric test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Motif analysis</title><p>DNA motifs enriched in target genomic regions were identified using the HOMER motif discovery software package v4.9.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) with the mm10 genome configuration v5.10. Motif scores were calculated using the binomial distribution. To identify motifs enriched at the STRA8 binding sites, we first pooled all sequencing reads from the three <italic>Stra8<sup>FLAG/FLAG</sup></italic> ChIP-seq samples, identified peaks of binding using MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) v2.1.1.20160309 at a <italic>P</italic>-value cutoff of &lt; 1×10<sup>−5</sup>, and then identified all peak summits that were at the promoter (within 1 kb of the TSS) of the 1,351 STRA8-activated genes. The findMotifsGenome tool was used to identify motifs de novo that were enriched among the 100 bp windows surrounding these summits (50 bp on each side of the summit); for this analysis, the background set consisted of 100 bp sequences that were matched for GC-content. For identification of motifs enriched near the TSS (−200 bp to +200 bp) of the STRA8-activated genes, the findMotifs.pl tool was used, using a target gene list of the 1,351 STRA8-activated genes and a background list of all other genes expressed in preleptotene samples. To determine the number of motifs at a gene’s promoter, we used the scanMotifGenomeWide.pl tool to determine all locations of the motif across the genome and counted the number of motif instances at the promoter (2 kb surrounding the TSS) for each annotated transcript. For genes associated with multiple transcripts, we used the motif count from the transcript with the most promoter motifs. To determine the number of promoter motifs at human genes, one-to-one human orthologs of mouse genes were identified using the BioMart database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smedley et al., 2015</xref>) (Ensembl release 90).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistical tests</title><p>Statistical tests were conducted using RStudio v1.1.414 as described here, unless otherwise noted.

protein</title><boxed-text><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43738.034</object-id><p>STRA8 was previously hypothesized to be a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, based on the presence of a stretch of basic amino acids followed by an HLH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baltus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tedesco et al., 2009</xref>) in amino acids (aa) 28-79 of the 393-aa STRA8 isoform. bHLH domains are found in transcription factors. Their HLH regions enable dimerization (either hetero-dimerization or homo-dimerization) with other HLH proteins, and this is required for protein activity. The basic residues preceding the HLH mediate DNA binding. Beyond the presence of this putative domain, there had been no <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that STRA8 functions as a bHLH transcription factor. However, the region containing the bHLH domain is likely to be important for STRA8 function, as it is among the most highly conserved regions of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baltus et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies using cell lines transfected with STRA8 revealed that the first 84 amino acids (which includes the bHLH domain) were required for nuclear localization; nuclear localization was also impaired when arginines in the basic region were mutated to alanine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tedesco et al., 2009</xref>). We now find <italic>in vivo</italic> that a STRA8 isoform that lacks the first 111 amino acids does not localize to the nucleus of preleptotene cells; germ cells that express only this shorter isoform of STRA8 are not able to initiate meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). These findings point to a critical role for the N terminus — presumably the HLH domain — in STRA8’s nuclear localization <italic>in vivo</italic> and its function in meiotic initiation.</p><p>The mouse STRA8 amino acid sequence has a long stretch of glutamic acid residues (amino acids 143-193 of the longer isoform). However, this stretch of glutamic acids is not well conserved among different species.</p><p>STRA8 may have another DNA binding domain in addition to the bHLH domain. Using the Phyre2 web portal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>), which predicts domains and secondary structures from amino acid sequences, we found that that amino acids ~216-268 of the 393-aa STRA8 protein likely encode a high-mobility group (HMG) box domain. This domain is often used by transcription factors for DNA binding but has not yet been studied in the context of the STRA8 protein.</p></boxed-text></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43738.056</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>de Massy</surname><given-names>Bernard</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Institute of Human Genetics, CNRS UPR 1142</institution><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>de Massy</surname><given-names>Bernard</given-names> </name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Institute of Human Genetics, CNRS UPR 1142</institution><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Ishiguro</surname><given-names>Kei-ichiro</given-names> </name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University</institution><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Bernard de Massy as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor.

Since its discovery twelve years ago STRA8 is the enigmatic gatekeeper of the mitotic/meiotic switch in vertebrates, though its molecular function remained unclear. In this study, the authors addressed the molecular function of STRA8 in the initiation of meiosis. The authors' comprehensive analyses with RNA-seq and ChIP-seq using spermatogenesis synchronization method lead the authors to conclude that STRA8 binds and activates promoters of germ-line specific genes for initiation of meiosis and those of G1-S cell cycle regulation. Overall manuscript is well written and provides insight into meiotic initiation in mouse.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>However the presentation of the data and its interpretation requires clarification. The main issues that require clarification are:</p><p>1) The authors should define more accurately what they define as meiotic initiation and also as preleptotene stage. It seems that one of their conclusions is that meiotic initiation is before/at/during (some ambiguity here) preleptotene. In addition, they have to take into account and integrate into their study the observation that Mark et al., 2008 reported meiotic initiation in <italic>Stra8</italic> deficient males. How come this study is not even referenced? For instance one can read the ambiguity in the sentence: &quot;These observations suggest that the decision to initiate meiosis occurs in the preleptotene stage, upstream of meiotic S phase&quot;: How can initiation occur in preleptotene and upstream of S phase, if preleptotene is S phase?</p><p>2) The CHipSeq analysis is performed on 2S cells which includes B type spermatogonia and only 44% Stra positive preleptotene cells. Romer et al. report in some samples 20% B type spermatogonia and also <italic>Stra8</italic> negative preleptotene cells (based on immuno-detection). What was the composition of the 2S samples used for ChIPSeq? Some <italic>Stra8</italic> bound sites could be genes regulated in these cells but potentially in spermatogonia. This should be clarified, discussed and it could indicate a role for <italic>Stra8</italic> before meiotic initiation. Ideally, the detection of <italic>Stra8</italic> binding in purified spermatogonia could solve this issue.</p><p>3) It is important to validate the use of the <italic>Stra8<sup>FLAG</sup></italic> allele: Are <italic>Stra8<sup>FLAG</sup></italic> homozygous mice fully fertile and is the testis transcriptome same as wild type?</p><p>4) The authors should analyze and present the comparison between <italic>Stra8</italic> bound genes, genes upregulated in the presence of <italic>Stra8</italic> (compared to <italic>Stra8</italic> KO) and genes upregulated at or before meiotic initiation in wild type, in a more synthetic way. This does not exclude to have specific sections for meiotic prophase and cell cycle genes. In addition, the authors should stress that these RNAseq analysis have a limitation: they do not detect other regulatory levels such as RNA stability and translation. Recent papers have shown this to be very important during meiosis.</p><p>In the paper, the tables provided with the list of genes deregulated in <italic>Stra8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> male preleptotene, ovaries, testis-specific and bound by STRA8FLAG is actually difficult to follow.

Is this correct? What are the expression levels of housekeeping genes (wt vs. <italic>Stra8</italic> KO)? Could these be used to normalize?</p><p>Why is <italic>Rec8</italic> down-regulated? Could this result from the normalization used?</p><p>9) The authors should discuss what the down-regulated genes are and whether this is compatible with a direct and/or indirect effect.</p><p>10) Figure 1—figure supplement 2A: include the <italic>Stra8</italic> KO control.</p><p>11) This sentence is not very convincing: “Even genes that were bound in only one replicate are likely true STRA8 targets; their promoters display appreciable ChIP-seq signal compared to non-target genes (Figure 2—figure supplement 4G).” What is the meaning of &quot;appreciable&quot;?

Furthermore, robust STRA8 expression is not observed until stage VII, during the last ~25 hours of the preleptotene stage. These observations are consistent with meiotic initiation occurring <italic>during</italic> the preleptotene stage. (Please see Materials and methods for calculations.)</p><p>In the present manuscript we characterize STRA8’s function in preleptotene cells, because a strict <italic>Stra8</italic> requirement for male germ cells to initiate meiosis and progress beyond the preleptotene stage was demonstrated on the pure C57BL/6 genetic background (Anderson et al., 2008). We have edited the Introduction (third paragraph) to reflect Mark and colleagues’ findings on a mixed genetic background [C57BL/6 (50%) 129/Sv (50%)], in which <italic>Stra8</italic>-deficient male germ cells can initiate meiosis but fail to complete meiotic prophase I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The CHipSeq analysis is performed on 2S cells which includes B type spermatogonia and only 44% Stra positive preleptotene cells.

However, our STRA8 ChIP-seq experiments were designed to specifically shed light on STRA8’s role at meiotic initiation. We carefully chose the 2S testis samples for ChIP-seq, through STRA8 staining and histological staging, to ensure that most of STRA8 ChIP-seq signal derives from cells at meiotic initiation:</p><p>1) Of all cells that express STRA8 in our 2S samples used for ChIP-seq, ~88% are initiating meiosis and ~12% are spermatogonia.</p><p>2) Preleptotene cells express at least two-fold higher levels of STRA8 protein than spermatogonia (see STRA8 IHC in Figure 2A).</p><p>3) Therefore, at least ~88% of STRA8 ChIP-seq signal derives from cells initiating meiosis. Assuming that STRA8 levels in preleptotene cells are twice the levels in spermatogonia, ~94% of the STRA8 ChIP-seq signal comes from meiotic initiation.</p><p>We note that in Romer et al., 2018, we demonstrated the range of cell types enriched at 6.75-7 days following the Win18,446/RA synchronization procedure. Due to mouse-to-mouse variability in synchronization, each sample used must be carefully staged, as we have done here before selecting samples for ChIP-seq.</p><p>We provide the composition of the 2S samples used for ChIP-seq in Figure 2—figure supplement 4, and we have modified the main text (subsection “Identifying the targets of a meiotic initiation factor”, fourth paragraph) to alert readers to this data.
