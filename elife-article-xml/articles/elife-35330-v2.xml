Here, we show that deletion of these selfish elements from the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> mitochondrial genome is stressful to the host. A strain without mitochondrial introns displays hallmarks of the retrograde response, with altered mitochondrial morphology, gene expression and metabolism impacting growth and lifespan. Deletion of the complete suite of mitochondrial introns is phenocopied by overexpression of the splicing factor Mss116. We show that, in both cases, abnormally efficient transcript maturation results in excess levels of mature <italic>cob</italic> and <italic>cox1</italic> host mRNA. Thus, inefficient splicing has become an integral part of normal mitochondrial gene expression. We propose that the persistence of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> self-splicing introns has been facilitated by an evolutionary lock-in event, where the host genome adapted to primordial invasion in a way that incidentally rendered subsequent intron loss deleterious.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>self-splicing intron</kwd><kwd>retrograde response</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>lifespan</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NAOS Group</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudan</surname><given-names>Marina</given-names></name><name><surname>Musa</surname><given-names>Marina</given-names></name><name><surname>Kanunnikau</surname><given-names>Matea</given-names></name><name><surname>Kriško</surname><given-names>Anita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mediterrenean Institute of Life Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudan</surname><given-names>Marina</given-names></name><name><surname>Musa</surname><given-names>Marina</given-names></name><name><surname>Kanunnikau</surname><given-names>Matea</given-names></name><name><surname>Kriško</surname><given-names>Anita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000761</institution-id><institution>Imperial College London</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Junior Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Warnecke</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Warnecke</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Removal of mitochondrial introns (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) from their host genes leads to detrimental increase in their transcript levels.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mobile genetic elements frequently compromise host fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Werren, 2011</xref>), corrupting genetic information or disturbing adaptive gene expression patterns, sometimes to lethal effect. Despite this, mobile genetic elements are ubiquitous in most eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hurst and Werren, 2001</xref>). How do these selfish elements persist in a genomic environment where – even in the absence of selection – mutational forces constantly work to erode them? Although mobile elements can donate motifs (or domains) that are co-opted into host regulatory pathways (or genic sequence) over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Feschotte, 2008</xref>), deletions usually whittle away all but the core beneficial motif. The components that once mediated mobility, such as the reverse transcriptases of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), are typically lost. Thus, functional selfish elements that remain mobile are thought to persist over evolutionary time not by virtue of sporadic beneficial effects for the host, but because they replicate and spread to other sites in the genome faster than they are deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Feschotte, 2008</xref>). The element survives, not where it originally invaded but as a descendant copy elsewhere in the genome.</p><p>An interesting exception in this regard are self-splicing introns, which populate some highly expressed genes in archaea, bacteria, and organellar genomes of fungi and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lambowitz and Belfort, 1993</xref>). In contrast to other mobile elements, self-splicing introns do not spawn a large pool of copies that disperse across the genome to escape mutational erasure. Rather, owing to highly specific homing sites, each intron is typically confined to a single location in the host genome and evolutionary persistence seems to rely on continued re-invasion, either from other individuals in the same population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Goddard and Burt, 1999</xref>) or across species boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Skelly and Maleszka, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dujon, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Repar and Warnecke, 2017</xref>). Self-splicing introns can spread despite considerable fitness costs to the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hickey, 1982</xref>). However, in practice, fitness costs might be relatively low as the host RNA is intact and fully functional once the intron has been spliced out. As far as we know, self-splicing introns do not contribute positively to host fitness and, naively, one would expect that deleting these introns from the genome would be beneficial or, at worst, make no difference to the host.</p><p>Here, we investigate the consequences of deleting all 13 self-splicing introns from the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mitochondrial genome, where they reside in three host genes: the 21S ribosomal RNA gene Q0158 (which harbours a single group I intron named <italic>omega</italic>) and two protein-coding genes, <italic>cox1</italic> (group I: aI3, aI4, aI5α, aI5β; group II: aI1, aI2, aI5γ) and <italic>cob</italic> (group I: bI2, bI3, bI4, bI5; group II: bI1), both encoding components of the electron transport chain. Note here, that we use ‘self-splicing introns’ as a convenient shorthand to describe the complete collection of group I and group II introns, even though timely splicing in vivo often depends on one or several <italic>trans</italic>-factors (see below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lambowitz and Belfort, 1993</xref>). We show that, contrary to expectations, removing these introns has dramatic consequences for mitochondrial physiology and function, triggering changes in nuclear gene expression that affect organismal growth and lifespan. Our results demonstrate that the presence of mitochondrial self-splicing introns has become integral to normal mitochondrial gene expression and that, curiously, normal mitochondrial function in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has come to require inefficient splicing. Our findings have implications for understanding how self-splicing introns and mobile elements more generally can survive over evolutionary time without providing an adaptive benefit to the host.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Removal of mitochondrial introns is associated with a multi-faceted stress phenotype</title><p>To test whether the removal of self-splicing mitochondrial introns affects host physiology and fitness, we compared two <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains that are isogenic with regard to their nuclear genomes (except for a single marker gene, <italic>ura3</italic>, see Materials and methods) but differ with respect to mitochondrial intron content. The control strain a161 (WT) contains the full complement of seven <italic>cox1</italic> and five <italic>cob</italic> introns, whereas strain a161-U7 (<italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic>) carries an intronless mitochondrial genome, which was originally constructed by Seraphin and co-workers via serial recombination of natural yeast isolates that lack individual mitochondrial introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Séraphin et al., 1987</xref>).</p><p>Contrary to a model where self-splicing introns are dispensable parasitic passengers, we find that <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> exhibits stark phenotypic differences to the control strain. When the two strains are cultured in isolation, exponential growth on glucose-supplemented YPD medium is ~30% slower for <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> also fares poorly when pitted directly against WT in competitive fitness assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Chronological life span (CLS, see Materials and methods), on the other hand, is almost two-fold longer for <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). At the cellular level, <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> displays increased mitochondrial mass and volume and a mitochondrial morphology characterized by a large network of branched tubules of homogeneous diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–e</xref>). Transcript levels of mitofusin (<italic>fzo1</italic>) and the GTPase <italic>mgm1</italic>, key nuclearly encoded regulators of mitochondrial fusion, are strongly upregulated (qPCR, <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>fzo1</italic>: 4.02-fold, p=0.002; <italic>mgm1</italic>: 5.24-fold, p=3.19×10<sup>−5</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) while levels of <italic>dnm1</italic> and <italic>fis1</italic>, which orchestrate mitochondrial fission, are only moderately induced (qPCR, <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>dnm1</italic>: 1.67-fold, p=0.026; <italic>dnm1</italic>: 1.81-fold, p=0.085), suggesting that the changes in mitochondrial morphology result from increased fusion rather than impaired fission. The <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> strain also exhibits a 2.7-fold increase in mitochondrial DNA copy number (qPCR, <italic>t</italic>-test p=1.09×10<sup>−7</sup>). At the same time, there are no significant differences in mitochondrial inner membrane potential, as measured by 3,3'-Dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide [DiOC6(3)] fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), suggesting that mitochondria are functional despite grossly altered morphology. This notion is further supported by the observation that <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> retains the capacity to grow on glycerol, a non-fermentable carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), as previously reported for a different nuclear background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Minczuk et al., 2002</xref>). In fact, biomarkers of mitochondrial metabolism point to increased mitochondrial activity, with higher oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>) and cellular ATP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>) during exponential growth. Despite increased activity, levels of mitochondrial superoxide are reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>), likely reflecting a &gt; 7.5-fold upregulation of the mitochondrial ROS-scavenger <italic>sod2</italic> (qPCR, <italic>t</italic>-test p=0.003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Thus, intron removal challenges but does not terminally compromise mitochondrial function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35330.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phenotypic effects of deleting all self-splicing introns from the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mitochondrial genome.</title><p>Deletion of mitochondrial introns (<italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic>) or overexpression of Mss116 (<italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic>) (<bold>a</bold>) reduces growth rates, (<bold>b</bold>) extends chronological lifespan, (<bold>c</bold>) increases mitochondrial mass, measured as NAO fluorescence, (<bold>d,e</bold>) increases mitochondrial volume, (<bold>g</bold>) oxygen consumption, and (<bold>h</bold>) ATP levels but (<bold>i</bold>) decreases superoxide levels, measured as MitoSOX fluorescence.

We considered two main possibilities. First, in deleting introns, we might have inadvertently removed DNA-/RNA-level regulatory elements that affect expression of the host genes. Alternatively, the act of short-circuiting the splicing process itself might interfere with normal expression. Specifically, we hypothesized that normal levels of transcription might be tuned to accommodate a certain proportion of transcripts that fail to splice correctly. Group II introns in particular are known for low splicing efficiency, even in the presence of auxiliary proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Karunatilaka et al., 2010</xref>). As a corollary, a large fraction of pre-mRNAs might be targeted and degraded by mitochondrial quality control, either because splicing is erroneous (mis-splicing) or does not occur in a timely manner so that the transcript is shunted into degradation (kinetic coupling). In <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic>, splicing does not occur so that erroneous splicing products do not arise. As a result, production of functional <italic>cox1/cob</italic> mRNAs might overshoot its target and trigger a system-wide response, for example because altered COX1/COB levels upset dosage balance amongst respiratory complexes. To test this abnormally-efficient-maturation hypothesis and simultaneously rule out that mitochondrial stress is caused by the removal of DNA-/RNA-level regulatory elements, we sought to alter splicing efficiency by orthogonal means. To this end, we overexpressed the nuclearly encoded DEAD box RNA helicase Mss116, which promotes splicing of all <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mitochondrial introns by remodeling or stabilizing splice-relevant RNA structures in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Karunatilaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). We confirmed overexpression and mitochondrial localization of Mss116 by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence, respectively, using an N-terminal His-tagged version of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), and then characterized the effects of Mss116 overexpression in the Y258 strain using an untagged version of the protein. Remarkably, the Mss116 overexpression strain (<italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic>) phenocopies <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic>.</p><p><italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic> exhibits increased generation times, extended chronological life span, lower competitive fitness, increased mitochondrial fusion, 2.9-fold increased mtDNA copy number (qPCR, <italic>t</italic>-test p=5.5×10<sup>−7</sup>), elevated oxygen consumption, and altered ATP and ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we observe longer replicative life span (RLS) in <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), a more direct proxy of ageing that we were not able to measure accurately in <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic>, where separating mother and daughter cells in a timely fashion proved challenging (see Materials and methods). Overexpression of a DEAD box mutant of Mss116 (<italic>Mss116<sup>E268K</sup></italic>), which lacks ATPase and therefore helicase activity, does not phenocopy <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This suggests that the role of Mss116 in splicing – which relies on helicase activity – is critical rather than a recently suggested ATP-independent role in transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Markov et al., 2014</xref>). More generally, the fact that <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic> – which encodes a full complement of introns – phenocopies <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> indicates that the stress phenotype in these strains is not caused by missing DNA-level functionality and instead points toward a critical role for splicing. Overexpressing Mss116 in <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> did not reveal additional phenotypes and the strain behaved like <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) further supporting the notion that intron deletion and Mss116 overexpression act through the same pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Cells are stressed because of abnormally efficient transcript maturation</title><p>We suspected that phenotypic effects of Mss116 overexpression (and intron deletion) are linked to altered transcript maturation of the host genes, <italic>cob</italic> and <italic>cox1</italic>. However, we first wanted to rule out an alternative hypothesis. In both <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic>, Mss116 is in excess relative to need (in <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic> because Mss116 is overexpressed, in <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> because its usual targets – the introns – are absent). Phenotypic effects could therefore be caused by excess Mss116 interacting with RNAs that it would not normally target or not target to the same extent. This is conceptually related to the idea that splicing dynamics can change simply as a result of altered competition between mRNAs for access to the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Munding et al., 2013</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we deleted Mss116 in the <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> strain. We observe the same suite of phenotypes we see in <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), demonstrating that neither absolute nor relative excess of Mss116 are responsible for the stress phenotype described above.</p><p>Having ruled out this hypothesis, we then focused on characterizing the effects of Mss116 overexpression on <italic>cob/cox1</italic> splicing dynamics in greater detail. Using qPCR, we first measured the levels of total <italic>cox1</italic> and <italic>cob</italic> transcripts as well as individual introns at steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, 240 mins after Mss116 induction, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). For <italic>cox1,</italic> we additionally monitored exon and intron (aI2, aI5β) levels using RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (RNA FISH, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, see Materials and methods). We find that most mitochondrial introns are strongly depleted in <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic> compared to the empty vector control and relative to exons. The relative depletion of individual introns is somewhat variable and one intron <italic>–</italic> aI5α - is equally abundant in <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic> and the Y258 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We then examined shifts in the abundance of pre-mRNA and mature mRNA over the course of Mss116 induction, using different primer combinations to monitor unspliced RNAs and spliced exon-exon junctions. For both <italic>cox1</italic> and <italic>cob,</italic> Mss116 overexpression shifts the balance between unspliced (or partially spliced) pre-mRNA transcripts, which dominate the uninduced steady state, towards mature mRNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), while total transcript abundance (mRNA plus pre-mRNA) remains largely unchanged. These observations are consistent with a model where nascent transcriptional output is unchanged in <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic> compared to the empty vector control and differential steady state levels are the result of post-transcriptional events.</p><p>Based on these findings, we suggest that <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic> phenocopies <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> because eliminating introns at the DNA level (<italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic>) and facilitating accurate and efficient excision at the RNA level (<italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic>) both result in abnormally efficient transcript maturation. That is, fewer transcripts are eliminated by mitochondrial quality control because splicing is erroneous or does not proceed in a timely manner, resulting in a greater number of mature <italic>cox1/cob</italic> mRNAs. For reasons that remain to be elucidated, increased transcript levels are then perceived as stressful and trigger the retrograde response, culminating in a multifaceted stress phenotype. We speculate in this regard that elevated protein levels of COB (<italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic>: 9.3-fold; <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic>: 5.0-fold upregulation, as determined by quantitative label-free mass spectrometry) and COX1 (<italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic>: 11.6-fold; <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic>: 12.1-fold upregulation) might interfere with proper assembly and function of complex III and complex IV, respectively, and therefore constitute a deleterious dosage imbalance phenotype.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is now well documented that disruption of splicing homeostasis can impact normal physiological function and lead to cellular stress and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wang and Cooper, 2007</xref>). There is also increasingly detailed mechanistic knowledge of how proteins involved in splicing can alter growth and ageing via a metabolic route, exemplified by the recent finding that splicing factor one is a modulator of dietary restriction-induced longevity in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Heintz et al., 2017</xref>). The classic model here is that loss of splicing homeostasis – through genetic, developmental, or environmental perturbation – leads to deleterious shifts in splice isoform production or precipitates increased production of erroneous transcripts that tax the quality control system and/or have direct cytotoxic effects. In other words, the disease/stress state is a high-error state. Our results are unusual in that they suggest that normal splicing can be associated with high error rates and that, therefore, splicing homeostasis can also be disturbed by increasing splicing efficacy.</p><p>Further research will be required to tease apart how individual mitochondrial introns affect the overall burden from failed splicing in this system. It is evident from population genomic analysis of different <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains that some mitochondrial introns are fixed across extant populations whereas others exhibit presence/absence polymorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wolters et al., 2015</xref>). This seems to suggest that the removal of at least some introns in isolation is insufficiently stressful to be purged by natural selection. At the same time, studies of <italic>suv3,</italic> the second DEAD box RNA helicase present in yeast mitochondria, suggest that the deleterious effect of deleting individual introns – while possibly idiosyncratic – is at least partially cumulative: deletion of <italic>suv3,</italic> a component of the mitochondrial degradosome, decreases levels of mature <italic>cox1/cob</italic> mRNA and compromises respiratory capacity, but less so where more introns had been removed from the mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Golik et al., 1995</xref>). Importantly – at least for the combinations tested – severity was found to depend on the number but not identity of the <italic>cox1</italic> or <italic>cob</italic> introns present.</p><p>In addition to providing a new insight into post-transcriptional gene regulation in mitochondria, our findings have implications for understanding the evolutionary persistence of self-splicing introns and perhaps mobile elements more generally. The phenotypic effects we observe run counter to the notion that self-splicing introns are low-cost passengers and instead demonstrate that at least some of these selfish elements are firmly embedded in the organization of mitochondrial gene expression such that removing them upsets proper expression of their host genes. We suggest that our observations can be explained by an evolutionary lock-in model where the primordial colonization of an intron-free <italic>cox1/cob</italic> ancestor by a self-splicing intron led to a drop in <italic>cox1/cob</italic> mRNA levels and favoured compensatory mutations that increased <italic>cox1/cob</italic> transcription to restore mRNA abundances back to their original levels. When we forcibly remove these introns, however, this hard-wired upregulation turns maladaptive. There no longer is a pool of transcripts targeted for degradation leading to excess levels of mature mRNA. In principle, it is also possible that the initial invader spliced very efficiently and imposed no cost but subsequently co-evolved with host gene expression in a ratchet-like fashion, whereby incidental greater-than-required levels of the host gene allowed recurrent small decreases in splicing efficiency. However, since self-splicing introns can spread despite substantial fitness costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hickey, 1982</xref>), we do not actually need to evoke a cost-free ancestral event. We suggest that evolutionary lock-ins of this type might provide an unappreciated mechanism to facilitate the longer term persistence of genetic parasites, especially in large host populations where evolution is not mutation-limited. We also note that this argument might in principle extend to nuclear introns: if, for a given dosage-sensitive gene, failure to splice is common and transcription levels are set to compensate, intron loss might be deleterious and prevented by purifying selection even though the intron makes no adaptive contribution to gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p>Strain a161 (also known as ID41-6/161, or sometimes simply 161), described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wenzlau et al.

SacI and SalI restriction sites were added by PCR for ligation between the 3’-end of the upstream flanking region and the 5’-end of the promoter sequence, and 3’-end of the promoter sequence and 5’-end of the downstream flanking region, respectively. The mutations introduced here (highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) have been previously shown to reduce the strength of <italic>cox1</italic> and <italic>cob</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Turk et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Chronological lifespan measurement</title><p>All strains were grown to saturation as described above and pelleted at 4000 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Cells were then washed twice and resuspended in sterile deionized water (10<sup>6</sup> cells in 10 mL in order to avoid cell growth on the debris of dead cells) and incubated at 30°C with shaking. Every 2–3 days, cells were serially diluted and plated onto YPD plates in order to evaluate cell growth.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Replicative lifespan measurement</title><p>Replicative lifespan (RLS) was determined by micromanipulation for <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic> and <italic>Mss116<sup>E268K</sup></italic> in the Y258 background, as well as for <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic> in the Δ<italic>hap4</italic> and Δ<italic>rtg2</italic> nuclear backgrounds, counting the number of daughters produced by individual mother cells. We were unable to reliably determine RLS for the <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> strain as daughter and mother cells could not be separated in a timely manner, which is critical for RLS measurements. For unknown reasons, and perhaps specific to the nuclear background, cells were unusually sticky so that the first daughter often could not be separated from the mother until the mother had already produced other buds, making it difficult to track mother/daughter identity over time, an essential prerequisite for reliably determining replicative lifespan. Cells were incubated at 30°C on YPD (WT) or -URA (mutants) plates for the duration of the experiment. Using a microscope equipped with a microdissection apparatus suitable for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Singer Instruments, Watchet, UK), cells were transferred to defined places on agar plates and virgin daughter cells collected. Each cell was monitored continuously over several days every 60–90 min until all mother cells stopped budding. The total number of daughter cells was noted for each mother cell. The total number of monitored mother cells is as follows: 90 cells for the empty vector control, 86 cells for <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic>, and 91 cells for the <italic>Mss116<sup>E268K</sup></italic>. The measurements were pooled from three independent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Respiration measurement</title><p>Oxygen uptake was monitored polarographically using an oxygraph equipped with a Clark-type electrode (Oxygraph, Hansatech, Norfolk, UK). Cells were harvested during exponential growth phase, spun and resuspended in growth medium (as above) at the density of 30 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. 500 μL of culture were transferred to an airtight 1.5 mL oxygraph chamber. Cells were assayed in conditions closely similar to the ones in a flask culture (30°C and stirring). Oxygen content was monitored for at least 4 min. To ensure that the observed oxygen consumption was due to the mitochondrial activity, complex III inhibitor antimycin (final concentration 10 μg/mL) was routinely added to the cultures and compared to the rate observed without antimycin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Competition assay</title><p>Competition experiments were carried out between <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> (a161-U7) and its control strain (a161) as well as between <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic> and its corresponding empty vector control strain. Prior to the competition, we plated 5 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells of each mutant (<italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> or <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic>) strain on YPD agar plates with 200 μg/mL geneticin, followed by a 4-day incubation at 30°C, to select for spontaneous geneticin resistance. In doing so, we can subsequently determine relative fitness in a relatively simple fashion using a plating method (rather than, for example, sequencing barcodes). The two strains to be competed were then grown independently on YPD medium in 2% glucose until saturation. The next day, an equal number of cells from each WT culture (geneticin-sensitive) and each mutant (geneticin-resistant) were mixed in fresh YPD medium, 2% glucose so that each was diluted 200x. In mid-exponential phase, OD 0.4–0.6 (approximately 5–6 hr after dilution), aliquots of cells were harvested, and serial dilutions were plated on YPD-agar plates without geneticin. Next, dilutions with between 50 and 200 colonies were replica-plated on YPD-agar plates with geneticin (200 μg/mL). Colonies were counted on both types of plates and the ratio of geneticin-resistant (mutant) to geneticin-sensitive (WT) colonies was calculated as a measure of relative fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Flow cytometry was carried out on a Becton-Dickinson (Franklin Lakes, NJ) FACSCalibur machine equipped with a 488 nm Argon laser and a 635 nm red diode laser.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Measurement of the Mss116 overexpression level</title><p>The expression level of Mss116 in the <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic> strain was measured by using a rabbit polyclonal anti-His tag antibody (Abcam, ab137839, 1:10000) and secondary IgG goat anti-rabbit labeled with Alexa 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, A11034, 1:2000).

Samples were then digested using a Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wiśniewski et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, samples were concentrated on the filter unit by centrifugation and buffer exchanged using sequential washing and centrifugation with 8M urea, 100 mM TRIS/HCL buffer (pH8.5). Proteins were reduced and alkylated sequentially with 10 mM Dithiothreitol and 50 mM Iodoacetamide (in 8M urea buffer), respectively. Samples were buffer exchanged to remove salts using sequential washing with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (AmBic). Trypsin Gold (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, V5280) was added to the samples in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate to an approximate 1:50, protease:protein ratio. Digestions were incubated at 37°C overnight (17 hr). Digest extracts were recovered from FASP filters via centrifugation and acidified with 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Acidified protein digests were desalted using Glygen C18 spin tips (Glygen Corp, Columbia, MD, TT2C18.96) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation and peptides eluted with 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (FA).

LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out in technical duplicates (1 µg on column) and separation was performed using an Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) via an Easy-Spray source. For LC-MS/MS analysis protein digests were injected and loaded onto a trap column (Acclaim PepMap 100 C18, 100 μm × 2 cm) for desalting and concentration at 8 μL/min in 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA. Peptides were then eluted on-line to an analytical column (Easy-Spray Pepmap RSLC C18, 75 μm × 50 cm) at a flow rate of 250 nL/min. Peptides were separated using a 120 min gradient, 4–25% of buffer B for 90 min followed by 25–45% buffer B for another 30 min (composition of buffer B – 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% FA) and subsequent column conditioning and equilibration. Eluted peptides were analysed by the mass spectrometer operating in positive polarity using a data-dependent acquisition mode. Ions for fragmentation were determined from an initial MS1 survey scan at 30,000 resolution, followed by CID (Collision-Induced Dissociation) of the top 10 most abundant ions. MS1 and MS2 scan AGC targets were set to 1e6 and 3e4 for maximum injection times of 500 ms and 100 ms respectively. A survey scan m/z range of 350–1500 was used, normalised collision energy set to 35%, charge state screening enabled with +1 charge states rejected and minimal fragmentation trigger signal threshold of 500 counts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Mass spectrometry - raw data processing</title><p>Data was processed using the MaxQuant software platform (v1.5.6.0), with database searches carried out by the in-built Andromeda search engine against the Uniprot <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> database (version 20160815, number of entries: 6,729). A reverse decoy database approach was used at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) for peptide spectrum matches.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor, Timothy Nilsen, and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work in its current form cannot be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, as you will see in the reviews below, all thought that the work was of potentially high interest. Therefore, we encourage you to address the reviewers' comments thoroughly and if successful to resubmit the paper to <italic>eLife</italic>. While such a resubmission will be considered to be a new submission, it will to the extent possible be handled by the same Editors and sent to the original reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors show that deleting all self-splicing introns in the yeast mitochondria leads to a pronounced phenotype, and that this effect can be phenocopied by overexpressing Mss116. The work done appears to be solid although the writing and explanation of figures could be improved.</p><p>This reviewer's concern comes primarily from the assertion that the observed phenomena arise from increased expression of the intron-containing genes. Another possibility is that overexpression of Mss116 relative to 'need' leads to problems, for instance interference with expression of other genes. (This is related to Manny Ares' idea of 'hungry spliceosomes' wherein overexpression of spliceosomes relative to number of intron-containing transcripts can lead to aberrant splicing of other (non-intron-containing) transcripts; it is also related to the notion that having extra proteins around is costly, as Drummond et al., have been arguing, although there is a bit of a difference here as that work concerns proteins without functions). Fortunately, this should be easy to test - does partial or complete KD of Mss116 ameliorate the phenotypes?</p><p>In addition, I think that the authors somewhat simplify the possible pathways to what they observe, thus setting up a bit of a strawman. Given that stuff has to be spliced, it is actually not all that surprising that splicing has become integrated. This is an important lesson, though one not as surprising as the paper perhaps tries to let on; it is not surprising that there will be coevolution of machinery and substrate such that removal of a network component would screw things up. As such I don't regard this work as a particularly 'clean' a test of repetitive elements' selective effects.</p><p>In particular, in the Results and Discussion section. The suggested model is possible but postulates a costly mutation (one that substantially decreases host gene expression). Perhaps instead an efficiently spliced intron invaded and gradually lost efficiency little by little while it was compensated by increased gene expression. If a non-infinitesimal band of gene expression is well tolerated, we expect the transcriptional level to float within this range (more precisely, within the range of transcriptional activity that, coupled with the splicing efficiency at the time). If there is mutational pressure imposes a direction on likely evolution of splicing efficiency (that is, if efficiency-decreasing mutations are more likely than -increasing mutations, which seems quite likely), then transcriptional level could float to a position of (non-selected) excess expression, which could allow fixation of a splicing efficiency decreasing mutation, and multiple cycles of this could lead to increased transcription and inefficient splicing without inferring a costly intermediate).</p><p>In total, then, I think that the authors should produce a draft of the manuscript that is more mindful of the limitations of their experiment, notwithstanding its elegance, to test the idea that (relative) overexpression of Mss116 is the problem rather than overexpression of intron-containing transcripts, and to spend more time discussing how surprising their findings really are given what we already know. After this revision I recommend that the manuscript be fully reconsidered; while I am hopeful that the paper will eventually reach a level of appropriate consideration of alternative possibilities and models, I hope that his partial encouragement will not be misunderstood as full endorsement and look forward to reviewing an improved and more subtle draft of the manuscript.</p><p>My hopes for improvement notwithstanding, I congratulate the authors on some very nice work.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Summary</p><p>The authors have conducted an interesting study that suggests that deleting the complete repertoire of group I and group II introns from the yeast mitochondrial genome leads to phenotypes consistent with a retrograde response. Intriguingly, a similar phenotype also is observed upon over-expression of the Mss116 helicase, but not upon over-expression of a mutant Mss116 protein that lacks ATPase (and therefore helicase) activity. These (and other) results lead the authors to conclude that normal mitochondrial function &quot;depends&quot; on inefficient splicing and that either the absence of introns or over-expression of Mss116 leads to abnormally efficient transcript maturation, thereby increasing the levels of mature cob and cox1 RNA, which accounts for the phenotypes observed in their studies. The authors then propose a rather intriguing evolutionary &quot;lock-in&quot; model. The model posits that the colonization of the primordial cob and coxI genes by mobile group I and/or group II introns led to inefficient splicing which, in turn, led to compensatory regulatory mechanisms that increased cob and coxI expression to allow efficient oxidative phosphorylation. The forceful experimental removal of the mitochondrial introns (or promoting more efficient splicing by over-expression of Mss116) then is predicted to lead to an over-expression of cob and coxI, which the authors demonstrate compromises mitochondrial function.</p><p>For the most part, this paper is well written, the available data support the conclusions, and the resultant model is intriguing. That being stated, additional editing and the inclusion of important controls would help clarify the presentation and strengthen the conclusions of the study. My suggestions for improvement are noted below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Title: Does mitochondrial function truly &quot;require&quot; inefficient splicing? It seems more likely that the population of the primordial cob and coxI genes by mobile introns was slightly detrimental, which allowed compensatory mutations that resulted in higher cob and coxI expression. If so, these data are consistent with the idea that mobile intron insertions were detrimental and that the host evolved second site mutations to restore cob and coxI expression. Thus, the artificial, forced deletion of the introns then leads to an over-accumulation of cob and coxI (which is the crux of the &quot;lock-in&quot; model). Though semantic, I have a hard time buying that the presence of introns and inefficient splicing are required for mitochondrial function. Instead, one can simply argue that mobile introns are successful parasites that disrupted the cob and coxI genes and that the host &quot;found&quot; a way to overcome the burden of intron insertion.

The latter has been generally assumed, because many organellar introns are &quot;optional&quot;, and no phenotypic differences have been observed among strains that contain or lack the optional introns. Still, it is tempting to speculate that the organellar introns have consequences that have gone unnoticed.</p><p>The authors start with a yeast strain in which all organellar introns have been deleted. They find that the strain grows more slowly than the wild type and has a number of physiological perturbations including an increase in mitochondrial mass in the cell, increased oxygen consumption, and activation of the retrograde response. Transcript levels of the cox1 and cob1 mitochondrial genes are elevated. To test if higher transcript levels per se are responsible for the phenotype, they make point mutations in the promoters of the two genes and find that the wild type phenotype is largely restored. Hypothesizing that the presence of the introns causes inefficient transcript maturation, they overexpress the helicase Mss116 in an intron-containing strain. Mss116 is known to facilitate splicing of organellar introns, and interestingly its overexpression causes a similar phenotype as removal of the introns. This is convincing evidence that the efficiency of intron splicing is responsible for the mitochondrial phenotype, and that the cell is adapted to accommodate low efficiency splicing, and that having higher efficiency transcript maturation causes stress and irregularities in the cells. Thus, the organellar introns have at least a biological consequence, if not an adaptive role.</p><p>Overall, the experiments and data are interesting and the conclusions significant. However, there are some issues with the presentation and possibly the data, because not all experimental details are clear to me. The main text is highly condensed and does not clearly explain the experiments or data. Conclusions are stated but not explained thoroughly. It is especially difficult to follow if one does not have a background in mitochondrial physiology and the associated assays. I expect that all the assays and data support the conclusions that are drawn, but I am not sure because the explanations are so brief or even left out.</p><p>The most important thing missing from the manuscript is a description and explanation of the intron-less strain. There is no mention of where the strain came from. Did the authors make it themselves? If so, how? How did they validate the strain? The issue of isogenicity of the intronless strain and the wild-type strain is not addressed. This is a very important issue of course because the entire manuscript is based on the strain.</p><p>There are also issues with the figures and legends. For example, in Figure 1 what are all the circles in panel A? Not all points in panel B have error bars. Not all of the descriptions match-up between the panels and legend. More care should be given to the presentation, for both the images and legends.</p><p>The authors seem to think that the presence of introns leads to mis-splicing of transcript, but isn't it more likely that maturation is simply slower because of the time it takes to splice? Is there any evidence for mis-splicing and degradation as opposed to just slow splicing?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35330.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors show that deleting all self-splicing introns in the yeast mitochondria leads to a pronounced phenotype, and that this effect can be phenocopied by overexpressing Mss116. The work done appears to be solid although the writing and explanation of figures could be improved.</p><p>This reviewer's concern comes primarily from the assertion that the observed phenomena arise from increased expression of the intron-containing genes. Another possibility is that overexpression of Mss116 relative to 'need' leads to problems, for instance interference with expression of other genes. (This is related to Manny Ares' idea of 'hungry spliceosomes' wherein overexpression of spliceosomes relative to number of intron-containing transcripts can lead to aberrant splicing of other (non-intron-containing) transcripts; it is also related to the notion that having extra proteins around is costly, as Drummond et al., have been arguing, although there is a bit of a difference here as that work concerns proteins without functions). Fortunately, this should be easy to test -- does partial or complete KD of Mss116 ameliorate the phenotypes?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer proposes a reasonable alternative hypothesis: in both <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> and <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic>, Mss116 is in excess relative to need (in <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic> because Mss116 is overexpressed, in <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> because its usual targets – the introns – are absent). Might the phenotypic effects we observe therefore be explained by Mss116 starting to interact (or interacting more strongly) with off-target RNAs? We tested this experimentally. As suggested by the reviewer, we deleted Mss116 from the <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> strain. In this <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> /Δ<italic>Mss116</italic> strain, any phenotypic effects cannot possibly come from excess Mss116. Reassuringly, the phenotype of <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> /Δ<italic>Mss116</italic> mirrors that of <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic>, rejecting this hypothesis. Note also that the “hungry Mss116” hypothesis is not consistent with the stress phenotype being lost when rendering the <italic>cob/cox1</italic> promoters hypoactive. The “hungry Mss116” hypothesis would have predicted no change or perhaps further exacerbation of the phenotype. We discuss these new results in the Results and Discussion section and include them as Supplementary Figure 6.</p><p>If we understand correctly, the reviewer is concerned about the costs of gratuitous expression, as exemplified by the work of Kafri et al., 2015 andStoebel et al., 2008 (Alan Drummond’s past work is more specifically concerned with the cost of misfolded proteins). The rationale here would be that expressing a protein – even if functionally inert – can be costly because it sequesters away cellular resources, e.g. by hogging ribosomes. We do not think that this is a concern here. First, any such generic cost of expression will be born both by the <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic> strain and the catalytic mutant (<italic>Mss116<sup>E268K</sup></italic>), for which we do not observe the same suit of phenotypes. In other words, our study already contained an internal control. Second, the lack of phenotype in <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> /Δ<italic>Mss116</italic> (see response to point #1 above) also rules out that a gratuitous expression cost of <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub> </italic>is responsible for the phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, I think that the authors somewhat simplify the possible pathways to what they observe, thus setting up a bit of a strawman. Given that stuff has to be spliced, it is actually not all that surprising that splicing has become integrated. This is an important lesson, though one not as surprising as the paper perhaps tries to let on; it is not surprising that there will be coevolution of machinery and substrate such that removal of a network component would screw things up. As such I don't regard this work as a particularly 'clean' a test of repetitive elements' selective effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it might well be intuitive and expected (at least to some people) that splicing – even inefficient splicing – becomes integrated into the gene expression process so that intron removal interferes with proper expression. But intuition is one thing, demonstrating it is another. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior demonstration of this phenomenon (certainly in such a well-defined context), that not only describes detailed physiological/fitness costs but also traces the molecular origins of these costs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In particular, in the Results and Discussion section. The suggested model is possible but postulates a costly mutation (one that substantially decreases host gene expression). Perhaps instead an efficiently spliced intron invaded and gradually lost efficiency little by little while it was compensated by increased gene expression. If a non-infinitesimal band of gene expression is well tolerated, we expect the transcriptional level to float within this range (more precisely, within the range of transcriptional activity that, coupled with the splicing efficiency at the time). If there is mutational pressure imposes a direction on likely evolution of splicing efficiency (that is, if efficiency-decreasing mutations are more likely than -increasing mutations, which seems quite likely), then transcriptional level could float to a position of (non-selected) excess expression, which could allow fixation of a splicing efficiency decreasing mutation, and multiple cycles of this could lead to increased transcription and inefficient splicing without inferring a costly intermediate).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that, in principle, the initial invader might have spliced efficiently and subsequently become less efficient, co-evolving with host gene expression in a ratchet-like fashion, whereby incidental increases in the expression level of the host gene allowed small decreases in splicing efficiency of the intron. We now acknowledge this scenario (Materials and methods section). However, since elements that operate like self-splicing introns can spread in the population despite substantial fitness costs (see article by Hickey mentioned by reviewer #3), it is arguably more parsimonious to not require perfect splicing upon initial invasion, a point we also highlight in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In total, then, I think that the authors should produce a draft of the manuscript that is more mindful of the limitations of their experiment, notwithstanding its elegance, to test the idea that (relative) overexpression of Mss116 is the problem rather than overexpression of intron-containing transcripts, and to spend more time discussing how surprising their findings really are given what we already know. After this revision I recommend that the manuscript be fully reconsidered; while I am hopeful that the paper will eventually reach a level of appropriate consideration of alternative possibilities and models, I hope that his partial encouragement will not be misunderstood as full endorsement and look forward to reviewing an improved and more subtle draft of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the poor legend to Figure 1, which reflected an earlier version of the figure and therefore was incomplete and had a number of incorrect panel assignments, explaining why negative results appeared to be stated as positive results etc. We have revised all figure legends and taken extra care to explain individual elements, clarify the colour scheme and assign panels correctly.</p><p>Regarding hyperfusion, we argue that elevated rates of fusion (rather than impaired fission) explains the larger branched network morphology because regulators of mitochondrial fusion (<italic>fzo1, mgm1</italic>) are strongly upregulated, whereas genes controlling mitochondrial fission are comparatively static. We have clarified this outside the figure legend (Results and Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My hopes for improvement notwithstanding, I congratulate the authors on some very nice work.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Title: Does mitochondrial function truly &quot;require&quot; inefficient splicing? It seems more likely that the population of the primordial cob and coxI genes by mobile introns was slightly detrimental, which allowed compensatory mutations that resulted in higher cob and coxI expression. If so, these data are consistent with the idea that mobile intron insertions were detrimental and that the host evolved second site mutations to restore cob and coxI expression. Thus, the artificial, forced deletion of the introns then leads to an over-accumulation of cob and coxI (which is the crux of the &quot;lock-in&quot; model). Though semantic, I have a hard time buying that the presence of introns and inefficient splicing are required for mitochondrial function. Instead, one can simply argue that mobile introns are successful parasites that disrupted the cob and coxI genes and that the host &quot;found&quot; a way to overcome the burden of intron insertion. Long story short-I have issues with the words &quot;requires&quot; or (in the Abstract) &quot;is dependent&quot; on inefficient splicing.</p></disp-quote><p>We are in perfect agreement with the reviewer about the likely evolutionary chain of events: One (or several) introns invade <italic>cox1</italic> and <italic>cob</italic>, compromising levels of mature mRNA. This sets the scene for compensatory mutations to arise that upregulate <italic>cox1/cob</italic> expression, allowing the host to overcome the burden of intron insertion. As an incidental consequence, introns become harder to lose because, in the absence of these introns, increased mRNA levels become detrimentally high.</p><p>Clearly, if we designed the system from scratch, introns would not be required for normal mitochondrial function. Thus, when we say “require” we refer not to an absolute requirement, but the current, evolved situation: the fact that inefficient splicing, despite its obvious wastefulness, has become integrated in the process of mitochondrial gene expression.</p><p>We understand the referee’s concern that using “require” (and “is dependent”) might evoke an absolute requirement rather than an evolved state and we have therefore rephrased this to “has become dependent on” (or similar) throughout the manuscript. We hope that this phrasing, although less punchy, better captures the notion of evolutionary lock-in, but we are open to suggestions on how to convey the phenomenon more eloquently.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Results and Discussion section: Does the intron-minus strain, when compared to the wt strain, exhibit a growth defect on non-fermentable carbon sources?</p></disp-quote><p>As we briefly alluded to in the previous version of the manuscript, prior work had already considered how <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> grows on glycerol, a commonly used non-fermentable carbon source (Minczuk et al., 2002; Huang et al., 2005). Minczuk et al., reported easily visible but smaller colonies (for a different nuclear background) using a standard drop test, while Huang et al. did not comment on qualitative differences, simply stating that they found <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> to be Gly+. We carried out our own drop tests for <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic>, <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub>, Mss116<sup>E268K</sup></italic>, and the two control strains on glycerol- and glucose-supplemented medium. All strains were Gly+ and we observed no obvious qualitative differences, in line with the results of Huang et al. The results are consistent with our other phenotypic observations: intron removal (or more efficient splicing) does not terminally compromise mitochondrial function but rather triggers a compensatory stress response, which works pretty well, although quantitative assays do reveal growth and fitness deficits. We now include the results of our drop tests (Supplementary figure 2) and highlight how they support the finding that mitochondria remain functional (Results and Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why is oxygen consumption increased in the intron-minus strain, whereas growth is decreased?</p></disp-quote><p>Oxygen consumption is indicative of metabolic activity but not all of that activity needs to be converted into growth. Increased biogenesis of mitochondria and molecular components involved in the stress response might well explain elevated oxygen consumption in the absence of a concomitant increase in growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Results and Discussion section: idh1 expression is not shown in Figure 2A.</p></disp-quote><p>Idh1 expression is shown in Figure 2A right above cit1 (TCA cycle category).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In general, the figures do not strictly follow the text, which caused me to jump between figures while reading the paper. Can the authors improve the presentation in this regard?</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware that this is not ideal but have struggled to come up with a better solution. The most important consideration for us was having all strains presented alongside each other to allow direct comparisons, especially between <italic>I<sub>0</sub> </italic>and <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic>. We can only do this by either including all the information in one figure (as we currently do) or duplicating information (presenting <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> first and then including the same <italic>I<sub>0</sub> </italic>information in a new <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic> figure), which seems redundant and therefore even less desirable. We hope that this is less of a nuisance once the manuscript has undergone conversion into a more compact format (or can be read online with clickable links to the relevant figures).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Can the authors conduct simple chemostat-type experiments to clearly demonstrate that wt yeast can &quot;out compete&quot; intron-minus and Mss116 over-expression mutant yeast for nutrients in culture-such an experiment would, in my opinion, be more convincing than a growth rate experiment when considering the proposed evolutionary model.</p></disp-quote><p>Even though growth rate measurements often serve as a reasonable proxy for fitness, we agree with reviewer that, given the evolutionary framing, a more direct read-out of differential fitness is desirable. We therefore carried out competition experiments between <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> (a161-U7) and its control strain (a161) as well as between Mss116<sub>OE</sub> and its corresponding empty vector control strain. Prior to the competition, we plated 5x10<sup>Hickey, 1982</sup> cells of each mutant (<italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> or <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic>) strain on YPD agar plates with 200 μg/mL geneticin, followed by a 4-day incubation at 30<sup>o</sup>C, to select for spontaneous geneticin resistance. In doing so, we can subsequently determine relative fitness in a relatively simple fashion using a plating method (rather than, for example, competing in a chemostat and then sequencing barcodes). The two strains to be competed were then grown independently on YPD medium in 2% glucose until saturation. The next day, an equal number of cells from each WT culture (geneticin-sensitive) and each mutant (geneticin-resistant) were mixed in fresh YPD medium, 2% glucose so that each was diluted 200x. In mid-exponential phase, OD 0.4-0.6, aliquots of cells were harvested, and serial dilutions were plated on YPD-agar plates without geneticin. Next, dilutions with between 50 and 200 colonies were replica plated on YPD-agar plates with kanamycin (50 ug/mL). Colonies were counted on both types of plates and the ratio of geneticin-resistant (mutant) to geneticin-sensitive (WT) colonies was calculated as a measure of relative fitness. We include these results as Supplementary figure 1 and mention them in the Results and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Have the authors tested whether the over-expression of cob and coxI RNA lead to higher levels of cob and coxI proteins? For example, an S-35 labeling experiment in the presence of cycloheximide could be very informative in testing whether RNA over-expression leads to protein over-expression. Basically, is it over-expression of cob and coxI RNA and/or over-expression of cob and coxI protein that lead to the observed phenotypes-these points are not clear from my reading of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have determined changes in COB and COX1 protein levels using quantitative label-free mass spectronomy. Both proteins are upregulated in <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> (COX1 11.6-fold, COB 9.3-fold) and <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub></italic> (COX1 12.1-fold, COB 5.0-fold), which is consistent with the idea that the stress phenotype is mediated by excess dosage at the protein level. We include these results in the Materials and methods section. However, we think it is important to stress that elevated protein levels do not directly implicate a protein-level over an RNA-level mechanism. To do so, one would have to specifically reduce <italic>cox1/cob</italic> RNA levels while leaving protein levels unchanged or vice versa. This is currently outside of our capabilities and the reason why – although it is tempting to suggest a protein-centric mechanism – we have confined ourselves to careful speculation in this regard and principally focused our attention on the ultimate cause of the phenotype: altered splicing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Though I appreciate the RNA FISH experiments shown throughout the paper, old-fashioned Northern blots would provide an orthologous means to look at intron accumulation cob and coxI RNA expression, etc. Can the authors consider conducting such experiments to examine transcript/intron accumulation?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that Northern blots would have provided an orthogonal means to understand expression/splicing dynamics. However, we already provide two orthogonal techniques (PCR and RNA FISH). Rather than adding a third, we have instead focused our efforts on carrying out experiments (requested above and below) that can provide new insights rather than additional confirmation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 1: The legend and Figure panels do not agree-please fix.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now fixed this issue.

We now do so (subsection “<italic>Removal of mitochondrial introns is associated with a multi-faceted stress phenotype”</italic> and subsection “Strains and growth conditions”).</p><p>Intronless mitochondria were originally constructed in Gérard Faye’s lab. By generating a series of mitochondrial recombinants between natural yeast isolates that lack individual mitochondrial introns, the authors managed to create a mitochondrial genome completely devoid of introns (Séraphin et al., 1987). This intronless mitochondrial genome has since been transduced into a number of different strains, including a strain known as <italic>a161</italic> (or <italic>ID41-6/161</italic>, or sometimes simply <italic>161</italic>), as described by (Wenzlau et al., 1989). This strain was prominently used by Alan Lambowitz to show that splicing of group I and II introns is Mss116-dependent (Huang et al., 2005). We decided to use this strain so that we could compare our results (regarding growth defects etc.) directly with prior literature. To this end, Alan Lambowitz kindly gifted us two strains: the <italic>a161</italic> strain with the intronless mitochondrial genome (sometimes referred to as <italic>a161-U7</italic>) and the <italic>a161</italic> control strain, whose mitochondrial genome contains the seven <italic>cox1</italic> and five <italic>cob</italic> introns that are also present in the Y258 strain used for Mss116 overexpression (see below). Strains <italic>a161</italic> (WT) and <italic>a161-U7 (I<sub>0</sub></italic>) are isogenic except for the mitochondrial genome and a single marker gene (a161: MATa ade1 lys1; <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic>: MATa ade1 lys1 ura3).</p><p>Mss116 overexpression, on the other hand, was carried out in the Y258 nuclear background, commonly used for overexpression experiments. The three strains we used (WT control, <italic>Mss116<sub>OE</sub>, Mss116<sup>E268K</sup></italic>) are isogenic except for the plasmid, which is either empty, contains Mss116, or the Mss116 ATPase mutant.</p><p>The reason why we ended up using two different nuclear backgrounds is two-fold: first, as already mentioned, we thought it prudent to use the <italic>a161</italic> strain to assess the properties of <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> so we could usefully compare and sanity-check our results against previous work. The second reason is historical. We had previously done some work on Mss116 and already constructed the appropriate strains in the Y258 background.</p><p>The most important thing to highlight here is that each “intervention” (intron deletion or overexpression) has its own, appropriate, isogenic control.</p><p>NB: as evident from the results presented, the two control strains (a161 and Y258) behave very similarly in all phenotypic aspects we considered, but genetic differences might explain, for example, our difficulties in separating mother from daughter cells in the a161 background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are also issues with the figures and legends.

Is there any evidence for mis-splicing and degradation as opposed to just slow splicing?</p></disp-quote><p>We now present a time course of pre-mRNA/mRNA abundance following Mss116 induction that might help to clarify some of these issues (subsection “Cells are stressed because of abnormally efficient transcript maturation”). The time course shows that Mss116 induction dramatically shifts the balance between pre-mRNA and mature mRNA. Prior to induction, mature mRNA levels are low compared to pre-mRNA, implying that only a fraction of pre-mRNAs reaches maturity. Although we agree that Mss116 might affect maturation speed, it is important to highlight that, at steady state, speed per se would not explain differential mRNA abundances – there has to be degradation. How, then, does the presence of introns lead to elevated rates of degradation? Altered kinetics might indeed play a role, i.e. splicing might fail to occur in a timely manner so that the transcript then becomes a target for the mitochondrial degradosome. Alternatively, introns might never be spliced or get spliced imprecisely. When we talked about “mis-splicing” in the manuscript, this should be read to include all the above options (kinetic, failure to splice, incorrect splicing) that can call the degradation machinery into action. We have clarified this in subsection “The effects of intron removal are phenocopied by overexpression of Mss116” and also replaced the word “mis-splicing” with the broader term “failure to splice” throughout the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
