has been to link these genes into molecular pathways. One example is <italic>Myo7a</italic> (myosin VIIA), in which deafness mutations affect the development and function of the mechanically sensitive stereocilia of hair cells. We describe here a procedure for the isolation of low-abundance protein complexes from stereocilia membrane fractions. Using this procedure, combined with identification and quantitation of proteins with mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that MYO7A forms a complex with PDZD7, a paralog of USH1C and DFNB31. MYO7A and PDZD7 interact in tissue-culture cells, and co-localize to the ankle-link region of stereocilia in wild-type but not <italic>Myo7a</italic> mutant mice. Our data thus describe a new paradigm for the interrogation of low-abundance protein complexes in hair cell stereocilia and establish an unanticipated link between MYO7A and PDZD7.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18312.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18312.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18312.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside the inner ear, sensory cells called hair cells detect and respond to sounds and head movements. These cells have a mechanically sensitive structure called the hair bundle, which is made of many thin projections called stereocilia. The stereocilia are linked so that when they bend in response to a sound or head movement, the whole hair bundle moves as one.</p><p>A protein called myosin VIIA (MYO7A) is thought to be involved in forming links at the base of stereocilia (so-called ‘ankle links’) and relaying signals from the stereocilia to the rest of the hair cell. However, it is not known how MYO7A interacts with the proteins that make up the ankle links.</p><p>To address this question. Morgan, Krey et al. developed a new method for isolating groups of proteins from the inner ear of chick embryos that are only found in low quantities. Using this method, it was possible to isolate MYO7A along with other proteins it associates with. One of these proteins – called PDZD7 – is known to be part of ankle links. The next step following on from this work is to use this new method to study other important groups of proteins that are even more scarce in hair bundles.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hair cells are the sensory cells of the inner ear; they transduce mechanical signals evoked by sound and head movement and relay these signals to the central nervous system. The mechanically sensitive organelle responsible for mechanotransduction is the hair bundle, a cluster of ~100 actin-filled stereocilia that protrude apically from a hair cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gillespie and Müller, 2009</xref>). Because stereocilia bend at their bases yet are coupled together with elastic linkages, the bundle pivots as a whole when exposed to mechanical stimuli. One special type of linkage, the tip link, couples bundle pivoting to electrical excitation of the hair cell. The tip link is composed of a dimer of CDH23 (cadherin 23) molecules interacting with a dimer of PCDH15 (protocadherin 15) molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kazmierczak et al., 2007</xref>), and is coupled to the mechanically sensitive transduction channel. Another class of linkage, the ankle link, couples stereocilia together at their bases, transiently in auditory hair cells but persistently in vestibular hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goodyear and Richardson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adato et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McGee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Michalski et al., 2007</xref>). Because many genes encoding proteins known to be associated with these links are affected by mutations that cause deafness, it is of great interest how these links couple with proteins within the stereocilia.</p><p>Myosin VIIA (MYO7A) was the first protein involved in hair-cell mechanotransduction to be identified by genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gibson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weil et al., 1996</xref>). While MYO7A has been implicated in ankle-link positioning by its location in frog stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hasson et al., 1997</xref>) and by mislocalization of ankle-link proteins in <italic>Myo7a</italic>-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Michalski et al., 2007</xref>), more precise localization experiments suggested that MYO7A also participates in mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grati and Kachar, 2011</xref>).</p><p>These differing roles could be reconciled if MYO7A forms several different protein complexes. The tail of MYO7A has two tandem FERM-MyTH4 domains and one SH3 domain, each of which might interact with stereocilia proteins. Biochemical and structural studies have indicated that MYO7A interacts both with PCDH15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Senften et al., 2006</xref>) and with a complex including USH1C, USH1G, and CDH23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boëda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). Preliminary evidence suggests that MYO7A interacts with ADGRV1, which was formerly known as GPR98 and VLGR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hamann et al., 2015</xref>), USH2A (usherin), and DFNB31 (whirlin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delprat et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Michalski et al., 2007</xref>). No interactions of MYO7A have been reported with PDZD7, another member of the ankle-link complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grati et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zou et al., 2014</xref>), and how MYO7A positions the ankle-link complex remains unclear.</p><p>While genetic methods have been successful in identifying essential stereocilia proteins, the approach can miss proteins that are more widely expressed or that can be compensated for by the expression of a paralog. To determine all the proteins present in hair bundles, we have developed biochemical methods for their characterization, coupling purification of bundles using the twist-off method with detection of proteins by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gillespie and Hudspeth, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shin et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">2013</xref>). Because of the fine dissection and tissue manipulation required, however, the twist-off method is limited in its throughput and is less ideal for biochemical experiments examining rare protein-protein complexes in bundles.</p><p>We therefore developed a high-throughput method for stereocilia-membrane enrichment using the monoclonal antibody D10, which allowed us to prepare large amounts of solubilized inner-ear material that is suitable for immunoaffinity purification of protein complexes from stereocilia detergent extracts. We initially used this approach to determine which proteins interact with MYO7A in the inner ear, using the monoclonal antibody 138-1 to show that MYO7A interacts tightly with several scaffolding proteins, notably PDZD7. By immunoprecipitating expressed proteins in tissue-culture cells, we confirmed that the interaction of PDZD7 and MYO7A is direct. Moreover, MYO7A is also in a protein complex including ADGRV1, which likely also includes PDZD7. We also show that USH1C, USH1G, and CDH23 co-precipitate from chick stereocilia with MYO7A, confirming the presence in the tissue of a complex that had only been suggested by genetics and recombinant-protein expression. Because other scaffolding proteins co-precipitate with MYO7A, these experiments show not only that MYO7A contributes to the tip-link and ankle-link complexes, but also suggest that MYO7A participates in other stereocilia protein complexes. Finally, the experiments indicate that the coupled stereocilia-membrane purification and immunoaffinity isolation methods will be useful for isolating even very rare protein complexes from stereocilia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>D10 chick stereocilia membrane preparation</title><p>We enriched stereocilia membranes from chicks using the D10 preparation, named for the monoclonal antibody that is critical for the procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). D10 recognizes PTPRQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goodyear et al., 2003</xref>), the most abundant transmembrane protein of hair bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shin et al., 2013</xref>). As in our previous experiments coupling stereocilia isolation with mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shin et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">2013</xref>), we used E19-E21 chicks because of chicks’ availability, moderate cost, sequenced genome, and near-mature inner ear. In most cases, we treated the exposed surfaces of dissected inner ears with DTSSP, a membrane-impermeable, reversible crosslinker with two N-hydroxysuccinimide groups coupled with an 12 Å spacer that includes a disulfide bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Staros, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">1988</xref>); this treatment stabilizes complexes of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corgiat et al., 2014</xref>), presumably including ankle links and tip links. DTSSP treatment should not affect intracellular protein complexes, however, and is reversed by reduction. If their binding affinity is sufficiently high, cytoplasmic proteins in association with membrane proteins should still be detected, however, even without covalent crosslinking. Because one investigator can comfortably dissect only ~200 ears per day, to allow larger preparations (≥1000 ears), we froze tissues daily after quenching the DTSSP reaction.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18312.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>D10 chick stereocilia-membrane enrichment procedure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow chart for stereocilia membrane enrichment.

We used antibodies to ATP2B2, the plasma-membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump of stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dumont et al., 2001</xref>), to locate fractions containing stereocilia membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Tissues were homogenized, subjected to differential centrifugation to remove nuclei (yielding fraction S1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and dense organelles were sedimented on top of a sucrose pad). In pilot experiments, we subjected the post-nuclear supernatant to fractionation using discontinuous equilibrium sucrose gradients; most of the ATP2B2 and hence the stereocilia membranes sedimented to the top of the 1.8 M sucrose layer. In large-scale experiments, we layered the post-nuclear supernatant on a cushion of 2.2 M sucrose, centrifuged to equilibrium, and collected material at the interface (fraction P2).</p><p>Stereocilia membranes were captured using magnetic beads coupled with D10 (fraction M3). We labeled beads with the antibody at high density, which facilitated efficient binding to stereocilia and enrichment with a magnet. Because stereocilia were present at extremely low concentrations in the extract, however, there was a large excess of antibody-coupled beads over stereocilia membranes. As a consequence, substantial amounts of non-stereocilia protein bound nonspecifically to the beads. While phalloidin staining showed that many of the D10 beads were decorated with stereocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), nuclei and other contaminants were also associated with the beads, presumably nonspecifically. Membranes were eluted using sonication (fraction S4); they were then washed several times prior to detergent extraction, yielding enriched stereocilia membranes (fraction P6). We solubilized protein complexes using RIPA buffer, a stringent buffer that contains both SDS and deoxycholate; the final solution, fraction S7, was used for subsequent immunoaffinity purification steps.</p><p>We examined the purification fractions using silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and immunoblotting of marker proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Very little total protein bound to the D10 beads (M3), and cytosolic (HSPA5, PITPNA1), nuclear (LMNB1), mitochondrial (MDH2), and plasma-membrane (ATP1A1) proteins were largely absent from D10 eluates (S4). A modest amount of the endoplasmic reticulum marker CANX was visible in the final RIPA-solubilized fraction (S7), however, as was the supporting-cell antigen PTPRJ. Nearly all of the ATP2B2 was detected in S7, however, showing that stereocilia membranes were efficiently solubilized.</p><p>In quantitative immunoblotting experiments, we found that the total amount of actin and ATP2B2 per ear, as compared to the amount in a single utricle, was much higher in the D10 stereocilia membrane preparation than in the twist-off hair-bundle preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This elevated level of stereocilia protein derived in part from sampling seven organs (cochlea, lagena, utricle, saccule, and three semicircular canals) rather than just one. Contaminating ATP1A1 from the basolateral membrane was detectable in the D10 preparation, but at modest levels compared to that in one utricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

With the exception of KIAA1211, which was not detected in the shotgun experiments, all of these stereocilia membrane proteins were enriched as the preparation proceeded or were found only in fraction S7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>To determine in an unbiased way whether stereocilia membranes increased in relative abundance, we calculated a slope for each protein of the preparation across the fractions where we expected enrichment (S1, P2, M3, P6, and S7). Of the 3036 proteins detected in at least four of the six fractions, PTPRQ had the largest 'enrichment slope' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The MYO3A-MYO3B group, with a somewhat steeper slope, was only detected in three fractions. SLC34A2 was highly enriched, as was XIRP2; while the function of the latter protein is poorly understood, it does localize to the membrane-cytoskeleton interface in stereocilia and could bind membranes itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Francis et al., 2015</xref>). Many other proteins enriched in the D10 preparation have annotated transmembrane domains, although some of these proteins likely derive from membranes other than those of stereocilia. Other proteins were known stereocilia proteins (ESPN, ANKRD24, MYO1H). Although ATP2B2 is part of a protein group also containing ATP2B1 and ATP2B4, which are not located in stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dumont et al., 2001</xref>), we estimated ATP2B2’s contribution to the ATP2B1/2/4 group riBAQ value for each fraction; we divided the intensities from peptides only found in each isoform by the sum of all isoform-specific peptides, generating the fractional contribution for each isoform. After making this adjustment, ATP2B2 was also one of the most enriched proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Gene ontology analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gene Ontology Consortium, 2015</xref>) using DAVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Huang et al., 2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2009a</xref>) indicated that the ten most enriched GO terms in S7 relative to S1 referred to membranes, mitochondria, or plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>); the latter term was most highly enriched in the last enrichment fraction (p=3 × 10<sup>–6</sup>). Similarly, 'membrane' is the most highly enriched (p=3 × 10<sup>–37</sup>) keyword from the Protein Information Resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, the steeper the enrichment slope, the more likely a protein was annotated as containing a transmembrane helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken together, our analysis shows that the D10 preparation substantially enriches membranes, especially stereocilia membranes, reducing protein complexity so that additional affinity purification steps can be used to identify protein complexes of stereocilia membranes.</p><p>The most abundant membrane proteins in S7 were either from the plasma membrane (e.g., ATP1A1, at riBAQ = 1.1 × 10<sup>–2</sup>) or mitochondrial membranes (e.g., ATP5A1, at riBAQ = 1.1 × 10<sup>–2</sup>). In comparison, ATP2B2, marking stereocilia membranes, was present at riBAQ = 0.7 × 10<sup>–2</sup>. In frog stereocilia, ATP2B2 and ATP1A1 each have membrane densities of ~3000 µm<sup>−2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamoah et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burnham and Stirling, 1984</xref>); in rat liver mitochondria, ATP5A1 has a density of ~7500 µm<sup>−2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwerzmann et al., 1986</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that stereocilia membranes account for ~5% of the solubilized membrane material in S7.</p><p>We used cluster analysis with mclust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fraley and Raftery, 2002</xref>), a model-based hierarchical clustering algorithm that allows estimation of the best number of clusters for a dataset, to determine which proteins shared behavior across the stereocilia enrichment procedure. Using only proteins that were reproducibly detected across the preparation, mclust indicated that 25 clusters were appropriate for the normalized data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). To determine which of these clusters were preferentially enriched in the D10 preparation, we applied a linear fit to the data from the sequential enrichment fractions (S1, P1, M3, P6, and S7). Cluster 8 had the greatest enrichment slope, and not surprisingly, it contained both PTPRQ and ATP2B2, as well as XIRP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>We also used targeted proteomics to confirm that proteins of interest were enriched in the D10 preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–I</xref>).

To confirm that the assays measured the peptide of interest, we spiked in heavy-labeled standard peptides; we also matched MS2 spectra collected during peaks to the protein of interest. Using this approach, we determined that PTPRQ was enriched between S1 and S7 by around 50-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>); the enrichment of ATP2B2 was less, perhaps because substantial amounts were located in hair-cell somas.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Immunoaffinity purification of MYO7A complexes from chick stereocilia</title><p>We sought to identify tight membrane complexes containing MYO7A.

Although a MYO7A-USH1C-USH1G-CDH23 complex has been inferred from cell-culture and complex reconstitution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boëda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2011</xref>), no evidence has been presented to date for direct association of these proteins in the inner ear. When we immunoprecipitated MYO7A from stereocilia S7 detergent extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and examined eluates using immunoblotting, we detected both a significant amount of USH1C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and a small amount of CDH23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) in the immunoprecipitates.</p><p>Because MYO7A and its interacting proteins should be highly enriched by the 138-1 antibody from the starting material, we analyzed immunoaffinity purification experiments using shotgun mass-spectrometry, comparing the relative abundance of each protein in the 138-1 eluate and in the stereocilia RIPA extract. This ratio—the immunoaffinity enrichment—will be high for MYO7A itself and for proteins that specifically coprecipitated with MYO7A. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows all proteins detected in the experiment, with those detected only in the 138-1 immunoprecipitate or in S7 segregated from those detected in both. For proteins detected in both fractions, the presence of a protein to the left and above the unity line (dashed) indicates that it is enriched; as expected, MYO7A itself was highly enriched (~10<sup>4</sup>-fold). The statistical significance, adjusted for the false-discovery rate (FDR), is indicated in a volcano plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). MYO7A and PDZD7 were not only highly enriched, but the enrichment was highly significant statistically (p=3 × 10<sup>–8</sup> and p=2 × 10<sup>–5</sup>).</p><p>We examined the proteins that were detected at least 4/6 times in the 138-1 runs and that were not detected in the control IgG eluates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Remarkably, most of the most highly enriched proteins have been previously detected as key hair-bundle proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shin et al., 2013</xref>); these include myosin motors MYO3B, MYO1H, and MYO6; actin-associated proteins ESPN, LMO7, FSCN2, and GRXCR1; and scaffolding proteins PDZD7 and GIPC3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Two other scaffolding proteins, SORBS1 and SORBS2, were also detected. Myosins apparently are not associated by binding to co-purifying actin filaments; actin was present at a low stoichiometry relative to MYO7A (&lt;1 mol/mol), indicating that the concentration of filaments was very low. Moreover, treatment of immunoprecipitated material with 5 mM Mg•ATP did not release the other myosins from MYO7A complexes. We also noted the presence of multiple calmodulin-related proteins, including MYL4, CALML4, MYL1, and CALM itself; these molecules are candidate light chains for MYO7A or co-precipitating myosins. In these shotgun experiments, we did not detect USH1G or CDH23 in 138-1 samples; we did, however, detect USH1C in 138-1 eluate, albeit only in 2/6 runs.</p><p>PDZD7 was highly enriched along with MYO7A; both were present in the 138-1 immunoaffinity purification at relative concentrations &gt;1000-fold higher than in S7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). While the calculated stoichiometry of PDZD7 relative to MYO7A was low (~1%), PDZD7 was present in the stereocilia membrane extract at a far lower level than MYO7A. Indeed, a large fraction of the PDZD7 (~20%) was precipitated from the extract, indicating that many PDZD7 molcules were present in MYO7A complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). PDZD7 has been localized to the ankle links (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grati et al., 2012</xref>), where it is essential for localization of protein complexes containing ADGRV1, USH2A, and DFNB31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zou et al., 2014</xref>). Depending on the splice form, PDZD7 has two or three PDZ domains, and is a paralog of both USH1C and DFNB31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ebermann et al., 2010</xref>). An interaction of PDZD7 with MYO7A has not been reported previously, although the interactions of MYO7A with USH1C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boëda et al., 2002</xref>) and DFNB31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delprat et al., 2005</xref>) suggest that the MYO7A-PDZD7 complex is plausible.</p><p>Containing five ankyrin domains, ANKRD24 is enriched in chick and mouse hair bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wilmarth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Krey et al., 2015</xref>); little else is known about ANKRD24, although it is a hair-cell-specific protein in the chick ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ku et al., 2014</xref>).

We developed assays not only for several proteins detected in the shotgun experiments, but also for other proteins predicted to be in MYO7A complexes at tip links and ankle links. These experiments used heavy-labeled standard peptides to confirm retention times and daughter-ion patterns, and we also matched MS2 spectra to peaks to confirm the assays’ veracity. Three biological replicates of 500 chick ears were used, with two technical replicates from each. Each peptide was analyzed in two or three of the biological replicates, yielding 4–6 total replicates for each.

For example, we detected daughter ions of the MYO7A peptide TTLTDSATTAK in 138-1 but not control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, left); this peak was identified definitively by matching an MS2 spectrum obtained during the peak to MYO7A in the database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, middle). This peptide was also detected in the extract used as the starting material (total; not shown). We examined four peptides, each of which displayed roughly equivalent levels of intensity in 138-1 immunoprecipitates as compared to totals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, right). Because the amount of material loaded in total samples (~2 ear-equivalents) was much less than loaded for the immunoprecipitation samples (~100 ear-equivalents), the y-axis reflects neither recovery nor enrichment but is useful for relative comparison of different proteins.</p><p>As in the shotgun proteomics experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), MYO6 was readily detected in the eluates of 138-1 immunoprecipitates but not in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Although a smaller fraction of MYO6 in the S7 extract was precipitated as compared to MYO7A (right panels), MYO6 was &gt;10-fold more abundant in the extract than MYO7A, suggesting that MYO6 and MYO7A could be present in a nearly equimolar complex. GIPC3 and ANKRD24 were also specifically precipitated using the 138-1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>).</p><p>Finally, targeted proteomics allowed us to confirm that USH1G is in a complex with MYO7A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>), as is USH1C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Our targeted proteomics assay for CDH23 was unfortunately not sensitive enough to detect it in the 138-1 eluates. Our combined immunoblotting and targeted proteomics data thus indicates that a MYO7A complex in stereocilia with USH1C, USH1G, and—probably—CDH23 is plausible.</p><p>Other proteins known to be located in ankle links also co-precipitated with MYO7A. While we did detect ADGRV1 and DFNB31 in 138-1 immunoprecipitates by shotgun proteomics, their inconsistent appearance (identified in only two of six mass-spectrometry runs each) prevented us from definitively concluding that they were in a complex with MYO7A. To provide stronger evidence that MYO7A forms a protein complex with PDZD7 and ADGRV1, we used targeted proteomics to determine how much of each protein was precipitated by 138-1 anti-MYO7A or control immunoaffinity beads. PDZD7 was present at significantly greater levels in 138-1 precipitations than in control precipitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), confirming its specific precipitation with MYO7A. By contrast, only one peptide for ADGRV1 showed significant enrichment in 138-1 immunoprecipitates compared to controls, and the fraction precipitated was very small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). We suggest that PDZD7:MYO7A complexes are more abundant than ones containing ADGRV1, or that ADGRV1 binds less tightly than PDZD7.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Interaction of mouse MYO7A and PDZD7 in tissue-culture cells</title><p>To confirm that PDZD7 interacts directly with MYO7A and extend the results to mammals, we co-expressed mouse or human proteins in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated GFP-MYO7A with the 138-1 monoclonal antibody.

The MYO7A-PDZD7 stoichiometry was high, as the majority of the PDZD7 was immunoprecipitated.

Unfortunately, each inner ear has only a few thousand hair cells, which constitute &lt;1% of the total cell mass of the ear, and hair bundles make up only ~1% of the protein in a hair cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Krey et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, many of the most interesting proteins of the bundle, like those involved in mechanotransduction, are present at very low copy numbers per stereocilium; for example, there are only a few hundred MYO7A molecules for the 400,000 actin molecules in an average stereocilium (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Thus, while biochemical characterization of protein complexes is essential for unraveling bundle function, the challenges of low absolute and relative protein abundance have hitherto prevented large-scale complex isolation from stereocilia.</p><p>By scaling up to hundreds to thousands of chicken ears per preparation and by exploiting monoclonal antibodies specific for stereocilia proteins, we were able to use biochemical methods to characterize protein complexes from stereocilia membranes of hair cells. We demonstrated the utility of the D10 enrichment method by examining protein complexes that include MYO7A. While our strategy does not yield purified MYO7A complexes, as they are too scarce in the stereocilia-membrane extract, we identified candidates for complex members based on each protein’s stoichiometry relative to MYO7A, immunoaffinity enrichment, and statistical significance of that enrichment.</p><p>Several potential roles have been ascribed to MYO7A, but it has not been clear how this motor protein can carry out disparate functions like positioning ankle links and controlling transduction. Our results show that MYO7A interacts with several scaffolding proteins, which suggests that different MYO7A complexes may simultaneously mediate several functions. We have focused here on PDZD7, which is essential for the formation of the ankle-link protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ebermann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grati et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2014</xref>) and requires MYO7A for localization to ankle links. We also showed that MYO7A is present in inner ear tissue in the predicted complexes with USH1C, USH1G, and CDH23. Our results thus demonstrate that it is indeed possible to characterize mechanotransduction using biochemical methods, which complement genetics, physiology, and microscopy methods.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Protein complex purification from stereocilia membranes</title><p>Our original hair-bundle isolation method, which uses agarose to embed and excise the bundles, yields stereocilia that are &gt;90% pure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gillespie and Hudspeth, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Krey et al., 2015</xref>). Considerable fine dissection is required, however, to prepare the inner-ear organs and clean up the agarose-embedded hair bundles; these steps make the daily throughput of bundles relatively low. In addition, the agarose matrix that extricates bundles complicates subsequent steps, such as detergent extraction of membrane proteins. While protein complexes can be detected by immunoprecipitation using the twist-off method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamoah et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hill et al., 2006b</xref>), the D10 purification strategy is far better for obtaining large amounts of stereocilia-membrane material that is suitable for complex extraction and purification (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The D10 preparation has significant contamination, however; we estimate that stereocilia membranes account for only ~5% of the RIPA-solubilized material. Other membranes are present in part because contaminating intracellular organelles are disrupted by a freeze-thaw cycle, preventing their precise separation from stereocilia based on distinct, uniform sedimentation properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cox and Emili, 2006</xref>). Many of the most important stereocilia proteins are present at vanishingly small levels, however, so for stereocilia membrane enrichment, we chose to maximize total recovery of stereocilia membrane protein rather than purity. Immunoaffinity purification, especially with high-affinity monoclonal antibodies, allows tremendous enrichment, even if multiple affinity enrichment steps are ultimately needed for some stereocilia protein complexes.</p><p>We stabilized protein complexes of the stereocilia using chemical crosslinking with membrane-impermeant crosslinker DTSSP, which should enhance our ability to detect low-abundance membrane protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vasilescu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gokhale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corgiat et al., 2014</xref>). By using DTSSP, we were able to use stringent extraction and washing conditions, minimizing the dissociation of protein complexes that included extracellular domains. Because the disulfide bond in DTSSP can be split by treating samples with a strong reducing agent prior to immunoblotting or mass spectrometry, we were able to examine proteins associated with MYO7A.</p><p>Were all proteins precipitated in our experiments with the 138-1 antibody in specific complexes with MYO7A? Probably not. While DTSSP should not penetrate into cells and hence artifactually crosslink nearby proteins, it is possible that trace amounts of large cytoskeletal complexes are purified with the immunoaffinity procedure. Subsequent validation of interactions detected, for example showing co-immunoprecipitation, protein-protein binding, or mislocalization in mutant hair cells, is thus of high importance.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Association of MYO7A with PDZD7 and other ankle-link components</title><p>Our data show that MYO7A interacts with PDZD7, a key ankle-link component. Originally identified as a modifier gene for Usher syndrome type 2 genes, <italic>PDZD7</italic> has more recently been identified as a nonsyndromic deafness gene itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Booth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vona et al., 2016</xref>). Genetics experiments showed that positioning of ADGRV1 at ankle links depends critically on PDZD7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zou et al., 2014</xref>); consistent with those results, PDZD7 binds directly to ADGRV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Our experiments suggest how this positioning might occur; PDZD7 could bind to MYO7A, and then MYO7A could transport the PDZD7-ADGRV1 complex to its final location. While present at lower levels than PDZD7, we did detect ADGRV1 in co-immunoprecipitates with MYO7A by both shotgun and targeted mass spectrometry; our experiments do not reveal, however, whether all three are simultaneously in the same protein complex.</p><p>PDZD7 requires functional MYO7A for localization to ankle links. MYO7A is also required for localization of ADGRV1; while MYO7A might bind directly to ADGRV1, the necessity of PDZD7 for the formation of the ankle-link complex suggests that MYO7A localizes both PDZD7 and ADGRV1 at ankle links. Association of MYO7A with ankle-link proteins explains the early observation that MYO7A concentrates at the ankle-link region of vestibular stereocilia of mature frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hasson et al., 1997</xref>) and cochlea stereocilia of immature mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Senften et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lëfevre et al., 2008</xref>). Positioning at this location by MYO7A is surprising, however, as the ankle links are very close to the pointed ends of the filaments located at the periphery of the stereocilia actin core. We suggest three possible explanations. First, because MYO7A moves from pointed to barbed ends of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Inoue and Ikebe, 2003</xref>), MYO7A may move PDZD7 and ADGRV1 towards stereocilia tips but stall if the N-terminal, extracellular end of ADGRV1 was anchored on the adjacent stereocilium. In this case, MYO7A would put ankle links under tension, which could also explain the frequent oblique positioning of the links (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goodyear and Richardson, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">1999</xref>). Second, MYO7A could hand off PDZD7 to MYO6 anywhere in the stereocilium; because MYO6 moves towards pointed ends of actin filaments, it would properly localize the ankle-link proteins at stereocilia bases. Indeed, MYO6 is thought to move PTPRQ to the taper region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sakaguchi et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, MYO7A and MYO6 may be in a multimolecular, bidirectional motor complex; like with other bidirectional motor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hancock, 2014</xref>), reciprocal regulation of the two motors could steer the complex to the top or bottom of the stereocilia. Indeed, MYO6 was the most abundant protein co-precipitated with MYO7A, and we are presently investigating the specificity of this interaction. Regardless of the mechanism, the data here show that MYO7A binds PDZD7 and is necessary for at least one step in its localization at the base of the hair bundle.</p><p>It is notable that the paralogs PDZD7, USH1C, and DFNB31 are all deafness genes and interact with MYO7A. Moreover, PDZD7 and DFNB31 both homodimerize and form heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2014</xref>); USH1C homodimerizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Siemens et al., 2002</xref>), but whether it can heterodimerize with PDZD7 or DFNB31 is unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Other molecules co-precipitated with MYO7A</title><p>Several other proteins are specifically co-precipitated with MYO7A; those with high enrichment and relatively high stoichiometry include MYO6, MYL4, COLEC12, ANKRD24, GIPC3, and MYL1. Although each of these will require in-depth characterization such as we have done here for PDZD7, we can speculate to their possible roles in hair cells. MYL1 and MYL4 are myosin light chains, and may substitute for CALM in binding to one or more IQ domains in MYO7A (or MYO6). The presence of MYO6 is quite interesting, as it could mediate pointed-end-directed motility in a complex that also contains a barbed-end-direct motor. More specific investigation of how MYO6 and MYO7A interact will be required; our preliminary co-expression experiments indicated only a low-stoichiometry interaction when both were expressed together in HEK cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). A relatively large fraction of ANKRD24 present in the stereocilia-membrane extract was co-precipitated, yet ANKRD24 did not appear to bind directly to MYO7A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Presumably ANKRD24 interacts with MYO7A via other proteins, indicating that a larger MYO7A complex may be present that warrants further study. Other proteins were highly enriched but less abundant, including MYO3B, MYO1H, ESPN, LMO7, FSCN2, and GRXCR1. All of these proteins interact with the actin cytoskeleton, and it is likely that some of them co-precipitate because of their association with substoichiometric levels of actin filaments also bound to MYO7A. Future experiments will be needed to discern which of these proteins interacts specifically with MYO7A complexes and which co-precipitate on associated actin.</p><p>A fraction of the MYO7A derived from enriched membranes was bound to USH1C and USH1G, and likely had bound CDH23 as well. While our experiments were not designed to accurately measure stoichiometry of MYO7A complexes, the data were nonetheless consistent with a roughly equimolar complex of the three proteins. This MYO7A-USH1C-USH1G complex was not necessarily the tip-link complex itself, as MYO7A could simply transport the scaffolding proteins to the correct location at stereocilia tips, hand off the complex to CDH23, then dissociate. Notably, CDH23 does not depend on MYO7A for localization in hair bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Senften et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boëda et al., 2002</xref>), although USH1C does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boëda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lëfevre et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that the cadherin and scaffolding proteins are transported separately. This interpretation is consistent with our determination that only a very small fraction of CDH23 was in a complex with MYO7A.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>MYO7A function in stereocilia</title><p>Unconventional myosins like MYO7A participate in transport, anchoring, tension sensing, actin organization, and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hartman et al., 2011</xref>). Given the substantial number of scaffolding proteins found with MYO7A, it is reasonable to conclude that the motor transports various proteins towards stereocilia tips. Nevertheless, consistent localization at ankle links and tip links suggests that MYO7A may also anchor protein complexes and sense tension applied to them. Furthermore, examination of <italic>Myo7a<sup>8J/8J</sup></italic> hair bundles indicates clearly that both their actin organization and stereocilia adhesion are disrupted. The division of MYO7A’s tasks into several categories is thus misleading, as those activities likely all overlap—MYO7A is a multifunctional protein, interacting with several different protein complexes in stereocilia and carrying out transport and functional roles. Our hypothesis is that knowing the composition of MYO7A complexes is an essential step in understanding the function of this motor in stereocilia.</p><p>Our experiments are designed to provide a rough estimate of the abundance of proteins present in MYO7A complexes. To accurately measure the stoichiometry of the detected complexes, additional purification will be required. We can identify co-precipitating proteins using enrichment analysis, but despite a nearly 10,000-fold purification of MYO7A, the immunoaffinity eluates have many proteins that have bound nonspecifically. This result is entirely expected; the proteins that interact with MYO7A are rare within stereocilia, so MYO7A protein complexes are present at extremely small levels in the stereocilia detergent extract. In addition, because of their low levels, extensive washing of MYO7A immunoprecipitates is required, biasing our analysis towards high-affinity interactions. Future studies that use a second antibody purification step following precipitation with 138-1, for example with an anti-PDZD7 antibody, will be needed to generate a more pure complex that can be interrogated for additional binding partners and stoichiometries of each component. Such experiments will likely require further scaling up of the starting material, given the likely losses during purification. Nevertheless, there is great value in large-scale purification of protein complexes from stereocilia, as these experiments will allow us to identify interacting components—like those in the transduction-channel complex—that may not be detected by any other strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Nomenclature</title><p>All proteins are referred to by their official gene symbols, all capitals (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org">http://www.uniprot.org</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genecards.org">http://www.genecards.org</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/gene.shtml#ps">http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/gene.shtml#ps</ext-link>).

Chromatographic and spectral data from RAW files were loaded into Skyline and manually analyzed to determine fragment ion peaks corresponding to each peptide. RAW files were also processed using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) software in order to match MS/MS spectra to an Ensembl spectral database using Sequest HT. Fragment ion peaks for each peptide were chosen according to the following criteria: 1) three or more co-eluting fragment ions contributed to the peak signal, 2) at least two or more data points were collected across the peak, and 3) one or more spectra within the peak were matched to correct peptide sequence within the spectral database. If spectra within a specific sample were not identified then a) the retention time of the chosen peak must be within 2 min of the retention time of an identified peak for that peptide from another sample and b) the type of daughter ions contributing to the peak must match the identified peptide peak from another sample. If no peak matching these criteria was found in a particular sample the peak area was counted as zero. Chromatographic peak areas from all detected fragment ions for each peptide were integrated and summed to give a final peptide peak area.

Briefly, for each MYO7A peptide, the intensity for a given experiment was divided by the average of all experiments for that peptide.

The area for each peptide analyzed was then divided by the appropriate experiment normalization factor.

Plasmid clones encoding the chimeric protein were selected and fully sequenced; clone M107 was used in this study.</p><p>COS7 cells were transfected using JetPrime transfection reagent (Mirus Bio LLC, Madison, WI) at 30–50% confluence. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grati and Kachar, 2011</xref>) using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope equipped with a 63X, 1.4 NA objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Immunocytochemistry in inner ear</title><p>Mouse strains were C57BL/6 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link>), as well as heterozygote and homozygote <italic>Myo7a8J</italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:2182923">MGI:2182923</ext-link>). Inner ears from postnatal day eight (P8) mice were removed and fixed for 3 hr in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS). Ears were rinsed with PBS, and utricles were incubated in 50 µg/ml protease XXVII (Sigma) for 10 min to remove otolithic membranes. Organ of Corti tissues were dissected from the inner ears and the lateral wall was removed. Organs were rinsed 2 times in PBS, permeabilized for 10 min in 0.5% Triton-X in PBS, and blocked for 1 hr in PBS containing 5% normal donkey serum and 1% bovine serum albumin. Utricles were incubated overnight at 4°C in blocking solution containing primary antibodies. After three 5–10 min washes in PBS, utricles were incubated for 3 hr at room temperature in blocking solution containing donkey anti-mouse IgG AlexaFluor 488 (Invitrogen, 1:1000) or donkey anti-rabbit IgG AlexaFluor 488 (Invitrogen, 1:1000) secondary antibodies and CF633 Phalloidin (Biotium, Fremont, CA; 1:500). Utricles were washed 3 times for 10 min each in PBS, post-fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min, rinsed twice with PBS and then mounted with VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) on slides with 0.12 mm Secure-Seal spacers (Thermo Fisher Scientific #S-24737).</p><p>Cochlea images were acquired using a 100X, 1.46 NA Plan-Apochromat objective on a Zeiss Elyra PS.1 system that reconstructs super-resolution images from a series of images acquired under spatially structured illumination (SIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gustafsson, 2000</xref>). Images were processed for SIM reconstruction in Zen 2012 (Zeiss) and three-dimensional projections of each z-stack were visualized and converted into TIFF files using the 'Surpass' mode and 'Snapshot' tool on Biplane Imaris 7.</p><p>Utricle images were acquired using either standard confocal microscopy or Airyscan processing on a Zeiss LSM780 or LSM880 with Airyscan using a Plan-Apochromat 63X, 1.4 NA objective. Airyscan processing was carried out using Zen 2012 (Zeiss). All z-stacks were processed using Bitplane Imaris 7. Three dimensional projections of each z-stack were visualized using the 'Surpass' mode and were cropped along the x or y dimension to include one row of hair cells using the 'Crop 3D' tool. The cropped 3D projection was then rotated in Surpass mode to visualize a y-z or x-z slab of the stack with the hair bundles oriented vertically and the 'Snapshot' tool was used to generate a tiff image of the projection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Stereocilia isolation on glass</title><p>Utricles were dissected and otoconia were removed with an eyelash. Square #1.5 glass coverslips (Corning) were washed with water and 70% ethanol, then autoclaved; they were then coated with 100 µg/ml poly-L-lysine for 10–20 min. Poly-L-lysine was removed and coverslips dried for 30–60 min. Dissected utricles were dropped onto the coverslips in dissection media and gently pressed to the coverslip with the hair bundle side down. The utricle and dissection solution was then removed and 200 µl of 4% formaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS was added to each coverslip for 20 min. Coverslips were rinsed three times with PBS and then placed on top of a petri dish lid inside a humidity chamber. Samples were permeabilized for 15 min in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% normal donkey serum in PBS, and blocked for 1 hr in 5% normal donkey serum in PBS. Coverslips were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution, then rinsed 3x for 10 min each. Coverslips were then incubated for 3–4 hr in blocking solution with donkey AlexaFluor 488, 568 and/or 647 (1:1000, Invitrogen) secondary antibodies (unless primary antibody was directly labeled) and 0.4 U/ml Alexa Fluor 568 Phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) or CF633 Phalloidin (Biotium, 1:500) followed by three 10-min rinses with PBS. Coverslips were rinsed briefly in water; excess water was blotted on a paper towel, then coverslips were mounted on slides using EverBrite mounting medium (Biotium).</p><p>Isolated stereocilia images were acquired using a 100X, 1.46 NA Plan-Apochromat objective on the Zeiss Elyra PS.1 system. Images were processed for SIM reconstruction in Zen 2012 (Zeiss) and selected Z-planes were exported as tiff images in Biplane Imaris 7. For the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, the line tool was used in Fiji to draw a line from the taper of each indicated stereocilium to its tip; the line was approximately the width of the stereocilia shafts. 'Plot Profile' was used to determine the pixel intensity along each stereocilium. In Excel, the profiles were aligned at the tapers, then all 11 profiles were averaged. Because each stereocilium is of a different length, only the taper and shaft regions are in alignment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>In utero electroporation</title><p>In utero electroporation was carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ebrahim et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, C57BL/6 males were crossed to CD1 females to generate embryos for transuterine microinjection. Pregnant females with E11.5 embryos were anesthetized with Nembutal (60–65 µg/gram body weight) in a 20.8 mg/ml MgSO4, 10% ethanol, and 40% propylene glycol. The uterine horn was exposed using a ventral laparotomy and embryos were visualized and positioned using a low-intensity halogen light. A microinjection pipette, backfilled with concentrated DNA plasmid (&gt;3 µg/µl), was secured in place in a pipette holder coupled to a Picospritzer III microinjector. The micropipette was inserted into the otocyst, and compressed nitrogen was used to deliver the inoculum. A square wave electroporator (Protech International CUY21SC) was then used to deliver a pulse of 60–100 mA to the injected embryo. Once the transuterine and electroporation steps were complete, the abdominal wall was closed using an absorbable suture. Immunocytochemistry was carried out as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Injectoporation in inner ear</title><p>Experiments were performed essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). The organ of Corti was isolated from P3 mice and placed in DMEM/F12 medium with 1.5 µg/ml ampicillin. For electroporation, glass electrodes (2 µm diameter) were used to deliver plasmid (500 ng/µl in 1x HBSS) to the sensory epithelium. A series of three pulses was applied; pulses were at 1 sec intervals with a magnitude of 60 V and duration of 15 msec (ECM 830 square wave electroporator; BTX). The tissue was fixed after two days in culture and stained with phalloidin; the mCherry signal was directly imaged for PDZD7.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We received support from the following core facilities: mass spectrometry from the OHSU Proteomics Shared Resource (partial support from NIH core grants P30 EY010572 &amp; P30 CA069533; Orbitrap Fusion S10 OD012246), hybridoma cell culture and antibody production from the VGTI Monoclonal Antibody Core (OHSU), and confocal microscopy from the OHSU Advanced Light Microscopy Core @ The Jungers Center.

the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript &quot; PDZD7-MYO7A complex identified in enriched stereocilia membranes&quot; to <italic>eLife</italic>. The manuscript has been reviewed by three expert reviewers, and their assessments together with my own, forms the basis of this letter. I am also including the three reviews in their original form at the end of this letter, as there are many specific and useful suggestions in them that will not be repeated in the summary here. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: William Brownell (Reviewer #2); Anthony J Ricci (Reviewer #3).</p><p>All of the reviewers were impressed with the technical prowess of your experiments. Inner ear proteomics is not for the faint of heart.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>Barr-Gillespie and colleagues have pioneered a proteomics approach to understand the molecular composition of the hair-cell stereocilia. Until now, this has revealed the total proteome but not discrete molecular complexes. Here, they use a purification protocol to cross-link proteins, pull down membranes with an antibody to an abundant membrane protein, and then specifically isolate proteins associated with MYO7A using a secondary immunoprecipitation. The paper illustrates the power of the method, but also how very difficult it is to do biochemistry at this scale. Even if few will have the courage to follow this path, the paper is an important contribution both to the technology and to the specific molecular understanding of stereocilia. As submitted, the paper is very complete with only few areas for polishing.</p><p>Results section, subsection “Immunoaffinity purification of MYO7A complexes from chick stereocilia” and Discussion: Although the DTSSP step will crosslink some proteins that are only mildly associated, it seems surprising that the 138-1 runs pull down so many proteins (MYO3B, MYO1H, MYO6, ESPN, LMO7, FSCN2, GRXCR1, GIPC3) and it seems unlikely that all are part of MYO7A complexes. The Discussion could be expanded to dwell a bit more on how to distinguish real from spurious associations.</p><p>Discussion section, subsection “Other molecules co-precipitated with MYO7A”: MYO7A would put ankle links under tension only if just one end moved. But the other end is presumably also associated with MYO7A.</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>The rationale for the study is that MYO7A may target the ankle link region of the stereocilia bundle because of interactions with specific proteins. The number of molecules involved in these interactions is very small and the interacting proteins would not be seen with traditional screens. The premise is that a high throughput screen of 1000s of stereociliar bundles may yield sufficient material for mass spectroscopic determination of candidate interacting proteins. The bulk of the manuscript is a presentation of the protocol used to accomplish the identification of PDZD7 as a potential interaction protein. The identification is verified using immunohistochemical labeling in culture cells and hair cells. The manuscript is essentially a methods paper with extraordinary expository power. The writing is spellbinding and held my interest throughout even though I do not totally understand the reason for each branch of the flow diagram describing the experimental design.</p><p>The rationale is somewhat slippery. Even though MYO7A is a deafness gene known to be essential for mechanotransduction, its function in the ankle links region is far from understood.

This method requires less surgical and physical separation of hair bundles but rather relies on pulling hair bundle stereocilia from homogenized inner ear tissue by targeting D10 antibody affinity of the stereocilia. Membrane proteins were targeted and stabilized using treatment with DTSSP a reversible crosslinker. Biochemical and proteomic methods were used to isolate, purify, enrich and identify stereocilia proteins and specifically the interacting partners of Myo7A. Overall this work provides good evidence supporting the ability of this new method to isolate stereociliary proteins as well as to investigate protein clustering. There are a couple of issues that could be addressed to make the significance of the work more clear both methodologically and biologically.</p><p>1) A more direct comparison to the twist off method would be helpful in terms of sensitivity, i.e. what is the lowest level of protein that you might identify between these technologies. What was the level of enrichment comparatively between the methods? What is the level of protein retrieval (i.e. what do you have left to work with) between the methods? What is the final purity level?</p><p>2) Have you compared the DTSSP method of obtaining membrane proteins between stereocilia isolation methods? Are they comparable?</p><p>3) I could not get my head around <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, are these 25 different protein clusters? What proteins are involved?

The Discussion could be expanded to dwell a bit more on how to distinguish real from spurious associations.</italic></p><p>DTSSP is a membrane-impermeant and thus should—in principle—crosslink only transmembrane and extracellular proteins. Nevertheless, membrane lysis during procedure might provide access of DTSSP to the cytoplasm, leading to crosslinking of some cytoplasmic proteins at low stoichiometry. Our experience with PDZD7 shows that each association detected will require an extensive set of experiments to validate, and so we have refrained from speculating too much on the biological significance of other proteins pulled down. Perhaps we erred on the side of too little speculation, especially (as the reviewer notes) on how to identify the real associations. Accordingly, we have modified the section to include the following text: <italic>“Subsequent validation of interactions detected, for example showing co-immunoprecipitation, protein-protein binding, or mislocalization in mutant hair cells, is thus of high importance.”</italic> (bold is new text) We also expanded the discussion later under the heading <italic>“Other molecules co-precipitated with MYO7A,” adding the following text: “Other proteins were highly enriched but less abundant, including MYO3B, MYO1H, ESPN, LMO7, FSCN2, and GRXCR1. All of these proteins interact with the actin cytoskeleton, and it is likely that some of them co-precipitate because of their association with substoichiometric levels of actin filaments also bound to MYO7A. Future experiments will be needed to discern which of these proteins interacts specifically with MYO7A complexes and which co-precipitate on associated actin.”</italic></p><p> <italic>Discussion section, subsection “Other molecules co-precipitated with MYO7A”: MYO7A would put ankle links under tension only if just one end moved. But the other end is presumably also associated with MYO7A.</italic></p><p>Yes, the point is well taken, but we did consider that in writing this section: <italic>“MYO7A may move PDZD7 and ADGRV1 towards stereocilia tips but stall if the N-terminal, extracellular end of ADGRV1 was anchored on the adjacent stereocilium.”</italic> Anchoring could occur if the N-terminus of ADGRV1 bound to an immobilized protein (USH2A) or to another ADGRV1 that is anchored on the C-terminus by other molecules than MYO7A (or rigor MYO7A). It is not clear whether an ankle link has a structure of MYO7A- ADGRV1-ADGRV1-MYO7A; evidence for an ADGRV1 antiparallel end-to-end dimer is not strong.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic> </p><p> <italic>The rationale is somewhat slippery.

However, we also assume the reviewer also wants more general discussion on the role of MYO7A. We added a new section, “MYO7A function in stereocilia”, into the Discussion, rearranging the last several paragraphs as well. The key new paragraph is as follows:</p><p>“Unconventional myosins like MYO7A participate in transport, anchoring, tension sensing, actin organization, and cell adhesion (Hartman et el., 2011).

The Discussion was modified to include this sentence: <italic>“Originally identified as a modifier gene for Usher syndrome type 2 genes, PDZD7 has more recently been identified as a nonsyndromic deafness gene itself (Booth et al., 2015; Vona et al., 2016).”</italic></p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3</italic></p><p><italic>1) A more direct comparison to the twist off method would be helpful in terms of sensitivity, i.e. what is the lowest level of protein that you might identify between these technologies. What was the level of enrichment comparatively between the methods? What is the level of protein retrieval (i.e. what do you have left to work with) between the methods?</italic></p><p>This is a difficult question to answer, as the two preparations are apples and oranges—one enriches stereocilia membranes, and the other isolates whole stereocilia. More importantly, mass spectrometric analysis is highly stochastic, especially for low-abundance proteins; increasing the number of runs leads to more and more proteins identified, but some proteins (e.g., membrane proteins) are more difficult to detect because of their composition. With the twist-off method, we feel that we have reached a plateau where we detect most proteins at &gt;10 molecules per stereocilia, but detection of more rare proteins requires additional enrichment. That is one of the main goals of the present work: to provide tools for further enrichment.</p><p>To partially address the reviewer's question, we have added a new supplemental figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, which compares the recovery per ear, relative to the amount in a single utricle, for several proteins in the D10 and twist-off preparations. In part due to the larger number of organs sampled (7 per ear rather than just 1), much more actin and ATP2B2 is isolated in the D10 prep than in the twist-offs. Thus in one important sense, the D10 preparation yields 10x more stereocilia membrane protein per ear—and the ears/day throughput is much greater.</p><p>We have also summarized the comparison between the D10 and twist-off methods in a new table, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>What is the final purity level?</italic></p><p>We took advantage of the mass spectrometry data to make an estimate of purity of the S7 fraction. We decided to emphasize membrane purity, using markers for stereocilia, basolateral, and mitochondrial membranes to make our estimate. Other non-membrane proteins are also present at moderate levels, but cannot be directly compared to membrane proteins, which are poorly detected and therefore under-quantified by mass spectrometry. The markers we chose have known densities in their membranes, allowing us to weight the riBAQ values to estimate membrane amount solubilized, rather than membrane protein solubilized. The calculations suggested that the amount of stereocilia membrane was ~5% of the total membrane solubilized by RIPA. The appropriate text in the Results was:</p><p>“The most abundant membrane proteins in S7 were either from plasma membrane (e.g., ATP1A1, at riBAQ = 1.1 x 10<sup>-2</sup>) or mitochondrial membranes (e.g., ATP5A1, at riBAQ = 1.1 x 10<sup>-2</sup>). In comparison, ATP2B2, marking stereocilia membranes, was present at riBAQ = 0.7 x 10<sup>-2</sup>. In frog stereocilia, ATP2B2 and ATP1A1 each have membrane densities of ~3000 µm<sup>-2</sup> (Yamoah et al., 1998; Burnham and Stirling, 1984); in rat liver mitochondria, ATP5A1 has a density of ~7500 µm<sup>-2</sup> (Schwerzmann et al., 1986). Taken together, these data suggest that stereocilia membranes account for ~5% of the solubilized membrane material in S7.”</p><p>We also rewrote a couple of sentences in the Discussion: “The D10 preparation has significant contamination, however; we estimate that stereocilia membranes account for only ~5% of the RIPA-solubilized material. Other membranes are present in part because contaminating intracellular organelles are disrupted by a freeze-thaw cycle, preventing their precise separation from stereocilia based on distinct, uniform sedimentation properties (Cox and Emili, 2006).”</p><p><italic>2) Have you compared the DTSSP method of obtaining membrane proteins between stereocilia isolation methods? Are they comparable?</italic> </p><p>We were not quite sure what the reviewer is asking—(1) whether DTSSP was effective in stabilizing membrane protein complexes, or (2) how the D10 method (with DTSSP) compared to the twist-off method. Because the present manuscript does not focus on membrane proteins, we are leaving the data supporting point #1 (showing more PCDH15 co-immunoprecipitates with TMC1 if the tissue is pretreated with DTSSP) for a subsequent manuscript. As to point #2, it is a good question that is addressed by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) I could not get my head around <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, are these 25 different protein clusters? What proteins are involved? Neither the text nor the legend discusses 25 clusters, just cluster 8? What is different about each one?</italic></p><p>All proteins that were detected in each of the considered purification fractions were analyzed (no missing data allowed). They are different in their patterns of protein expression—proteins with similar patterns of expression are grouped into a cluster. We found that cluster 8 was most relevant for this analysis, as it both had the steepest enrichment slope and it contained the key proteins PTPRQ and ATP2B2. We have now added a new source data file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>), which contains the normalized expression levels for each protein in each fraction, as well as the cluster assignment. Interested readers can peruse the tables to see what proteins are clustered together.</p><p><italic>4) I didn't see where <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> was discussed and was also unclear of its significance?</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> is important—it illustrates how we sum the daughter ions (fragments of the original peptide) over time to get the total signal for the peptide of interest. The legend was changed to read: <italic>“<bold>C</bold>, Each daughter ion is monitored over time; signal from all monitored daughter ions is summed and the time-summed intensity plot is integrated to determine the signal for the peptide of interest.”</italic></p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> seems to largely be confirming published data, I am not sure how important these data are to include (though I do think replicating published data is important).</italic> </p><p>There are many new observations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and while the gist is confirmation of sketchy previous data, the new observations help us in understanding what MYO7A is doing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref> validates the antibody for use in the vestibular system. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> is the first SIM localization of MYO7A, highlighting its location outside the actin core. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–G</xref> reveal that the mutant has (a) longer stereocilia, (b) probably fewer stereocilia, (c) disorganized stereocilia, and (d) a mislocalized fonticulus. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H–I</xref> confirm in the vestibular system what has been shown in the auditory system previously, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J–K</xref> show that the mislocalization of ADGRV1 does not extend to another membrane protein. Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L–O</xref> reveal much more detail of the phenotype in cochlear hair cells, as SIM gives far better resolution.</p><p><italic>6) What is rate limiting when discussing abundance of proteins, are all proteins and protein interactions equally weighted? That is, is the process to get these proteins linear or might it be biased toward higher affinity interactions or might some steps in the purification and isolation procedure selectively effect some proteins and not others?</italic></p><p>The affinity of the interactions in the MYO7A complex is definitely an important point, especially for the final immunoaffinity purification step. The critical issue is the wash time that follows the antibody-bead interaction with the extract; this wash step takes ~30 minutes for us. Presumably dissociation rates for different MYO7A complexes vary substantially, so some complexes may be nearly completely stable and others may be quite transient. Here, we considered the stoichiometry of each protein relative to MYO7A when choosing which to focus on; complexes with near 1:1 stoichiometry must be quite stable, assuming there is not an abundance of one of the partners in the complex.</p><p>Thus the picture of the MYO7A complexes afforded by our immunoaffinity experiments is distorted by complex affinity. These experiments must therefore be used to discover new complexes, but the detailed composition, including stoichiometries, should be probed in different experiments.</p><p>We have added the following sentence to the last paragraph of the Discussion: “In addition, because of their low levels, extensive washing of MYO7A immunoprecipitates is required, biasing our analysis towards high-affinity interactions.”</p><p>Note that it is possible to use membrane-permeant crosslinkers instead of DTTSP, which would stabilize intracellular complexes as well. We have had successful pilot experiments with these and will be pursuing this route in the future.</p><p><italic>7) It is unclear how the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> were generated? How many cilia are included in measurement? How are they aligned, how do you know top from bottom and do you only look at cilia of a particular length?</italic> </p><p>We added the following to the Methods: “For the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, the line tool was used in Fiji to draw a line from the taper of each indicated stereocilium to its tip; the line was approximately the width of the stereocilia shafts. &quot;Plot Profile&quot; was used to determine the pixel intensity along each stereocilium. In Excel, the profiles were aligned at the tapers, then all 11 profiles were averaged. Because each stereocilium is of a different length, only the taper and shaft regions are in alignment.”</p><p><italic>8) It was surprising that Myo Ic was not identified by this methodology, does this reflect sensitivity of the assay?</italic> </p><p>MYO1C was identified—see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. Its enrichment was not particularly high, however, and we did not call it out in the Results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
