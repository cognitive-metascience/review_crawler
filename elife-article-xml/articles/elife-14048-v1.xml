that mediate this are not known. Here we identify the Dual Leucine-zipper Kinase (DLK, Wnd in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) as a critical target and effector of cAMP in injured axons. DLK/Wnd is thought to function as an injury ‘sensor’, as it becomes activated after axonal damage. Our findings in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian neurons indicate that the cAMP effector kinase PKA is a conserved and direct upstream activator of Wnd/DLK. PKA is required for the induction of Wnd signaling in injured axons, and DLK is essential for the regenerative effects of cAMP in mammalian DRG neurons. These findings link two important mediators of responses to axonal injury, DLK/Wnd and cAMP/PKA, into a unified and evolutionarily conserved molecular pathway for stimulating the regenerative potential of injured axons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14048.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14048.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14048.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Adult mammals typically cannot repair damage to the nerve fibers in their brain or spinal cord. This is because these nerve cells cannot generally grow new nerve fibers. However this inability to regenerate nerve fibers is not set in stone. Instead, it can be unlocked by a second injury in nerves elsewhere in the body, the so-called “peripheral nervous system”. This process relies on an enzyme called DLK, which becomes activated in damaged nerve fibers.</p><p>But how does DLK ‘sense’ damage to nerve fibers? Injuring the peripheral nervous system causes the levels of a molecule called cAMP to increase in the damaged nerve cells, and the elevated cAMP levels stimulate the nerve fibers to regenerate. However, it was not known if cAMP activates DLK, or if the two act independently of each other.</p><p>By looking at the regeneration of damaged nerve fibers in fruit fly larvae, Hao et al. now show that the cAMP and DLK signaling pathways are clearly linked. Further experiments with nerve cells from mice and human cells revealed more detail about this link. Together the results showed that another enzyme called PKA activates DLK directly when cAMP levels are high. These findings reveal a unified pathway that is the key to unlocking the regenerative potential of injured nerve fibers, which has been conserved for hundreds of millions of years of evolution. Further work could now ask if the DLK enzyme is involved in the other known roles of cAMP signaling in nerve cells; or if cAMP and PKA activate DLK in other forms of nerve damage, including injuries where nerve fibers normally fail to regenerate.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14048.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14048.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>axonal regeneration</kwd><kwd>cAMP signaiing</kwd><kwd>MAP Kinasae signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 NS093962-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frey</surname><given-names>Erin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008191</institution-id><institution>Wings for Life</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yoon</surname><given-names>Choya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005984</institution-id><institution>Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

This failure is not only a reflection of the growth inhibitory nature of CNS tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fawcett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Filbin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silver et al., 2015</xref>), but also due to the lack of intrinsic capacity for neurons in the adult CNS to grow axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun and He, 2010</xref>). However, landmark studies by Richardson and Issa have suggested that neurons indeed possess an innate ability to regenerate their axons in the adult mammalian CNS, and that this ability can be unlocked by a ‘conditioning lesion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richardson and Issa, 1984</xref>). In adult DRG neurons, an injury to peripherally projecting axons, i.e. a compression injury to the sciatic nerve, unleashes growth programs within the DRG and allows for regeneration of its centrally projecting axons in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neumann and Woolf, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richardson and Issa, 1984</xref>). This growth can be induced by a lesion in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) even after the CNS lesion has occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ylera et al., 2009</xref>), hence it is of great interest from a therapeutic perspective to understand the molecular mechanisms that allow for the unlocking of such regenerative potential.</p><p>Previous studies have discovered that several signal transduction pathways are activated in DRG neurons upon a conditioning injury, including JAK-STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qiu et al., 2005</xref>), ATF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fagoe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hollis and Zou, 2012</xref>), Smad1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zou et al., 2009</xref>), Activin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Omura et al., 2015</xref>), HIF-1alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2015</xref>) and cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qiu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neumann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 1999</xref>). Impressively, ectopic elevation of cAMP alone is sufficient to strongly enhance regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qiu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neumann et al., 2002</xref>). Since this second messenger is commonly modulated by growth signals and neuronal activity, cAMP modulation has been suggested as a potential therapeutic inroad to stimulate the regenerative potential of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>). However, the downstream pathways that are engaged by this broadly utilized second messenger to actually promote axonal regeneration are not known. Much attention has focused upon the cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), since constitutive activation of CREB is sufficient to stimulate axonal regeneration in the presence of CNS myelin <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2004</xref>). However, more recent studies indicate that endogenous CREB is not required for cAMP elicited axonal regeneration <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). Hence it remains elusive how cAMP elevation activates axonal regrowth programs in neurons.</p><p>A recent study has identified an essential role for the dual zipper-bearing kinase DLK in the pro-regenerative effect of a conditioning lesion in adult DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shin et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue Wallenda (Wnd), mediates protective effects of a conditioning lesion in <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brace and DiAntonio, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xiong and Collins, 2012</xref>). This conserved axonal mitogen activated kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) is thought to function as a sensor of axonal damage, and therefore should become activated upon conditioning injury. In support of this, Wnd/DLK is transported in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>) and is required acutely in injured axons for the generation of signals that are retrogradely transported to the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shin et al., 2012</xref>). DLK/Wnd is required for axonal regeneration in many types of neurons, including motoneurons in mammals, flies and worms, and CNS neurons where regeneration is ectopically induced by PTEN mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammarlund et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, in mammalian CNS neurons that do not regenerate (eg. retinal ganglion cells, RGCs), DLK activation after injury mediates cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Welsbie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these findings support the model that a conserved function of the Wnd/DLK kinase is to ‘sense’ axonal damage. Through a yet unknown mechanism, axonal damage leads to activation of Wnd/DLK’s kinase function. Once activated, downstream signaling mediates both beneficial and deleterious outcomes in neurons, depending upon the context. The high stakes outcomes of regeneration or death, combined with additional findings that DLK mediates cell death in models for nerve growth factor withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>), glaucoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Welsbie et al., 2013</xref>), MPTP toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mathiasen et al., 2004</xref>) and excitotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pozniak et al., 2013</xref>), have inspired much interest in understanding the unknown pathways that lead to the activation of DLK/Wnd in injured axons.</p><p>Here we identify a direct upstream activator of DLK/Wnd in injured axons, in the form of the cAMP effector kinase PKA. We find that PKA phosphorylates evolutionarily conserved serines within the activation loop of DLK, which is sufficient to activate DLK independently of its downstream signaling mechanisms. In addition, our functional studies in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneurons and adult mammalian DRG neurons indicate that the ability of cAMP and PKA to promote axonal regeneration depends entirely upon the ability of PKA to activate the DLK/Wnd kinase. These findings present a unified and evolutionarily conserved molecular pathway, from cAMP to PKA to DLK, which plays a central role in stimulating the ability of injured axons to regenerate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PKA regulates axonal regeneration via Wnd</title><p>Previous studies in mammalian and <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons suggest that cAMP signaling stimulates regenerative axonal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qiu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neumann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghosh-Roy et al., 2010</xref>). To study this axon regeneration pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we used previously developed axon injury assay in third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>), and found that knockdown of phosphodiesterase <italic>dunce (dnc</italic>) or activation of PKA by overexpression of the catalytic subunit (PKA<sup>CA</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 1995</xref>) led to an enhanced growth response of <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneuron axons after nerve crush injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The new axonal growth from the injured proximal stump generally assumes a highly branched shape, characterized by a network of small branches and a general thickening of the axon diameter. To assess the injury response, we quantified the total membrane volume within 100 µm of the axonal tip (indicated by the dash line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In control animals, this total volume increases 3 fold, from 68.5 µm<sup>3</sup> to 200 µm<sup>3</sup> 15 hr after injury. PKA activation led to a 1.5 fold increase in this volume compared to control (WT) axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The enhanced sprouting response stimulated by PKA was lost when DLK/Wnd function was inhibited by co-expression of RNAi targeting Wnd (but not a control RNAi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). These observations are consistent with the previous finding in <italic>C.elegans</italic> that DLK is required for the regeneration that is induced by cAMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghosh-Roy et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, PKA alone is required for <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneurons to initiate regenerative sprouting, as RNAi-mediated knockdown of the PKA catalytic subunit inhibited the sprouting response by 50% compared to control axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). cAMP and PKA therefore play an influential role in the regenerative capacity of <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneuron axons.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14048.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PKA stimulates and is required for axonal regeneration in <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneurons.</title><p>Single motoneuron axons were labeled by expression of UAS-mCD8-GFP using the m12-Gal4 driver and imaged either 0 hr or 15 hr after nerve crush injury.

Notably, the activation loop contains a conserved consensus sequence for PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and a recent study has demonstrated that the predicted phosphorylation site S302 is required for DLK to activate downstream kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To test whether PKA stimulates phosphorylation of DLK’s activation loop (S302), we have generated phospho-specific antibodies against a phosphorylated peptide corresponding to activation loop of mouse DLK (KELSDKpSTKMpSFAGTV). The phospho-DLK antibodies detected a strong band in HEK293 cells that overexpress WT mouse DLK, but show no reactivity for mutant DLK<sup>S302A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Remarkably, expression of PKA<sup>CA</sup> in HEK293 cells induces a dramatic increase of phospho-S302 DLK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), even when normalized to the levels of total DLK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

We used both torin1 and rapamycin to inhibit TORC1 in the presence or absence of PKA in HEK293 cells. However, in both cases we observed no effect upon DLK and pDLK levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). PKA therefore stimulates phosphorylation of DLK’s activation loop independently of TORC1 function.</p><p>To confirm that S302 is a critical site for Wnd/DLK function in axonal regeneration, we conducted a rescue experiment in <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneurons based on the requirement of Wnd for axonal sprouting after injury.

In addition, overexpression of Wnd<sup>S301A,S305A</sup> does not give rise to any of the previous described gain-of-function phenotypes similar to WT Wnd, suggesting that S302 is indeed required for DLK function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PKA promotes DLK stability independently of downstream signaling</title><p>A previous study has described a positive feedback loop for DLK stabilization that involves the action of DLK’s downstream effector JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>). JNK activation stimulates phosphorylation of DLK at sites outside of its activation loop (T43 and S533) and changes DLK’s sensitivity to degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>). This increase in protein stability leads to an increase in total levels of DLK. Since PKA stimulates an increase in ectopically expressed DLK, it most likely increases protein stability. We therefore tested whether this increased stability involves the previously described JNK-dependent feedback mechanism. If this is the case, the effects of PKA and forskolin should depend on the function of JNK. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, treatment with JNK inhibitor VIII led to a 30% decrease in total DLK level, as expected for JNK’s previously demonstrated role in promoting DLK stability. However, even in the presence of JNK inhibitor, treatment with forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) or transfection with PKA<sup>CA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) increases DLK level by 50%. Moreover, treatment with JNK inhibitor had very little effect upon the fraction of total DLK that is phosphorylated at S302 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). These results suggest that PKA stimulates DLK phosphorylation and stabilization independently of downstream JNK activation.</p><p>Previous biochemical studies suggest that DLK’s activation mechanism is associated with dimerization and autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nihalani et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mata et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Merritt et al., 1999</xref>). We therefore further considered whether PKA could function either upstream or downstream of DLK’s own ability to function as a kinase. To test this, we utilized a kinase-dead version of DLK, DLK<sup>K185A</sup>, which is unable to activate downstream signaling or undergo autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nihalani et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mata et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Merritt et al., 1999</xref>). Consistent with the previously described feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>), the DLK<sup>K185A</sup> mutant protein was less stable, and addition of JNK inhibitor had no further effect upon the levels of kinase dead DLK protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, PKA<sup>CA</sup> stimulated a strong increase of DLK<sup>K185A</sup> levels and phosphorylation at S302 for DLK<sup>K185A</sup>. The ability of PKA to increase DLK protein stability and activation loop phosphorylation independently of DLK’s own signaling abilities places PKA firmly upstream of DLK, as an upstream regulator/activator.</p><p>Since PKA promotes DLK stability and directly phosphorylates S302, we wondered whether PKA stabilizes DLK by phosphorylation of S302. Previous work has shown that a decreased stability for DLK<sup>S302A</sup> mutant protein is linked to the fact that it is inactive for kinase activity, and is therefore unable to activate the downstream stabilization mechanism via JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Consistent with this, the reduced levels of DLK<sup>S302A</sup> protein are not further reduced in the presence of JNK inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However surprisingly, co-transfection with PKA<sup>CA</sup> still caused an increase of the levels of DLK<sup>S302A</sup> protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We interpret that PKA regulates DLK via an additional mechanism, in conjunction with phosphorylation of the critical activation loop S302. This additional mechanism may involve other sites of phosphorylation, or other modes of regulation (discussed further below).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PKA stimulates axonal regeneration via DLK in adult DRG neurons</title><p>Our finding that PKA activates DLK, taken together with previous findings that DLK promotes axonal regeneration in different neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammarlund et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yan et al., 2009</xref>), led to the hypothesis that DLK is an important downstream mediator of cAMP-stimulated axon regeneration.

Depending upon the context, its activation can lead to either axonal regeneration or cell death and degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tedeschi and Bradke, 2013</xref>). The factors that determine beneficial versus detrimental outcomes, along with the general cellular mechanisms that lead to the activation of DLK, are poorly understood. In this study, we found that an immediate upstream activator of DLK is the cAMP regulated kinase PKA. Elevation of cAMP signaling, which is activated by pro-regenerative manipulations such as a conditioning lesion, is the most widely known pathway for promoting axonal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hannila and Filbin, 2008</xref>). We found that an essential component of this regenerative pathway is the activation of Wnd/DLK by PKA. These findings delineate an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for the activation of the Wnd/DLK kinase. Taken together with previous findings that Wnd/DLK is an essential regulator of responses induced by a conditioning injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shin et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xiong and Collins 2012</xref>), the activation of Wnd/DLK by PKA in injured axons presents a unified molecular pathway for activating a regenerative response to axonal damage.</p><p>In contrast to a merging of cAMP and DLK pathways, some other studies have suggested that these pathways may act separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2016</xref>). A recent study has noted that in certain sensory neuron types in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, PKA <italic>gain-of-function</italic> mutations can induce axonal outgrowth even in <italic>dlk</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, multiple pathways for axonal regeneration may be inducible by PKA. However DLK is strongly required for cAMP stimulated regeneration in other neuron types in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghosh-Roy et al., 2010</xref>), and, importantly, in axonal regeneration induced by a conditioning lesion in the mammalian PNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shin et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings now indicate that DLK is an important molecular target and effector of cAMP-induced regeneration in mammalian neurons.</p><p>Previous biochemical studies indicate that DLK activation involves dimerization via its leucine zipper domains and autophosphorylation, at locations that are yet undefined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nihalani et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mata et al., 1996</xref>). Because ectopic elevation of DLK/Wnd protein is sufficient to activate its downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mata et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nihalani et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>), and DLK is known to be highly regulated at the level of protein turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammarlund et al., 2009</xref>), a plausible mechanism for its regulation is to hold its levels and/or its ability to dimerize in check (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mata et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nihalani et al., 2000</xref>). The existence of a direct upstream activator of the kinase was not previously implied, and has thus far been unknown. Here we found that PKA stimulates the phosphorylation of the activation loop of DLK independently of DLK’s kinase activity, and also independently of downstream JNK signaling. This defines PKA as an upstream activator of DLK.</p><p>A previous study in <italic>C. elegans</italic> has described a mechanism through which transient elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon axonal injury leads to the activation of DLK-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yan and Jin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghosh-Roy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spira et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, earlier studies have implicated calmodulin-regulated calcineurin in the regulation of mammalian DLK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mata et al., 1996</xref>). However, the hexapeptide that mediates activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is not present in mammalian or <italic>Drosophila</italic> DLK/Wnd, and mammalian DLK can be activated independently of Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation by cytoskeletal destabilizing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Valakh et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, the consensus PKA phosphorylation site in the activation loop of Wnd/DLK is conserved in all phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting this pathway as a central (although not necessarily exclusive) mechanism for regulating DLK.</p><p>We note that in conjunction with phosphorylation of DLK’s essential activation loop, PKA enhances DLK’s stability via an additional mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), since the mutated protein DLK<sup>S302A</sup> can still be stabilized upon PKA activation. This mechanism may involve additional phosphorylation sites on DLK, and indeed, multiple PKA consensus sequences are observed in Wnd/DLK’s sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, it is also possible that PKA regulates DLK’s stability via other mechanisms, such as previously described ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2006</xref>), palmitoylation modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holland et al., 2016</xref>), changes in DLK’s interacting proteins or subcellular localization. Such aspects of regulation could involve additional molecular targets of PKA, which would provide some potential for context specificity in DLK’s regulation. While PKA has many cellular targets, its specificity can be highly regulated at a subcellular level by interactions with AKAP scaffolding proteins and local changes in cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tasken and Aandahl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wong and Scott, 2004</xref>). It will be interesting to identify the additional players in cAMP and PKA regulation of DLK through future work.</p><p>It is remarkable that PKA stimulates a specific increase in Wnd levels in axons but not cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and inhibition of PKA strongly inhibits the induction of Wnd protein after axonal injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Does PKA act locally in axons to stimulate DLK? Other studies have suggested that Wnd/DLK can regulate retrograde signaling pathways that originate in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holland et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, the Hiw/Rpm-1/Phr1 ubiquitin ligase, which is previously known for its role in regulating Wnd/DLK’s levels in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lewcock et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babetto et al., 2013</xref>), contains a RCC1-like domain that biochemically inhibits adenylate cyclase, and therefore may negatively regulate cAMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pierre et al., 2004</xref>). Hiw/Rpm-1/Phr1 is previously known for its role in regulating synaptic arborization and growth via its regulation of Wnd/DLK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shin and DiAntonio, 2011</xref>). The addition of cAMP and PKA into this regulatory pathway suggests a mechanism that may be broadly utilized to orchestrate structural changes within presynaptic terminals. We propose that the regulation of DLK by PKA may be generally important for neuronal plasticity as well as responses to axonal damage.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly genetics</title><p>The following fly strains were used in this study: Canton-S (WT), m12-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ritzenthaler et al., 2000</xref>), BG380-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Budnik et al., 1996</xref>), OK6-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aberle et al., 2002</xref>), RRa(eve)-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fujioka et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>puc</italic>-lacZ<sup>E69</sup>, <italic>wnd</italic><sup>3</sup>, UAS-Wnd, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2006</xref>), UAS-GFP-Wnd<sup>KD</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>), UAS-PKA<sup>CA</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 1995</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Hugo Bellen as the Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Hao et al. describe an evolutionarily conserved mechanism mediating cAMP axonal regeneration via the phosphorylation of dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase (DLK). DLK (known as Wnd in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) has previously been implicated in invertebrate and mammalian systems to be essential for neuronal axon regeneration. DLK is enriched in axons after axonal injury, and DLK is required for injury-induced axonal regeneration in neurons of mammals, flies and worms. However, the specific mechanism by which DLK is activated is currently unknown, but multiple signaling pathways are likely to activate axonal regeneration. The authors focus on the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, which stimulates axonal elaboration in multiple models systems of axon growth/regeneration. Based on an evolutionarily conserved PKA phosphorylation site residing in the kinase domain of DLK, the authors hypothesized that DLK phosphorylation lies downstream of the cAMP-PKA pathway to modulate DLK-dependent axonal regeneration. Consistent with this hypothesis, the authors demonstrate that DLK is subject to direct PKA phosphorylation at the proposed PKA phosphorylation site (S302). Additionally, the authors demonstrate in HEK293 mammalian cultured cells that DLK phosphorylation is enhanced (phospho-specific DLK antibody) when the PKA signaling pathway is activated either pharmacologically or by expression of constitutively activated PKA. The authors correlate DLK phosphorylation with enhanced DLK abundance in HEK293 cells and implicate a previously described JNK feedback pathway that affects DLK ubiquitination and degradation. These observations are consistent with their well-executed in vivo experiments demonstrating #1) a genetic interaction in <italic>Drosophila</italic> between PKA and Wnd in mediating axonal regeneration after injury, #2) enhanced levels of Wnd protein and activity after axonal injury or genetically activating the PKA pathway, and #3) failure to rescue axonal regeneration by expressing the phosphorylation incapable Wnd S302A in the <italic>wnd</italic> mutant compared to WT controls.</p><p>PKA-phosphorylation of DLK/Wnd is a novel finding and of interest to the field of regeneration, unifying several previously described pathways into a coherent DLK-dependent pathway for injury-induced axon regeneration. Overall, the use of multiple model systems to describe DLK activation by PKA as a mechanism for axonal regeneration activation is one of the many strengths of this manuscript. Some comments for the authors to consider are noted below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>I recommend that the authors perform a few experiments to assess whether elevating cAMP levels in neurons mimics the expression of PKA<sup>CA</sup> with regard to Wnd-dependent axonal sprouting and puckered induction. For instance, the authors could utilize loss-of-function alleles of the gene encoding the cAMP phosphodiesterase, <italic>Dunce</italic>. It will also be worthwhile to evaluate whether axon sprouting and puckered induction in dunce mutants are sensitive to Wnd knockdown. Conversely, the authors could examine if injury dependent axon sprouting and puckered induction are diminished if adenylyl cyclase (for e.g. Rutabaga or AC78C) levels are reduced.</p><p>Given that PKA activation leads to a strong upregulation of Wnd levels, I wonder whether Hiw and PKA function in the same pathway. I recommend that authors examine whether the increase in Wnd levels by PKA<sup>CA</sup> is attenuated in the <italic>hiw</italic> mutants (by Westerns OR by imaging Wnd-GFP in axons). The results of this experiment will be interesting and relevant to this study regardless of the outcome! At the very least, the authors should discuss the stabilization of Wnd by PKA in the context of their previous findings regarding Hiw.</p><p>Is endogenous DLK/Wnd phosphorylated by PKA? The authors generated a beautiful DLK S302 phospho-specific antibody and successfully used it in transfected HEK293 cells expressing DLK. Can this antibody be used to demonstrate enhanced S302 phosphorylation of endogenous DLK/Wnd in <italic>Drosophila</italic> after expression of PKA<sup>CA</sup> and/or axonal injury using westerns and/or immunostaining? Not sure if the antibody works across species, so this might not be an option. If not, has the antibody been tried in forskolin treated cultured cortical or DRG neurons? Would be a very nice positive addition to support the model, though not required given how difficult phospho-antibodies can be.</p><p>One point that could use some clarification for the readers is how the authors think that S302 phosphorylation actually affects DLK function. The authors nicely correlate DLK 302 phosphorylation with DLK abundance in transfected HEK293 cells. Huntwork-Rodriguez, in a prior study, reported that S302 of DLK is required for DLK protein stability (Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013). That is, DLK downstream activation of the JNK pathway was proposed to result in a feedback loop in which JNK→DLK phosphorylation results in increased DLK abundance by reducing DLK degradation. There, the DLK<sup>S302A</sup> mutant exhibited decreased overall DLK abundance by enhancing DLK degradation. Consistent with these previous findings, the current authors observed PKA-induced enhancement of DLK levels are blocked by JNK inhibitors without affecting S302 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E and 3F</xref>). Interestingly, the DLK<sup>K185A</sup> kinase dead version of DLK remains enhanced AND phosphorylated at S302 with PKA activation even in the presence of JNK inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3G</xref>), suggesting that elevation of DLK levels via S302 phosphorylation occurs <italic>independent</italic> of DLK kinase activity. How do the authors rationalize this in regards to their model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) and previous studies? For example, Huntwork-Rodriguez et al. found that the S302A mutation abolished the ability of DLK to activate downstream effectors (JNK). This observation led directly to a previous model that DLK kinase activates JNK to feedback and phosphorylate DLK and regulate its abundance. If both the DLK<sup>K185A</sup> and DLK<sup>S302A</sup> mutants lack kinase activity and fail to activate downstream effector pathways (e.g. JNK), why do they behave differently with JNK inhibitors? The authors' statement that &quot;The induction of DLK activation loop phosphorylation independently of its own signaling abilities places PKA firmly upstream of DLK, as an upstream regulator/activator” (Results) seems true, but what does this data mean for the proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>)? Finally, does DLK<sup>S302A</sup> mutant fail to rescue in the <italic>wnd</italic> mutant rescue experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), as they fail to increase in general abundance in response to injury and/or are the basal levels of DLK<sup>S302A</sup> lower compared to WT DLK?</p><p>The authors placed the WT and WndS302A <italic>Drosophila</italic> rescue experiments in the supplemental figures, but I'm not sure why these are not in the main text. As mentioned in #2, failure of the DLK<sup>S302A</sup> rescues to enrich DLK in axons after PKACA expression or axon injury would strengthen the authors model that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of DLK modulates its local stability to promote regeneration programs. Finally, are the DRG experiments amenable to rescue experiments with WT and DLK<sup>S302A</sup> rescue experiments?</p><p>Axons vs. cell body. PKA activity has much more effect on <italic>wnd</italic> levels in axons than cell bodies. Does this mean PKA is activated by injury in axons but not cell bodies? This should be possible to test with a PKA activity reporter, and possibly also the phospho-specific <italic>wnd</italic> antibody.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14048.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>I recommend that the authors perform a few experiments to assess whether elevating cAMP levels in neurons mimics the expression of PKA<sup>CA</sup> with regard to Wnd-dependent axonal sprouting and puckered induction.

The results of this experiment will be interesting and relevant to this study regardless of the outcome! At the very least, the authors should discuss the stabilization of Wnd by PKA in the context of their previous findings regarding Hiw.</italic></p><p>We agree that the relationship between Hiw and PKA is very interesting to understand, particularly since some biochemical data in other species suggest that Hiw/Pam may regulate cAMP levels by inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity (Ehnert et al., 2004) (Pierre et al., 2004). Our data thus far suggest that the relationship is complex, so including data/experiments on this issue would be both distracting to the current story, and would require many more experiments to address the relationship properly. So instead we are following the reviewer’s suggestion to discuss the regulation of Wnd by PKA in the context of what is previously known for Hiw, (in the Discussion section).</p><p><italic>Is endogenous DLK/Wnd phosphorylated by PKA?

Over the past two months, we have tried hard to get a decent signal for endogenous DLK in cultured neurons, including scaled up cultures and immunoprecipitations to enrich for the protein. This has been very challenging technically – we think that the levels of endogenous DLK are very low, and that the antibodies may also not be very sensitive. We prefer to leave this experiment out of the paper. As the phosphorylation of S302 is important for DLK to function as a kinase, our functional data combined with our biochemical data in HEK293 cells strongly suggests that S302 is indeed phosphorylated on endogenous DLK.</p><p><italic>One point that could use some clarification for the readers is how the authors think that S302 phosphorylation actually affects DLK function. The authors nicely correlate DLK 302 phosphorylation with DLK abundance in transfected HEK293 cells. Huntwork-Rodriguez, in a prior study, reported that S302 of DLK is required for DLK protein stability (Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013). That is, DLK downstream activation of the JNK pathway was proposed to result in a feedback loop in which JNK→DLK phosphorylation results in increased DLK abundance by reducing DLK degradation. There, the DLK<sup>S302A</sup> mutant exhibited decreased overall DLK abundance by enhancing DLK degradation. Consistent with these previous findings, the current authors observed PKA-induced enhancement of DLK levels are blocked by JNK inhibitors without affecting S302 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E and F</xref>). Interestingly, the DLK<sup>K185A</sup> kinase dead version of DLK remains enhanced AND phosphorylated at S302 with PKA activation even in the presence of JNK inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3G</xref>), suggesting that elevation of DLK levels via S302 phosphorylation occurs independent of DLK kinase activity. How do the authors rationalize this in regards to their model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) and previous studies? For example, Huntwork-Rodriguez et al. found that the S302A mutation abolished the ability of DLK to activate downstream effectors (JNK). This observation led directly to a previous model that DLK kinase activates JNK to feedback and phosphorylate DLK and regulate its abundance. If both the DLK<sup>K185A</sup> and DLK<sup>S302A</sup> mutants lack kinase activity and fail to activate downstream effector pathways (e.g. JNK), why do they behave differently with JNK inhibitors? The authors' statement that &quot;The induction of DLK activation loop phosphorylation independently of its own signaling abilities places PKA firmly upstream of DLK, as an upstream regulator/activator” (Results) seems true, but what does this data mean for the proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>)?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for these points. We have carried out and included some additional experiments (which lead to an expansion of the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> into two figures: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). These data provide further clarification and lead to a revised model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Both the S302A and K185A mutants appear to be ‘kinase dead’ since they are unable to stimulate downstream signaling, including phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun (Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013). We found that for both mutant proteins, PKA activation stimulates an increase in DLK levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>), even though they are incapable of downstream signaling. This suggests that PKA enhances DLK stability via an independent mechanism that is separate from the previously described JNK-dependent feedback mechanism. In further support of this, JNK inhibition acts additively with PKA activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This revised model (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) unifies our observations with previous studies (including Huntwork-Rodriguez et al) and has some additional interesting implications for the regulation of DLK, which we have discussed further in this revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Finally, does DLK<sup>S302A</sup> mutant fail to rescue in the wnd mutant rescue experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), as they fail to increase in general abundance in response to injury and/or are the basal levels of DLK<sup>S302A</sup> lower compared to WT DLK</italic></p><p>Since independent transgenes have different expression levels, we cannot fairly assess the effect of the mutation upon basal expression levels. Using anti-Wnd antibodies to detect the over-expressed Wnd protein, we have examined basal and injury induced Wnd levels by immunocytochemistry. The transgenic protein is still quite hard to detect, and we do not observe an induction in Wnd<sup>S301A,305A</sup> mutant protein after axonal injury. But we have caveats to reach any firm interpretations with this data, since we know that the expression levels of the mutant transgene is extremely high compared to endogenous Wnd.</p><p><italic>The authors placed the WT and WndS302A Drosophila rescue experiments in the supplemental figures, but I'm not sure why these are not in the main text. As mentioned in #2, failure of the DLK<sup>S302</sup>A rescues to enrich DLK in axons after PKACA expression or axon injury would strengthen the authors model that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of DLK modulates its local stability to promote regeneration programs.</italic></p><p>We appreciate this suggestion and have moved the rescue data into the main figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). As discussed above and in our revised manuscript, the fact that this mutant protein is non-functional is important to emphasize since the stabilizing effect of PKA still occurs for the DLK<sup>S302A</sup> mutant.</p><p><italic>Finally, are the DRG experiments amenable to rescue experiments with WT and DLK<sup>S302A</sup> rescue experiments?</italic> </p><p>We would like to do such rescue experiments. Unfortunately, they are not very feasible in adult DRG neurons. Both transfection and infection is very inefficient in adult DRG neurons for constructs the size of DLK. In addition, overexpression of DLK in neurons leads to DLK auto-activation and induces apoptosis.</p><p><italic>Axons vs. cell body. PKA activity has much more effect on wnd levels in axons than cell bodies. Does this mean PKA is activated by injury in axons but not cell bodies? This should be possible to test with a PKA activity reporter, and possibly also the phospho-specific wnd antibody.</italic></p><p>We agree that it is very interesting to know whether PKA regulates DLK locally in axons, however this is currently a very technically challenging question. The phospho-DLK antibodies do not work in flies, and our recent efforts lead us to conclude that they are also intractable for IHC in mammalian neurons (due to a high degree of non-specific staining). While a FRET reporter has been used for PKA in flies (Gervasi et al., 2010), it has never been used before in our larval motoneuron preparation. We have begun to work with a cAMP FRET reporter that is more widely used in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Ponsioen et al., 2004) and still have a great deal of troubleshooting to carry out in order to implement the reporter in a new preparation and verify that it is working properly. The PKA reporter would require even further validation and controls. We think this is an interesting future project, but is not practical for this current story. An important additional caution is that even if any of these suggested assays work, a negative result in our injury assays could still have the caveat that the method of detection is not sensitive enough to detect functional changes that indeed occur.</p></body></sub-article></article>
