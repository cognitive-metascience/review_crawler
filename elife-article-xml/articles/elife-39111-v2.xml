Local rhythms serve cortical area-specific sleep needs and functions; however, mechanisms controlling locality are unclear. We identify the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) as a source for local, sensory-cortex-specific non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) in mouse. Neurons in optogenetically identified sensory TRN sectors showed stronger repetitive burst discharge compared to non-sensory TRN cells due to higher activity of the low-threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3. Major NREMS rhythms in sensory but not non-sensory cortical areas were regulated in a Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3-dependent manner. In particular, NREMS in somatosensory cortex was enriched in fast spindles, but switched to delta wave-dominated sleep when Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels were genetically eliminated or somatosensory TRN cells chemogenetically hyperpolarized. Our data indicate a previously unrecognized heterogeneity in a powerful forebrain oscillator that contributes to sensory-cortex-specific and dually regulated NREMS, enabling local sleep regulation according to use- and experience-dependence.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39111.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Falling asleep affects our behavior immediately and profoundly. During sleep, large electrical waves appear across the brain in areas responsible for consciousness, sensation and movement. In the cortex – the outer layer of the brain – sleep waves arise from networks that connect to the thalamus, a deeper structure within the brain. However, not all areas of the brain sleep equally. We know this intuitively because sensory stimuli, such as an alarm clock or a baby’s cry, can still wake us up. By contrast, we typically do not move much or take major decisions while we sleep. Therefore, the brain areas involved in sensation should not be expected to sleep in the same way as areas involved in movement or reasoning.</p><p>Neighboring brain areas generally show very different sleep waves. The brain regions that we use during the day can also affect how sleep varies from one area to the next. It is not well understood what determines these ‘local’ sleep properties.</p><p>By studying the brains of mice, Fernandez et al. now show that the networks between the cortex and thalamus are much more varied than previously thought, in particular regarding a thalamic nucleus that is relevant for sleep wave generation. These previously unrecognized differences deep within the brain are part of the origin of local sleep in the outer layer of the brain. Sleep wave activity differed depending on whether the networks were involved in sensory or non-sensory roles. The networks allow sensory areas to switch efficiently between different forms of local sleep. This might underlie how the brain’s sensory activity during the day can influence local sleep at night.</p><p>There is growing evidence that major sleep disorders are due to disturbances to local sleep. Techniques to modify or restore specific sleep waves locally in the brain could help to develop new sleep therapies. For example, having a detailed map of electrical waves within the sleep-disordered brain could help researchers to apply transcranial stimulation techniques in ways that might help to treat these debilitating disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>EEG</kwd><kwd>LFP</kwd><kwd>Ca2+ channel</kwd><kwd>spectral power</kwd><kwd>sleep spindles</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_166318</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fernandez</surname><given-names>Laura MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Vantomme</surname><given-names>Gil</given-names></name><name><surname>Osorio-Forero</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name><name><surname>Cardis</surname><given-names>Romain</given-names></name><name><surname>Béard</surname><given-names>Elidie</given-names></name><name><surname>Lüthi</surname><given-names>Anita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>État de Vaud</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fernandez</surname><given-names>Laura MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Vantomme</surname><given-names>Gil</given-names></name><name><surname>Osorio-Forero</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name><name><surname>Cardis</surname><given-names>Romain</given-names></name><name><surname>Béard</surname><given-names>Elidie</given-names></name><name><surname>Lüthi</surname><given-names>Anita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FBM Poste de soutien à un congé parental</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fernandez</surname><given-names>Laura MJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Local cortical sleep features arise subcortically due to heterogeneous burst discharge in neurons of a sleep rhythm pacemaker previously thought to act uniformly.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sleep is a global vigilance state with well-known behavioral, electroencephalographic and neuromodulatory attributes. However, cerebral correlates of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) and REMS, notably several major EEG sleep rhythms, occur variably at different times in different brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Massimini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nir et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Siclari and Tononi, 2017</xref>). This suggests that, on top of a global regulation, forebrain pacemakers with regionally specific oscillatory properties shape sleep across the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krueger et al., 2013</xref>). Such local aspects probably underlie the sleeping brain’s decreased capacity to integrate external information and enable plasticity in specific neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Siclari and Tononi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crunelli et al., 2018</xref>). For example, sleep-dependent memory consolidation is linked to spatially confined regulation of NREMS rhythms in the brain areas involved in recent learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, sleep disorders may arise from a pathologically altered spatial heterogeneity that negatively impacts sleep as a global state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krueger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Siclari and Tononi, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Prototype cellular pacemakers for NREMS rhythms, notably for the slow-oscillation (SO) (&lt;1 Hz), delta waves (1–4 Hz) and sleep spindles (10–15 Hz) have been known for decades (for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Steriade et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Astori et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanchez-Vives et al., 2017</xref>)). However, the spatiotemporal variability of cortical rhythms challenges the idea that these are homogeneous sources across the cortical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Piantoni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Siclari and Tononi, 2017</xref>). For example, ‘fast’ and ‘slow’ human sleep spindles distribute variably and correlate differentially with memory consolidation, which has prompted a search for at least two, if not several, separately active spindle generators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schabus et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frauscher et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, anatomical and functional boundaries of cortical areas go in parallel with variations of sleep rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernandez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Piantoni et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, sleep rhythms can show local singularities within a single cortical area according to developmental stage, or as a result of experience and learning during the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kurth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laventure et al., 2016</xref>). There is also evidence for the localized appearance of sleep-related patterns in individual cortical columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pigarev et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rector et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, modality-specific thalamocortical loops could account for diversity in local NREMS. Moreover, there should be powerful local tuning mechanisms to locally switch between different NREMS rhythms. The current view is dominated by cortical focal influences as essential to shape local rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Contreras et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Piantoni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Siclari and Tononi, 2017</xref>). In contrast, thalamic oscillators are seen as broad and relatively homogeneous sources of oscillatory power that can spread focally or globally to cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonjean et al., 2012</xref>), but that have little bearing on their ultimate cortical correlates.</p><p>This view is becoming revised as novel observations on heterogeneous thalamic pacemaker mechanisms are reported. Of interest is the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), typically referred to as an inhibitory shell of highly oscillatory, burst-prone cells surrounding the dorsal thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pinault, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fogerson and Huguenard, 2016</xref>). Burst discharge generates large inhibitory synaptic potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herd et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rovó et al., 2014</xref>) that entrain thalamocortical neurons into rhythmicity. Bursting is based on the Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel that is crucial for sleep spindle generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astori et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pellegrini et al., 2016</xref>), but many studies indicate that not all TRN cells burst equally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Contreras et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunton and Charpak, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemente-Perez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Higashikubo and Moore, 2018</xref>). Then, the TRN is parcellated into at least five modality-specific sectors, sensory, motor or limbic ones, according to their innervation by a particular dorsal thalamic nucleus and the reciprocally connected cortical area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crabtree, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pinault, 2004</xref>). Moreover, optogenetic activation of TRN promotes cortical spindles or delta waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halassa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that the exact patterns of TRN cell activity may determine the contribution of these two rhythms at the cortical surface. Most recently, various discharge propensity in TRN cells was linked to the differential expression of parvalbumin (PV) or somatostatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemente-Perez et al., 2017</xref>). The number of PV-expressing cells is smaller in TRN of schizophrenic patients and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Steullet et al., 2018</xref>) in which reduced sleep spindle density is a common observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Manoach et al., 2016</xref>). Together, there is accruing evidence for marked molecular and functional TRN cell heterogeneity. However, whether TRN heterogeneity is relevant for brain correlates of NREMS has so far not been tested.</p><p>This study shows that the heterogeneous cellular properties of optogenetically identified TRN sectors are a major source of local NREMS rhythms in sensory cortices. We identify the ionic mechanisms underlying this heterogeneity and study its impact on major NREMS correlates in sensory and non-sensory cortices using genetic and chemogenetic approaches. We thereby unravel novel organizing principles of NREMS topography in mouse and show that heterogeneity in TRN sectors accounts for a previously unrecognized enrichment of fast and large sleep spindles in somatosensory cortices that are coupled to the SO. We also find that TRN heterogeneity enables rapid switching between different forms of NREMS rhythms, suggesting that this could underlie the regulation of local NREMS by use and experience.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TRN cell burst discharge propensity in acute slices varies across sensory and non-sensory sectors</title><p>To identify TRN cells belonging to a sensory sector, we used stereotaxic injections of AAV-ChR2_EYFP into somatosensory (S1, barrel field) or auditory cortex (AC) of 3- to 4-week-old mice. Non-sensory TRN sectors related to associative areas, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), were instead targeted through injections into the mediodorsal (MD) thalamic nucleus that is the input structure forming reciprocal loops with several areas of the PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mátyás et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delevich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2018</xref>) and that forms reciprocal circuits with the TRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mitchell, 2015</xref>). Enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) fluorescence was present at injection sites and in restricted portions of TRN 3–4 weeks after injection, as verified on coronal sections stained immunohistochemically for PV to delineate the dorso-ventral extent of the TRN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The observed sectorial portions coincided with the ones established previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pinault and Deschênes, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pinault, 2004</xref>). Thus, injections into S1 revealed fibers navigating through the postero-dorsal portion of the TRN that terminated in elongated fluorescent spots in the thalamic ventral posterior medial nucleus corresponding to thalamic barreloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourassa et al., 1995</xref>). AC injections resulted in fluorescent labeling of postero-central regions of the TRN that are anterior to the medial geniculate nucleus. Finally, MD injections labeled antero-ventral portions of the TRN, overlapping with TRN areas innervating motor and intralaminar nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pinault and Deschênes, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pinault, 2004</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39111.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of TRN sectors through anterograde tracing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme illustrating injection of AAV-ChR2_EYFP into S1 (top), AC (middle) and MD (bottom). (<bold>B</bold>) Epifluorescent micrographs of coronal sections at 2.5x magnification, anteroposterior position indicated with respect to bregma (Bg).

Rebound oscillatory bursting hallmarks the capacity of TRN cells to engage in rhythm generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astori et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wimmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemente-Perez et al., 2017</xref>). S1- and AC-innervated TRN cells showed the rhythmic, repetitive burst discharge described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cueni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astori et al., 2011</xref>), evident as several groups of high-frequency action potentials each riding on a triangular-shaped membrane depolarization and followed by a pronounced afterhyperpolarization. Repetitive burst discharge strongly depended on the membrane voltage, showing an inverted U-shaped voltage dependence that peaked at -65 to -60 mV for S1-innervated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D1,E</xref>). Only 1/12 S1-innervated TRN cells was a non-repetitive bursting cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Similar burst propensity was found for TRN cells innervated from AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), but 4/13 cells were non-repetitive bursters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Similar, yet weaker rhythmic activity was observed in AC and PFC. The PFC showed signals dominated by slow events, as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernandez et al., 2017</xref>), which included a component around 4 Hz resembling a respiratory-related rhythm in frontal brain areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhong et al., 2017</xref>). Power spectral analyses over total NREMS times of 2200–6100 s per animal (average 4487 ± 603 s, concatenated from NREMS bouts across recording days) showed that NREMS in all recorded areas had broadly elevated power in the low-frequency range covering both the SO and the delta range (0.5–4 Hz), whereas a ‘shoulder’ in the sigma band was present only in somatosensory areas (n = 9 for S1 and n = 8 for S2) but not in AC (n = 6) and PFC (n = 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>NREMS in animals lacking Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels showed several marked changes that were apparent in both the raw traces and in characteristic alterations of the power spectra (NREMS recording times of 1800–7000 s per animal, average 3459 ± 421 s). First, there was a striking lack of visually recognizable sleep spindle activity in S1 and S2, and a sigma power shoulder was not present in the power spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>, bottom panel showing enlarged portions of the power spectrum and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Second, activity in the delta range was augmented, whereas the SO was less prominent in LFP traces from S1, S2 and AC. These visual observations manifested as a rightward shift of the low-frequency activity in the power spectrum, with a clear power peak present in the delta band that dominated over power values &lt; 1.5 Hz. The power spectra for WT and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 KO animals intersected in the slow frequencies around 1.6–1.8 Hz for S1, S2 and AC, suggesting a consistent spectral border between the SO and the delta bands. Separate quantification of total power in the SO, the delta and the sigma frequency band confirmed these observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). After Bonferroni correction, the sigma power reduction in S1 appeared as a trend. However, this is an underestimation because the difference between the two curves extends up to ~18 Hz. In PFC, in contrast, no alterations in the power spectrum were observed, with in particular no significant change in the sigma power and in the SO peak. The delta band was not analyzed in this area due to the superposition of the respiratory rhythm on top of the delta waves.</p><p>Together, the lack of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels altered the spectral mix of NREMS in sensory circuits, whereby power in the delta frequency band became overrepresented compared to the SO. This shift was greatest in S1 and S2, where in addition sigma power activity was suppressed. In contrast, the PFC did not show these alterations in two of the three major frequency bands, suggesting a minor dependence on Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Chemogenetic inhibition of TRN cells reproduces the switch from spindle- to delta-enriched sleep</title><p>The results from Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 KO animals suggest that strong Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3-dependent burst discharge is required for spindle-enriched NREMS. Therefore, acute reduction of TRN excitability to suppress bursting should also deplete spindles and lead to a NREMS enriched in delta waves. To test this, we hyperpolarized TRN cells with a chemogenetic approach, whereby we expressed the inhibitory DREADD receptor hM4Di in VGAT-Ires-Cre animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vong et al., 2011</xref>) through bilateral injection of AAV-hM4D(Gi)_mCherry or AAV-hM4D(Gi)_IRES_mCitrine in the region of the somatosensory TRN sector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In acute slices prepared 3 weeks after injection, bath application of the DREADD-ligand Clozapine N-oxide (CNO, 10 μM) induced a marked membrane hyperpolarization (ΔV = −13.9 ± 1.5 mV, n = 10, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, p=6×10<sup>−6</sup>) of fluorescent cells held in whole-cell current-clamp at resting membrane potentials ranging from −50 to −70 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Cellular input resistance was reduced and rebound burst discharge suppressed in the continuous presence of CNO. Bursting could be recovered upon direct current (d.c.) injection to restore the original membrane potential (d.c. injection tested in n = 3 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Non-fluorescent cells in the vicinity of the injected area did not respond to CNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This result is consistent with CNO-induced activation of K<sup>+</sup> conductances and shows that TRN neurons become silenced without impairing rebound bursting and action potential firing. Treatment with CNO thus overall reduces TRN excitability, and in particular specifically reproduces the decreased burst propensity of TRN cells found in the Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3-KO animals that is relevant for the altered NREMS spectral properties.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39111.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Chemogenetic hyperpolarization of TRN cells mimics the NREMS phenotype of the Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 KO mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative membrane voltage recording of a whole-cell patch-clamped TRN cell <italic>in vitro</italic> exposed to CNO (10 μM, bath application indicated by horizontal bar) recorded in a slice from a mouse injected with AAV8-hM4D(Gi)_IRES_mCitrine. The cell was injected every 10 s with brief negative current pulses to elicit rebound discharge.

It arises through heterogeneity in thalamic circuits and correlates with variable oscillatory bursting propensity across TRN sectors. Strong Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3-dependent bursting in the somatosensory TRN sector led to local NREMS with fast and large spindles coupled to the SO, whereas this was not the case for cortical areas corresponding to TRN sectors with weakly bursting cells. Intriguingly, high burst propensity was also coupled to a dual regulation of local NREMS, such that the SO and spindles could be suppressed in favor of delta waves. Sectorial attributes of TRN circuits thus emerge as a powerful source for local NREMS correlates. They additionally facilitate a tuning of NREMS between major spectral correlates, offering a candidate mechanism for local sleep modulation, possibly in response to use, experience and learning. A sectorial heterogeneity of TRN will also advance insight into a proposed common vulnerability of TRN circuitry for both sleep as well as wakefulness-driven selective attention in neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krol et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The TRN has been traditionally regarded as a homogeneous sleep rhythm pacemaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fuentealba and Steriade, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fogerson and Huguenard, 2016</xref>) that underlies global thalamic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Halassa and Acsády, 2016</xref>). Although its molecular and functional heterogeneity is increasingly recognized, consequences for NREMS are so far poorly explored and the role of sector-specific TRN cell characteristics is unknown. Thus, it is not clear whether heterogeneous cellular discharge properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Contreras et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunton and Charpak, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Higashikubo and Moore, 2018</xref>) or variable expression of PV and somatostatin are important for local sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemente-Perez et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, sensory but not limbic TRN cells preferentially engage in sleep-related activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Halassa et al., 2014</xref>), but it is not known whether they are cellularly distinct. Therefore, this study is the first to bring together TRN heterogeneities at both the <italic>in vitro</italic> and the <italic>in vivo</italic> levels using optogenetically assisted mapping of TRN sectors. We show that cellular heterogeneities align with identified TRN sectors, and TRN sectors with area-specific NREMS, thus establishing the TRN sector-specific cellular properties as a source for local and tunable NREMS. Based on a previous study demonstrating that PV-positive cells are stronger bursters than cells enriched in somatostatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemente-Perez et al., 2017</xref>), we propose that PV-positive TRN cells are primary determinants of the unique sleep spindle properties in somatosensory cortex.</p><p>The focus on NREMS in specific cortical areas using LFP recordings, combined with genetic and chemogenetic manipulation and cellular analysis, reveals novel and surprising topographical aspects of mouse NREMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Terrier and Gottesmann, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernandez et al., 2017</xref>). One remarkable observation is that somatosensory cortices showed a clear sigma power ‘shoulder’ and strong, fast, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3-dependent spindle events. The widespread idea from EEG recordings that sleep spindle generation in mouse NREMS is weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astori et al., 2011</xref>) should thus be revised as we now show that full-fledged spindle activity is generated in local regions of the mouse brain. The highly focal synaptic organization of the barrel system, where TRN-thalamic, thalamocortical and corticothalamic projections between barreloid and barrel topographically match on a cell-to-cell basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Desîlets-Roy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wimmer et al., 2010</xref>), together with a high density of PV-positive, bursty cells in the TRN somatosensory sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemente-Perez et al., 2017</xref>), are likely important anatomical substrates enabling strong local spindles. The tight alignment of thalamic unit and S1 LFP activity recorded simultaneously during spindles in urethane anaesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rovó et al., 2014</xref>) supports this interpretation. We also observed prominent sigma power and high-amplitude spindles in S2 that exceeded levels in S1. High reciprocal cortical connectivity between S1 and S2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feldmeyer et al., 2013</xref>), and a differential recruitment of first- and higher order thalamic nuclei in these two areas, could be some of the reasons behind this difference. In contrast to S1 and S2, no discernable sigma power shoulder was present in AC, and detected spindles showed no dependence on the Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel. We found a tendency for a decreased density of highly burst-prone cells in mouse, which possibly reduces the strength of spindle generation in auditory sectors. It also remains to be seen whether there exist functional and anatomical differences in the overall connectivity of each sensory TRN sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crabtree, 1999</xref>). Similarly, the spectral composition of NREMS in pre- and infralimbic portions of the PFC showed no prominent sigma power and no overall dependence on Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels, consistent with a minor expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels in the MD-innervated sector and with the presence of a majority of somatostatin-positive, weakly bursting cells in these areas of the TRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemente-Perez et al., 2017</xref>). However, discrete spindles could be detected in mouse and they are well-described for rat PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Siapas and Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peyrache et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maingret et al., 2016</xref>). Discrete spindle events were accompanied by a phase entrainment of TRN discharge in sleeping rats, although mean firing rates seemed low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>). There could thus be a spindle-generating circuitry independent of the powerful Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3-dependent mechanisms in sensory TC loops, in which anterior and midline thalamic nuclei and hippocampus are involved. Such ideas remain to be tested also regarding the notion of distinct frontal spindles in both human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schabus et al., 2007</xref>) and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Power in the SO band was consistently co-modulated with sleep spindle activity in both the Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 KO mouse and during chemogenetic TRN inhibition. This could be evidence in favor of a role of TRN in the generation of the SO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crunelli et al., 2015</xref>). Our chemogenetic results generally support the idea that the TRN sustains low-frequency activity in cortico-thalamocortical loops, an effect which could possibly also result secondarily from its phasic recruitment by cortex to generate sleep spindles. Also, the increase of delta power could have de-emphasized the relative presence of SOs. Additionally, possible roles of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels in cortically generated rhythms could arise from a subgroup of cortical interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The genetic removal of the Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel enhanced delta power in S1 and S2 at the expense of sleep spindles. Chemogenetic hyperpolarization reproduced this observation closely. Although the chemogenetic approach suppresses excitability in a manner that is not limited to bursting, the close correspondence with the observations in the Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3-KO animals, in which only bursting but not tonic firing is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astori et al., 2011</xref>), strongly suggests that suppressed bursting, which is the common denominator of both experimental approaches, is the principal mechanism involved in the effects at the level of NREMS. While the reduction in sleep spindle activity under these conditions is expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astori et al., 2011</xref>), an enhancement and/or unmasking of delta wave-generating activity in thalamocortical circuits has now become apparent thanks to the locality of our recordings. It is reminiscent of previous observations of an opposite regulation of slow wave/delta and spindle power during NREMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dijk et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Steriade et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franken et al., 1998</xref>), which has been explained based on the different membrane potential polarizations of TC cells involved in spindle or delta rhythm generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nuñez et al., 1992</xref>). Here, we identify TRN cell membrane potential polarization as a determinant for such regulation in somatosensory thalamocortical circuits during NREMS. Remarkably, the capability of TRN in generating either spindles or delta waves was also evident based on whether brief or prolonged optogenetic stimulation was applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halassa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>). This underscores the power of TRN-dependent inhibition in controlling thalamocortical synchrony according to discharge patterns. We add to this the capability of a local, switchable tuning of NREMS spectral properties in somatosensory cortex. In agreement with pioneering work on delta waves, we propose that TRN hyperpolarization liberates TC cells from phasic hyperpolarization to engage in a clock-like rhythm at delta frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Steriade et al., 1993</xref>). Results consistent with this interpretation were also obtained in animals doubly deficient in Ca<sub>V</sub>3 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pellegrini et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, it was also shown that optogenetic inhibition of anterior TRN cells may suppress rather than strengthen low-frequency EEG activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Herrera et al., 2016</xref>), yet this effect occurred with a 10-s-long delay after acute inhibition of TRN cell discharge.</p><p>The powerful control of delta power by TRN-dependent mechanism could be relevant for the role of delta waves in the homeostatic regulation of NREMS. The increase in low-frequency power of NREMS over the 0.75–4 Hz power band, referred to as slow-wave activity, is the most widely used marker to quantify homeostatic sleep pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borbély and Tobler, 2011</xref>). We find here that slow-wave activity contains a thalamically controlled component that can be rapidly and bidirectionally modulated through TRN membrane polarization. Such mechanisms could contribute to sleep-deprivation induced boosting of the high- but not the low-frequency component of slow-wave activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achermann and Borbély, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huber et al., 2000</xref>). Bidirectional regulation of slow-wave activity in local brain areas according to use dependence has also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kattler et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pigarev et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vyazovskiy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miyamoto and Hensch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huber et al., 2006</xref>). More complex localized alterations in NREMS are observed following exposure to learning tasks that involve enhanced power in both the low-frequency range (SO and delta waves in the slow wave activity frequency range of 0.5–4 Hz) and in the fast sleep spindle range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huber et al., 2004</xref>). Learning tasks involving motor cortex increase the density of individual spindle events in a manner specifically restricted to motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>) or augmented both slow wave and sleep spindle power in supplementary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tamaki et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, cortical modules are capable of generating qualitatively different forms of local NREMS spontaneously and according to recent use and experience. Membrane potential polarization within TRN sectors could represent a powerful addition to previously proposed mechanisms that primarily imply changes in cortical synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>). Both ascending brainstem and basal forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McCormick and Bal, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beierlein, 2014</xref>) as well as descending cortical inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McCormick and von Krosigk, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) regulate TRN membrane potential and burst propensity. Whether differential neuromodulation of TRN sectors contributes to use- and experience-dependent sleep regulation remains an intriguing topic for further study.</p><p>Compromised sleep spindle generation is a promising read-out for neuropsychiatric disorders involving aberrant sensory percepts and attentional deficits, such as schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Manoach et al., 2016</xref>). In large-scale genome-wide association studies, the gene encoding Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels ranks in the top list of candidate risk genes in schizophrenia, together with several genes that are highly enriched in TRN and implied in repetitive burst discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krol et al., 2018</xref>). Based on our data, we propose that wake-related deficits in some of these patients may show a specificity for certain sensory modalities that co-vary with local deficits in sleep spindles and their coupling to the SO. This could help to further refine the classification and diagnosis of these complex disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 KO</td><td>PMID: 21808016</td><td>MGI:5637591</td><td>generated by <break/>Dr. H.

Recording glass pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (TW150F-4) (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) with a DMZ horizontal puller (Zeitz Instruments, Martinsried, Germany) to a final resistance of 2–4 MΩ. Pipettes were filled with a K<sup>+</sup>-based intracellular solution that contained in mM: KGluconate 140, Hepes 10, KCl 10, EGTA 0.1, phosphocreatine 10, Mg-ATP 4, Na-GTP 0.4, pH 7.3, 290–305 mOsm, supplemented with ~2 mg/ml of neurobiotin (Vector Labs, Servion, Switzerland). Slices were placed in the recording chamber of an upright microscope (Olympus BX50WI, Volketswil, Switzerland) and continuously superfused at room temperature with oxygenated ACSF containing in mM: NaCl 131, KCl 2.5, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.25, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 26, <italic>D-</italic>glucose 20, <italic>L(+)-</italic>ascorbic acid 1.7, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2 and MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1.2, picrotoxin 0.1, glycine 0.01. Cells were visualized with differential interference contrast optics and 10X and 40X immersion objectives. Infrared images were acquired with an iXon Camera X2481 (Andor, Belfast, Northern Ireland). Signals were amplified using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, digitized via a Digidata1322A and sampled at 10 kHz with Clampex10.2 (Molecular Devices, San José, CA). Immediately after gaining whole-cell access, cell capacitance C<sub>m</sub> was measured in voltage-clamp at −60 mV through applying 500 ms-long, 20 mV hyperpolarizing steps (5 steps/cell). Whole-field blue LED (Cairn Res, Faversham, UK) stimulation (455 nm, duration: 0.1 to 1 ms, maximal light intensity 0.16 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) in voltage-clamp (−60 mV) was used to assess the connectivity of TRN neurons through fibers arising from the previously injected area (S1, AC or MD). Once identified, squared somatic current injections (−50 to −300 pA for 500 ms, 4 injections/cell and membrane potential) hyperpolarized neurons below −100 mV from membrane potentials between −90 and −50 mV (corrected for a liquid junction potential of 10 mV) and induced repetitive burst discharge in TRN neurons. For comparison between neurons from different TRN sectors, the response to this current injection was also used to assess cellular input resistance R<sub>i</sub>. For CNO application, a stable baseline of at least 2 min was recorded before bath application of water-soluble CNO (10 µM, Tocris, Bristol, UK) for at least 2 min until its hyperpolarizing effect reached a plateau. Washout of CNO did not reverse the hyperpolarizing effect for up to 10 min of washout. Two VPM and two TRN neurons outside the visually identified fluorescent site of injection were used as control for CNO’s effect on membrane potential.</p><p>Cell parameters were calculated on Clampfit v.10.2. and IgorPro Wavemetrics (Lake Oswego, OR). Input and access resistances were evaluated all along the recordings. Neurons presenting a variation of the access resistance &gt;20% or a holding current at −60 mV &lt; −150 pA were excluded from analysis. Light-evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes were measured in traces presenting monophasic synaptic events that occurred at fixed latency after LED onset and that were not contaminated by asynchronous release. In the subset of neurons that underwent paired-pulse stimulation, traces containing spontaneous activity between the two LED stimulations were discarded. Paired-pulse ratios are expressed as percentage of the second over the first EPSC amplitude (6 paired-stimuli/cell). The bursting of TRN neurons was assessed by counting the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes following a 500 ms hyperpolarization below −100 mV. Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes were counted as bursts if they generated triangular-shaped membrane depolarizations followed by a clear afterhyperpolarization, regardless of the presence of high-frequency action potentials on top of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> multi-site electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Surgery was performed as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lecci et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, animals were subjected to gas anaesthesia (isoflurane supplemented with a mixture O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O) and small craniotomies (0.3–0.5 mm) were performed at the location for implantation of high-impedance fine tungsten LFP microelectrodes (10–12 MΩ, 75 µm shaft diameter, FHC, Bowdoin, ME) at the following sites (in stereotaxic coordinates, relative to bregma: anteroposterior, lateral, depth from surface): sensory regions S1 (−1.7, 3.0, -1.0), S2 (−0.7, 4.2, -1.1), and AC (−2.5, 4.0, -1.1), limbic areas of PFC (+1.8, 0.3, -1.85). Implantations were guided through calculating the corresponding interaural coordinates. As a neutral reference for LFP electrodes, a silver wire (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) was inserted in the bone over lateral portions of the cerebellum. On the contralateral skull site, two conventional gold-coated low-impedance electrodes were implanted over the <italic>dura mater</italic> through frontal and parietal bones for differential surface EEG recordings. Two gold pellets inserted into the muscles of the neck served as EMG electrodes. Multi-site recordings were carried out in head-restrained conditions, for which a light-weight metal head-post (Bourgeois Mécanique SAS, Lyon, France) was glued and cemented onto the midline skull in order to perform painless head-fixed recording sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernandez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lecci et al., 2017</xref>). Carprofen (5 mg/kg, i.p.) and paracetamol (2 mg/mL, drinking water) were provided during the pre- and post-operative periods. Mice were gently and gradually habituated to a custom-made head-fixation system (Bourgeois Mécanique SAS, Lyon, France) by increasing the amount of time spent in head fixation daily from 10 to 30 min to 2–3 hr/day. Mice sat within a cardboard roll such that only the head protruded. Occasionally, a heating pad was placed underneath the cardboard. After each head-restrained period, mice were rewarded with <italic>ad libitum</italic> drops of sweetened water. Mice typically started sleeping spontaneously after 7–14 d of habituation, generating periods of both NREMS and REMS. LFP and EEG/EMG signals were amplified 1000x through a 16-channel Multiple Acquisition Processor System (Plexon Inc., Dallas, TX), high- and low-pass filtered at 0.8 and 300 Hz, respectively, and digitized at 1 kHz. For multi-site recordings, 5 WT and 6 Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 KO animals had all four recording sites histologically confirmed, 1 WT (S1, S2, PFC) and 3 Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 KO (2x S1, S2, AC; 1x S1, S2, PFC) animals had three confirmed recording sites, 3 WT (1x S1, AC; 2x S1, S2) and 4 Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 KO (S1, S2) animals had two confirmed sites. Four animals were excluded because recording sites could not be identified or because brain appearance was not satisfying (ventricle dilatation or damaged brain slice).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> chemogenetics</title><p>After 1 week of recovery from viral injection, bilateral S1 LFP electrodes, and EEG/EMG electrodes were implanted as described above, followed by a week of recovery. After 4 days of habituation to the tethering cable, baseline activity was recorded in freely moving conditions during 3 to 4 days. 3 weeks after viral injections, intra-peritoneal injection of CNO (water-soluble diluted in NaCl 0.9%, dosis 1 mg/kg, Ref. 6329, Tocris, Bristol, UK) or NaCl 0.9% was performed at Zeitgeber time ZT2 in a random cross-over design, with the experimenter blind to the injection. Recordings under each condition took place on 4–5 successive days, with 2–3 CNO and 1–2 NaCl injections per animal. Signals were acquired at 1 kHz with an Intan digital RHD2132 amplifier board and a RHD2000 USB Interface board, with a high-pass filter set at 0.8 Hz (Intan Technologies, Los Angeles, CA). Data were acquired in Matlab using the RHD2000 Matlab toolbox and customized display software in Matlab. To assess the time course of CNO action, 3 DREADD-mCherry and 3 AAV8-control animals were recorded starting at ZT0. Based on these dynamics, we chose a window of 45 min (starting 20 min after the injection) for comparison of CNO and NaCl effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,D</xref>). The average power spectrum per animal was calculated as mean between recording sites and repetition-days for the two conditions (CNO or NaCl). Spectral analysis of the signals was performed as described in the data analysis section. For chemogenetic recordings, a total of 3 DREADD-mCherry and 2 control AAV8 mice had bilateral S1 recording sites histologically confirmed, 2 DREADD-mCherry and 1 control AAV8 had one confirmed S1 recording sites.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Histology and immunofluorescent labeling</title><p>After completion of patch-clamp recordings <italic>in vitro</italic>, slices were post-fixed in paraformaldehyde (4%) for &gt;24 hr. An immunostaining on free-floating sections was used to outline PV-positive (PV+) neurons in the TRN and to recover neurobiotin-filled neurons. To ensure proper staining of PV+ neurons, a 5-day incubation at 4°C of the primary antibody (mouse anti-PV, 1/4000, Swant Inc., Marly, Switzerland) in 1% Triton was required. The secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse CY5, 1/500, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Ely, Nevada) and Streptavidin (coupled with Alexa Fluor 594, 1/8000, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were incubated at 4°C for 24 hr.

Drowsiness period between wakefulness and NREMS were discarded, as well as intermediate sleep periods between NREMS and REMS. Only consolidated clear episodes of NREMS were selected for the analysis: high amplitude voltage and slow EEG components, such as periods of slow oscillation (&lt;1.5 Hz), delta waves (1.5–4 Hz) and spindles (10–15 Hz). REMS was clearly distinguishable with reduced EMG activity (atonia) and predominant theta (~6–10 Hz) on the low-amplitude EEG.

The onset and offset times of a spindle event were extended to the closest cycle at 0 crossing before and after the threshold. Events that were overlapping or that were separated by &lt;10 ms were fused. Events that were at the beginning time point or last time point of a NREMS bout were discarded. Amplitudes of spindles were computed from the average amplitude of the sigma power between onset and offset time and averaged per mouse. Frequency of spindles were determined by extracting the peak frequency from the magnitude FFT on each spindle event (86.3% of events had a distinguishable frequency peak and were included), followed by calculating the mean intra-frequency per mouse. Two WT mice with S1 and S2 recording sites were omitted due to an unusually reduced signal amplitude that prevented comparison to other mice (note that no normalization was applied for spindle detection).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-5"><title>Slow oscillation detection</title><p>Periods of clear and visible SOs were detected based on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mölle et al., 2009</xref>).

The mean minima (Y1) and the mean maxima (Y2) as well as their difference (Y2-Y1) were calculated. Constraints for selecting periods of SOs were: (1) times between x1 and x2 were comprised between 0.5 s and 2 s, (2) if y1 was lower than 2/3 of the mean Y1, (3) y2-y1 was at least 2/3 of Y2-Y1. These constraints allowed to select the largest SOs periods. Only events that had a time overlap ≥95% to a SO were selected for the phase-locking analysis.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jeanne Paz (Reviewer #2); Christopher I Moore (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study by Fernandez et al. identifies the TRN as a source for local, sensory-cortex-specific non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) in mouse. The writing is clear, and the methodology and results are for the most part (see below), very strong. The authors put forward a clear case that local field potential recordings from different cortical regions exhibit distinct NREMS-related activity patterns, and link these to burst firing in associated areas of the TRN. In brain slices, they confirm that parts of TRN associated with sensory or non-sensory cortex show different bursting activity, and that this distinction is lost in CaV3.3 knockout mice. The authors conclude that the CaV3.3 channel endows higher bursting capacity to sensory over non-sensory TRN cells. Sensory cortices (especially S1) have more σ band activity and spindles compared to non-sensory (PFC), while reducing bursting by knocking out CaV3.3 or inhibiting TRN via DREADDS is sufficient to interfere with normal bursting, and shifts relative signal power away from σ and toward δ.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) CNO induced hyperpolarization does not simply reduce TRN bursting.

This is not very well rationalized.</p></disp-quote><p>The strategy to target a non-sensory area of the TRN was based on available classic literature that points to the MD as a major associative thalamic nucleus interacting with non-sensory TRN portions (see e.g. Pinault and Deschênes, 1998; Mitchell, 2016). Moreover, MD-prefrontal connections form important reciprocal thalamocortical loops (Delevich et al., 2015; Collins et al., 2018). In contrast, the literature on the anatomy of prefrontal-TRN synaptic projections is scarce in rodent, and the relationship between the multiple corticothalamic projections into the mouse MD (Mátyás et al., 2014) and their innervation of TRN is not known. Therefore, the identification of non-sensory TRN sectors was based on targeting the clearly identifiable MD. Based on the reviewer’s note, we have now further rationalized this point in the first paragraph of the subsection “TRN cell burst discharge propensity in acute slices varies across sensory and non-sensory sectors”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Discussion is quite long and speculative, arguably going beyond what is warranted from the specific results in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have accommodated this important concern mainly through two changes.

The point here is that we worked with an a priori functional specification of thalamocortical circuits in which cellular properties were then studied. This also allowed to make a strong case for a subcortical determinant of local sleep properties, the TRN. To make this point more clear, we have reworded our statement in the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Spindle power is mainly seen in S2. The reasons for this are not very well developed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that spindle power is very pronounced in S2, the secondary somatosensory cortex known to be involved in sensory discrimination. We understand the reviewer’s comments as asking for the possible mechanistic reasons underlying this observation. A comprehensive answer would require additional studies to define the sources of sleep spindles in S2. For example, opto- or chemogenetic inhibition of S1 would help decide whether the well-described strong reciprocal wiring with the barrel cortex in S1 (Feldmeyer et al., 2013) is implied in amplifying spindles in S2. Furthermore, there is the possibility of a differential involvement of first- and higher-order thalamic nuclei in sleep spindle generation in S1 compared to S2. This question would also be addressable using opto- or chemogenetic interference. These possibilities remain open to experimentation and could shed light on what are probably multiple origins of cortical spindles. We allude to these possibilities through adding an additional sentence to the third paragraph of the Discussion.<italic>6) To determine if the alterations in NREMS of CaV3.3-/- animals were caused by suppressed TRN burst discharge the authors used chemogenetic inhibition of TRN cells and found that they could reproduce the switch from spindle- to δ-enriched sleep.

Lewis et al., 2015 had showed that tonic optical activation of TRN enhances δ power in the cortex which seems inconsistent with the findings described in this study. How do the authors explain this discrepancy?</italic> </p><p>The reviewers note that a previously published study by Lewis et al. seems at odds with some of our observations. However, several technical and analytical points warrant attention that make us feel this conclusion is premature.</p><p>This study is mostly concerned with awake mice, only Figure 4D refers to sleeping mice. Full power spectra are not shown and power values are calculated by pooling power in the slow oscillation (0.5-1.5 Hz) and δ (1.5-4 Hz) frequency ranges. This makes a separate assessment of effect on slow oscillations and δ waves not possible. Electrodes used in this study were bundles implanted by hand, which is unlikely to lead to a reliable positioning in a defined cortical layer. In our work, all electrode positioning in the spindle-power rich deep cortical layers were verified post-hoc, and proper positioning was an important inclusion criterion. Finally, the effects of optogenetic stimulation of TRN cells reported by Lewis et al. are ambiguous: tonic TRN optogenetic stimulation actually <underline>de</underline>creased rather than increased firing rate in a majority of TRN cells (58.8%) in awake mice. Overall, the intended tonic excitation of TRN seems thus to have resulted in a substantial inhibition of these cells.</p><p>Together, we feel that it is premature to claim that the findings by Lewis et al. are inconsistent with ours. On the contrary, we argue that the predominant inhibition of TRN cells by optogenetic stimulation makes their observations possibly quite compatible with ours. In further support of this, it is mentioned in the text that spindle power actually decreases, an observation that we also make. However, likely differences in the precision of the recording sites, different analysis procedures and the use of different frequency bands makes final conclusions not possible at this point. Given these discrepancies, we prefer not to further discuss them in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Given the previous findings of TRN heterogeneity (Clemente, Halassa), the authors should close the loop, and determine whether the diversity in CaV 3.3 behavior they observe is actually related to the highly parallel diversity observed between PV and SOM cell types in the Clemente et al. work.

This should ideally be done at all levels, from the in vitro analysis to sleep. Given that our paper studies sleep as the read-out for TRN heterogeneity, the principal and most forward moving question is to test whether the roles of PV- and SOM-expressing cells in natural non-REM sleep are indeed different. We thus carried out a series of sleep recordings in PV-Cre and SOM-Cre mouse lines (n = 8 each) that were chemogenetically manipulated in precisely the same way as the VGAT-Ires-Cre line in the original manuscript. The results obtained are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><p>This first series of experiments indeed suggests that chemogenetic hyperpolarization of PV-, but not of SOM-expressing cells reproduces most observations found in the VGAT-Ires-Cre line, in which all TRN cells are hyperpolarized irrespective of their neurochemical nature. Thus, we find an increase in power in the δ (1.5-4 Hz) frequency band, while power in the slow oscillation (0.5-1.5 Hz) and the spindle bands (10-15 Hz) was reduced. Such changes could not be detected in the SOM-Cre expressing mouse line.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39111.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(<bold>A</bold>) Effects of chemogenetic hyperpolarization of PV-expressing TRN cells, experiment and analysis as described in Figure 4.</title><p>(<bold>B</bold>) Effects of chemogenetic hyperpolarization of SOM-expressing TRN cells, experiment and analysis as described in Figure 4.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-39111-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>These data suggest that PV-expressing TRN cells are primarily implied in the control of local non-REM sleep. This result is consistent with the cellular and in vivo optogenetics findings described by Clemente-Perez et al. and with the important role of bursting cells for local non-REM sleep identified here. It is thus a starting point in bringing together neurochemical and electrophysiological heterogeneities.</p><p>Here are our arguments that make us think that these data are nevertheless preliminary and need important controls. First, the effects in the PV-Cre line are more moderate than in the VGAT-Ires-Cre line. This could mean that PV-expressing cells are only partially responsible for local sleep control, and that there other cellular subgroups involved. Alternatively, the chemogenetic manipulation in this mouse line could be weaker or less efficient. At the moment, we cannot distinguish between these possibilities. Moreover, the histological inspection of the brains used for these recordings make us think that the PV- and the SOM-expressing cell populations might not be completely separate and/or that there might be other cell groups. Additionally, we found virally driven mCherry expression in restricted cell groups of the dorsal thalamus in some mice. These were excluded from the data shown here but nevertheless made us doubtful about whether the findings can be unambiguously attributed to PV-expressing TRN cells. Immunohistochemistry in combination with viral tracing will be required to more definitely define the chemogenetically manipulated cell types and their roles in non-REM sleep.</p><p>We think this important and exciting next step requires a separate study combining optogenetically assisted circuit mapping and chemogenetics in in vitro and in vivo assessments. This goes beyond the scope of the current work. Therefore, in the revised manuscript, we define it as an important step to clarify in the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor point:</p><p>The authors throw up their hands a little bit in the Discussion about how their algorithm might have impacted their findings.

Briefly, for every brain area we recorded, we selected spindle events in all wild-type animals that had an amplitude that fell within the mean ± 1SD of the amplitude of the spindle events in the Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3-KO animals in the corresponding brain area. The coupling of these remaining events to the slow oscillation was then again analyzed (See Author Response Image 2). The results show that the overall preferential occurrence of spindle events on the cortical upstate is preserved. This again suggests that the differential coupling between slow oscillations and spindles between WT and KO animals was not due to detection failures.
