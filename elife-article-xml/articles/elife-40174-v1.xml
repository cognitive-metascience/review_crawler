environmental conditions. However, methodological frameworks to investigate the plasticity of genetic interaction networks over time or in response to external stresses are largely lacking. To analyze the plasticity of genetic interactions, we performed a combinatorial RNAi screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells at multiple time points and after pharmacological inhibition of Ras signaling activity. Using an image-based morphology assay to capture a broad range of phenotypes, we assessed the effect of 12768 pairwise RNAi perturbations in six different conditions. We found that genetic interactions form in different trajectories and developed an algorithm, termed MODIFI, to analyze how genetic interactions rewire over time. Using this framework, we identified more statistically significant interactions compared to end-point assays and further observed several examples of context-dependent crosstalk between signaling pathways such as an interaction between Ras and Rel which is dependent on MEK activity.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

Although different communication routes – so called signaling pathways – control different cell activities, they do not work in isolation. Instead, they form part of larger regulatory networks that maintain the cell in an appropriate state. As such, changing the activity of one pathway may in turn affect another seemingly unrelated pathway.</p><p>The Ras signaling pathway helps to control when cells divide. When this signaling is not regulated correctly, cells can start to divide uncontrollably, leading to cancer. Drugs that suppress the activity of overactive Ras pathways could help to treat cancer. But how do the wider regulatory networks in the cell rewire themselves over time in response to this treatment?</p><p>To investigate this question, Heigwer et al. used a method called RNA interference to alter the activity of different pairs of 168 genes in fruit fly cells that had been grown in the laboratory. This meant 12,768 gene interactions were examined in total. Some of the cells had been treated with a drug that suppresses Ras signaling. By developing a new cell imaging and analysis system, Heigwer et al. could examine how the cell’s regulatory networks were affected by the drug at three different time points after treatment. The results show that housekeeping genes, which handle basic cell duties, take more time to rewire their interactions than signaling pathways.</p><p>Heigwer et al. also developed a computational method – called MODIFI – to analyze how environment and time affect how genes interact. This highlighted a number of signaling pathways that are strongly affected by the suppression of Ras signaling, including an unexpected immune signaling pathway.</p><p>In the future, more research will be needed to study the context-dependency of interactions between genetic networks in different cell types and in living organisms. A better understanding of this context-dependency will be important to understand how cancerous cells develop drug resistance. The data collected by Heigwer et al. could also be used by other researchers to explain any unexpected gene interactions that affect the signaling pathways they are studying.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genetics</kwd><kwd>systems genetics</kwd><kwd>genetic interactions</kwd><kwd>image-based phenotyping</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>computational biology</kwd><kwd>image analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SYNGENE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heigwer</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name><name><surname>Scheeder</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name><name><surname>Miersch</surname><given-names>Thilo</given-names></name><name><surname>Schmitt</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name><name><surname>Blass</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name><name><surname>Pour Jamnani</surname><given-names>Mischan Vali</given-names></name><name><surname>Boutros</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic interaction analysis by combinatorial genetic perturbation and high-throughput imaging maps time- and context-dependent crosstalk between signaling pathways.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene-gene interactions – the epistatic influences of one gene’s effect on the function of another gene – have widespread effects on cellular and organismal phenotypes, ranging from fitness defects in unicellular organisms to interactions between germline and somatic variants in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baryshnikova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Billmann and Boutros, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boone et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burgess, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ideker and Krogan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Phillips, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Taylor and Ehrenreich, 2015</xref>).

To create genetic interaction maps, these studies systematically identified alleviating (e.g. better fitness than expected) or aggravating (e.g. worse fitness than expected) genetic interactions, which can then be used to generate ‘genetic interaction profiles’ for each gene. Several studies have shown that genes involved in the same cellular processes have highly similar genetic interaction profiles, which therefore can be used to create maps of cellular processes at a genome-wide scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Costanzo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Costanzo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rauscher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition to univariate phenotypes, such as fitness and growth phenotypes of cells or organisms, genetic interactions can be measured for a broader spectrum of phenotypes by microscopy and image-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Horn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Laufer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roguev et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, by allowing to infer the direction of specific genetic interactions, multivariate phenotypes further opened the possibility to predict a hierarchy of epistatic relationships of components in genetic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To date, most studies of genetic interactions focused on ‘static’ environmental conditions (e.g. under optimal culture conditions), ignoring the impact of context-dependent changes. Recently, several studies have more specifically analyzed the influence of environmental changes on genetic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Billmann and Boutros, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Díaz-Mejía et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guénolé et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Martin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">St Onge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandyopadhyay et al. (2010)</xref> defined static, positive and negative differential interactions that vary under changing environmental conditions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Billmann and Boutros, 2017</xref>) used extrinsic and intrinsic changes of Wnt signaling in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells to map differential genetic interactions using a pathway-centric functional readout. These studies demonstrated that widespread changes in genetic interactions occur upon changes in environmental conditions. RNA interference (RNAi) can be used to perturb gene function with high efficiency and specificity to study gene function and map genetic interactions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heigwer et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Upon treatment, for example, with small molecules, genetic interactions change over time due to time-dependent inhibition of components or other changes in the underlying composition of its molecular constituents. To date, little is known about the trajectories genetic interaction networks ‘rewire’ over time and models for their analysis as well as proof-of-principle data sets are missing. In this study, we devised an experimental and analytical approach to gain insights into higher order (e.g. gene-gene-drug) interactions. To analyze how genetic interactions manifest over time, we used a high-throughput, image-based, multivariate phenotypic readout. By combining combinatorial RNAi with a MEK inhibitor or control treatment, we measured higher order chemo-genetic interactions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells to gain new insights into the wiring diagram of the Ras signaling cascade.</p><p>Ras signaling is an important oncogenic pathway and Ras and EGFR family proteins are frequently mutated in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 2005</xref>). MEK1/2 (the ortholog of Drosophila <italic>Dsor1</italic>) acts downstream of Ras and phosphorylates ERK1/2 (the ortholog of <italic>Drosophila rl</italic>), which phosphorylates many other proteins (e.g. ETS-family transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>]). The topology of the Ras signaling pathway and its key components are widely conserved between human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kolch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Perrimon, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wassarman et al., 1995</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the Ras-pathway has been implicated in early embryonic patterning, growth of wing imaginal discs, differentiation of photoreceptors and blood cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Prober and Edgar, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wassarman et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we first performed a series of high-throughput image-based genome-wide RNAi screens to identify a set of 168 genes with phenotypic profiles sensitive to MEK inhibition. To construct the differential genetic interaction network, we then created a 168 × 76 double-perturbation matrix and measured the effect of 12,768 gene-gene perturbations under differential time and treatment conditions. These perturbations were characterized by 16 reproducible and non-redundant phenotypic features. Notably, we assessed how each treatment-sensitive interaction changes over time and used this information to construct maps of context-dependent biological modules. Context-dependent interactions mapped the plasticity of Ras signaling and cross-talk to other signaling pathways, such as <italic>Rel</italic> and Stat signaling. Our analyses help to better understand the principles of interaction changes in higher order combinations of genetic perturbations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Time-dependent genetic interactions</title><p>Previous studies defined positive differential, negative differential and stable interactions between two genes associated with changes in environmental conditions such as DNA-damage inducing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">St Onge et al., 2007</xref>). Positive differential interactions are newly forming under stress conditions and mark resistance or other mechanisms counter-acting the noxious stimulus (e.g. drug treatment). Negative differential interactions, on the contrary, mark connections that are required for homeostasis under normal, unperturbed conditions but are either obsolete or harmful under stress conditions. Within these studies, the wiring diagrams of genetic interaction networks were studied at steady state conditions between two endpoints. The information gained from observations of isolated gene-gene-drug interactions thus missed dynamic responses of differential interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ideker and Krogan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Martin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Based on the observation that the formation of measurable genetic interactions appears to be time dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), our study aims to extend the previously established framework of differential genetic interactions by adding a time component. Often, when genetic interactions such as a synthetic sick or lethal interaction between two genes are quantified, different interactions-scores (π) are found at different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This indicates that, next to a perturbation by external stresses (e.g. chemicals), also time influences the experimental outcome of genetic interaction measurements systematically. We thus extended the theoretical concept of context-dependent interactions by adding a temporal component and distinguished time-dependent from time-independent interactions, treatment sensitive versus treatment insensitive and alleviating (rescuing) from aggravating interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By a systematic exploration of the time’s influence on stress-sensitive genetic interactions, we can gain an understanding on the mechanisms that change genetic interactions over time, and thus the possibility to map stress responsive interactions in greater depth and the chance to assess the time dependence of stress response of specific biological processes upon chemical perturbation of MEK. Thus, we asked: (i) What is the behavior of genetic interactions over time and how can we describe it? (ii) What do we learn about the genetic interaction network in response to a compound treatment when observed over time? (iii) What specific biological processes underlie time-dependent and treatment-sensitive genetic interactions. (iv) Can we in turn reveal new characteristics of the biological pathways under study, for example regulatory feedback loops in Ras signaling in response to MEK inhibition?</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40174.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genetic interactions rewire over time.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of a synthetic lethal trajectory between two genes A and B.

Hence, the identification of genes showing a phenotype as a single knockdown will likely enrich combinatorial screens for genes that form higher order interactions. To this end, we performed multiple genome-wide RNAi screens under different environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, Materials and methods, Appendix 1).</p><p>For the following gene-gene interaction analysis, we selected a set of 168 genes from the genome-wide screens that showed: (i) high reproducibility between biological replicates, (ii) high correlation between sequence-independent dsRNA reagents (Pearson’s correlation coefficient [PCC]&gt; 0.5), (iii) measurable effects that deviate from the negative controls, (iv) differential phenotypes upon <italic>Dsor1</italic> inhibition, and (v) are expressed in S2 cells (log normalized read count &gt; 0, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We also prioritized genes that were largely uncharacterized (Materials and methods, Appendix 1).

The query gene set, a subset of the 168 target genes, contained 76 well-described genes to aid biological interpretability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A time resolved co-RNAi screen to capture differential genetic interactions</title><p>To quantitatively analyze treatment-sensitive genetic interactions in a time-dependent manner, we set up an experimental design based on co-RNAi treatment and high-throughput microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A combinatorial gene-gene matrix covering 168 target genes and 76 query genes was used to measure 12768 genetic interactions under the different conditions. The library was screened under MEK (Dsor1) inhibitor and control conditions at 48, 72 and 96 hr after compound addition. The screen was performed using two sequence-independent dsRNA design replicates and in two biological replicates for each condition. In total 4.4 Mio. fluorescent images were captured, and 155 image features measured the perturbation effects for every single cell in the experiment (Appendix 1). Following automated image analysis, we transformed the phenotypic features using the generalized logarithm, normalized, centered and scaled them (Materials and methods, Appendix 1). Plates failing technical quality control (Z’-factor between <italic>RasGAP1</italic> RNAi and Diap1 RNAi &lt;0.3 and biological correlation &lt;0.6 PCC for cell number) were masked in further analysis. Overall,&lt;3% of all plates were excluded according to these criteria. Most of the 155 features showed a high reproducibility (80% having a PCC greater than 0.6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The two features cell count (relative cellular fitness) and actin eccentricity (morphology of cells) were among the features with the highest replicate correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>) and are highlighted as exemplary features in some of the following visualizations. All features that failed to meet a replicate correlation of PCC &gt;0.6 were removed, leaving 114 features for further analyses. In addition, 90% of sequence-independent dsRNA pairs correlate with a PCC &gt;0.6 with an average correlation of PCC = 0.77 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>Since many of the remaining 114 features provide redundant information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), overlap was reduced by first clustering all features according to the pairwise PCC of the genetic interactions. Second, we fixed the first feature (cell number) and removed all remaining features that correlated with PCC &gt;0.7. Third, we selected the next most reproducible and biologically interpretable feature and removed all highly correlated features; this scheme was iterated until all features were passed. The remaining 16 features (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) were selected for further analysis. As a confirmation, we verified that cell number and actin eccentricity show a weak correlation (PCC = 0.48) and thus provide independent information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). An unbiased ‘information gain’ analysis by stability selection, as carried out in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>), validated this approach showing that each of the chosen features also delivers independent but reproducible information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). As they enrich biologically interpretable and reproducibly measurable features, we however kept the features selected by correlation-based analyses. An analysis of the multivariate Z’-factors between RasGAP1, a negative regulator of Ras signaling and Pvr, a positive regulator of Ras signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>) showed a multi-variate Z’ of 0.814, indicating high assay quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>).</p><p>In a first quality control step, we systematically analyzed whether: (i) π-score analysis recapitulates earlier studies using a cell morphology readout in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> (ii) π-scores were reproducible between biological replicates, (iii) the interaction profile changed considerably when target and query genes switch roles and (iv) interaction profiles were independent for different features. To this end, we compared gene-gene interactions that overlapped between this and previous studies of genetic interactions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We found significant agreement between π-scores measured in various features in the different studies (FDR &lt;&lt; 0.1, for linear dependence between π-scores measured in different studies). We found, for example, that the DNA texture feature we used, could also explain the phospho-histone H3 staining used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fischer et al. (2015)</xref>.</p><p>Next, we confirmed a high correlation of interactions between biological replicates, as illustrated on the phenotypic features ‘DNA eccentricity’ and ‘cell number’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A,A’</xref>). As the combinatorial matrix contained all query genes also in the target gene set, we tested whether interaction phenotypes were in accordance regardless of the assignment of target and query. In theory, all interactions should be symmetric, and it should not matter which gene was assigned as target and which as query. However, in practice target and query RNAi reagents were added independently during the experiment which could skew symmetry. Our analysis demonstrated that both combinatorial conditions highly correlate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B,B’</xref>, PCC = 0.76 for cell number; PCC = 0.75 for actin eccentricity). We furthermore confirmed that different features provide independent information about genetic interactions as indicated by low correlation (PCC = −0.21 and 0.04, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C,C’</xref>). We also confirmed the suitability of our cell-based assay to score compound induced phenotypes without the need to measure its biochemical effect, and determined the ED<sub>50</sub> of the MEK-inhibitor PD-0325901 on S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). These experiments demonstrated that S2 cells show a sustained phenotypic response toward PD-0325901. A high correlation (PCC = 0.81) between small molecule and RNAi perturbation of MEK indicates high compound specificity. The most drastic phenotypic changes among a number of features occurred in a concentration window around the drug’s ED<sub>50</sub> (1.5 nM). Thus, we selected a concentration of 1.5 nM PD-0325901 as an optimal condition for the co-RNAi screening experiments. This ranges within an order of magnitude of the ED<sub>50</sub> known for treatment of mammalian tissue cells cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ciuffreda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hatzivassiliou et al., 2013</xref>). Under control conditions, phenotype vectors also reliably separated control RNAi treatments (<italic>RasGap1</italic> [<italic>RASAL3</italic>] vs. <italic>drk</italic> [<italic>GRB2</italic>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). In addition, the multi-variate Z’ factor is significantly higher than univariate Z’ using cell count only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>). We also found that the knockdown phenotypes of known Ras pathway components <italic>Dsor1 (MEK1/2)</italic> and <italic>drk</italic> showed a high correlation (PCC = 0.91, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>). Accordingly, knockdown phenotypes of genes with antagonizing function like the negative regulator of Ras signaling <italic>RasGAP1</italic> and <italic>Dsor1</italic> inversely correlate (PCC = −0.78). dsRNA targeting the same gene were also highly reproducibly producing similar phenotypic vectors (e.g. PCC<sub>RasGAP1</sub> = 0.88). Hierarchical clustering of phenotypic profiles recapitulated known functional relationships of Ras pathway components, whereas regulators of translation show distinct phenotypes. These experiments demonstrated that the morphological assay captures meaningful phenotypes for MEK inhibition, robustly distinguishes controls and groups functionally related genes into clusters of phenotypic similarity.</p><p>Following quality control, we calculated genetic interaction scores (π-scores) for each feature under each condition using a multiplicative model as described previously by Horn <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Horn et al., 2011</xref>, Materials and methods). Overall, we analyzed over 1.3 million gene-gene interactions in two conditions, three time points and 16 cellular features. 72922 interactions showed a significant deviation from the expected combinatorial phenotype. Only 9090 (12%) genetic interactions are measured significantly (moderated t-test [limma], FDR &lt; 0.1) for the cell number phenotype underlining the value of the multiparametric analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Robust linear modeling of differential genetic interactions across multiple features</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows an excerpt of the genetic interaction matrices obtained for each treatment and time condition.

We further found that MODIFI increased statistical power, identifying 147% more differential interactions across all features when compared to the best endpoint measurements (4723 vs 1907; 96 hr/rlm).

To this end, we compared the unweighted residuals of each fit with the actual experimental variance measured at each time point. If the model fails to fit the data appropriately (e.g. the comparison does not behave monotonic, or the form of the input-curve is not linear) one would expect that the residuals are unexpectedly greater than the variance. However, analyses of all interactions for each phenotypic feature reveals that this is rarely the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In most models, remaining residuals of fit are explained by the variance between biological replicates (avg. PCC = 0.96, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.92). Interestingly, this is true for all features we assessed. By initial feature transformation, centering and scaling, systematic differences between features were removed. During subsequent interaction calling, where only the residual of activity not explainable by each single gene knockdown is kept as a phenotype, specific time-dependent behaviors of features affecting each gene are removed as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Diss and Lehner, 2018</xref>). We thus concluded that the π-score dependence on time and treatment for each phenotypic feature can be reliably quantified using linear model statistics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Related genes share patterns of context-dependent interactions</title><p>Next, we quantified to what extent gene-gene interactions changed due to MEK inhibitor treatment (δ). δ serves as a surrogate for the integrated area between the trajectories of the two treatments. If δ is close to zero, only little changes occur upon treatment and high δ marks highly treatment-sensitive interactions. We found that treatment-sensitive interactions were equally likely to be positively or negatively shifted over all analyzed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, grey distribution). Of note, especially treatment-sensitive interactions of <italic>Rel (NFKB1,</italic> a downstream effector of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Imd signaling pathway, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Myllymäki et al., 2014</xref>), or Ras/Map and Jak/STAT related genes enriched as either negatively shifted π-score or positively shifted π-scores because of MEK inhibition, respectively. This implies that pathways which are positively regulated by MEK tend to form interactions that are less aggravating under MEK inhibition. Interactions formed by <italic>Rel</italic> are negatively enhanced by MEK inhibition. We further found no or little significant difference between housekeeping modules (such as proteasome, translation machinery) and all genes (p&gt;0.1, two-sided KS-test).

Interactions that are neither time-dependent nor treatment-sensitive were not covered by MODIFI (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> I, II). Among the time-dependent interactions, we observed alleviating treatment-insensitive interactions where the π-score raised over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These interactions often involve core essential genes whose influence on the phenotype (e.g. cell count) is not altered by MEK inhibition.

We found considerably more treatment-insensitive than treatment-sensitive interactions for all feature (18468 vs. 4723, 16 phenotypic features, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). While, as expected, the distribution of negative and positive interactions over all features was symmetric, specific phenotypic features capture surprisingly high numbers of alleviating (nuclear shape) or aggravating (nuclear texture) treatment-insensitive interactions. This indicates that different phenotypic features identify specific biological reactions of cells toward double gene perturbations. A possible explanation would be that different biological processes influence different cellular features, for example perturbations of the cytoskeleton organization mostly influence shape features while perturbation of nuclear factor alters mostly nuclear texture. The direction of interactions then follows the genes that are involved and so do the different features enrich distinct interaction types. Core essential housekeeping genes, for example, show exceptionally high numbers of alleviating interactions on cell shape but simultaneously display mostly aggravated phenotypes on their nuclear texture. These observations indicate a complex interdependence between specific genes under investigation and the phenotypic features that are used to assess them.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Differential genetic interactions enrich in stress responsive genes and pathways</title><p>Additionally, we found that treatment-sensitive interactions, compared to treatment-insensitive interactions, enriched in specific signaling pathways related to MEK inhibition.

Many biological processes rely on context-dependent changes in genetic requirements, from robustness of cell differentiation during development to responses of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic treatments. However, only few studies on selected phenotypes have systematically analyzed how environmental changes impact genetic interaction networks. Previous studies have analyzed genetic networks after activation of the DNA damage response signaling in yeast or changes in Wnt signaling activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Billmann and Boutros, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Díaz-Mejía et al., 2018</xref>). In these studies, positive and negative treatment-sensitive, and treatment-insensitive interactions have been determined based on fitness phenotypes or pathway reporter activity in static end-point assays. Aim of the present study was to analyze changes in genetic networks that impact a broad spectrum of phenotypes by imaging and multiparametric image analysis and to determine how treatment-sensitive interactions change over time after small molecule perturbation of the Ras signaling pathway.</p><p>In this study, we established a high-throughput image-based assay which enabled us to reproducibly measure many phenotypes including cell proliferation and cell morphology which are influenced by many cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Breinig et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fuchs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Horn et al., 2011</xref>). We used this assay to measure genetic interactions between differential treatment conditions over the course of three time points. To this end, we assessed the phenotypes of 76608 di-genic interactions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> hemocyte-like cells. Each interaction was characterized by a vector of 16 non-redundant and quantitatively reproducible phenotypic features. Further, we developed MODIFI, a two-factor robust linear model to quantitatively describe the time and treatment-dependent changes of genetic interactions. MODIFI also allowed us to describe whether an interaction is treatment sensitive (treatment could predict π-score) or time dependent (time predicted the π-score). Using MODIFI we found, for example, treatment-insensitive interactions within the Ras signaling cascade (<italic>rl-ksr</italic> interaction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) as well as treatment-sensitive crosstalk between Mediator, STAT and Ras signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Discovery of such interactions can lead to new treatment options in cases where the pharmacologic inhibition of MEK had no effect and an inhibition of the ERK (<italic>rl</italic>) -KSR (<italic>ksr</italic>) interaction becomes an interesting target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Roy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yu et al., 1998</xref>). Regarding the example of a signaling axis between Ras, STAT and Mediator signaling, some evidence indicates that mediator and STAT signaling engage in cooperative transcriptional regulation dependent on the phosphorylation status of Stat92E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kuuluvainen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wienerroither et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, evidence exists on mutual crosstalk between phosphorylation-dependent Ras signaling and <italic>Stat92E</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2002</xref>). Hence, our data suggests that these pathways could be interconnected and <italic>Stat92E</italic> and <italic>Mediator</italic> only show cooperative action when Ras signaling is active and Stat92E phosphorylation is not impaired.</p><p>Our analysis showed that we detected treatment sensitive interactions more sensitively as compared to endpoint measurements or single time point replicates (see examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,C’</xref>). Enrichment of treatment-sensitive interactions among stress-responsive pathways and genes underlines their biological relevance. Using this approach, we also analyzed the treatment (δ) and time (σ) dependency of interactions of specific genes and pathways. Overall, measuring phenotypes resulting from genetic interactions increased our ability to detect treatment-sensitive interactions. Furthermore, the measurement of multiple phenotypic features simultaneously enabled more detailed characterization of the observed treatment-sensitive interaction. We also tested whether the establishment of phenotypes is dependent on a gene’s expression level but found no correlation of high gene expression and high time dependency (data not shown). Our data further suggests that σ is influenced by the general resilience of a pathway or signaling module to perturbations. For example, housekeeping genes, widely believed to form extremely time and condition stable regulatory networks took the most time to rewire their interactions. This makes it unlikely that the stability or turnover of a single gene product is a major driver of time-dependent establishment of genetic interactions. We found, for example, that genetic interactions of ‘core’ (or housekeeping) modules such as the translation machinery, proteasome and others induce phenotypes that are much stronger at later time-points. In contrast, other cellular modules such as signaling and innate immunity ‘rewire’ early in the experiment. We could also show that while single perturbation phenotypes in some instances do not change over time interactions still do, hinting toward a time-dependent combinatorial effect. Our analysis classified genes into categories of genetic interactions that are (i) signaling modules central to the cells’ physiological role, (ii) signaling modules required for maintaining homeostasis and (iii) resilient ‘core’ modules whose network hubs form interactions on a longer timescale. We also found that measuring different phenotypes provided more information about the development of interaction differences over varying time scales and demonstrate a number of example treatment-sensitive interactions that could not have been found in end-point assays. While the cell count (comparable to yeast colony size) as a phenotype captures cellular reactions rather late in the experiment, other phenotypes, such as nuclear morphology or cytoskeleton texture, enabled to measure immediate cellular reactions.</p><p>In the gene-drug interaction experiments, we found that pathways interacting with Ras signaling reacted strongest to the Dsor1/MEK inhibition. This observation was translated to map signaling modules that react similarly toward Ras signal perturbation and we correlated δ-profiles along all features between all target genes. By this means, genes whose interactions change coherently upon Dsor1 inhibition are grouped into highly interconnected modules. Consequently, this correlation network clusters genes of similar functions in proximity with each other. Each module is also characterized by a coherent reaction towards Dsor1 perturbation. Interestingly, <italic>rolled</italic> (<italic>rl)</italic>, <italic>Dsor1</italic> and <italic>pole hole</italic> (<italic>phl)</italic> (ERK1/2, MEK1/2 and Raf) were not connected to the rest of Ras-signaling-related genes in the correlation network. In contrast, they correlated with Ras when using interaction profiles of the control treatment. This indicates that the chemico-genetic analysis identified ‘responsive’ factors that can be uncoupled upon environmental modulation of specific signaling modules.</p><p>Our analysis also revealed three genes that unexpectedly connected to Ras signaling: <italic>Fur1</italic>, a serine-type endopeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>swm</italic>, involved in mitotic checkpoint regulation and hedgehog signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Casso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dong et al., 1997</xref>) and <italic>Rel</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Foley and O'Farrell, 2004</xref>). The correlation of <italic>Fur1</italic> and <italic>swm</italic> with positive regulators of Ras signaling indicates that they respond similarly towards Dsor1 inhibition as Ras pathway members. In addition, we identified <italic>Rel (NF-κB)</italic> as a strong treatment-sensitive genetic interactor, suggesting that mitogenic Ras signaling and innate immune pathways depend on each other. Once <italic>Rel</italic> is lost, cells become more dependent on Ras signaling; a phenotype that can be blocked by perturbing Dsor1 activity chemically or genetically. Already at a low dose, both perturbations result in a synthetic lethal phenotype that kills <italic>Drosophila</italic> hemocyte-like cells. Conversely, it was previously shown that Ras signaling influences <italic>Rel</italic> activity by regulation of its negative transcriptional regulator pirk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ragab et al., 2011</xref>). We hypothesize that this mutual negative feedback regulation could be the basis for a ‘fight’ or ‘flight’ response of the immune cells; balancing an immune and proliferative response in the same cell.</p><p>Large-scale studies on gene essentiality have challenged the concept of a static repertoire of essential genes. In contrast, loss-of-function screens in different genetic background of cancer cells identified ‘core’ and ‘genotype’-dependent sets of essential genes. This indicates that essentiality is modulated in a context-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McDonald et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rauscher et al., 2018</xref>). At this point, our study is the largest exploration of gene-gene-drug interactions based on multiparametric, non-essential phenotypes. We demonstrate how different vulnerabilities for a diverse set of automatically scored phenotypes change upon time and environmental conditions. Our modeling approach increases the confidence to call treatment sensitive interactions upon changes of environmental conditions. This allows to map a correlation network of cellular modules that react coherently toward the external stimulus. We expect that, when further studies of context-dependent genetic interactions will become available, a comparative analysis will provide fundamental insights into how different cellular networks react to environmental stimuli with implications for therapy resistance and timing of drug treatments. In future studies, MODIFI could be further expanded to include terms assessing the influence of the treatment on the behavior over time (rate of interaction change). This will, for example, aid to understand the qualitative relationships between different treatment trajectories beyond the current analysis and sets the basis for further experiments. This study introduced an experimental and analysis framework to explore time-dependent rewiring of genetic networks which can be used to dissect the complexity of biological networks in model organisms and human cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Dmel-2; S2 cells; <break/>Schneider S2 cells</td><td>ATCC CRL1963 from <break/>ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, <break/>used in PMID:21378980; <break/>PMID: 26912791; <break/>PMID:25748138;</td><td>ATCC Cat# CRL-1963; <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_Z232">CVCL_Z232</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>alpha-tubulin-FITC mAB, <break/>tubulin antibody, mouse <break/>monoclonal clone DM1A</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich <break/>Cat# F2168</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich Cat# F2168, <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_476967">AB_476967</ext-link></td><td>(1:1500)</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, <break/>recombinant <break/>protein</td><td>Phalloidin-TRITC antibody</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich <break/>Cat# P1951</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich Cat# P1951, <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2315148">AB_2315148</ext-link></td><td>(1:6000), TRITC <break/>conjugate, <break/>C<sub>62</sub>H<sub>72</sub>N<sub>12</sub>O<sub>12</sub>S<sub>4</sub></td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td>Hoechst 33342</td><td>Thermo Fisher <break/>Scientific Cat# H1399</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific <break/>Cat# H1399</td><td>(1:4000) from 1 mg/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td>DMSO</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich <break/>Cat# 276855</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich Cat# 276855</td><td>0.05%</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td>PD-0325901; MEKi; <break/>MEK inhibitor</td><td>Cayman Chemical <break/>Cat# 13034</td><td>Cayman Chemical Cat# 13034; <break/>CAS: 391210-10-9</td><td>1.5 nM</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based <break/>reagent</td><td>HD3 dsRNA library; <break/>dsRNAs for combinatorial <break/>library</td><td>other; PMID: 26912791</td><td/><td>in house synthesized <break/>dsRNA library</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>R</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/">https://cran.r-project.org/</ext-link>; <break/>R Project for Statistical <break/>Computing</td><td>nif-0000–10474; <break/>OMICS_01147; <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001905">SCR_001905</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>custom R code</td><td>this paper; <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/boutroslab/Supplemental-Material/tree/master/Heigwer_2018">https://github.com/boutroslab/Supplemental-Material/tree/master/Heigwer_2018</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Perl</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</ext-link>; <break/>Comprehensive Perl <break/>Archive Network</td><td>nif-0000–30267; <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007253">SCR_007253</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>source data; well-wise <break/>feature data</td><td>this paper; <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6819557">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6819557</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Flybase gene <break/>annotation database</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/">http://flybase.org/</ext-link>; <break/>PMID: 30364959</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_006549">SCR_006549</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell line</title><p>All cells used in this project were from the same culture of the, serum-free medium adapted, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> S2 cell line (S2) and will be referred to as S2 cells (Schneider's <italic>Drosophila</italic> Line 2 [D.

Four sets of 88 × 384 well Greiner µClear plates were spotted with the HD3 library, 5 µl of 50 ng/µl dsRNA in each well. The HD3 library is arrayed to target one gene with one dsRNA design per well. Two additional plates, containing only controls were added to control assay reproducibility, robustness and effect size. Controls were chosen to spread over the complete dynamic range of cell fitness. dsRNAs against <italic>RLUC</italic> and <italic>GFP</italic> expressing plasmids serve as non-targeting negative controls, such that we could control for unspecific dsRNA induced phenotypes. dsRNA containing plates were thawed, seeded with cells and left for 24 hr at 25°C without CO<sub>2</sub> adjustment for incubation prior to drug treatment.

Images were acquired using the standard protocol described below with low illumination timings (DAPI: 100 ms, Cy3: 200 ms, FITC: 300 ms). The resulting images were analyzed in line with the acquisition using the standard image analysis pipeline and progress was monitored using our automated analysis pipeline as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Combinatorial RNAi screening under differential time and treatment conditions</title><p>The design of the library for combinatorial screening is described in a separate paragraph. 168 genes were chosen for design of a combinatorial RNAi library. The dsRNA sequences that were used in the combinatorial library can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">5</xref>. All used labware and reagents, which are not further detailed here have been the same as in previous experiments. The library contained 12 batches for screening, each comprising 80 × 384 well Greiner µClear plates spotted with 250 ng dsRNA/well dissolved in 5 µl of DNase, RNase-free water. dsRNAs were obtained from the HD3-library templates and synthesized accordingly. To avoid contaminations, all dsRNAs were sterile filtered using Steriflips-0.22µm (Merck Millipore, Ref: SCGP00525, Darmstadt, Germany) for the query dsRNAs and MultiScreenHTS-GV 0.22 µm filter plates (Merck Millipore, Ref: MSGVN2250) for the target dsRNAs. Genes were divided into target and query genes based on prior knowledge on key pathway components and screened a matrix of 76 genes combined with 168 genes. All query genes were included in the list of target genes. We screened each target gene in two sequence independent designs and each query gene in one design. This way, we screened 25536 dsRNA combinations (12768 gene pairs) in each batch. Combinatorial dsRNA spotting was achieved with combining the query and target master plates such that 2.5 µl of each query dsRNA were spotted onto 2.5 µl target dsRNA using a Beckman FX robotic liquid handling station (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). In order to control for RNAi induced phenotypes and per-plate batch effects control dsRNAs against <italic>Dsor1</italic>, <italic>drk</italic>, <italic>Diap1</italic>, <italic>RasGAP1</italic>, <italic>Pten</italic>, <italic>pnt</italic>, <italic>Pvr</italic>, <italic>Rho1</italic> and <italic>RLUC</italic> expressing plasmid were spotted on each plate and not paired with a second query dsRNA perturbation. Two control plates containing only the target gene dsRNA reagents with 250 ng dsRNA per well complete one screening batch of 80 plates and controlled for screening batch effects. To achieve differential treatment and time resolution, 12 screening batches were prepared. They were divided into two groups of six batches, which then were treated under different conditions in duplicate. six library batches are needed to screen two conditions (1.5 nM PD-0325901% and 0.5% DMSO) at three time points (fixation 48 hr, 72 hr, 96 hr after small molecule addition), all in all comprising 480 screened plates. The entire experiment was repeated twice. This way we screened 960 × 384 well plates.</p><p>The assay workflow followed the same procedures as outlined above. Briefly, 9000 cells per well were seeded onto 384-well Greiner µClear plates for microscopy, which were pre-spotted with a combinatorial dsRNA library. After centrifugation, plates were sealed and left to incubate for 24 hr at 25°C prior to compound addition. Therefore, a PD-0325901 dilution (15 nM in medium with 5% DMSO), and a 5% DMSO-only dilution in medium were prepared and added to the opened plates. This resulted in either 1.5 nM PD-0325901 or 0.5% DMSO in-assay concentrations. Plates were sealed again using a heat sealer and left to incubate until the experiment was stopped by fixation after 48 hr, 72 hr and 96 hr, respectively. Stained plates were imaged using an InCell Analyzer 2200 automated fluorescence microscope according to the protocol described above with 20x magnification, three channels per field and four fields per well. Resulting images were analyzed using the R/EBImage based pipeline described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Imaging</title><p>All plates were imaged using the same protocol. There, an InCell-Analyzer 2200 automated fluorescence microscope (GE Healthcare GmbH, Solingen, Germany) with a Nikon SAC 20x objective (NA = 0.45) was used. The microscope was adjusted to scan Greiner µClear plates by setting the bottom height to 2850 µm and the bottom thickness to 200 µm and the laser autofocus function was applied to identify the well bottoms with attached cells. This Z-position was used for image acquisition in three fluorescence channels: Hoechst (excitation: 390 ± 18 nm, emission: 435 ± 48 nm) at 400 ms exposure (100 ms in dose response experiments and genome wide screens), Cy3 (excitation: 475 ± 28 nm, emission: 511 ± 2 nm 3) at 300 ms exposure (200 ms in dose response experiments and genome wide screens) and FITC (excitation: 542 ± 27 nm, emission: 597 ± 45 nm) at 300 ms exposure (300 ms in dose response experiments and genome wide screens). Four fields of view were imaged per well at 20x magnification each representing a 665.60 µm x 665.60 µm area covered (approximately 20% of total well area) by 2048 × 2048 pixels. For plate handling, the microscope was equipped with a KinedX robotic arm (PAA Scara, Peak Analysis and Automation Ltd, Hampshire, UK) allowing a fully automated image acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Automated image processing and high-throughput image analysis</title><p>Plates were imaged and analyzed in batches of 40 plates and a custom pipeline allowed parallel image processing and analysis by bundling images of fields and channels of several wells. During imaging an automated pipeline scheduled the processing of image files for each field of view through the following analysis workflow, here described representatively for one field. Raw images of three channels with a size of 8.4 MB (16-Bit grey scale, 2048 × 2048 pixels) per image were captured with the InCell Analyzer 2200 software and saved as TIFF files on a server cluster for image processing and analysis. The image processing- and analysis pipeline covered two main blocks, first a sequence of pre-processing steps which was followed by extraction of phenotypic features from single cells. First, the images were read in and each channel was assigned to the subcellular structure that was selectively stained with the above described assay (Hoechst: DNA, Phalloidin-Cy3: F-actin, α-tubulin-FITC: tubulin). To identify cell and nuclei boundaries, a duplicate image of each channel is ln transformed, scaled between 0 to 1 and smoothened by a Gaussian filter using a sigma of one. This reduced optical noise, improved the dynamic range and smoothened the image gradients for further segmentation by thresholding. For segmentation, the normalized actin and tubulin images were binarized by global thresholding. Second, the cell nuclei were identified by applying a local adaptive average threshold to binarize the DNA channel nuclei image and assigning objects. The resulting binary image was then subjected to morphological operations of opening and hull filling such that filled objects with smoothly roundish outlines result. Offsets for segmentation were varied if the channels surpassed certain thresholds. If more than 30 nuclei were counted per field, the objects were subjected to further propagation of nuclei objects into the an á priori defined cell body mask. Starting from the nucleus objects as seed regions, the cell bodies are segmented by propagating the nuclei objects into foreground area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carpenter et al., 2006</xref>). This strategy allowed to identify single cells and corresponding nuclei as objects. Using the segmented object outlines as masks, features on each object and channel were calculated on the original image using the R/Bioconductor package EBImage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pau et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Specifically, numeric descriptors for five feature classes are defined in the computeFeatures function from EBImage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary fle 6</xref>): (i) shape features which quantify the shape of cells and nuclei, (ii) basic features that describe the summary statistics, such as 5% quantiles, of pixel intensity within the borders of the object, (iii) moment features that describe the spatial orientation of the objects, (iv) Haralick features derived from a pixel intensity co-occurrence matrix as texture descriptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haralick et al., 1973</xref>) and (v) social features such as distance to the first 20 nearest neighboring cells. Social features are derived by a k-nearest-neighbor search based on the geometric center points of single cells. Single-cell data were stored and aggregated to well averaged data by calculating the trimmed mean (q = 0.01) of all cells belonging to all fields of one well and its standard deviation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data processing and normalization</title><p>For the analysis of the genome-wide drug-gene interaction screens the following analysis strategy was pursued: feature data was collected in a data frame containing per-well aggregated values as trimmed mean and standard deviation. This data frame was then reformatted to a 4-dimensional data cube featuring the dimensions: feature, plate, well, screen. Per feature, the feature’s minimum value was added to each value prior to log<sub>n</sub>(x + 1) transformation to approach the features’ histogram to normal distribution. Following transformation, each plate in each screen was normalized separately for each feature by B-Score normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ljosa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mpindi et al., 2015</xref>). The B-Score normalization centers and scales the data to be the residuals of the median polish divided by the median absolute deviation (mad) across all values of the plate and thus be symmetrically centered around zero and scaled in units of the mad. Here, 38 representative features were chosen based on their biological significance (our ability to refer them back to cellular phenotypes) and their biological reproducibility between the two mock (DMSO) treated replicate screens and their information content, as measured by added variance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).</p><p>For the combinatorial screens, the obtained data frame containing rows for each well and columns for each feature. In addition, we added well, plate and batch identifiers as annotation columns. Data acquired from single cells was aggregated by calculating the trimmed mean (q = 0.01) for each feature extracted in the respective well together with its standard deviation. This way, outliers, produced by over or under segmentation of cells, were mostly excluded from further analysis. Data was normalized by dividing each feature in each plate by the median of the non-targeting control wells (if that was not zero). Further, the values of each feature were transformed on a logarithmic scale using the generalized logarithm with c being the 3% quantile of the features value distribution over all values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Caicedo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>). For each feature, data was subsequently scaled and centered around 0 by using the robust Z-transformation, where the feature median is subtracted from each value and the result was divided by the median absolute deviation (x’=(x-median(x))/mad(x)). After that, all features were in normalized units of median absolute deviation from the median of that feature and normalized per plate. The normalized feature vector provided the basis to all further analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Candidate selection for combinatorial RNAi screening</title><p>The metrics used for judging the quality of dsRNA reagents and to assess the gene’s suitability for the combinatorial screen are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. For this purpose, several metrics have been deployed. Summarized, the applied metrics were used to assesses for each individual gene in the genome-wide HD3 library (i) the quality of the RNAi reagent, (ii) the effect size of the induced phenotypes under solvent control treatment as well as the differential effect size of the treatment-sensitive phenotype between small molecule treatment and control conditions, (iii) the quality of the target gene as a candidate for gene-gene-drug combinatorial screening. Effect size was quantified using the Euclidean distance (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:msqrt><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:msqrt></mml:math></inline-formula>) between sample and control measurements under different conditions. Quality of dsRNAs was assessed by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients between phenotypic profiles of biological and dsRNA design replicates. The quality of genes as screening candidates was assessed by gene expression analysis and literature analysis. The Q1 metric shows the strength of a knockdown induced profile when compared to the non-targeting control knockdown (here: GFP). This was calculated as the Z-Score normalized Euclidean distance of the genes profile to the control profile and can be used to inform if a phenotype of a gene is exceptionally strong or weak. In general, strong phenotypes (Q2) were preferred since they were more robust to experimental noise and are likely to engage in many genetic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Costanzo et al., 2010</xref>). Q3 gives to what extent the phenotypic profile of those genes’ knockdown changes upon drug treatment. An ideal candidate for drug gene interaction screening shows a high value in this metric. Q4 and Q5 allow inferring the reproducibility of the measured phenotype by comparing the correlation of two sequence-independent dsRNA designs targeting one gene and the correlation of one design across screen replicates, respectively. There, 7957 genes were targeted by designs whose feature vectors correlate with PCC &gt;0.5 while 17263 designs were reproducible between screens (PCC &gt;0.5). Q6 was used to infer if the respective gene is expressed under the screened conditions (S2 cells, 4 days in culture in Express-V medium). 12567 genes (88% of all genes screened) had a log<sub>2</sub> normalized read count greater than 0. In contrast, the knowledge sum in Q7 was used to avoid over enrichment of well-characterized genes in the final combinatorial library. The ‘unknown’ was defined by means of assigning each gene a score describing how well it has been studied and characterized. Therefor the Gene Ontology terms associated to each <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene were downloaded from Flybase. In Flybase, each ontology term is annotated with evidence codes as provided by the gene ontology consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>). Each of these codes was then used to assign weights to the ontology terms for each gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Ontology terms derived from experimental evidence, such as genetic interactions, direct assays or physical interactions were assigned the highest weight while computational annotations were weighted the lowest. For each gene, the sum of ontology terms was computed and used as a proxy for the current state of its functional characterization. For example, the cell fate determining receptor <italic>Notch</italic> is the most well studied gene with a score of 973, while all genes have an average score of 34.7 and the third quartile ends at 41. This means that only a minor fraction of genes is as well studied as <italic>Notch</italic> and most genes can be accounted as uncharacterized if their score is beneath 100 (90 % quantile). An example for such a gene is <italic>tzn</italic> with a knowledge sum of 14. Only known fact about <italic>tzn</italic> is its function as Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase in response to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Neely et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jha et al., 2016</xref>). For screening, genes with a low knowledge sum were preferentially chosen.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Modeling of genetic interactions</title><p>The data frame with normalized feature data per well was reformatted into a five-dimensional data cube representing the experimental design. The dimensions are: target dsRNA (two entries for each gene), query gene, time, treatment and feature. The data cube was further subjected to genetic interaction analysis following the protocol established by Bernd Fischer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Horn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Laufer et al., 2013</xref>). There, genetic interactions are defined as the residuals of a modified median polish over the double perturbation matrix of one replicate, feature, treatment and time point. The median polish presents a robust linear fit (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) that lifts the main effects (m, n) of each query such that it resembles the value of a single gene knockdown. The residuals of this fit scaled by their median absolute deviation are defined as π-scores. π-scores further provide us with a quantitative measure of genetic interaction following the multiplicative model plus some error term (ε) estimating the experimental noise. There, the interaction of two genes is defined as the deviation of the measured combined phenotype (M<sub>ij</sub>) from the expected phenotype for a target-query gene pair <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>. The expected phenotype is defined as the product of the two independent single knockdown phenotypes. The resulting π-scores are then collected for all replicates (dsRNA and experimental, each interaction is measured four times). The significance of their mean over all measured scores is estimated by a moderated students t-test as is implemented in the R-package limma. There, the t-test is adapted for situations where a small amount of observations is tested in many tests, normally causing large test variability, using an empirical Bayes variance estimator. p-values were adjusted using the methods of Benjamini Hochberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). From there on, adjusted p-values can be treated as false discovery rates. The FDR estimates the chance that the finding was observed by random chance given the entire dataset. This described procedure was applied to quantitatively calculate genetic interactions for each phenotypic feature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Modeling of treatment-sensitive interactions</title><p>To identify a hit-list of condition-sensitive gene-gene interactions, we tested whether the changes of genetic interactions over time and between different conditions could be quantitatively described by a multi factorial linear model. This would provide the possibility to (i) quantify the time dependence of an interaction and (ii) to measure the phenotypic difference between treatment conditions with high confidence. For every gene-gene combination [i, j] screened across time and chemical treatment, we used a two-factor robust linear model, which we termed <underline>mo</underline>del of <underline>di</underline>fferential <underline>i</underline>nteractions (MODIFI), to estimate the predictive strength and influence of time and differential compound treatment on the π-score (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>). Therein, the coefficient σ<sub>ij</sub> models the time dependence, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>models the quantitative offset between treatments, c estimates the intercept and the residual ε<sub>ij,</sub> estimates the error of fit for each combination of the target gene i and the query gene j. σ and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>are thus parameter estimates that uniquely describe the behavior of each gene-gene interaction. A separate model was fitted for every feature and every gene-gene combination using the “rlm” function of the R/MASS package. A p-value denoting the predictive power of each covariate (time, treatment) on the π-score was estimated by a robust F-test as implemented in the function f.robftest function from the R/sfsmisc package. For statistical assessment the difference in interaction strength is used, as opposed to the interaction in a single condition. This way MODIFI identifies a great number of treatment sensitive interactions where the interaction score in each isolated condition is small, but the difference between conditions is significant. This resulted in a data frame that, for each gene-gene combination and each feature, contains a p-value for each covariate and its estimate. The p-value was multiple testing corrected by FDR analysis (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Interactions with an FDR&lt;0.1 in either term (time, treatment or both) were called significant. The FDR threshold also served as the basis for classifying context-dependent interactions into the different classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interactions are time dependent if the adjusted p-value for the time term is below 0.1, treatment sensitive when the adjusted p-value for the treatment term is below 0.1, and context-independent else. Interactions are aggravating when the π-score is negative and alleviating if it is positive.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>qPCR analysis</title><p>Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was used to analyze the transcriptional response following Rel/pnt co-RNAi. To this end, as 5*10<sup>5</sup> cells / well were seeded in 630 µl ExpressFive (Gibco) culture medium and reverse transfected with 14 µg dsRNA. All dsRNAs denoted with #2 were used in three biological replicates and combinatorial RNAi was achieved by mixing 7 µg of dsRNA targeting each gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). After 72 hr incubation (25°C, no CO2 adjustment), cells were washed once in 750 µl PBS (Gibco) and lysed in 350 µl RLT buffer shipped with the RNAeasy-mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA was then purified from all samples according to manufacturer's standard instructions for spin column purification. An optional DNase digestion step was performed using the RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen). Samples were prepared for qPCR by reverse transcription of 1 µg of RNA using RevertAid H minus First strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo scientific) according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. A qPCR reaction was prepared using PrimaQuant 2x qPCR-Mastermix (Steinbrenner) by mixing 5 µl of sample (1:10 diluted cDNA) with 5 µl of Mastermix (including 0,3 µM of forward and reverse primer, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>) on a 384-well qPCR plate (LightCycler 480 Multiwell Plate 384, white, Roche).

(PD)</title><p>Prior to large scale RNAi screening and RNA-Seq the sensitivity of S2 cells towards small molecule MEK inhibitor PD-0325901 (Cayman chemical, Ref: CAY-13034–5, Biomol GmbH, Germany) was tested under three different conditions: (i) normal treatment regimen, (ii) recovery after drug wash-out, (iii) treatment with used drug medium. All cells used in this project were from the same culture of the, serum free medium adapted, Drosophila <italic>melanogaster</italic> S2 cell line (S2) and will be referred to as cells (Schneider's Drosophila Line 2 [D. Mel. (2), SL2] (ATCC CRL1963) from ThermoFisher (Waltham, MA).</p><sec id="s7-1-1"><title>Experimental setup and drug treatment regimen</title><p>Cells were seeded in 2 Greiner µClear plates (Ref: 781073, Greiner Bio One International GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany), pre-spotted with 250 ng/well anti-GFP dsRNA and left to incubate for 24 hr at 25°C. After incubation, the cells were treated with a gradient of PD-0325901 in medium (Express V, serum free cell culture medium +10% Glutamax, Gibco, Ref: 10486–025 and Ref: 35050–061, Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) using robotic liquid handling. The gradient was pipetted as a 2-fold serial dilution in 100% DMSO from a 10 mM stock of PD-0325901 using a Beckmann NX-P pipetting robot (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA). The prepared gradient was then diluted in 384 well format 1:20 in medium reaching a pre-assay concentration of 5% DMSO in medium. Addition of 5 µl gradient dilution mix to the cell culture adds another 1:10 dilution step yielding an in-assay concentration gradient ranging from 50 µM to 0.024 nM PD-0325901 in 0.5% DMSO in medium. Thus, each column was treated with one concentration of PD-0325901. Column 1 and 24 were left mock treated with 0.5% DMSO. Plates were sealed again and incubated at 25°C for 96 hr. After completed incubation one plate was subjected to fixation and staining while the medium of the other plate was carefully removed and dispensed on a plate containing cells freshly seeded 24 hr in advance. 50 µl of fresh medium was then added to the emptied plate. Both, the plate with fresh medium and the plate with fresh cells and used medium were then incubated for additional 72 hr prior to fixation and staining. This results in three dose response analyses. (1) with normal assay protocol, (2) where the cells could recover from the treatment to test if the phenotypes are temporal and (3) where the remaining activity of PD-0325901 was tested after 96 hr of incubation on cells. All experiments in this setup have been replicated twice.</p></sec><sec id="s7-1-2"><title>Data normalization</title><p>All plates were subjected to standard fixation, staining and imaging protocols and analyzed using automated image analysis as described in the main methods. Data were triaged by removing NA value containing wells and single cell data was aggregated by calculating the mean per field of view. The data were scaled per feature on a scale from 0 to 1 and subjected to dose-response modelling.</p></sec><sec id="s7-1-3"><title>Dose-Response modeling and statistical analysis</title><p>Dose-response-modelling was carried out using the drm function for dose response models from R package drc. For modelling, the replicates and fields per well were used as independent measurements to inform the model. Dose response data was fitted to a four-parameter log-logistic function estimating the parameters slope, lower limit, upper limit and ED<sub>50</sub>. We used this model to accurately estimate the ED<sub>50</sub> concentration of cell growth inhibition. There the model provided us with a fixed value plus and minus a confidence interval in which the coefficient was estimated. The resulting model was assessed via plotting the dose response curves for different features, including all measured points with their mean and s.e.m. and the ED<sub>50</sub> was further used in all subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s7-1-4"><title>Western Blot analysis of in vitro PD-0325901 activity</title><p>Inhibition of Dsor1 kinase activity by PD-0325901 was tested by assaying levels of phosphorylated rl. Therefore, S2 cells were seeded as 4.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in a 24-well cell Culture plate (Greiner, Ref: 2511, Greiner Bio One International GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) in 700 µl Express Five cell culture medium (Gibco, Ref: 10486–025, Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with 10% Glutamax (Gibco) in four identical wells. Cells were incubated at 25°C for 24 hr prior to compound addition (150 nM PD-0325901, 0.5% in assay) in well A. After another 24 hr, well B was treated. This procedure was repeated for well C and D. After additional 24 hr of incubation, cells in all wells were lysed and western-blot analysis was carried out as follows. After washing the cells once with 500 µl PBS (Life Technologies, Ref: 10010015, Gibco), 50 µl of ice-cold RIPA-lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 % NP-40, 2 mM EDTA,1 x Protease Inhibitor, 2% Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail II and III, Sigma, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) were added and cells left to lyse for 30 s on ice. The lysate was collected in fresh 1.5 ml tubes (Eppendorf, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) and samples were centrifuged (21000 rpm, 5 min, 4°C). 20 µl of supernatant were mixed with 5 µl 5x Laemmli buffer and incubated 10 min at 95°C. Another 2 µl of each sample were used to measure protein content after manufacturer’s instructions for BCA assays 96-well plates (Pierce, Ref: 10741395, Thermo Scientific, Ref: H1399, Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). Samples were then loaded on a 12-well NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris Gel (Novex, Ref: NP0323BOX, Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) and left for electrophoresis for 30 min at 80 V constant voltage followed by 60 min at 120 V constant voltage in 1 × 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer (40 mM MOPS, 10 mM NaAc, 1 mM EDTA). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto a methanol activated PVDF-membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Ref: IPVH00010, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) by tank-blotting in 1 x Transfer buffer (25 mM Tris base, 192 mM glycine, 10% methanol) at 35 V for 90 min. After transfer, the membrane was shortly washed in 1 x TBST (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 19 mM Tris Base) and incubated for 60 min with constant shaking at room temperature (RT) in 5% skimmed milk (Sigma, Ref: 70166–500G, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). After washing the membrane 5 times 5 min at RT with 1 X TBST, the membrane was incubated overnight in a 1:2000 dilution of anti pp-p44/42 rabbit monoclonal antibody (Cell-Signaling, Ref: 4370, Cell Signaling Technology, Frankfurt, Germany) in 5% BSA (Sigma, Ref: A9085-25G). Following washing the membrane five times, 5 min in 1 x TBST it was incubated 60 min in 1:10000 anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugate (from Donkey) (Amersham ECL igG-HRP Conjugate, GE Healthcare). After an additional washing step, the membrane was developed on Hyperfilm ECL (Sigma Aldrich, Ref: GE28-9068-36) using Immobilon ECL substrate (Merck Millipore, Ref: WBKLS0100). The membrane was then stripped in 1 x Re-Blot Plus strong (Merck Millipore, Ref: 2504) for 15 min, RT followed by washing once 5 min in 1 x TBST. The membrane was again blocked 60 min in 5% skimmed milk in TBST, stained with 1:1000 anti p44/42 rabbit monoclonal antibody (Cell-Signaling, Ref: 4695), developed the same way as with the first antibody and stripped again. The same procedure was repeated using a 1:2000 dilution of anti α-tubulin monoclonal rabbit antibody (Cell-Signaling Ref: 2144).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s7-2"><title>Transcriptional Profiling of S2 cells</title><p>RNAi most effectively induces a visible phenotype when targeting highly expressed genes.

Additional 95 µl pre-warmed (25°C) medium were added to each plate using a MultiDrop dispenser (Thermo Scientific, low speed, 96-well standard plate, full plate, 20 µl pre-dispense and 16 mm offset). All further MultiDrop dispensing steps have been carried out using the same settings if not denoted different. The same cell culture medium was used in all the following experiments and is referred to as medium. All cells used in this project were from the same culture of the, serum free medium adapted, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> S2 cell line (S2) and will be referred to as cells.</p></sec><sec id="s7-2-2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>S2 cells (at passage 21, counted via a Nexcelom Cellometer Auto 1000 for 90% viability, Ref: CETHT4SD100002, Cenibra GmbH) were seeded in all plates at 40000 cells/well in 35 µl medium using a MultiDrop dispenser. Plates were sealed using a heat plate sealer (PlateLoc, Agilent Technologies Deutschland GmbH and Co. KG, Waldbronn, Germany) and centrifuged at 140 g for 60 s. Cells were left to incubate for 24 hr at 25°C in a cell culture incubator with no CO<sub>2</sub> adjustment. After incubation, plates were opened and 15 µl of 150 nM solution of PD-0325901 (MEK1/2 inhibitor, CAS: 391210-10-9, Cayman Chemical, 15 nM in assay) dissolved in medium with 5% DMSO (Sigma Aldrich, Ref: 41644–1 l, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) or 5% DMSO in medium were added using MultiDrop dispensing. Column 1–6 of each plate were filled with the DMSO control medium and columns 7–12 of each plate were treated with the inhibitor solution. Plates were heat sealed again and left to incubate for an additional 48 hr, 72 hr and 96 hr at 25°C without CO<sub>2</sub> adjustments prior to cell lysis and RNA extraction.</p></sec><sec id="s7-2-3"><title>Cell lysis and RNA extraction</title><p>Cell lysis of 3 plates from each time point was carried out after 48 hr, 72 hr and 96 hr on a Beckman FX pipetting robot using a custom protocol with reagents supplied from the Agencourt RNAdvance tissue kit (Beckman Coulter, Ref: A32649). RNA extraction was performed on a Beckman NX-P robot with a custom protocol using lab ware and the reagents from an Agencourt RNAdvance tissue kit. In brief, medium was removed and the cells were washed carefully using 200 µl PBS before 50 µl freshly prepared lysis buffer were added (5% Proteinase K in 30 ml of lysis buffer). Lysis was left to incubate for 30 min at room temperature (RT). The solution was then mixed, transferred to a new plate and stored at −20°C. Cell lysates were mixed vigorously in a 1:1 mass ratio with the magnetic bead solution (320 µl 70% 2-Propanol + 80 µl magnetic beads) and incubated for 5 min at RT prior to 5 min of incubation at RT on a plate magnet. The supernatant was removed and the plate removed from the magnet. The samples were re-suspended in 800 µl of washing buffer before another 4 min of incubation at RT on the magnet. The remaining supernatant was removed, the plate removed from the magnet and the samples dissolved in 800 µl of 70% ethanol. After gentle mixing of the solution, samples were left to incubate for 4 min at RT on the magnet and the supernatant was removed. Prior to addition of 100 µl DNase mix (80 µl H<sub>2</sub>O, 10 µl DNase buffer, 10 µl DNase) sample were incubated for 5 min at 37°C on a pre-warmed heating block. Samples with DNase were then incubated another 15 min at 37°C on the heating block before 500 µl of washing buffer were added and the samples were mixed gently by pipetting. Samples were left to rest for 4 min at RT before the plate was transferred to the magnet and incubated for 4 min at RT. The supernatant was discarded and the samples washed three times with 200 µl 70% ethanol. The supernatant was removed and the samples allowed to dry 5 min at 37°C before they were vigorously re-suspended in 30 µl RNase, DNase free water. RNA was allowed to dissolve from the beads by incubating the mixture 5 min at RT before the plate was transferred to the magnet. After 30 s, the DNase treated total RNA containing eluate was transferred to a fresh plate, pooled per sample and stored in conventional Eppendorf tubes at −20°C.</p></sec><sec id="s7-2-4"><title>Sample preparation and sequencing</title><p>Sample preparation and sequencing were carried out by the DKFZ high throughput sequencing core facility using standard protocols.

(2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Billmann et al. (2018)</xref>. It contains 28941 sequence unique dsRNA reagents targeting 14242 unique gene IDs and comprising two sequence independent reagents targeting each gene, where possible. The reagents were optimized for efficient targeting of the most recent (BDGP5) mRNA annotations in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> by for example avoiding CAN repeats and non-unique sequences (off-targets). Target genes in the library are organized into the categories of chromatin biology, human homologs, non-human homologs, human homologs II and non-human homologs II. The library contains primer pairs against exonic regions of target genes that are amplified by PCR and processed to double stranded RNA by in vitro transcription (IVT) the following way. Starting from purified genomic DNA of S2 cells, a first PCR (0.28 µM fwd./rev. primer, H<sub>2</sub>O, 10x Buffer (Qiagen, Ref: 203209, Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germnay), 0,28 mM dNTPs (Fermentas, Ref: R0182, Life Technologies), 0.03 U Hotstar Taq (Qiagen), 2 ng genomic DNA) with genomic sequence specific primers was performed, which also adds four different TAGs for later re-amplification of the product. Using TAG specific primers, a second PCR (same conditions as first one) was performed adding an additional T7-promotor sequence to either end of the resulting amplicon. A list of primers can be found at <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>. The product of this reaction was then input for in vitro transcription at 37°C, incubated overnight (10 µl buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM DTT, 10 mM Spermidine), 20 µl NTPs (Sigma), 5 µl Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP, Sigma), 0,25 µl RNA lock (40 U/µl, Fermentas), 5 µl T7 Polymerase (20 U/µl)). The IVT product (dsRNA) was normalized to 250 ng/µl and diluted to a final concentration of 50 ng/µl in DNase, RNase free water. All products were subjected to E-GEL (E-Gel 96 2% 8-PAK, Life Technologies) quality control using the QIAXEL automated gel electrophoresis (Qiagen). Samples, which did not pass quality control (no band, band of the wrong size or smear) were processed again or flagged in the annotation. The final solution was stored in 384-well stock plates and aliquoted to 384 Greiner µ-clear plates prior to the screening assay at a mass of 250 ng/well.

There, the InCell-Analyzer 2200 (GE-healthcare, hereof short InCell) was calibrated to scan Greiner µClear plates setting the bottom height to 2850 µm and the bottom thickness to 200 µm so that the laser autofocus function can find the bottom of the cells at 10% laser power. This function measures the refraction peaks of the laser while moving the focus in Z-direction. Two peaks are detected, where the second peak marks the position where the focal plane hits the inner side of the well bottom. This Z-position was used for image acquisition in three channels: DAPI (excitation: 390 ± 18, emission: 435 ± 48) at 400 ms exposure (100 ms in dose response experiments and genome wide screens), Cy3 (ex: 475 ± 28, em: 511 ± 23) at 300 ms exposure (200 ms in dose response experiments and genome wide screens) and FITC (ex: 542 ± 27, em: 597 ± 45) at 300 ms exposure (300 ms in dose response experiments and genome wide screens). Four tiles per well were imaged as fields of view each representing a 665.60 µm x 665.60 µm area covered by 2048 × 2048 pixels. The fields were centered around the well’s center in a layout touching each other’s margins. A KinedX robot (PAA Scara, Peak Analysis and Automation Ltd, Hampshire, UK) was used to automate feeding of plates into the microscope. For efficient data handling, the microscope’s workstation was directly connected to a server cluster storage node via X520 optical fiber network adapter (Intel).</p></sec><sec id="s7-4-6"><title>Image processing and feature extraction</title><p>On a 96 CPU server cluster, a script scheduled the automated processing of image files through the following analysis workflow, representative for each field of each well on each plate. First, the images were read in and, before each image is duplicated, each dye was assigned to the cell organelle it is supposed to stain (DAPI: DNA, Cy3: actin, FITC: α-tubulin). The duplicate image was log2 transformed, scaled from 0 to 1 and smoothened by a Gaussian filter using a sigma of one and a radius of 7 pixels. This reduces optical noise and smoothens the image gradients for further segmentation by thresholding. Afterwards the normalized actin and tubulin images were binarized by global thresholding (thresholds of 0.2 and 0.35, respectively). If the tubulin channel was bright enough (<italic>diff (range (raw image tubulin)) &gt; 0.1</italic>) the binary cell body mask was defined as the sum of the actin and tubulin binary masks, else the tubulin was left out of the cell body segmentation. Second, the cell nuclei were identified by applying a local adaptive average threshold to binarize the nuclei image and assigning objects after morphological smoothing of the binary image. Each normalized and smoothened DAPI channel image was binarized using an average thresholding method with a 21 × 21 pixel wide filter. Every Pixel above the local average plus the given offset is defined as foreground and every other pixel is defined as background. The resulting binary image was then subjected to morphological operations of opening and hull filling such that filled objects with smoothly roundish outlines result. The function <italic>bwlabel</italic> numbers each area of connected foreground pixels to be an object (here nuclei). Offsets for segmentation were varied if the channels surpassed certain thresholds. If more than 30 nuclei were counted per field, the objects were subjected to further propagation of nuclei objects into the <italic>á priori</italic> defined cell body mask. Starting from the nucleus objects as seed regions, the cell bodies are segmented by propagating the nuclei objects into foreground area. Allowed foreground area is defined by the cell body binary mask. The direction of propagation is defined by the image gradient of the normalized actin channel image, together with the lambda factor. The extend of lambda defines how strong the image gradient is considered. If lambda is one the half distance between two nuclei defines the cell border and the cell bodies equal a Voronoi map between the nuclei. Here a relatively small lambda was chosen to allow also for cell shapes other than roundish cells. There, the lambda factor defines to which extend the propagation algorithm follows the image gradient of the normalized actin image while the body binary provides the borders of the propagation. Using the segmented object outlines as masks on the original image, cell features have been extracted using EBImage’s <italic>computeFeatures</italic> function on each object and original non-normalized channel of the image. Specifically numeric descriptors for four feature classes are defined in this function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>): (i) shape features describing how the object outline forms, (ii) basic features that describe pixel intensity based summary statistics, such as 5% quantiles, of pixel intensity within the borders of the object, (iii) moment features that describe the spatial orientation of the objects, (iv) Haralick features derived from a pixel intensity co-occurrence matrix as texture descriptors and (v) social features such as distance to the first 20 nearest neighboring cells. Cell body shape and moment features (dependent on the cell outlines) were only computed once using the actin channel. The tubulin channel, because of having the same outlines as the actin channel, was only measured for basic, intensity and texture features. All categories giving the nuclear shape, moment, intensity and texture features were measured in the DAPI channel. Social features were derived by a k-nearest-neighbor search based on the geometric centers of segmented nuclei. Taken together, we extracted 78 features for every single cell. Single cell data were stored and aggregated to well averaged data by calculating the trimmed mean (q = 0.01) of all cells belonging to all fields of one well and its standard deviation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s7-5"><title>Genome-wide chemo-genetic interaction screen</title><p>We performed genome-wide RNAi screens in combination with differential drug treatment to test dsRNA reagents, identify interesting candidates for combinatorial screening and to find which genes react most differentially as resistance mediators or sensitizers to the MEK inhibitor (PD-0325901) treatment.</p><sec id="s7-5-1"><title>Genome wide high content RNAi vs drug screen</title><p>Four sets of 88 × 384 well Greiner µClear plates were spotted with the HD3 library, 5 µl of 50 ng/µl dsRNA in each well.

Following transformation, each plate in each screen was normalized separately for each feature by B-Score normalization. There, a median polish was performed across the plate to remove spatial column and row biases from the plate. Additionally, the B-Score normalization centers and scales the data to be the residuals of the median polish divided by the median absolute deviation (mad) across all values of the plate and thus be symmetrically centered around zero and scaled in units of mad. An artifact resulting from the dispensing pattern of the MultiDrop dispenser is a Chess-board like pattern biasing all values spatially. Under the assumption that the values of the black panels and the white panels should both follow the same distribution, we performed the following normalization.

The library contained 12 batches for screening, each comprising 80 384-well Greiner µ-clear plates spotted with 250 ng dsRNA/well dissolved in 5 µl of DNase, RNase free water. dsRNAs were obtained from the HD3-library templates and synthesized accordingly. To avoid contaminations, all dsRNAs were sterile filtered using Steriflips-0.22µm for the query dsRNAs and MultiScreenHTS-GV 0.22 µm filter plates for the target dsRNAs. Here, genes were divided into target and query genes and screened a matrix of 76 genes combined with 168 genes. We defined the larger group as target genes and chose 76 of them to be the query genes. We screened each target gene in two sequence independent designs and each query gene in one design. This way, we screened 25536 dsRNA combinations (12768 gene pairs) in each batch. Combinatorial dsRNA spotting was achieved with combining the query and target master plates such that 2.5 µl of each query dsRNA were spotted onto 2.5 µl target dsRNA by a Beckman FX liquid handling robot using a 384-well pipetting head. This results in 76 × 384 well plates where each well, except the control wells in column 12 and 13, contains 250 ng of dsRNA targeting two different genes. Controls in columns 12 and 13 contained only 125 ng of dsRNA in the same volume of water. Control plates containing the uncombined target gene dsRNA matrix with 250 ng dsRNA per well complete one screening batch of 80 plates. To achieve differential treatment and time resolution, 12 screening batches were prepared. They were divided into two groups of six batches, which then were treated under different conditions in duplicate. six library batches are needed to screen two conditions (1.5 nM PD-0325901% and 0.5% DMSO) at three time points (48 hr, 72 hr, 96 hr), all in all comprising 480 screened plates.

Briefly, 9000 cells per well were seeded onto 384-well Greiner µClear plates for microscopy, which were pre-spotted with a combinatorial dsRNA library. After centrifugation, plates were sealed and left to incubate for 24 hr at 25°C prior to compound addition. Therefore, a PD-0325901 solution, (15 nM in medium with 5% DMSO), and a 5% DMSO only dilution in medium were prepared and added to the opened plates. This resulted in either 1.5 nM PD-0325901 or 0.5% DMSO in-assay concentrations. Plates were closed again by heat sealing and left to incubate until the experiment was stopped by fixation after 48 hr, 72 hr and 96 hr, respectively. Fixation with 4% PFA and staining with Hoechst, Phalloidin-TRITC and anti-α-tubulin-FITC conjugate antibody were carried out using standard protocols on a CybiWell Vario liquid handling workstation.

As a result, we obtained a data frame containing one row for each well that was screened and columns containing the measured features and well, plate and batch identifier for later trace back. The resulting raw data contained 368640 rows and 164 columns. To this end, data acquired from single cells was aggregated by calculating the trimmed mean (q = 0.01) for each feature extracted in the respective well together with its standard deviation. This way, outliers, produced by over or under segmentation of cells, should be excluded from further analysis. Here, data were either kept as a table or transformed into a multidimensional data cube depending on the analysis. Data were normalized by dividing each feature in each plate by the median of the negative control wells (if that was not zero). Further, the values of each feature were glog transformed with c being the 3% quantile of the features value distribution over all values. Glog transformation works effectively in smoothening the histogram of each feature without the anomaly observed by conventional log transformation. For each feature, data were then scaled and centered around 0 by using the robust Z-transform, where the feature median is subtracted from each value and the result was divided by the median absolute deviation (x=(x-med(x))/mad(x)). After that, all feature data were in normalized units of median absolute deviation from the median of that feature normalized to each plate. The normalized feature vector provides the basis to all further analyses. Screening quality was assessed per plate such that plates with a replicate Pearson correlation smaller than 0.6 and a Z’-factor (between Diap1 and RasGAP1) smaller than 0.3 were masked by the NA_real_ constant, so all experimental dimensions remain complete while the values are masked from downstream analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s7-6-4"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>From normalized features per well, the data frame is reformatted to fit the experimental design into a 5-dimensional data cube.

The residuals of this fit scaled by their median absolute deviation are then defined as π-scores. π-scores further provide us with a quantitative measure of genetic interaction following the multiplicative model plus an error term (ε) estimating the experimental noise. There, the interaction of two genes is defined as the deviation of the measured combined phenotype (δ) from the expected. The expected phenotype would then be a multiple of the two independent single knockdowns. The resulting π-scores were collected for all replicates (dsRNA and experimental) and the significance of their mean over all measured scores was estimated by a moderated students t-test as is implemented in the R-package limma. There, the t-test was adapted for situations where a small amount of observations was tested in many tests, normally causing large test variability, using an empirical Bayes variance estimator.

For this experiment, all dsRNAs denoted with #2 were used in three biological replicates. Combinatorial RNAi was achieved by mixing 7 µg of dsRNA targeting each gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). After 72 hr incubation at (25°C), cells were washed once in 750 µl PBS (Gibco) and lysed in 350 µl RLT buffer shipped with the RNAeasy-mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA was then purified from all samples according to manufacturer’s standard instructions for spin column purification. An optional DNase digestion step was performed using the RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen). RNA was diluted from the spin columns using 40 µl RNase/DNase-free water. The concentration was measured using a NanaDrop spectrometer (Thermo scientific). Samples were prepared for qPCR by reverse transcription of 1 µg of RNA using RevertAid H minus First strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo scientific) according the manufactures standard protocol. A qPCR reaction was prepared using PrimaQuant 2x qPCR-Mastermix (Steinbrenner, Steinbrenner Laborsysteme GmbH, Wiesenbach, Germany) by mixing 5 µl of sample (1:10 diluted cDNA) with 5 µl of Mastermix (including 0,3 µM of forward and reverse primer) on a 384-well qPCR plate (LightCycler 480 Multiwell Plate 384, white, Roche, Ref: 4729749001, Roche Molecular Systems Inc., Pleasanton, California, USA). The plate was then centrifuged (2 min, 2000 rpm) and processed for qPCR in a Roche 480 LightCycler using the following PCR program: (i) 10 min at 95°C, (ii) 15 s at 95°C, (iii) 60 s at 60°C, repeat step ii and iii 40 times and measure fluorescence at 494 nm-521 nm during step. Melting curve analysis of each sample was performed to assess reaction quality. Relative expression of each gene in each sample (normalized to rps7 expression) was analyzed as log<sub>2</sub>-foldchange over RLUC dsRNA treated samples. qPCR primers were designed using the GETprime web service (Supplementary file 9).</p></sec><sec id="s7-6-6"><title>qPCR and Western Blot analysis of Rel/pnt crosstalk</title><p>Since phosphorylation levels of rl were already equalized after 96 hr of different dsRNA treatments (<italic>Sos</italic> k.d., MEK inhibition and rl k.d. showed no or little reduction in pp-rl, data not shown) we examined the molecular response also 48 hr after dsRNA transfection.

Pair-wise gene deletions or knock-downs have been used for a long time to study how the consequence of the double gene perturbations to a phenotype is different from expectation. More recently, such pairwise combinations have been performed in different environmental conditions or in different genetic backgrounds. In this study the authors asked how such genetic-interactions change during time. Time dependencies in genetic-interactions were previously exploited but not studied, as mentioned by the authors, by Shen and colleagues (Shen et al., 2017). For this purpose they have developed a linear regression model to jointly estimate the impact of the kinase inhibitor and the time dependencies of the genetic-interactions. The authors go to great lengths to set-up the experiments and to show the validity of their data and approach. In fact, about half of the results are devoted to this. They first performed a single gene down-regulation screen in the presence/absence of MEK inhibitor using microscopy and imaging as cellular phenotypes. Based on this they selected a set of candidate genes to perform a 76 by 168 double gene knock-down experiments in 3 time points (+/- MEK inhibitor). They performed a series of benchmarks on the screens to ensure that the data is reproducible.</p><p>From the genetic-interactions screens there are some general analysis and findings. From a technical point of view the authors show that modelling the time dependencies as they do can identify a higher number of differential interactions when compared to previous approaches. Biologically, most of the interactions with changes over time were interactions that changed in magnitude over time in a way that was similar in the control and MEK inhibitor (called &quot;stable&quot; by the authors). Those interactions that changed over time differently in the inhibitor versus the control were found to be enriched in signalling genes. One aspect that I found particularly interesting was the possibility to assign a magnitude of time dependence to each differential interaction. Based on this they briefly explored how some phenotypes and some genes were more responsive to changes after perturbation. The authors showed that the correlations of the changes interactions is predictive of functional association. Finally, from the analysis of correlation of differential interactions, they then selected and further investigated the role of Rel as a potential negative regulator of Ras signalling.</p><p>Overall, I think this work explores well the changes in genetic-interactions over time after perturbation. The analysis is well performed and extensively benchmarked. I have the impression that the manuscript focuses almost more on the generation of the data than on the new insights. It was also not very easy to follow but that is also due to the complexity of the experiment – non linear effects of pairs of gene knock-downs over time plus and minus drug. Even for researchers used to thinking about genetic interactions the results of these assays should be difficult to conceptualize. In part, this complexity also makes it difficult to extract novel findings on the genetic architecture of the cell.</p><p>I have no major concerns regarding the work, only a few minor points on clarification that the authors may consider:</p><p>– From my reading of the manuscript the major novel findings of this work relate to the time dependencies on the differential genetic interactions. However, almost half of the Results section relate to the process of obtaining the differential interactions. While I commend the authors for the thorough characterization of the chemical-genetic and genetic-interaction data it would be possible to summarize further the initial results, in particular the initial screen for MEK inhibitor sensitive genes and to a lesser extent the establishment of the genetic interactions. This could give more space to focus on the main novel findings regarding the differential genetic interactions. The section on the differential interactions could in turn be broken down into more sub-sections trying to give more visibility to the main new findings that derive from this data.</p><p>– The article gets confusing in the nomenclature of the genetic-interactions. These interactions can be: time (in)dependent, differential, stable, positive, negative, aggravating and alleviating. In particular, calling a time dependent interaction as &quot;stable&quot; is awkward. Perhaps using condition independent or condition insensitive instead of stable would be clearer.</p><p>– The differential genetic interaction method is not described in the Materials and methods section. Are all genetic interaction pairs tested for differential interactions ? Can a genetic interaction be called as significantly changing without having a strong effect size in any condition? Looking at the genetic interaction scores of replicates in Figure 2—figure supplement 5, the values range from around -5 to 5 with strong variance around -0.5 to 0.5. However, in several places in the article the interaction values and changes highlighted are often in the ranges of 0 to 0.5. Are these interaction terms calculated in the same way in Figure 2—figure supplement 5? It would appear that the variance in replicates is higher than the apparent precision of the method.</p><p>– How are condition independent interactions (&quot;stable&quot;) defined ? A cut-off on the condition sensitivity parameter ?</p><p>– Given that the differential interactions are being called with a linear model on the time differences with a term for the drug effect, are time invariant but drug dependent genetic interactions well captured by this model ?</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>- Figure 1E – annotate in the figure what are the Ras pathway components and translational regulators groups described in the Results section for clarity.</p><p>- Figure 4F – could be move to supplementary materials and corresponding results description shortened.</p><p>- Figure 2—figure supplement 2 – figure title is wrong</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40174.046</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] By studying in particular on the RAS signaling pathway, authors showcase several examples of context dependent crosstalk.

As such it is reported that ksr serves as a scaffolding protein that supports the phosphorylation cascade downstream of Raf.

However, our data shows a negative, synthetic sick, interaction which suggest a positive influence on cell viability/proliferation between <italic>ksr</italic> and <italic>rl</italic> independent of MEK kinase activity. This interaction is yet unexplored but could be a potentially interesting target for interventions when kinase inhibitors loose efficacy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Next paragraph skd and Stat92E – synlet connects them until perturbed. Same question – how does this affect our view of how these pathways work?</p></disp-quote><p>To answer this question we added a detailed paragraph discussing the triangular crosstalk between STAT, mediator and Ras signaling (subsection “Examples of context-dependent genetic interactions” and Discussion paragraph two). Interestingly there have been a very limited number of studies that suggest cooperative regulatory function of mediator and STAT and others suggest mutual biochemical modulation between STAT and Ras signaling downstream of <italic>Drosophila PDGFR (Tor</italic>). Our study does on the one hand support prior findings regarding the known pathway crosstalk and for the first time demonstrates the linkage of all three pathways. This provides ground for further studies to gain new insights into multi-pathway crosstalk involving biochemical signaling perturbation and transcriptional feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) High numbers of alleviating (nuclear shape) or aggravating (nuclear texture) stable interactions. Is this different to what we expect? Why? What is the null expectation for these results?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we expected that all features show balanced numbers of interaction types. Our data, however suggests that different features have different capabilities to reveal, e.g. alleviating, aggravating, early or late interactions as outlined throughout the manuscript. A possible explanation would be that different biological processes influence different cellular features, e.g. perturbations of the cytoskeleton organization mostly influence shape features while perturbation of nuclear factor alters mostly nuclear texture. The direction of interactions then follows the genes that are involved and so do the different features enrich distinct interaction types. From these observations we concluded that the assessment of multiple features simultaneously gives us a more differentiated characterization of genetic interactions. Our data does not suggest to favor certain phenotypic features over the other as they capture widely different aspects of the cellular reactions. We addressed this comment by re-phrasing the according section in the main manuscript (subsection “Different phenotypic features capture distinct cellular reactions”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Exceptionally high time dependence for interactions with housekeeping genes. Why?</p></disp-quote><p>Our data suggests that this phenomenon could be explained if we assume that regulatory networks that are built of housekeeping genes show increased resilience towards perturbation and rewiring. Co-RNAi perturbation as well as chemical inhibition of MEK force the signaling network to adapt its function to maintain homeostasis. If we assume that housekeeping processes are less prone to rapid modulation and need longer time to rewire their interaction networks this would explain our observations. They show exceptionally low treatment sensitivity as their function is so basally governing cellular reactions that perturbation of a downstream signaling pathway does not change their network. Their interactions to other genes also prove this stable that we cannot observe it during early phases of the experiment but very strongly later on. This manifests in their exceptionally high time dependency. We outline the capabilities of our data to map the temporal dynamics these networks in paragraph three of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>GIs are pretty abstract entities. How they are expected to change across time is something I cannot guess so having some idea what we might have expected and what these findings reveal would really help.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment we completely reworked the end of the introduction and the part of the results which covers Figure 1 and 2. Therein we outline our hypothesis that the quantitative measurement of genetic interactions is always time dependent and explain how we expect this will extent the theoretical framework under which we assess genetic interactions and their context dependence. We further explain that we expect to learn more about the mechanisms by which gene regulatory networks rewire in response to changes in the cell’s environment. From this we can map the plasticity of the gene-regulatory landscape and understand higher-order crosstalk between signaling pathways with possible implications understanding cellular homeostasis and disease.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I'd also suggest in future that as well as focusing on a well chosen gene set as they do here, they also do similar analyses on a set of random genes so we can see whether the trends they find are specific to the chosen genes or to genes in general. I know that adds greatly to the work (hence not requiring it here) but I think it would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment and consider this a starting point for future studies that are informed by our approach. However due to constraints given by the bad scalability of such complex high-order perturbation experiments we consider an experiment on random genes out of scope of the current study. However, as the degree of automation within lab routines extends, we are certain that such experiments will soon become feasible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Results section, paragraph twenty; extent</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected this mistake throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 – I'd prefer something other than yellow in A.

In our revised manuscript we performed a number of measures (moving more figures to the supplement, editing Figure 1 and 2, 4 and 5) to increase the accessibility of our manuscript. In paragraph three of the Discussion section we also highlight why the time-resolved measurements allowed to study many observations that were not visible in end-point assays.

To address this comment, we revised the discussion of modeling the time dependent behavior of different features in the main text (subsections “Robust linear models accurately describe the temporal dynamics of genetic interactions” and “Examples of context-dependent genetic interactions”). Indeed, we expected different signal curves for different features. However due to first, normalization, centering and scaling and second the interaction calling these differences are mitigated when modeling, as also explained by Diss and Lehner, 2018. For example: Two genes that cause a phenotype that follows a sigmoidal shaped function over time. Then this shape is removed together with the main phenotypes of each gene alone when interaction scores are quantified for each time point. The interactions could indeed still follow the curve of the corresponding input feature, however as our study showed as an unexpected result, the remaining residuals could be explained by a linear model, for all features we tested (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Still as more data become available and more fine-grained time courses and experimental setups are realized, this question could be further investigated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Feedback will also lead to epistasis, and the authors' approach might be able to detect the mechanisms of feedback, as transcriptional feedback is expected to be slower than phosphorylation- or allostery-based feedback, and translational or transcriptional components might behave differentially when they are required for feedback.

To this end, one would need an experiment such as the following: First one creates double knockdown or double mutant cells, second these cells would be pulsed using a chemical perturbation for different time periods. So far this is not different to the experiment we conducted. However, to discern biochemical from transcriptional and later translational feedback one would need an array of time resolved readouts. These would cover overlapping time scales and different biochemical modalities. Therefore, one could use proteomics, very shortly (minutes to hours) after perturbation to map biochemical reactions, transcriptomics to map transcriptional feedback at medium to long time frames (hours to days) and phenomics to assess long-term impact of feedback mechanisms, a mixture of transcriptional and biochemical feedback. Our current dataset however only covers feedback reactions measured a later time points by macroscopic phenotypic changes. Some preliminary data during our follow-up of the <italic>Rel-pnt</italic> interaction indicate a concerted cascade of biochemical and transcriptional regulation that starts early after perturbation and manifests in long lasting transcriptional changes (Figure 8—figure supplement 3 and 4). While one can infer feedback loops from these data and gain insights into their temporal dynamics (e.g. rewiring of housekeeping networks vs. signal transduction networks) we doubt it would have the resolution to exactly discern the mechanisms of different forms of feedback interplay. As also gold-standard data and methods for such analyses are missing, we consider these highly interesting experiments and analyses out of scope of the current study but they offer a very promising avenue to pursue in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Abstract &quot;end-point assay&quot;</p><p>Results paragraph seven; &quot;a control perturbation&quot;</p><p>Paragraph two subsection “Differential genetic interactions enrich in stress responsive genes and pathways”; &quot;to such an extent that&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions and made changes to the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The authors go to great lengths to set-up the experiments and to show the validity of their data and approach.

Specifically, we edited the Introduction and Results sections to lower the entry barrier to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It was also not very easy to follow but that is also due to the complexity of the experiment – non linear effects of pairs of gene knock-downs over time plus and minus drug. Even for researchers used to thinking about genetic interactions the results of these assays should be difficult to conceptualize. In part, this complexity also makes it difficult to extract novel findings on the genetic architecture of the cell.</p></disp-quote><p>We discussed the revised text with researchers that are not specialized on genetic interactions to make the text more accessible to other scientists despite the admittedly high complexity of the underlying data. To this end we reworked the introduction, Figure 1 and Figure 2 together with their according textual descriptions. There we specifically highlighted the conceptual questions and advances of this study (Introduction paragraph three and paragraph two “A chemo-genetic screen identifies genes sensitive to small molecule MEK inhibition”). In addition, we greatly extended the description and discussion of biologically interesting findings that highlight unexpected inter-pathway crosstalk uncovered by our experiment in the Results section (subsection Examples of context-dependent genetic interactions” paragraph two and Discussion section). Our manuscript further sets ground for future analyses and also provides all source data and code to explore and re-analyze the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have no major concerns regarding the work, only a few minor points on clarification that the authors may consider:</p><p>– From my reading of the manuscript the major novel findings of this work relate to the time dependencies on the differential genetic interactions. However, almost half of the Results section relate to the process of obtaining the differential interactions. While I commend the authors for the thorough characterization of the chemical-genetic and genetic-interaction data it would be possible to summarize further the initial results, in particular the initial screen for MEK inhibitor sensitive genes and to a lesser extent the establishment of the genetic interactions. This could give more space to focus on the main novel findings regarding the differential genetic interactions. The section on the differential interactions could in turn be broken down into more sub-sections trying to give more visibility to the main new findings that derive from this data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank for these suggestions and edited the manuscript accordingly. Specifically, we moved parts discussing technical details to the Materials and methods. We furthermore re-structured Figure 1, 2, 4 and 5 to allow readers to more easily follow the main messages in the manuscript. A more precise definition of the different types of interactions as outlined in Figure 1 also facilitates the accessibility of the manuscript. In addition, in the Results section we now highlighted more biological insights that can be drawn from our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The article gets confusing in the nomenclature of the genetic-interactions. These interactions can be: time (in)dependent, differential, stable, positive, negative, aggravating and alleviating. In particular, calling a time dependent interaction as &quot;stable&quot; is awkward. Perhaps using condition independent or condition insensitive instead of stable would be clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>We now introduced a more consistent phrasing of different context dependent genetic interactions and added precise definitions outlined in a revised Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The differential genetic interaction method is not described in the Materials and methods section. Are all genetic interaction pairs tested for differential interactions?</p></disp-quote><p>In response we shifted an expanded description of the two-factor robust linear modeling to the Materials and methods. All genes that we tested in the pair-wise interaction screen were subjected to differential interaction analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can a genetic interaction be called as significantly changing without having a strong effect size in any condition? Looking at the genetic interaction scores of replicates in Figure 2—figure supplement 5, the values range from around -5 to 5 with strong variance around -0.5 to 0.5. However, in several places in the article the interaction values and changes highlighted are often in the ranges of 0 to 0.5. Are these interaction terms calculated in the same way in Figure 2—figure supplement 5? It would appear that the variance in replicates is higher than the apparent precision of the method.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we find an uneven distribution of variance along the absolute mean of the π-score that peaks at medium to low π-scores. Interestingly, this distribution is different for independent features and e.g. the variance for DNA eccentricity peaks at high absolute values. We are convinced that by our statistical measures (moderated t-test, alongside stringent control of the false discovery rate) we can control these effects to robustly identify biological signal also from observations in the range of low absolute scores and high variance. As a result, most interactions with low π-scores are disregarded when analyzing interactions in isolated conditions. However, as we demonstrate at multiple points throughout the manuscript, the change in π-scores due to changing conditions (time and/or treatment) can often be statistically valid, even though it’s not significant in one single condition. An example is a synthetic lethal interaction between <italic>Rel</italic> and pnt (Figure 8). While the interaction is weak and non-significant in either condition, the difference between conditions is however surprisingly stable across replicates and forms one of the most significant differential interaction. As we score interaction differences between conditions in contrast to their amplitude in isolated conditions we can identify significant differential interactions in many cases (Figure 3B) where single conditions were not significant. Our manuscript thus presents a strategy to robustly detect interaction differences even if the interaction strength in one isolated condition was weaker. We adopted the new “Modelling of treatment sensitive interactions” section of the Materials and methods accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How are condition independent interactions (&quot;stable&quot;) defined ? A cut-off on the condition sensitivity parameter ?</p></disp-quote><p>Condition independent interactions are defined as interactions where the treatment coefficient has no significant predictive power (FDR&gt;0.1) while the time does influence the π-score significantly (FDR&lt;0.1, subsection “Modelling of treatment sensitive interactions”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Given that the differential interactions are being called with a linear model on the time differences with a term for the drug effect, are time invariant but drug dependent genetic interactions well captured by this model ?</p></disp-quote><p>This kind of time-independent but treatment sensitive interactions are indeed captured by the model and often include interactions that are non-significant in either condition but their differential change was significantly measurable (Figure 1, 4, Materials and methods). This includes the example interaction between <italic>Rel</italic> and <italic>pnt</italic>. Notably, the model does not readily capture interactions that are time and treatment independent but significant in the single conditions. These need to be captured using alternative, less sensitive methods such as the one sample moderated t-test used in earlier studies (e.g. Fischer et al., 2015). To clarify this further we extended the Materials and methods section devoted to the linear modeling and also discussed its current limits (e.g. its restriction to two modelled parameters per interaction) in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>- Figure 1E – annotate in the figure what are the Ras pathway components and translational regulators groups described in the Results section for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the requested figure annotation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 4F – could be move to supplementary materials and corresponding results description shortened.</p></disp-quote><p>We moved Figure 4F to the supplement and split Figure 4 into two figures.
