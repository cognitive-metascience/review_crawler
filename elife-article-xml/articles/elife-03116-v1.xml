initiate new trans-neuronal contacts. While much is known about the molecules that control filopodia extension and subsequent maturation into functional synapses, the mechanisms that regulate initiation of these dynamic, actin-rich structures have remained elusive. Here, we find that filopodia initiation is suppressed by recruitment of ArhGAP44 to actin-patches that seed filopodia. Recruitment is mediated by binding of a membrane curvature-sensing ArhGAP44 N-BAR domain to plasma membrane sections that were deformed inward by acto-myosin mediated contractile forces. A GAP domain in ArhGAP44 triggers local Rac-GTP hydrolysis, thus reducing actin polymerization required for filopodia formation. Additionally, ArhGAP44 expression increases during neuronal development, concurrent with a decrease in the rate of filopodia formation. Together, our data reveals a local auto-regulatory mechanism that limits initiation of filopodia via protein recruitment to nanoscale membrane deformations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03116.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03116.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03116.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our brains contain a vast network of many billions of cells that communicate with, and are connected to, each other. Each brain cell, or neuron, can form connections with as many as 10,000 other neurons—and signals pass from one neuron to the next at sites known as synapses.</p><p>A neuron's surface has numerous finger-like protrusions known as filopodia that are important for sensing the environment around the cells. Filopodia are highly changeable and constantly extend and retract as the filaments that support them—which are made up of a protein called actin—grow and shrink back. Neurons use their filopodia to explore and seek out other neurons in the brain, and when they make contact with the right neuron, it leads to the formation of a synapse. However, how filopodial extensions begin to grow—and what stops a neuron from forming too many filopodia—is not fully understood.</p><p>Galic et al. now show that a protein called ArhGAP44 limits the formation of new filopodia in neurons. The ArhGAP44 protein is recruited to patches of the surface membrane that have a lot of actin and that curve inwards. ArhGAP44 then locally inhibits other proteins that are normally required to extend the actin filaments and drive the growth of filopodia out from the surface of the cell.</p><p>Galic et al. also show that more ArhGAP44 is produced with age—levels are low in embryos and high in adults—and this increase in the amount of protein correlates with a decrease in the number of filopodia formed. When Galic et al. engineered rat neurons to produce more of the ArhGAP44 protein, fewer filopodia formed on the surface of the neurons. Decreasing the amount of this protein had the opposite effect. Moreover, ArhGAP44 was shown to mainly stop new filopodia from forming and had little effect on existing filopodia. Together, these findings suggest that ArhGAP44 may help neurons transition from a dynamic exploratory mode to a mature, more static, state; this is a characteristic of the development of the nervous system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03116.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03116.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>membrane curvature</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 1003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galic</surname><given-names>Milos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH064801</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH095087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM063702</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Local inward plasma membrane deformations caused by actomyosin-dependent contraction trigger the dynamic recruitment of a curvature-sensitive actin-regulatory protein, which represents a receptor-independent auto-regulatory mechanism to control local actin polymerization dynamics at the plasma membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the development of the central nervous system, neuronal progenitor cells proliferate, migrate, and finally differentiate into functional units to form a multi-cellular neuronal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayala et al., 2007</xref>). In culture, differentiation of individual neurons occurs in a stereotypic pattern starting with the formation of an axon, followed by the creation of an elaborate dendritic tree and culminating with the initiation and maturation of trans-neuronal synaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dotti et al., 1988</xref>). The formation of synaptic connections is often facilitated by dynamic exploratory filopodia that extend out of thicker dendritic branches to sample the environment and thereby increase the probability that selective pre-to-postsynaptic connections are established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ziv and Smith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marrs et al., 2001</xref>). Exploratory filopodia are dynamic finger-like membrane structures containing actin cables formed out of actin patches along the dendritic shaft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lau et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matus, 2000</xref>). Extension of filopodia is driven by local activation of formins, Ena/VASP proteins, small GTPases, and likely other steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krugmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lebrand et al., 2004</xref>). Intriguingly, the frequency of filopodia formation dramatically drops once high synapse density is established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ziv and Smith, 1996</xref>), suggesting that the initiation of these structures is controlled by opposing negative regulators. However, the identity of these inhibitors has remained elusive.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that ArhGAP44 limits the initiation of exploratory dendritic filopodia. Consistent with previous reports, we observe that formation of actin patches precedes filopodia extension. Notably, we find that within actin patches Myosin II-mediated pulling on plasma membrane (PM)-associated actin cables induces highly curved membrane sections that trigger ArhGAP44 recruitment. The resulting enrichment of ArhGAP44 then reduces local actin polymerization due to the Rac GAP activity of ArhGAP44, preventing the formation of filopodia. ArhGAP44 expression increases as the neuronal network is established and the frequency of exploratory filopodia formation is diminished, suggesting that ArhGAP44 may facilitate the transition of neurons from a dynamic exploratory mode to a mature more static state, a hallmark of nervous system development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ArhGAP44 is predominantly expressed in the brain and increases with age</title><p>Formation of filopodia depends on proteins that regulate polymerization of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krugmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lebrand et al., 2004</xref>). To identify new regulators of exploratory dendritic filopodia formation, we performed a literature search and identified 286 genes that were previously associated either directly or indirectly with actin reorganization. We then clustered these genes according to expression pattern using published microarray data and found 89 of the 286 genes to be expressed predominantly in neuronal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and ‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As we were interested in regulators of actin dynamics selective for the brain, we ranked these 89 genes for high expression in the brain compared to the spinal cord and tested the validity of the ranking using a set of control genes expressed only in one of the respective tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and ‘Materials and methods’). Among the five actin regulators with the highest brain vs spinal cord ratio, we found ArhGAP44 (also known as Rich2 or Nadrin2), a membrane-curvature-sensing GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) selective for the small Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Richnau and Aspenstrom, 2001</xref>).

We find the N-BAR domain enriched at the end of dendrites (dendritic tips; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>), as well as in spine-shaped dendritic protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). Knockdown of ArhGAP44 in aged neurons facilitates re-emergence of exploratory dendritic protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>). Thus, considering that ArhGAP44 expression increases with time, this suggests that ArhGAP44 may facilitate the transition of neurons from a dynamic exploratory mode to a mature more static state.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study shows that recruitment of ArhGAP44 to actin patches, which seed exploratory filopodia along dendritic branches, is mediated by Myosin II-dependent contraction of membrane-associated actin cables. These actin patches have been shown to serve as precursors for the formation of filopodia in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lau et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spillane et al., 2012</xref>) and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Korobova and Svitkina, 2010</xref>). Studies in non-neuronal cells showed that individual actin filaments within the actin cortex form bundles prior to filopodia elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Svitkina et al., 2003</xref>). Consistently, electron micrographs of neurons showed that these filopodial actin bundles are embedded in the underlying dendritic actin meshwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Korobova and Svitkina, 2010</xref>). It has been proposed that once enough actin filaments are bundled to generate the force required to protrude the PM, the resulting outward membrane deformation triggers recruitment of actin bundling/Cdc42 activating proteins, which then further increase the polymerization rate within the extending filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krugmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Disanza et al., 2006</xref>). Given the localization of Myosin II in actin patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), it is reasonable to conjecture that Myosin II-dependent contraction of individual actin filaments within actin patches provides structural integrity to counter the force generated by the extending filopodia. However, considering that individual actin filaments within a bundle are oriented with the barbed end to the PM, Myosin II-dependent contraction also exerts an inward directed pull forces that curve the PM inward which triggers increased recruitment of ArhGAP44. We propose that the highly convoluted membrane topography associated with actin patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) reflect such Myosin II-dependent contraction of membrane-associated actin cables, at which ArhGAP44 becomes enriched in a curvature-dependent manner. In support of this hypothesis, we find not only that inward membrane deformation is sufficient for ArhGAP44 and N-BAR domain recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3 fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplements 3 and 4</xref>), but that deletion of ArhGAP44 curvature-sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>) or reducing action-myosin-dependent contractile forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) both prevented ArhGAP44 enrichment.</p><p>A second major finding of our study is that recruitment of ArhGAP44 to plasma membrane deformations in nodes (i.e., acto-myosin patches) limits initiation of exploratory filopodia. We show that ArhGAP44 can hydrolize the small GTPase Rac and Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Thus, a likely function of local ArhGAP44 at actin patches is to suppress GTPase-mediated local actin polymerization. We propose that ArhGAP44 is limiting Rac-dependent formation of actin patches, which provide the structural integrity required for filopodia to protrude outwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is consistent with previous reports in neurons, showing that dynamic rearrangements within actin patches relies on Rac activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spillane et al., 2012</xref>), and that elevated Rac levels increase filopodia dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakayama et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang and Macara, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheadle and Biederer, 2012</xref>). In support of this notion, we find Rac1 localized at actin patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and show that artificial decrease of ArhGAP44 concentration at actin patches either by reducing overall ArhGAP44 levels by knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) or by preventing ArhGAP44-recruitment to actin patches via inhibition of acto-myosin contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ryu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hodges et al., 2011</xref>]) both increased the number of exploratory filopodia.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03116.048</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of ArhGAP44-dependent regulation of exploratory dendritic filopodia initiation.</title><p>Scanning electron micrographs of dendritic protrusions with and without filopodial protrusions aligned in a hypothetical time-line.

Consistently, knockdown of Cdc42 substantially reduces filopodia formation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garvalov et al., 2007</xref>). Intriguingly, overexpression of Cdc42 is not sufficient to initiate filopodia formation in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>, see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hotulainen et al., 2009</xref>]) or in other cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kast et al., 2014</xref>). This has led to the hypothesis that elongation of filopodia is a combinatorial process requiring multiple factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kast et al., 2014</xref>). We propose that signal integration at actin patches controls this decision of filopodia elongation. Considering that actin-patch formation occurs before filopodia elongation, this argues for a 2-step process where Rac1-induced patch formation (and ArhGAP44-dependent regulation thereof) precedes Cdc42-induced filopodia elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, since ArhGAP44 shows dual specificity for Rac1 and Cdc42, both steps will be limited by recruitment by ArhGAP44 to actin patches.</p><p>Taken together, we propose that ArhGAP44 mediates a localized negative feedback that becomes upregulated as neurons mature to reduce the frequency with which neurons initiate new exploratory filopodia. Considering that acto-myosin initiated PM deformation is a ubiquitous process and that a high number of curvature-sensing proteins are known to modify actin dynamics, this suggests that the local feedback mechanism for ArhGAP44 described in our study likely exemplifies a more general principle for receptor-independent signaling whereby signal transduction is initiated by the transient recruitment of regulatory proteins to actin- and force-dependent nanoscale PM indentations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Clustering of microarray data</title><p>A set of 286 genes relating to the actin cytoskeleton and GTPase signaling was identified with a search on the NCBI Gene database with the query ‘actin AND GTPase AND human[orgn]’.

Cells were then serum starved for 18 hr. For all conditions, live cell fluorescence 18 hr post transfection showed transfection efficiency of &gt;80%. Cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml EGF for 5 min. Next, cells were scratched and protein levels were measured and adjusted for all samples to equal levels. Of each sample 900 µl were used for pulldown and 100 µl for loading control. GTP levels were probed using Rac1 Activation Assay Kit (Cell Biolabs [San Diego, CA], STA-404) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, GTP-bound Rac was eluted from cell lysates using PAK PBD agarose beads and detected by western blot using α-Rac1 (Cell Biolabs, 240106) antibody.

Specific primers for ArhGAP44 were automatically designed and used to amplify from a cDNA library an approximate 600-bp PCR fragment of the 3′ region of the coding sequence. A second amplification was performed with a set of nested primers bearing a T7 promoter sequence on their 5′ extension. Nested PCR products were transcribed in vitro (T7 MEGA script kit; Ambion, Austin, TX) and the resulting double-stranded RNAs were annealed and processed with 30 units per reaction of human recombinant Dicer (Invitrogen) for 15 hr at 37°C. The 21mer siRNAs were separated from incompletely digested fragments using a succession of isopropanol precipitations and filtration on glass fiber plates (Nunc, Rochester, NY).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Filopodia dynamics analysis</title><p>Neurons were imaged for 10 min every 60 s using a 63× objective.

The relative intensity of POI’s was determined as [(POI<sub>Patch</sub> − POI<sub>BG</sub>)/(Cytosol<sub>Patch</sub> − Cytosol<sub>BG</sub>)]/[(POI<sub>Dendrite</sub> − POI<sub>BG</sub>)/(Cytosol<sub>Dendrite</sub> − Cytosol<sub>BG</sub>)].</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Correlative IF/SEM image analysis</title><p>A micro-pattern was generated on glass slides and coated over night with PLL (0.1 mg/ml).

Cells were then sputter-coated with 70A of Au/Pd using a Denton Desk 11 Sputter Coater. Using the backscatter detector, individual micro-patterns were identified and used to navigate and identify individual previously imaged neurons as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 2 peer reviewers, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers.</p><p>After careful examination of the results and multiple consultations, the reviewers and the Reviewing editor decided that the results did not reach the level of significance claimed by the authors and despite tackling an interesting problem, the main interpretations would require a lot more work to meet our publication standard. The reviewers’ comments follow for your consideration.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>The authors analyze here the Rac1 GAP and BAR-domain containing protein Nadrin2, which they identified as an actin regulatory protein enriched in brain vs spinal cord and that they show to be enriched in cortex. Overexpression and knock-down studies demonstrate that this protein is a negative regulator of dendritic filopodia number. The GAP activity contributes to this function, but is not required. Analyzing filopodia dynamics, live imaging data upon knock-down and in overexpressing neurons support that this protein causes newly formed filopodia to be unstable. Nadrin2 localizes to actin rich dendritic patches (which are nicely analyzed using correlative scanning EM/immunostaining), and imaging of the less active Nadrin2 GAP mutant supports that filopodia can emerge from these dendritic Nadrin2 patches. Interestingly, Nadrin2 appears to be recruited dynamically and in a myosin light chain kinase-dependent manner to these actin patches, which also contain Rac1. The model that emerges from these results is that myosin-actin interactions at dendritic membranes cause membrane indentations to form, which recruit Nadrin2 via its BAR domain to dynamically regulate Rac1 and restrict filopodia formation. This provides evidence that stable filopodia require not only positive signals to form but also the removal of negative regulators such as Nadrin2, which is an interesting concept. Several key experimental questions need to be addressed, however, to further strengthen this study.</p><p>1) How frequently do filopodia emerge from Nadrin2-positive patches? Are filopodia more likely to emerge from these patches than from Nadrin-2 negative dendritic shaft areas? This information will allow to assess how important a player Nadrin2 is in the control of filopodia formation. If most emerging filopodia do not contain Nadrin2, this protein is only relevant to control a subset of these protrusions.</p><p>2) Does overexpression or loss of Nadrin2 impact the number of dendritic spines? This is important to assess the biological role of Nadrin2-mediated filopodia formation.</p><p>3) Can the authors show more directly that Nadrin2 is recruited to membranes in a curvature-dependent manner?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> only shows that Rac1 overexpression promotes the formation of transient filopodia independent of Nadrin2. The statement that “Nadrin2 limits Rac-dependent de novo filopodia formation” is not supported by these data.</p><p>5) Knock-down neurons should be stained for Nadrin2 to confirm antibody specificity in immunostaining.</p><p>6) The tissue distribution blot in Figure1 needs to be repeated for better signals.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The paper identifies Nadrin2 as brain-enriched regulator of filopodia outgrowth in neuronal dendrites, as overexpression of the wt strongly suppresses filopodial number. More refined manipulations of Nadrin2 have a number of more moderate effects: it shows a mild (50%) enrichment in actin patches along the dendrite compared to GFP, and its knockdown prompts an increase in the number of quickly collapsing protrusions and a 20% increase in steady state filopodia density. Its recruitment to patches is shown to depend on its N-BAR domain, suggesting it is recruited to the membrane curvature observed in detail by SEM in these patches. Pharmacological inhibition of Myosin II or application of LatA or CytoD acutely reduced Nadrin2 at the patches, suggesting that the status of actin and myosin in the patches is also involved in Nadrin2 targeting. The model is that Nadrin2 recruitment suppresses Rac1 activity important for filopodial extension, and this model is supported by weaker phenotypes of a Nadrin2 mutant that retains only weak Rac1 GAP activity.</p><p>The paper presents a new model for suppression of protrusion formation, and postulates a role for the membrane curvature seen in the filopodial birthplaces. These observations highlight previously overlooked aspects of neuronal process formation. The combination of live-cell imaging and correlative SEM is potentially quite powerful. However, the live-cell approaches are not used to test the Nadrin2 model very directly, and though the phenotype is compelling, overall I find the explanation offered by the model only weakly supported by the available data.</p><p>My major concerns are as follows:</p><p>1) The authors overuse the terms “transient” and “dynamic” to describe the Nadrin2 enrichment at patches. For example, “A major finding of our study is that transient recruitment of Nadrin2 to actin patches...”… “deletion of Nadrin2 curvature-sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) as well as limiting action-myosin dependent contractile forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) both prevented dynamic Nadrin2 recruitment.” “both treatments led to a significant reduction of Nadrin2 recruitment”</p><p>In fact, the time course of recruitment is never analyzed in the paper. There is only one <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure (3C)</xref> that shows any transience. No treatment was analyzed in a manner that would have assessed the dynamic nature of the recruitment. Perhaps the decreased but remaining colocalization is just as transient but weak, or more short-lived but just as pronounced. Regarding myosin, the ML7 results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) seem to suggest only that retention, not recruitment, of Nadrin2 are mediated by myosin II. It seems that examining the time course of accumulating Nadrin2 with respect to the time of filopodial extension would be required to evaluate the model. A more specific test would be to compare the time course of active Rac1 in the patch with Nadrin2 levels. Similarly, the curvature aspect could be addressed in detail specifically by timelapsing the N-BAR construct during extension.</p><p>2) The authors state “the transient localization of Nadrin2 to patches but not to extended filopodia argues that Nadrin2 limits initiation rather than elongation of newly formed filopodia.”</p><p>Why doesn't this argue equally well that recruitment of Nadrin2 initiates outgrowth? Loss of Nadrin in an elongating filopodium would seem to indicate that it might in fact suppress elongation, not initiation. With the few examples available for viewing, initiation seems to occur before loss of Nadrin. Clearly, an additional step of mechanism would be required to explain the overexpression and knockdown phenotypes, but I think it is too facile to say the live imaging supports this model.</p><p>3) The authors state “Our experiments identified the small GTPase Rac as the principal target of Nadrin2 within actin patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1B</xref>).”</p><p>The indicated figure does not demonstrate this at all. The assumption is that Nadrin2 acts through Rac1 only, not Cdc42, but the alternative (interaction with Cdc42) is not tested. Can this really be dismissed out of hand? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> tests the relative levels of GTP-Rac1, but does not test whether Nadrin2 or its mutant alter levels of other potential targets (e.g. Cdc42).</p><p>A related but unstated presumption is that the dynamic assays of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> predict total protrusion number, and expressing Cdc42 would provide a test of that as effect of its overexpression is opposite to Rac1. Does Cdc42 overexpression alter the dynamic measures in a way opposite to Rac1? Does it decrease the number of nodes?</p><p>Presumably, dynamics were not measured following Nadrin2(wt) overexpression because there are so few filopodia left, but shouldn't the Rac1+Nadrin2(wt) case be examined, since Nadrin2(wt) should suppress the Rac1 phenotype? That is the claim in the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, left column.</p><p>4) Surprisingly, the movies do not make a great case for this paper, and in fact in my mind raise more questions than they answer. Technically, the intensity levels fluctuate substantially, making me wonder whether small or thin structures such as nascent filopodia or nodes could really be identified with confidence. One troubling example is in the upper right panel, going from frame 1 to 2. The structure seemingly of most interest is the node or protrusion in the middle of the process (under “n2”), which appears to pop into existence. But the entire image brightens in this panel, making it unclear whether to trust the relative intensity of the node. Related to that type of phenomenon, some of the fluctuation is apparently due to an inconsistent z span; e.g. in Movie 1, the overexpression of Nadrin2 panel clearly shows the middle one of the processes fade out and then return, as it was insufficiently spanned by the planes of the z sectioning. In the upper right panel, that particular node could just have been captured more completely in bounds of the z stack rather than appear or brighten in reality.</p><p>In terms of observations, it doesn't seem as though the control example in movie 1 demonstrates any protrusion formation at all. Am I missing something? Based on the quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A'</xref>, there should be just as many forming and collapsing processes as there are processes that persist through the movie, but I don't see this at all. At the very least, I'd say that readers will need some help: formation, collapse, and unclassified changes should probably be pointed out with markers of some sort.</p><p>Raw data (movies) of the Rac1 and Rac1+Nadrin2(R291M) experiments would be good to see.</p><p>More raw data (stills or movies) from the key experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and 3B</xref> is needed.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, the accumulation of a set of SEM images into a numbered series of panels portrayed as “stages” is unnecessary and misleading-there is no evidence presented here or cited that the stages correspond to a growth sequence. There is a near-total lack of information about how these images were assessed or quantified, and what constituted a node or a protrusion or any other feature.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03116.052</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We have substantially expanded description and analysis of filopodia initiation from dendritic nodes, showing now in detail morphological rearrangements and kinetic behavior of ArhGAP44 and actin at such sites.

We have substantially reduced the use of both terms in the text, using them now only 2 times in the whole manuscript to describe ArhGAP44.</p><p>(B) Curvature-aspect of protein recruitment. In the revised version of the manuscript, we added a series of experiments to investigate the curvature-dependence of ArhGAP44 enrichment (see also Referee #1, point 3):</p><p>We show that the isolated N-BAR domain of ArhGAP44 forms puncta selectively above nanocone-induced membrane-deformation in the basal PM of primary hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5–figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media14 media15">Videos 14, 15</xref>).</p><p>We show that enrichment of ArhGAP44 over nanocone-induced PM-deformations does not correlate with enrichment of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 3F</xref>) or of actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 3G</xref>).</p><p>These experiments provide evidence that inward plasma membrane deformation is sufficient for enrichment of ArhGAP44 to inward deformed plasma membranes in neurons.</p><p>(C) Time course of ArhGAP44 enrichment. The following four experiments were added: ArhGAP44 is recruited to contracting structures: We added a synthetic approach that we developed earlier, where we used a small molecule to rapidly recruit a Rac GEF to the PM and activate Rac in order to increase actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media13">Video 13</xref>). In this approach, we observe enrichment of the isolated N-BAR domain of ArhGAP44 at retracting actin-rich structures induced along the dendritic shaft. Together with the experiment where we inhibit MLCK using ML-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and show that recruitment of ArhGAP44 requires myosin contraction, this argues that the increase in local ArhGAP44 concentration is caused by increased formation of acto-myosin-dependent inward membrane deformation.</p><p>Kinetic analysis of actin and ArhGAP44 during filopodia initiation. The following experiments were added: we find that 83% ± 7% of all protrusion emerge from dendritic nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3B</xref>), that 89% ± 6% of all protrusions emerge from actin patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1B</xref>), and that ArhGAP44 is enriched in 100% of actin patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3B</xref>). These experiments argue that the majority of dendritic protrusions are emerging from dendritic nodes that are enriched both in actin and in ArhGAP44.</p><p>Together, these added experiments further strengthen the statement that ArhGAP44 is recruited to contracting actin patches within nodes that precede filopodia elongation.</p><p>(D) Retention vs. Recruitment. We propose that ArhGAP44 diffuses trough the cytosol by Brownian movement, and that enrichment of ArhGAP44 at nodes is caused by binding of the protein to inward membrane deformations that transiently form at such sites due to myosin-dependent contraction of membrane-associated actin cables. Binding of N-BAR domain proteins (such as ArhGAP44) has been shown to depend (i) on increased electrostatic interactions between negatively charged lipid head groups in curved membranes and positively charged amino acids of the banana-shaped protein dimer facing the membrane, and (ii) the insertion of an amphipatic helix present in all N-BAR domain proteins into membrane-imperfections that predominantly occur in curved lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dotti et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ziv &amp; Smith, 1996</xref>). Enrichment of N-BAR domain proteins at curved membranes is thus believed to be due to an increase in binding affinity that may result molecularly from a reduced off-rate and possibly an increased on-rate. As the term ‘recruitment’ does not imply active directed transport (it is often used to describe a diffusion mediated retention at local sites), we feel that it is appropriate to use this term since it describes the observed dynamic increase in local concentration of ArhGAP44 when new actin patches are formed.</p><p><italic>2) The authors state “the transient localization of Nadrin2 to patches but not to extended filopodia argues that Nadrin2 limits initiation rather than elongation of newly formed filopodia</italic>.”</p><p><italic>Why doesn't this argue equally well that recruitment of Nadrin2 initiates outgrowth? Loss of Nadrin in an elongating filopodium would seem to indicate that it might in fact suppress elongation, not initiation. With the few examples available for viewing, initiation seems to occur before loss of Nadrin. Clearly, an additional step of mechanism would be required to explain the overexpression and knockdown phenotypes, but I think it is too facile to say the live imaging supports this model</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the referee that it is a valid question whether ArhGAP44 functions more as an inhibitor of filopodia initiation vs. an inhibitor of filopodia elongation/outgrowth: We considered that an inhibitor of filopodia elongation/outgrowth would be expected to localize together with positive regulators of actin dynamics (e.g. MENA or IRSp53) at the tip of extending filopodia where actin-polymerization in growing filopodia occurs. In contrast, an inhibitor of filopodia initiation would be expected to be present at the ´birthplace´ of filopodia, and to dissociate once elongation/outgrowth begins. The localization of ArhGAP44 all across actin patches, which our data argues is caused by acto-myosin dependent inward curved plasma membrane deformation, suggests that it reduces Rac and Cdc42 activity globally across the patch which we think explains the lower frequency of filopodia extension. The dissociation from extending filopodia (with outward membrane deformation) can best be explained by the change in curvature (all negative) in the extending membrane tubes. Based on the selectivity of N-BAR domain proteins to positively curved membranes, we therefore think that our data is consistent with a role of ArhGAP44 in regulating filopodia initiation. In the revised version of the manuscript we discuss this now in the text.</p><p>As an added note: the possibility that ArhGAP44 may have additional functions in nodes (e.g. inhibit filopodia initiation AND elongation/outgrowth) will be discussed in more detail below in point 4.</p><p><italic>3) The authors state “Our experiments identified the small GTPase Rac as the principal target of Nadrin2 within actin patches (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1"><italic>Figure 2–figure supplement 1B</italic></xref><italic>).” The indicated figure does not demonstrate this at all</italic>.</p><p>We agree.

Does Cdc42 overexpression alter the dynamic measures in a way opposite to Rac1? Does it decrease the number of nodes</italic>?</p><p>This is an excellent question. Considering the dual specificity of ArhGAP44 to Rac1 and Cdc42 (as we cite in the paper), ArhGAP44 also likely has an added function in regulating Cdc42 during filopodia initiation (it is well established that Cdc42 is critically involved in filopodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marrs et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lau et al., 1999</xref>)). In the revised version, we have added 3 experiments as well as raw material to characterize the potential interplay between ArhGAP44 and Cdc42:</p><p>ArhGAP44 can hydrolyze GTP-Cdc42: Consistent with previous reports, we find hydrolysis of GFP-Cdc42 by ArhGAP44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5A</xref>).</p><p>Overexpression of Rac1(wt) but not of Cdc42(wt) phenocopies protrusion dynamics upon knockdown of ArhGAP44: We have previously shown that knockdown of ArhGAP44 increases density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, yellow) and dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, yellow) of dendritic protrusions, while overexpression of ArhGAP44 reduces protrusion density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, blue) and protrusion dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, blue). As ArhGAP44 is a RhoGAP, overexpression of the small GTPase that is targeted by ArhGAP44 should phenocopy the knockdown of ArhGAP44. We previously showed that overexpression of Rac1(wt) increases density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5B</xref>, red) and dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, red) of dendritic protrusions, and rescues reduced protrusion dynamics upon overexpression of ArhGAP44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, purple). For Cdc42, we showed in the initial submission that overexpression of Cdc42(wt) did not increase protrusion density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5B</xref>, green). We have now added experiments that show that overexpression of Cdc42(wt) has no effect on protrusion dynamics, and does not rescues reduced protrusion dynamics upon overexpression of ArhGAP44(R291M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5C</xref>). The latter suggests that Rac regulation is more important but does not exclude an additional regulatory role of Cdc42.</p><p>Overexpression of Rac1(wt) but not of Cdc42(wt) phenocopies protrusion morphology upon knockdown of ArhGAP44: In the revised version of the manuscript, we added raw material showing that overexpression of Rac1 but not of Cdc42 phenocopied the ArhGAP44 knockdown causing the formation of dynamic dendritic nodes and filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3 media4">Videos 3, 4</xref>, 6–10). Again, this suggest for a more important role of Rac but does not exclude an added regulation of ArhGAP44 on Cdc42.</p><p>Together, while these results argue for ArhGAP44-dependent regulation of Rac1 in actin patches, we agree with the referee that a discussion about the function of Cdc42 has been missing in the initial manuscript. Following discussion on the role of Cdc42 have been added to the text: Cdc42 acts as an activator of Irsp53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lebrand et al., 2004</xref>), promoting IRSp53-dependent enrichment and clustering of VASP and other factors to drive actin assembly in elongating filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krugmann et al., 2001</xref>). Consistently, knockdown of Cdc42 substantially reduces filopodia formation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Richnau &amp; Aspenstrom, 2001</xref>). Intriguingly, overexpression of Cdc42 is not sufficient to initiate filopodia formation in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5</xref>, see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rollason et al., 2009</xref>)) or in other cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lebrand et al., 2004</xref>). This has led to the hypothesis that elongation of filopodia is a combinatorial process requiring multiple factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lebrand et al., 2004</xref>). We propose that signal integration at actin patches controls this decision of filopodia elongation. Considering that actin-patch formation occurs before filopodia elongation, this argues for a 2-step process where Rac1-induced patch formation (and ArhGAP44-dependent regulation thereof) precedes Cdc42-induced filopodia elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, since ArhGAP44 shows dual specificity for Rac1 and Cdc42, both steps will be limited by recruitment by ArhGAP44 to actin patches.</p><p><italic>5) Presumably, dynamics were not measured following Nadrin2(wt) overexpression because there are so few filopodia left, but shouldn't the Rac1+Nadrin2(wt) case be examined, since Nadrin2(wt) should suppress the Rac1 phenotype? That is the claim in the model of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref><italic>, left column</italic>.</p><p>Expression of ArhGAP44(wt) rapidly triggers varicosity formation and cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1–figure supplement 6</xref>), likely due to excessive levels of the enzyme. Consequentially, either enzymatic efficiency or expression levels need to be reduced to study ArhGAP44 function in neurons. Since western blot analysis and live cell experiments show that ArhGAP44(R291M) is less potent than ArhGAP44(wt) but still active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1–figure supplement 6</xref>), we decided to use ArhGAP44(R291M) for the synthetic rescue experiments. In contrast to a system that would rely on reduced expression of ArhGAP44(wt), this approach has the additional advantage of providing a strong fluorescence signal that is critical to identify transfected cells and study sub-cellular protein localization.</p><p><italic>6) Surprisingly, the movies do not make a great case for this paper, and in fact in my mind raise more questions than they answer. Technically, the intensity levels fluctuate substantially, making me wonder whether small or thin structures such as nascent filopodia or nodes could really be identified with confidence. One troubling example is in the upper right panel, going from frame 1 to 2. The structure seemingly of most interest is the node or protrusion in the middle of the process (under “n2”), which appears to pop into existence. But the entire image brightens in this panel, making it unclear whether to trust the relative intensity of the node. Related to that type of phenomenon, some of the fluctuation is apparently due to an inconsistent z span; e.g. in Movie 1, the overexpression of Nadrin2 panel clearly shows the middle one of the processes fade out and then return, as it was insufficiently spanned by the planes of the z sectioning. In the upper right panel, that particular node could just have been captured more completely in bounds of the z stack rather than appear or brighten in reality</italic>.</p><p><italic>In terms of observations, it doesn't seem as though the control example in movie 1 demonstrates any protrusion formation at all. Am I missing something? Based on the quantification in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A'</italic></xref><italic>, there should be just as many forming and collapsing processes as there are processes that persist through the movie, but I don't see this at all. At the very least, I'd say that readers will need some help: formation, collapse, and unclassified changes should probably be pointed out with markers of some sort</italic>.</p><p><italic>Raw data (movies) of the Rac1 and Rac1+Nadrin2(R291M) experiments would be good to see</italic>.</p><p><italic>More raw data (stills or movies) from the key experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3A and 3B</italic></xref> <italic>is needed</italic>.</p><p>(A) Added raw material: We agree with the reviewer that addition of more raw data would be helpful to (i) explain what types of dendritic protrusions exist, and (ii) show how these protrusions are affected by overexpression and knockdown of ArhGAP44 or the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42.

As the referee correctly state, we only observe structures in the illuminated plane of the confocal microscope. This means that dynamic dendritic sections that move in z-direction during the 10 minute long acquisition period may cause filopodia to leave the confocal plane. To investigate the frequency and origins of protrusions that ‘pop into existence, the following experiments were added:</p><p>Timelapse analysis of filopodia formation using a shorter acquisition interval: As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4B</xref>, 57% ± 8% of all filopodia elongate from nodes, while the remaining filopodia appear to emerge directly from the dendritic shaft (i.e. ‘pop into existence’) using an acquisition interval of 60 seconds (between frames). However, when the acquisition interval was reduced from 60 seconds to 15 seconds (i.e. between frames), the fraction of filopodia emerging from nodes increased to 83% ± 7%.</p><p>Time series showing dendritic filopodia emerging from node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4A</xref>). This example shows that the acquisition interval of 60 seconds is sufficient to detect protrusions, but may in some cases miss nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4A</xref>, compare columns 2 and 4).</p><p>These added experiments provide evidence that the majority of filopodia that ‘pop into existence’ are reflective of filopodia emerging from dendritic nodes that were to short-lived to be captured using a 60-second interval. We consider the remaining 17% of filopodia that ‘pop into existence’ to be a mixure of (i) filopodia emerging from nodes in less than 15 seconds (i.e. between frames), (ii) filopodia emerging directly from the dendritic shaft, or, more likely, (iii) filopodia that appear due to changes in the focal plane of the dendritic tree.</p><p><italic>7) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref><italic>, the accumulation of a set of SEM images into a numbered series of panels portrayed as “stages” is unnecessary and misleading-there is no evidence presented here or cited that the stages correspond to a growth sequence.

Only the proximal 50-60 μm of the dendritic arbors that can clearly be associated to a particular neuron were analyzed.
