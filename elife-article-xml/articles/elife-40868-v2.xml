multiple (~4 Hz) objects. Here, we investigated whether attention samples sensory representations that are not part of the conscious percept during binocular rivalry. When crossmodally cued toward a conscious image, subsequent changes in consciousness occurred at ~8 Hz, consistent with the rates of undivided attentional sampling. However, when attention was cued toward the suppressed image, changes in consciousness slowed to ~3.5 Hz, indicating the division of attention away from the conscious visual image. In the electroencephalogram, we found that at attentional sampling frequencies, the strength of inter-trial phase-coherence over fronto-temporal and parieto-occipital regions correlated with changes in perception. When cues were not task-relevant, these effects disappeared, confirming that perceptual changes were dependent upon the allocation of attention, and that attention can flexibly sample away from a conscious image in a task-dependent manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>visual attention</kwd><kwd>periodic sampling</kwd><kwd>binocular rivalry</kwd><kwd>crossmodal stimulation</kwd><kwd>EEG</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FT120100619</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsuchiya</surname><given-names>Naotsugu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP130100194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsuchiya</surname><given-names>Naotsugu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP150101731</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alais</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combined behavioural and electroencephalographic approach investigating the covert allocation of attention shows evidence for distributed periodic sampling away from a conscious visual image.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent behavioral and electrophysiological evidence suggests that despite our seamless visual experience, incoming visual information is periodically enhanced for analysis in the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">VanRullen, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">VanRullen, 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zoefel and VanRullen, 2017</xref>). This periodic sampling mechanism is proposed to result from the allocation of visual attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and VanRullen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dugué et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dugué and VanRullen, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">VanRullen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zoefel and VanRullen, 2017</xref>), wherein alternating windows of high- and low-attentional resources operate to parcel incoming visual information, similar to the sequential frames that capture film within a video camera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chakravarthi and Vanrullen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Vanrullen and Dubois, 2011</xref>).

These spontaneous fluctuations in detection may result from the allocation of visual attention toward a single location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and VanRullen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dugué et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Spaak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">VanRullen, 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zoefel and VanRullen, 2017</xref>), and support the assumption that neural excitability cycles gate and filter incoming information for further processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schroeder and Lakatos, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">VanRullen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zoefel and VanRullen, 2017</xref>).</p><p>This periodic gating of visual perception is also prominent behaviorally in the time-course of detection accuracy. Spectral analyses applied to high temporal resolution behavioral measures reveal 7–8 Hz modulations in performance following cues to reorient attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fiebelkorn et al., 2013</xref>), which slow proportionately when attention is divided between two or more locations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Holcombe and Chen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Landau and Fries, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Landau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">VanRullen, 2013</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Landau and Fries, 2012</xref> observed that following a cue to reorient attention to either the left or right visual hemifield, target detection oscillated at a 4 Hz counterphase rhythm depending on whether cues were congruent or incongruent with the target location. Critically, this counterphase sampling of visual information persisted at ~4 Hz when attention was directed to two locations on a single object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fiebelkorn et al., 2013</xref>), and when cues to reorient attention were incongruent with target location – requiring a subsequent shift in the allocation of attention to a second location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). These successive fluctuations in target detection and counterphase sampling between locations have led to the suggestion that an intrinsic ~7–8 Hz attentional rhythm can be allocated over space and time in a sequential manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dugué et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dugué and VanRullen, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fiebelkorn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Holcombe and Chen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Landau and Fries, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">VanRullen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zoefel and VanRullen, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we tested if rhythmic attentional sampling is at play during binocular rivalry. During binocular rivalry, incompatible images are presented to each eye which results in stochastic perceptual alternations, with one image visible at a time while the other is suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alais, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alais and Blake, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Maier et al., 2012</xref>). In an experiment designed to induce or delay these transitions using auditory and tactile cues, we found that changes in consciousness were occurring rhythmically after the reorientation of attention. These fluctuations occurred depending on whether the crossmodal cue directed attention toward either the dominant or suppressed visual image, resulting in ~8 Hz and ~3.5 Hz oscillations, respectively. Critically, these rhythms were observed in both behavior and the electroencephalogram (EEG), and were absent when cues were not task-relevant. This approximate halving of frequency suggests that when non-visual input is inconsistent with the ongoing visual percept, attentional sampling can flexibly orient away from a consciously perceived image, seemingly ‘searching for’ alternative sensory information to resolve the conflict.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Attending to low-frequency crossmodal stimulation promotes the perceptual dominance of low-frequency flicker during binocular rivalry</title><p>We manipulated the conscious visibility of images across two sessions of 24 × 3 min binocular rivalry blocks. Subjects (<italic>N</italic> = 34) continuously reported the content of their visual consciousness via button press to indicate which image they currently perceived, while neural activity was simultaneously recorded via 64-channel EEG (see Materials and methods). Rivalry stimuli were orthogonal sinusoidal gratings, which underwent sinusoidal contrast modulation, one at 4.5 Hz and the other at 20 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In each 3 min block, we intermittently presented 12 crossmodal cues (mean duration 2.6 s), which were sinusoidally amplitude-modulated signals presented in the auditory and/or tactile modality (auditory, tactile, or combined auditory and tactile) at a frequency congruent with one of the visual stimuli (4.5 or 20 Hz). Three null cues (visual-only periods) without any crossmodal stimulation were also presented to increase the uncertainty of stimulus timing. The visual-only periods also served as a baseline to compare the behavioral effects of crossmodal cues (see below). We separated all cue periods by jittering the ISI between 7–10 s. As a result, the timing of crossmodal cues was completely independent to perceptual reports, and cues were presented at any point relative to the onset of the currently dominant percept (i.e., no closed-loop control).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40868.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental paradigm.</title><p>A schematic time course showing stimulus presentation and reported visual percept.

For one of their two sessions (day 1 for <italic>n</italic> = 16, day 2 for <italic>n</italic> = 18), we asked subjects to count the number of times that the temporal frequency of crossmodal cues coincided with their conscious visual percept at crossmodal cue offset (see Materials and methods). For their other session, subjects were instructed to focus on reporting their visual percept alone – ignoring any crossmodal cues.</p><p>Following the onset of a crossmodal cue, the probability of perceiving a congruent visual image increased only during attended low-frequency cues compared to all other cue types, during the period 0.68 to 3.97 s after cue onset (repeated measures ANOVAs followed by planned comparisons, FDR q = 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). There was no difference in this effect when comparing the three types of crossmodal cues (auditory, tactile, and combined auditory tactile, data not shown). To confirm that this effect was due to attention, we performed a correlation-based behavioral analysis. First, we computed the Pearson's correlation coefficient (x-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), between each subject’s verbally reported number of congruent cues (i.e., their attentional task during attend conditions), to the actual number of cues that were congruent with their visual percepts based on button-press data. Second, we defined the strength of the crossmodal cueing effect for attended low-frequency cues compared to other cue types (y-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), as the difference in the probability of seeing the congruent visual flicker during 1 to 4 s after cue onset. We call this the perceptual switch index (PSI), as it reflects the degree of perceptual switch after cue onset. The magnitude of these two variables displayed a strong positive correlation (<italic>r</italic>(32) = 0.46, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006, two-tailed), suggesting that the cross-modal cueing effect was indeed mediated by attention.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40868.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Behavioral results.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Button-press data, aligned at cue onset, were averaged over all crossmodal cue and visual-only periods per subject, then averaged over subjects for each cue condition.

By contrast, when visual and crossmodal cues matched at cue onset, the effect of attending to low-frequency crossmodal cues delayed changes to the previously suppressed visual percept compared to all other cue types, over the period from 1.05 to 3.58 s (FDR q = 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Comparison against the visual-only cue period yielded the same conclusion, confirming that the attended low-frequency cues significantly influenced rivalry dynamics, while other cue types did not.

In their model, attentional modulation is dealt to the sensory representation that has the stronger sensory responses, by providing feedback to monocular-excitatory drives that otherwise increase monotonically with stimulus contrast. Building on our findings, future models could incorporate an oscillatory increase in excitatory drive as a result of periodic, rather than sustained attentional modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fiebelkorn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Helfrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">VanRullen, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Previous behavioral investigations of attentional sampling have relied upon a brief cue to reorient attention, before estimating the time-course of target detection by densely sampling subject responses over closely spaced target-presentation intervals. Our design is unique in that ‘target-detection’ here is operationalized as the first reported change in visual consciousness for a continuously presented stimulus, resolved at 16.7 ms (or 60 Hz) from 500 ms to 2000 ms following cue-onset.</p><p>Past researchers have demonstrated approximately 7–8 Hz fluctuations in perceptual performance following the allocation of visual attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dugué et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fiebelkorn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">VanRullen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">VanRullen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zoefel and VanRullen, 2017</xref>), commensurate with suggestions that cortical oscillations at approximately 7–8 Hz gate the content of visual perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and VanRullen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dugué and VanRullen, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hanslmayr et al., 2013</xref>). In our binocular rivalry paradigm, we also observed changes in visual consciousness occurring within an 8 Hz rhythm, yet unique to when cues were congruent with the dominant visual percept at cue onset. By contrast, perceptual sampling has previously been observed at ~4 Hz when cues have encouraged dividing attention between two objects or locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dugué et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fiebelkorn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Landau and Fries, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Landau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Song et al., 2014</xref>). As such, the ~3.5 Hz rhythm we observed when crossmodal cues mismatched with the conscious visual percept extends the evidence for divided attentional sampling to binocular rivalry.</p><p>From our data alone, we cannot infer whether during conventional binocular rivalry, attention samples at 8 or 4 Hz. We surmise that increased attention to stimulus competition may be required to observe the attentional sampling rhythms we report here. Indeed outside of attended cue periods we did not observe periodic behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that attentional sampling is commensurate with sustained and goal-directed attention, instead of persisting throughout rivalry. We also note that the issue of trial-to-trial variability when reporting on perceptual changes cannot be completely avoided in binocular rivalry research, and is important to consider. Here, one might argue that variable timing in perceptual reports may blur any effects of temporal periodicity. However, our results clearly demonstrate that a change in perceptual state occurred for attended low-frequency cues that were unique in changing visual consciousness compared to visual-only baseline, at or near frequencies of attentional sampling that have been reported in previous literature. By comparison, the time-course of visual switches during visual-only periods did not exhibit periodic sampling, nor did the first-switches during non-attended, or high-frequency cues.</p><p>Distinct neural correlates of these attentional sampling rhythms were also found in the EEG. We found significantly greater 3.5 Hz ITPC strength for mismatched compared to matched cue types over right fronto-centro-temporal electrodes [FT8 and C6], suggesting this region may be a candidate neural correlate for divided periodic attentional sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Accordingly, following both mismatched and matched cues, increased 3.5 Hz ITPC in this region also positively correlated with the likelihood of switching to the previously suppressed visual image across subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c–d</xref>). Using visual-only stimulation, previous research has identified a pre-target ~4 Hz phase-dependency for peri-threshold perception when attention is divided across visual hemifields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Landau et al., 2015</xref>). While our right fronto-temporal region is different to those previously implicated in attentional-sampling (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Landau et al., 2015</xref>), we note that in our paradigm, attention was not divided between visual hemifields, but between competing stimuli during binocular rivalry. Right fronto-temporal regions have previously been implicated in the reorientation of attention to unattended locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Downar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Proskovec et al., 2018</xref>), and most recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Helfrich et al., 2018</xref> have demonstrated that the phase of ~4 Hz dependent sampling in frontal and parietal areas determines visual perception. Taken together, our results support previous research indicating that a periodic attentional sampling mechanism modulates visual perception, here extending this finding into binocular rivalry when visual stimuli spatially overlap and compete for perceptual dominance.</p><p>We also found behavioral and neural correlates of focused attentional sampling during binocular rivalry when cues were consistent with the prevailing visual percept. Specifically, 8 Hz ITPC over parieto-occipital electrodes was negatively correlated with the likelihood of switching to the incongruent perceptual outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Previously, phase-dependent peri-threshold perception has been reported for focused attention tasks in the visual domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Busch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and VanRullen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hanslmayr et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mathewson et al., 2009</xref>), and has primarily implicated an approximately 7 Hz component located over fronto-central electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Busch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and VanRullen, 2010</xref>). Given the differences between paradigms, it is unsurprising that our identified region for focused attentional sampling does not coincide with those reported in previous research regarding phase-dependent perception. Particularly as our right-lateralized response may be due to the left-lateralized tactile input used to investigate crossmodal attentional sampling (though ITPC was not different among the three crossmodal stimulation types, data not shown). While promising, future experiments that control for this lateralization are needed to characterize the contributions of fronto-centro-temporal and parieto-occipital regions to this effect, particularly as activity over each of these regions has previously been implicated in the reorienting of visuo-spatial attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Downar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Dugué et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Proskovec et al., 2018</xref>), and for the integration of multisensory stimuli into a coherent percept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beauchamp, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bushara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Calvert and Thesen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Driver and Noesselt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zhang et al., 2011a</xref>). Increases in right parieto-occipital theta power (4–8 Hz) have also been shown when attending to visual stimuli in the presence of auditory distractors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">van Driel et al., 2014</xref>), with the phase of right parieto-occipital alpha (8–10 Hz) or theta (6–7 Hz) oscillations determining the perceptual outcome of bistable stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ronconi et al., 2017</xref>). As such, the present modulation for 8 Hz parieto-occipital ITPC is consistent with the idea that right-parietal networks may preferentially represent temporal information in the visual modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Guggisberg et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Reporting binocular rivalry switches involves both a change in perception, and a decision to press the button. Accordingly, the attentional sampling in binocular rivalry we report here may reflect the fluctuation of perception or of decision criterion. Recent studies of behavioral oscillations that have employed signal detection theory have reported that sensitivity and response criterion both exhibit oscillations (at distinct frequencies) in the high theta/low alpha band, for both vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and audition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ho et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, whether our oscillations reflect perceptual or decision-level effects must be clarified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Iemi and Busch, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Iemi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Limbach and Corballis, 2016</xref>). Our paradigm cannot resolve this as it is, although a future investigation using our paradigm combined with signal detection theory could do so.</p><p>Our analysis has so far revealed that when crossmodal cues mismatched with the dominant binocular rivalry stimulus, that rates of attentional sampling slowed to ~3.5 Hz – implicating the division of attention over multiple locations. However, our exogenous cues oriented attention toward the congruency of visual and crossmodal stimuli, prompting the question: between what was attentional sampling divided? One possibility is that attentional sampling during mismatched cues was divided between two sensory modalities, as the brain tried to resolve a conflict between concurrent auditory/tactile and visual information. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> provides a schematic of this multisensory interpretation. If the neural activity in our identified region is representative of divided sampling between modalities, it constitutes the first evidence that an attentional sampling mechanism can flexibly orient between temporally co-modulating crossmodal stimuli. Although the facilitative role of attention in multisensory integration remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hartcher-O’Brien et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Talsma et al., 2010</xref>), we see it as a viable possibility that this mechanism resolved perceptual ambiguity through a visual perceptual switch to the competing image, rendering the multisensory stimuli congruent.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40868.022</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Two possible interpretations of attentional sampling during mismatched crossmodal cues. Schematic representation of attentional sampling and perceptual oscillations during binocular rivalry.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Crossmodal sampling hypothesis: While perceiving the high-frequency visual flicker, an attended low-frequency crossmodal cue mobilises attention to sample between the dominant image and mismatched crossmodal cue at ~3.5 Hz.

Such a limit on crossmodal interactions may explain why we observed low- but not high-frequency behavioral effects in the present task, and is supported by previous investigations regarding the binding of multisensory stimulus attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Fujisaki and Nishida, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Fujisaki and Nishida, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lunghi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Vroomen and Keetels, 2010</xref>), and the limits of crossmodal temporal judgments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Fujisaki and Nishida, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Fujisaki and Nishida, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Holcombe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Vroomen and Keetels, 2010</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Fujisaki and Nishida, 2005</xref> have shown that judgments of temporal synchrony between rhythmic sensory streams degrade above ~4 Hz. It is plausible that the ineffective crossmodal cueing that we found is related to the above-mentioned findings, reflecting a limit on crossmodal integration processes, rather than attention.</p><p>Having said that, one previous study using a similar design to ours was successful in eliciting a high-frequency crossmodal effect (15–20 Hz; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lunghi et al., 2014</xref>), and notably, in the absence of explicit attentional demands. However, these differences are not wholly unexpected, as to optimize the present task for EEG recordings we used larger (6.5° visual angle) luminance-modulated sinusoidal gratings to facilitate subsequent steady-state visually evoked potential analyses. While in comparison, Lunghi et al. succeeded in showing a high-frequency effect with rivalry stimuli that were contrast-modulated narrow-band random noise patterns (3.2° visual angle), and did so under conditions analogous to our non-attend conditions. This difference in the composition of visual stimuli is noteworthy, as stimulus size is known to strongly affect rivalry dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blake et al., 1992</xref>). To our knowledge, whether stimulus size impacts upon crossmodal effects during binocular rivalry is unknown. However, given the strength of our results for attended low-frequency flicker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), we note that the low- and high-frequency effects observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lunghi et al., 2014</xref> are not generalizable to the larger and attended-rivalry stimuli employed here. Similarly, whether the type of stimuli (e.g., gratings vs random noise patterns) also impacts upon crossmodal effects during rivalry represents a fruitful endeavor for research, particularly given the novel possibility of distinguishing between crossmodal and attentional limits on attentional sampling.</p><p>An alternate possibility to crossmodal attentional sampling is that the 3.5 Hz rhythm in our paradigm reflects divided attentional sampling between dominant and suppressed visual images during binocular rivalry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). The frequency of divided attentional sampling that we observed is consistent with those obtained when visual attention has been divided between two objects or locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fiebelkorn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Landau and Fries, 2012</xref>). As our binocular rivalry stimuli necessarily occupied the same spatial location, attention in our paradigm was likely divided between either features or objects, instead of locations. Indeed, feature-based attention has already been shown to modulate neural processes when an attended target is suppressed during continuous flash suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kanai et al., 2006</xref>). During binocular rivalry, perceptual dominance is also influenced by object-based attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mitchell et al., 2004</xref>), with unconscious selection mechanisms argued to mediate perceptual transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lin and He, 2009</xref>). This second alternative is also indirectly supported by the temporal limits of binocular rivalry when conflicting visual stimuli are presented asynchronously, without temporal overlap between the two eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">O'Shea and Blake, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">van Boxtel et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">van Boxtel et al., 2007</xref>). The maximum stimulus onset asynchrony that can sustain this type of rivalry is approximately 350 <italic>± </italic>50 ms, beyond which alternating stimuli introduced to one eye are perceived immediately, without rivalry occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">van Boxtel et al., 2008a</xref>). This limit is consistent with a 7–8 Hz attentional sampling rhythm distributed between the two conflicting stimuli (each sampled at ~3–4 Hz). When stimuli are presented rapidly enough they are temporally bound together and can engage in ongoing rivalry; when stimuli are presented slower than at 3–4 Hz, they are temporally individuated by attention, and rivalry ceases. A recent computational model that explicitly modeled time-varying attention could indeed reproduce this finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Li et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that attention is the process that temporally binds the successive stimulus presentations together. Based on our findings, we propose the persistence of percepts may also be modeled using an oscillatory, and feature-selective attentional mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Li et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The suggestion that attention can sample between conscious and nonconscious vision is also consistent with a view that the underlying neuronal processes for attention and consciousness are supported by distinct neural mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahrami et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Watanabe et al., 2011</xref>); for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Koch and Tsuchiya, 2007</xref>). We note that while attentional sampling of a suppressed image suggests that attention is not sufficient for consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dehaene et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Koch and Tsuchiya, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lamme, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">van Boxtel et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">van Boxtel et al., 2010b</xref>), this interpretation remains consistent with a view that attention may still be necessary for conscious perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chica and Bartolomeo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cohen and Dennett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Merikle and Joordens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">O'Regan and Noë, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Posner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Posner, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Whether attributable to conscious-nonconscious, or visual-crossmodal attentional sampling, the present results also complement the ‘active-sensing’ hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schroeder et al., 2010</xref>), whereby perceptual selection is determined by routine exploratory behaviors. According to the active-sensing hypothesis, attention is critical to search for task-relevant information from the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schroeder et al., 2010</xref>), particularly via the rhythmic coordination of multisensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schroeder et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thorne and Debener, 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, early contributions from multi-sensory (non-visual) information have been shown to modulate perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Morillon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schroeder et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">van Atteveldt et al., 2014</xref>). The rhythmic modulation of visual performance has also been demonstrated to follow the onset of both voluntary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hogendoorn, 2016</xref>), and preparatory motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tomassini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tomassini et al., 2015</xref>). Here, in further support of the active-sensing hypothesis, we have shown that task-relevant crossmodal information can change the rhythmic modulations of perceptual selection during competition for perceptual dominance.</p><p>In summary, here we have provided novel evidence in support of attentional sampling during binocular rivalry through the use of crossmodal cues matched to either a conscious or nonconscious visual stimulus. As the attention sampling hypothesis continues to garner traction from various psychophysical and neuronal paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fiebelkorn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Helfrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">VanRullen, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">VanRullen, 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">VanRullen, 2018</xref>), future targeted experimentation can confirm whether attention can indeed sample across modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), as well as if attention can sample between conscious and nonconscious neural representations during binocular rivalry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).

Each visual stimulus was viewed through a mirror stereoscope placed at an approximate viewing distance of 55 cm from computer screen (29 × 51 cm, 1080 × 1920 pixels, 60 Hz refresh rate) with the subject’s head stabilized via chin rest. Rivalry stimuli were red and green gratings displayed on a black background, with a white frame to aid binocular fusion, embedded within the wider gray background of the remaining portions of the screen. Beside each white framed image, colored arrows indicated the direction for button-press (e.g., right for red, left for green). Gratings were sinusoidal with spatial frequency of 0.62 cycles per degree, oriented ±45<bold>°</bold> from vertical, and subtended 6.5<bold>°</bold> visual angle (240 × 240 pixels on the display). Visual stimuli were sinusoidally contrast-modulated at either 4.5 or 20 Hz using a temporal sinusoidal envelope. The phase of each grating was static throughout each 3 min binocular rivalry block, yet shifted after each block to reduce the effects of visual adaptation. The stimulus size was chosen after piloting the largest images that could support minimal incidences of piecemeal rivalry. The very low spatial frequency of 0.6 cycles per degree and the rapid temporal modulations both favor neurons with large receptive fields and thus reduce the incidence of piecemeal rivalry. In addition, by rivaling red and green stimuli, each image had a consistent color which helps group rivalry alternations and maintain perceptual coherence rather than piecemeal switching. We explained to participants that piecemeal percepts may occur and in such cases they should indicate the stimulus that was most predominant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>For crossmodal stimuli 50 Hz carrier tones were amplitude modulated by 4.5 or 20 Hz sine waves to create digital waveforms, which were either 2, 3.1 or 4 s in duration.

Photodiodes were used to record the flicker-envelope of visual stimuli and stored as separate channels in the ongoing EEG. The waveforms for crossmodal stimulation were simultaneously sent to both the presentation hardware and external electrode channels using a digital splitter (Redback A2630 4 Channel Headphone Distribution Amplifier). Stimulus presentation lag was assessed by computing the difference between the recorded frames of trigger-codes and actual physical trace within the EEG as part of data pre-processing.

In each block, 12 trials of crossmodal cues were presented. Each cue was either low (4.5 Hz) or high (20 Hz) frequency auditory and/or tactile stimulation. Six cues were presented for each frequency, with durations composed of three x 2 s, two x 3.1 s, and one x 4 s cues. To increase uncertainty for the timing of the cues, we inserted three null cues (which we call visual-only periods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) without any crossmodal stimulation for a duration of 2.6 s (the average duration of crossmodal cues). We also used these visual-only periods as a baseline for behavioral analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). We randomized the order of all cues, which were separated with uniform jittering by 7–10 s ISI within each block.</p><p>Across all sessions, subjects were told to focus on accurately reporting their dominant visual percept at all times via button-press. As the state of the button-press was sampled at 60 Hz, the same rate as the video refresh rate, we were able to estimate the probability and time-course of binocular rivalry dynamics over 16.7 ms intervals.</p><p>Over two sessions on separate days, subjects distributed attention between visual rivalry and crossmodal cues based on separate task instructions. On day 1 for <italic>n</italic> = 18 or day 2 for <italic>n</italic> = 16, subjects were instructed to ignore the crossmodal cues and to focus on reporting only visual rivalry. For the other session, subjects were instructed to distribute attention across both visual rivalry and crossmodal cues. To ensure their attention was on task, these alternate days included task instructions for subjects to silently tally the number of times the temporal frequency of an attended crossmodal cue matched that of their dominant visual percept at the time of crossmodal cue’s offset. Due to the varied duration of crossmodal cues, this task ensured that attention was allocated consistently throughout the presentation of crossmodal cues. To familiarize subjects with these task demands, an additional two practice blocks (3 minutes each) were included during the calibration procedure on the relevant day of experimentation. Although 34 subjects were retained for final analysis, five others were recruited and began the experiment, yet failed to complete their second day of experimentation. One other subject was removed due to their failure in following task instructions and excessive movement during EEG recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Evaluation of attention-on-task</title><p>To evaluate the attentional allocation to both visual and crossmodal stimuli, at the end of each 3 min block we asked subjects to verbally report their subjective estimate of the number of crossmodal stimuli which were matched in temporal frequency to the flicker of their dominant visual percept at the point of attended crossmodal cue offset. Then, we defined an index, ‘attention to cues’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,x</xref>-axis) as the correlation coefficient between 24 subjective estimates (one per attended block) and the actual recorded occurrences of congruent stimuli. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> displays the correlation between subjective and actual congruent stimuli for an exemplary subject.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Behavioral data analysis</title><p>We preprocessed the button-press data to accurately estimate the timing of changes in visual consciousness during binocular rivalry. First, we categorised each time-point according to the flicker frequency of the dominant visual stimulus reported. To analyze the time-course of the probability of a button-press state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), we categorized button-presses (which could correspond to either low- or high-frequency) as either congruent or incongruent with the ongoing crossmodal stimulus frequency. Then, we obtained the probability of a congruent button-press state as a function of time per subject, by averaging responses at each time point across all 144 trials per attention x frequency cue subtype.</p><p>For visual-only periods, the left button (corresponding to left-eye dominance) was arbitrarily set to congruent prior to the averaging of probability traces within subjects. As visual parameters were balanced across all blocks, this selection necessarily balanced across visual frequency and color parameters, and we note that the identical analysis performed using right-eye congruence produced equivalent results. Mismatched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) or matched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) condition comparisons were then defined by whether the congruent button (left-eye dominant) was pressed at cue onset.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>, we set the y-axis for ‘Probability of seeing mismatched flicker’, to reflect the probability of perceptual states that differ in temporal frequency from the crossmodal cue. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,c and d</xref>, we compared among six conditions with one-way repeated-measures ANOVAs: 1, visual-only on attend days; 2, visual-only on non-attend days; 3, attended low-frequency; 4, attended high-frequency; 5, unattended low-frequency; and 6, unattended high-frequency. We defined significant differences among conditions at those time points that survived corrections for multiple comparisons with planned comparisons between cue types and the visual-only baseline, using FDR at q = 0.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Perceptual switch index (PSI)</title><p>To quantify crossmodal effects during binocular rivalry, we defined the perceptual switch index (PSI). PSI is the difference in the probability of a change in percept when comparing attended low-frequency to four other crossmodal cues. For the y-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, we calculated the PSI as the difference in the probability of viewing a congruent visual flicker over the period 1–4 s after stimulus onset. The same subtraction was used to compare the probability of viewing the previously suppressed visual flicker following mismatched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5c</xref>) and matched cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5d</xref>), for the period 2–4 s after onset. This shorter time window was selected to capture when the crossmodal effects on binocular rivalry emerged for mismatched and matched cues. A similar pattern to the results displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> was shown when a wider window was used (e.g. 0–4 s, data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Spectral analysis of first switches</title><p>For our spectral analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we focused on the first perceptual switches, which were the first time-point recording a change in button-press state after cue onset. To account for individual variation in the amount of overall switches, the proportion of switches at each time point was first calculated at the subject level, before averaging across all subjects. We sampled button-presses at 60 Hz (or every 16.7 ms). For the spectral analysis of perceptual switches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>), we applied a single-taper fast Fourier transform (FFT) to the period 0.5–2 s after cue onset (Nyquist = 30 Hz, a half bandwidth = 0.67 Hz). This window was selected to restrict the analysis so that all the analyzed trials occurred during an attended cueing period (as the minimum crossmodal cue duration was 2 s), and to remove transient button presses occurring early in the cue period, which were unlikely to be caused by crossmodal match or mismatch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We display the frequency range of 0–15 Hz for all conditions, as no higher frequencies (above 9 Hz) were significant after our two-stage statistical criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics on spectra of first switch timing</title><p>To assess the statistical significance of behavioral spectra we used a two-stage statistical testing procedure as applied in previous investigations of attentional sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Landau and Fries, 2012</xref>) and electrophysiological research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>). At the first stage, we first detected significant frequencies (at <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.005 uncorrected) through a non-parametric randomization procedure. In this procedure, after obtaining the spectral amplitude for the observed data across subjects, we generated a null distribution of first switches during the same cue period by randomly shifting switch-times within each subject, while keeping the number of perceptual switches the same. We generated 5000 surrogate datasets in this way, to test the null hypothesis that there were no temporal effects on the timing of perceptual switches. We then compared the amplitude of the Fourier transform from the observed and the surrogate data at each frequency. We regarded the spectral amplitude at a certain frequency to be significantly above chance, if the observed spectral amplitude exceeded the top 99.5% of the null-distribution of amplitudes at each frequency generated by surrogate data.</p><p>At the second stage, we applied a cluster criterion, which corrects for multiple comparisons across multiple frequencies through a permutation procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>). We required that the first-level significance (p&lt;0.005 uncorrected) be sustained for at least two neighboring frequencies, and retained the sum of their clustered test-statistics (amplitudes in this case) as our observed data. Then, from our surrogate dataset, we calculated the maximum cluster-based amplitudes per surrogate (maximum spectral amplitude excluding 0–1 Hz and nearest neighbor), which we retained as the null-distribution to compare against our observed data. Candidate clusters survived this second order analysis when their observed cluster-based test-statistics exceeded the top 95% of the null distribution, or corrected to <italic>p<sub>cluster</sub></italic> &lt;0.05 if testing across multiple clusters.

Ground and reference electrodes were AFz and FCz at recording, respectively. After re-referencing the data to the average of all channels, we performed linear detrending and bandpass filtering (0.1–60 Hz with a Hamming-windowed finite impulse response filter) and down-sampled the data to 250 Hz before time-frequency analysis.</p><p>We performed all time-frequency analyses using the Chronux toolbox ((<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chronux.org"><underline>http://chronux.org</underline></ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bokil et al., 2010</xref>); RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005547">SCR_005547</ext-link>), and custom MATLAB scripts.

ITPC is an amplitude-normalized measure of the degree to which EEG responses are phase-locked to the onset of an exogenous cue, ranging between 0 (random phase over trials) and 1 (perfect phase consistency over trials).

Because the bias level (or expected chance level for pure noise data) of ITPC is strongly influenced by the number of trials, we took additional measures to equate the number of mismatched and matched cue types for the analysis. To achieve this aim, the minimum number of trials recorded for a given cue combination was identified across subjects. Following this, subjects with greater numbers of trials had their observed number of trials supplemented by downsampling with replacement from their recorded trials, equating them to the predefined minimum for each condition. Upon this resampled dataset, the ITPC was computed, and this process repeated 100 times. As the difference in ITPC between auditory, tactile, and combined auditory and tactile cues was not significant, we proceeded by combining crossmodal cue types within each subject.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>ITPC statistics</title><p>To investigate the neural correlates of attentional sampling, we analysed evoked ITPC, the increase in ITPC during 0 to 2 s after onset compared to −2 to 0 s before onset. Similar to our statistical approach for the behavioral spectral analysis described above, we used a two-stage statistical testing procedure for this analysis. At the first stage, we performed a <italic>t</italic>-test (two-tailed) comparing whether evoked 3.5 and 8 Hz ITPC differed between mismatched and matched conditions across subjects at each electrode. At each electrode, we used the mean evoked ITPC value obtained from the downsampling method described above. As a result of the <italic>t</italic>-tests, if we found a cluster of at least two neighboring electrodes with the same <italic>t</italic>-score polarity at <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05 (uncorrected), where inter-electrode distance did not exceed 3.5 cm, we proceeded using this cluster in the second stage of statistics. As a result of this cluster criterion, we always identified a minimum size of 2-electrode clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5a</xref>).</p><p>At the second stage, we first computed the absolute value of the sum of observed <italic>t</italic>-scores within the identified cluster, which we retained as our observed test-statistic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). To create the null distribution, condition labels (mismatch and match) were randomly shuffled for each electrode within each subject, to create two surrogate datasets the same size as our original mismatch and match conditions. Then the <italic>t</italic>-scores were computed for each electrode based on our surrogate datasets, and the electrode with the maximum <italic>t</italic>-score and the maximum <italic>t</italic>-score of its neighbors retained. The sum of these <italic>t</italic>-scores were then retained per shuffle, and this procedure repeated 2000 times to obtain a null distribution of the sum of <italic>t</italic>-scores around the maximum electrode for each shuffle of our surrogate data. Against this distribution, the sum of observed <italic>t</italic>-scores for the candidate cluster was then compared. When the observed sum of <italic>t</italic>-scores was within the top 5% (or cluster corrected to <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05) then we concluded that there was a significant difference between mismatch and match conditions.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Daniel H Baker (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an innovative, interesting and timely study that reveals periodic switching dynamics during binocular rivalry, following cross-modal cues, and explores the rate of attentional sampling during dominance and suppression. Data from perceptual responses show that with relevant cross-modal cues attentional modulations are periodic. When the cue is congruent with the current visual percept, switches display an 8Hz periodicity; when the cue is incongruent, switches occur in about half of 8Hz, with a 3.5Hz frequency. This pattern of results fits well with the idea of attentional sampling, whereby attention samples a single target at around 8Hz, but for two competing targets the effective sampling rate is divided, i.e. about 4Hz. The presence of EEG correlates of these rhythmic dynamics at the same frequencies tends to support the authors' claims.</p><p>Addressing the following points will provide information regarding the validity of the claims and strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Theoretical issues</p><p>1) You should discuss the Dieter, Melnick and Tadin, 2015 study, which shows that stimulus-driven cues can bias perceptual report. Exogenous feature-based cues were presented close to the rivalry stimuli; the cue congruent with the (currently) dominant percept lengthened its duration whereas the cue congruent with the suppressed percept hastened it to emerge back. The authors should stress the novelty of their study regarding the oscillatory nature of such process.</p><p>2) The authors should discuss whether they think that the oscillatory behavioral responses they found reflect an oscillation of perception or decision criteria, even though these two aspects cannot be distinguished in the perceptual report used in this study. Germane to this discussion is a recent study that using signal detection theory found that alpha oscillation modulates criterion, not sensitivity (Lemi et al., 2017).</p><p>3) The reported effects only occur for the 4.5-Hz modulated stimulus, and not for the 20Hz modulation. Does this imply an upper temporal limit for crossmodal interactions or for attention?</p><p>4) The authors should relate their findings to computational models of binocular rivalry. Many use mutual inhibition, adaptation and noise to describe the neural circuit underlying rivalry (e.g. Wilson, 1997; Laing and Chow, 2002). Some have explicitly implemented an attentional component (e.g. Li et al., 2017). None of the rivalry models have attempted to model oscillatory perceptual rhythms. Could the current results inform which model component(s) (e.g. input drive, mutual inhibition or attention) may be oscillatory?</p><p>5) The authors suggest that the 7-8 Hz oscillation reflects a single attentional focus, and the ~4Hz oscillation reflects attention that was split into two foci. Does that imply that without a mismatched cue, observers' attention would be predominantly allocated to the dominant image without oscillating between the two stimuli? Were that the case, how would this relate to the theory on rivalry. Are the authors suggesting that a mismatch cue allowed attention to start jumping across two items? And that such a process would not happen without a mismatched cue?</p><p>Methods, Analyses and Results</p><p>6) It is not clear that there are 3 types of cross-modal cues (auditory, tactile, and both combined) until the Materials and methods section; i.e., well after reading the Results and considering the figures. The existence of 3 cue types should be mentioned explicitly earlier. In addition, this begs the question of possible differences among the cue types: Do they affect the dynamics of switching and the results described in all figures?</p><p>7) It would be good to report the frequency tagged responses to the rivaling stimuli themselves. Are there increases in the response when a frequency-matched cross-modal cue is presented? Do the amplitudes correspond to participant button presses consistent with Brown and Norcia, 1997?</p><p>8) For computing Fourier amplitude spectrum, the authors analyzed the time window from 0.5 to 2s from the cue onset. However, Figure 3C and 3D also show oscillatory patterns in the first 0.5s time window. Include this time, narrow the window, or explain why this range was not analyzed. Note that previous studies have removed a shorter time window after the cue (e.g. Landau and Fries, 2012; Fiebelkorn et al., 2013).</p><p>9) It is unclear whether the authors performed FFT on the averaged (across subjects) time course, or on individual time courses, and then averaged the spectrum across subjects. If the former, the latter should also be reported. It is important to ensure that the effect does not merely result from the averaging procedure.</p><p>10) A technical issue regards the EEG ITPC calculation and the logic of upsampling. We agree that it is necessary to equate the number of mismatched and matched cue types for the analysis. However, the strategy of upsampling the lowest-trial-count condition up to the trial number in the highest-trial-count condition is questionable. We are not convinced that the authors' analysis confirmed that upsampling, compared to downsampling, reduced the bias introduced when equating ITPC values across subjects. Running the Matlab code below, the authors will see that the ITPC bias caused by a difference in trial count (first figure) is not reduced when upsampling the low-trial-count condition (second figure), but disappears when downsampling the high-trial-count condition (third figure). You should repeat the analysis with downsampling, ideally multiple times to avoid spurious results.</p><p>1.%% Matlab code</p><p>2. phases = 2*pi*rand(30,1000);% low trial count condition</p><p>3. otherphases = 2*pi*rand(90,1000);% high trial count condition</p><p>4. downsampled_otherphases = otherphases(1:30,:);% downsample high trial count</p><p>5. upsampled_phases = repmat(phases,3,1);% upsample low trial count</p><p>6.

We assume these plots are thresholded, such that electrodes with non-significant t-values are set to t=0, but this wasn't stated explicitly. Why not plot all t-values and indicate which are significant in some other way (e.g. with superimposed symbols).</p><p>13) The 9Hz difference in Figure 5B is somewhat unexpected. This is described as a 'stimulus harmonic', but if so, we wouldn't expect to see a difference between matched and mismatched trials. Do the authors have an explanation for this? Does the 9Hz response also correlate with the PSI measure?</p><p>14) The model diagrams in Figure 6 are somewhat confusing. For model (a), do the authors mean that the suppressed image emerges back because attention shifts to the mismatched cue first, and thus the mismatched cue enhances the suppressed image? For model (b), it seems surprising that the presence of the green-crossmodal cue would let the attention focus move from the dominant red image to the suppressed red image, before it moves to the dominant green image…</p><p>15) For correlation scatterplots, it would be helpful to include R and p values in the plot. Are the straight lines in these plots regression lines that predict the y-values using the x-values (i.e. minimizing the error in the y-direction)? Given that both of these are dependent variables with presumably no implied causation, we recommend using Deming regression lines instead, which minimize the absolute error between the line and each data point.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Attention periodically samples competing stimuli during binocular rivalry&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Frank (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The three reviewers and I think that you have addressed all the issues raised satisfactorily, but one. The pending issues regards the ITPC calculations and down-sampling vs. up-sampling.</p><p>We note that there is a crucial difference in the definition of ITPC &quot;bias&quot;: You are talking about minimizing absolute bias (the fact that ITPC is always overestimated when using a finite number of trials, to an extent inversely related to the trial number, e.g. compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4D and 4E</xref>). Instead, the reviewers are worried about relative bias (the fact that two experimental conditions with equal &quot;true&quot; ITPC may produce very different ITPC values if the number of trials is not equated, e.g. compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A and 4D</xref>).</p><p>Your upsampling method keeps the absolute bias as low as possible in each condition (given the trial number), but does not reduce relative bias (e.g. compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4C and 4D</xref>). Only downsampling can remove this relative bias (e.g. compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A and 4E</xref>). This comes with the cost of an increase in absolute bias for the high N condition (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4D and 4E</xref>), but given that your analysis relies on a comparison of the two conditions, the relative bias must be eradicated; absolute bias changes are just collateral damage.</p><p>To summarize:</p><p>1) The reviewer made the null assumption that the 2 experimental conditions (matched/mismatched) have the same true ITPC but different numbers of trials.

But, this is not the point here. The aim of resampling is to let the ITPCs from the two conditions comparable when performing statistical tests. When comparing ITPC from two conditions with unequal trial numbers, upsampling can produce false positives, downsampling will not. Thus, the authors should use downsampling instead of upsampling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40868.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Theoretical issues</p><p>1) You should discuss the Dieter, Melnick and Tadin, 2015 study, which shows that stimulus-driven cues can bias perceptual report. Exogenous feature-based cues were presented close to the rivalry stimuli; the cue congruent with the (currently) dominant percept lengthened its duration whereas the cue congruent with the suppressed percept hastened it to emerge back. The authors should stress the novelty of their study regarding the oscillatory nature of such process.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have now cited Dieter et al., 2015, in our Discussion. We have also positioned our findings in support of cue-based effects on rivalry, stressing the novel oscillatory nature of this process (Discussion, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should discuss whether they think that the oscillatory behavioral responses they found reflect an oscillation of perception or decision criteria, even though these two aspects cannot be distinguished in the perceptual report used in this study. Germane to this discussion is a recent study that using signal detection theory found that alpha oscillation modulates criterion, not sensitivity (Lemi et al., 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers point out our study is unable to tell whether the oscillations in switch rates we have observed reflect changes in perceptual sensitivity or decision criteria. While the results of Iemi et al. support oscillations in decision criteria rather than sensitivity per se (Iemi et al., 2017), others show oscillations in both criterion and sensitivity (Ho et al., 2017; Zhang, Morrone, Alais, Sci Rep, In press) and perception rather than decision criteria (Iemi and Busch, 2018). We have included a short treatment of this distinction in our Discussion (ninth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reported effects only occur for the 4.5-Hz modulated stimulus, and not for the 20Hz modulation. Does this imply an upper temporal limit for crossmodal interactions or for attention?</p></disp-quote><p>We view it as possible that this difference reflects a temporal limit for crossmodal interactions or for attention. We have clarified our consideration of both alternatives in our Discussion (eleventh paragraph). Although high-frequency effects have been reported in other previous, similar designs (without attention), it is unclear whether our new crossmodal stimulus parameters, or the inclusion of an attentional instruction are responsible for the upper temporal limit we have observed. We believe that distinguishing between these alternatives will be a fruitful line of endeavour in future experimentation, and mention this in our Discussion also.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should relate their findings to computational models of binocular rivalry. Many use mutual inhibition, adaptation and noise to describe the neural circuit underlying rivalry (e.g. Wilson, 1997; Laing and Chow, 2002). Some have explicitly implemented an attentional component (e.g. Li et al., 2017). None of the rivalry models have attempted to model oscillatory perceptual rhythms. Could the current results inform which model component(s) (e.g. input drive, mutual inhibition or attention) may be oscillatory?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion, and have now incorporated a treatment of BR models in our Discussion (third paragraph). We suggest that the attention component of a rivalry model, such as the one that is modelled by Li et al., 2017, can be oscillatory. We have linked our previous discussion of van Boxtel et al., 2008; to an oscillatory model of BR more explicitly (Discussion, twelfth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors suggest that the 7-8 Hz oscillation reflects a single attentional focus, and the ~4Hz oscillation reflects attention that was split into two foci. Does that imply that without a mismatched cue, observers' attention would be predominantly allocated to the dominant image without oscillating between the two stimuli? Were that the case, how would this relate to the theory on rivalry. Are the authors suggesting that a mismatch cue allowed attention to start jumping across two items? And that such a process would not happen without a mismatched cue?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the opportunity to address this clarification, and would like to clarify two points: 1) We do not believe that switches in rivalry are caused only by an attentional sampling mechanism, and 2) nor that attentional switches are completely determined by an 8 / 3.5 Hz rhythm.</p><p>As to 1), there are many different types of attention (Koch and Tsuchiya, 2007), and in the context of rivalry, it is unclear the extent to which attention (or type thereof), may mediate perceptual outcome. If anything, both endogenous and exogenous effects of attention are rather limited (Alais and Blake, 2005; Maier, Panagiotaropoulos, Tsuchiya, and Keliris, 2012; Dieter et al., 2015).</p><p>As to 2), we view our results to be consistent with previous investigations of attentional sampling. Specifically, that attentional sampling rhythms modulate, but do not completely determine perceptual outcome. We have now clarified this nuance in our Discussion (sixth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods, Analyses and Results</p><p>6) It is not clear that there are 3 types of cross-modal cues (auditory, tactile, and both combined) until the Materials and methods section; i.e., well after reading the Results and considering the figures. The existence of 3 cue types should be mentioned explicitly earlier. In addition, this begs the question of possible differences among the cue types: Do they affect the dynamics of switching and the results described in all figures?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We now point out specifically that there were three crossmodal cue types more clearly (subsection “Attending to low-frequency crossmodal stimulation promotes the perceptual dominance of low-frequency flicker during binocular rivalry”, first paragraph).</p><p>We found no difference in the crossmodal cue effects based on cue type. That is to say, whether attending to low-frequency auditory, tactile, or combined auditory and tactile cues, the results were the same. We observed an increased probability of perceiving the congruent, low-frequency flicker. A new figure shows these individual time-series, separated by crossmodal modality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). No significant difference between cue types emerged when comparing these time-series (repeated measures ANOVA at each time point, with FDR correction for multiple comparisons).</p><p>As the cue differences were not statistically significant, we continued by pooling them for our subsequent behavioural analyses. This had the advantage of increasing the number of trials available per mismatch x match condition, and improved our statistical power. Without pooling across cue types, the number of the trials per cue type are only ~33% of the total number of trials, and not enough to obtain significant results with our spectral analysis for first perceptual switches.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40868.025</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The effect of crossmodal cue modality on behavioural switch dynamics.</title><p>Crossmodal cue modalities are shown for auditory cues in magenta, tactile cues in black and auditory plus tactile in blue.

We here provide an example of the change in 4.5 Hz frequency-tagged SSVEP strength with button press. The amplitudes correspond with perceptual contents, increasing when perceiving a low-frequency flicker, and decreasing when perceiving the high-frequency flicker. We also provide for the reviewer an example of increased 4.5 Hz SNR, during these perceptual switches, when accompanied by a steady-state crossmodal stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40868.026</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Changes in frequency-tagged power (in the unit of signal to noise ratio, log SNR) around the time of button presses for perceptual switches.</title><p>(a) In visual-only conditions, around the time of button presses, the time course of the power of EEG at the occipital areas (electrode P08) at 4.5 Hz tracks perceptual alternations, consistent with previous investigations using frequency-tagged binocular rivalry.

This is because the number of switches per each of 8 conditions (match vs. mismatch x low- vs. high- frequency x attended vs. unattended) is very small per subject, and the attentional effects themselves vary across subjects – as shown in manuscript Figure 2B. Furthermore, some FFT spectra from subjects with very few perceptual switches are extremely noisy, and disrupts any effects that could be observed at the group level if averaging individual spectra.</p><p>We have now stated that this effect is clearest in the across-subject time-course, and that this analysis was chosen to match with previous investigations of attentional sampling, which also analyzed the time-course of data at the across-subject level (e.g., Landau and Fries, 2012; Fiebelkorn et al., 2013).

We agree that it is necessary to equate the number of mismatched and matched cue types for the analysis. However, the strategy of upsampling the lowest-trial-count condition up to the trial number in the highest-trial-count condition is questionable. We are not convinced that the authors' analysis confirmed that upsampling, compared to downsampling, reduced the bias introduced when equating ITPC values across subjects. Running the Matlab code below, the authors will see that the ITPC bias caused by a difference in trial count (first figure) is not reduced when upsampling the low-trial-count condition (second figure), but disappears when downsampling the high-trial-count condition (third figure).

While the reviewers interpretation of their code appears to contradict with our original claim, in fact, it is consistent with what we have claimed: downsampling enhances the bias while upsampling does not. The discordance in interpretation comes from the way the reviewer contrasts the results (ITPC vs. otherITPC, upsampled ITPC vs. otherITPC, and ITPC vs. downsampled ITPC). As we explain in the following, we claim that the appropriate comparison is between ITPC vs upsampled ITPC and other ITPC vs. downsampled ITPC. The details in response to the reviewers’ code are as follows:</p><p>Explanation of the code:</p><p>Lines 2-5 prepare the data, in which the true ITPC is assumed as 0. We interpret <italic>phases</italic> to represent 30 trials sampled from 1000 channels (or subjects). Then, line 10-11 plots the expected “bias” distribution over 1000 channels where the true ITPC is 0 and sampled over 30 trials in each channel. (Reproduced as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A</xref>)</p><p>Now line 13-14 plots what the reviewers call <italic>upsampled_phases.</italic> But line 5 creates it by duplicating the same random distribution 3 times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4B</xref>, which is identical to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A</xref> by definition). This is different from what we did, which is upsampling with replacement. Our procedure would replace line 5 as follows:</p><p>for iChannel = 1:1000</p><p>upsampled_phasesv2 = phases(randi(30,1, 90), iChannell);</p><p>end</p><p>With this correction, upsampling minimally affects the distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4C</xref>) from the original distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A</xref>). This was exactly our point. Upsampling does not introduce further bias into the ITPC estimated from all available 30 trials. From the originally sampled 30 trials, we cannot (and should not be able to) reduce the bias no matter how much upsampling we do.</p><p>Next, line 12 plots the expected ITPC distribution of <italic>otherphases</italic> defined in line 3, where now each channel is sampled with 90 trials. This proves the point that ITPC bias (when the true ITPC is 0) reduces as we increase the number of sample trials. (Reproduced as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4D</xref>)</p><p>Line 4 downsamples 30 trials out of the 90 available trials in <italic>otherphases.</italic> Line 18 plots this downsampled distribution of the ITPC, which proves our point that downsampling introduces further bias (comparing 4D to 4E). This is the reason why we have not used downsampling.</p><p>The above code by the reviewer establishes that when the true ITPC is assumed to be 0, 1) we should sample more trials to reduce the bias in ITPC, 2) upsampling with replacement does not introduce much bias, and 3) downsampling introduces significant bias.</p><p>Given that our data consists of N=34 subjects, whose minimal number of trials is 12 and maximal is 36, and that the mean ITPC across subjects should be computed with an equal number of trials, we opted for upsampling to the maximum number of trials across subjects.</p><p>The revised code is reproduced here for convenience:</p><p>1.% % Matlab code</p><p>2, phases = 2*pi*rand(30,1000);% low trial count condition</p><p>3, otherphases = 2*pi*rand(90,1000);% high trial count condition</p><p>4, downsampled_otherphases = otherphases(1:30,:);% downsample high trial count</p><p>5. upsampled_phases = repmat(phases,3,1);% upsample low trial count</p><p>6. upsampled_phasesv2 =zeros(size(upsampled_phases));</p><p>7, for iChannel = 1:1000</p><p>8. upsampled_phasesv2(:,iChannel) = phases(randi(30,1, 90), iChannel);</p><p>9. end</p><p>10.

For model (a), do the authors mean that the suppressed image emerges back because attention shifts to the mismatched cue first, and thus the mismatched cue enhances the suppressed image? For model (b), it seems surprising that the presence of the green-crossmodal cue would let the attention focus move from the dominant red image to the suppressed red image, before it moves to the dominant green image.</p></disp-quote><p>We included this figure to offer a schematic to emphasise the different foci of attention in our suggested interpretations, and not to provide a detailed model of how we think it works. We have clarified our intention in our revised figure legend, emphasizing that this scheme does not imply any detailed mechanisms of how attentional sampling during binocular rivalry should work. Our take-home message was to compare a) sampling between visual and crossmodal cues and b) sampling between dominant and suppressed visual stimuli. We could remove this figure if the editor and reviewers recommend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) For correlation scatterplots, it would be helpful to include R and p values in the plot. Are the straight lines in these plots regression lines that predict the y-values using the x-values (i.e. minimizing the error in the y-direction)? Given that both of these are dependent variables with presumably no implied causation, we recommend using Deming regression lines instead, which minimize the absolute error between the line and each data point.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included r and p values in these plots.</p><p>The reviewer is correct, the straight lines are least-squares regression lines, predicting the change in PSI based on nITPC, while minimizing error in the y-direction (change in PSI). We do however have an implied causation (predicting the y-values from the x-values), as we are correlating the nITPC strength 0:2 s after stimulus onset to the change in PSI 2:4 s after cue onset.</p><p>As an alternative, we present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig8">Author response image 8</xref>) the original correlations, with three-regression lines, as per Huang et al.

The pending issues regards the ITPC calculations and down-sampling vs. up-sampling.</p><p>We note that there is a crucial difference in the definition of ITPC &quot;bias&quot;: You are talking about minimizing absolute bias (the fact that ITPC is always overestimated when using a finite number of trials, to an extent inversely related to the trial number, e.g. compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4D and 4E</xref>). Instead, the reviewers are worried about relative bias (the fact that two experimental conditions with equal &quot;true&quot; ITPC may produce very different ITPC values if the number of trials is not equated, e.g. compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A and 4D</xref>).</p><p>Your upsampling method keeps the absolute bias as low as possible in each condition (given the trial number), but does not reduce relative bias (e.g. compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4C and 4D</xref>). Only downsampling can remove this relative bias (e.g. compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A and 4E</xref>). This comes with the cost of an increase in absolute bias for the high N condition (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4D and 4E</xref>), but given that your analysis relies on a comparison of the two conditions, the relative bias must be eradicated; absolute bias changes are just collateral damage.</p><p>To summarize:</p><p>1) The reviewer made the null assumption that the 2 experimental conditions (matched/mismatched) have the same true ITPC but different numbers of trials. (Here the true ITPC was assumed to be zero, which is the worst-case scenario: no actual phase-locking).</p><p>2) When comparing ITPC across the two conditions, a systematic difference was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A</xref> vs. 4D). This difference is necessarily a statistical artifact.</p><p>3) The reviewer applied the authors' upsampling method to equate trials; the systematic difference remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4B</xref>/4C vs. 4D).</p><p>4) The reviewer applied a downsampling method to equate trials; the (artifactual) difference disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A</xref> vs. 4E).</p><p>5) Conclusion:</p><p>The authors are correct that upsampling can preserve the ITPC to have a similar value as that derived from the original dataset (without resampling). But, this is not the point here. The aim of resampling is to let the ITPCs from the two conditions comparable when performing statistical tests. When comparing ITPC from two conditions with unequal trial numbers, upsampling can produce false positives, downsampling will not. Thus, the authors should use downsampling instead of upsampling.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased to hear that our ITPC resampling procedure is the only remaining issue.</p><p>After reviewing your explanation, we are in agreement that reducing the relative bias in ITPC values is preferable in this case.</p><p>We have revised our analysis and proceeded by downsampling. Our overall conclusions have not changed, and we have adjusted the statistical values and figures accordingly.</p><p>These changes are in the revised manuscript, and include new data for Figures 4 and 5.</p><p>All associated source data and figure supplements have also been updated.</p><p>We have now addressed all of the reviewers’ concerns and hope our paper is now suitable for publication in <italic>eLife.</italic></p></body></sub-article></article>
