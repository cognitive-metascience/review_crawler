We find that DNA damage also generates nuclear actin filaments—detectable by phalloidin and live-cell actin probes—with three characteristic morphologies: (i) long, nucleoplasmic filaments; (ii) short, nucleolus-associated filaments; and (iii) dense, nucleoplasmic clusters. This DNA damage-induced nuclear actin assembly requires two biologically and physically linked nucleation factors: Formin-2 and Spire-1/Spire-2. Formin-2 accumulates in the nucleus after DNA damage, and depletion of either Formin-2 or actin's nuclear import factor, importin-9, increases the number of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), linking nuclear actin filaments to efficient DSB clearance. Nuclear actin filaments are also required for nuclear oxidation induced by acute genotoxic stress. Our results reveal a previously unknown role for nuclear actin filaments in DNA repair and identify the molecular mechanisms creating these nuclear filaments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07735.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07735.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07735.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In animals, plants, and other eukaryotic organisms, a cell's DNA is contained within a structure called the nucleus, which separates it from the rest of the interior of the cell. Filaments of a protein called actin are normally found outside the nucleus, where they help give the cell its overall shape and organize its contents. However, these filaments can sometimes form inside the nucleus in response to a sudden increase in heat or another type of stress. However, it was not clear what role these actin filaments play in the nucleus because it was difficult to distinguish them from the actin filaments that form in other parts of the cell.</p><p>Researchers have recently developed new techniques to study actin filaments inside the nuclei of live cells under a microscope, using fluorescent protein tags. Here, Belin et al.—including some of the researchers involved in the previous work—used this technique to investigate whether DNA damage causes actin filaments to form in the nuclei of human cells.</p><p>The experiments show that DNA damage does indeed lead to the formation of actin filaments in the nucleus. In a structure within the nucleus called the nucleolus, the actin filaments are short. However, in the rest of the nucleus, the actin forms long filaments and dense clusters. Cells that contained lower levels of actin were less able to repair their DNA than normal cells.</p><p>Belin et al. also identified three proteins—called Formin-2, Spire-1, and Spire-2—that assemble the actin filaments in the nucleus. These proteins are also required to make actin filaments in other parts of the cell. The experiments show that the level of Formin-2 increases in the nucleus after DNA damage, and that the DNA of cells lacking this protein is more severely damaged. Belin et al.'s findings reveal a new role for actin in the repair of DNA and the next challenge is to understand the details of how this works.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07735.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07735.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>nuclear actin</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>nuclear oxidation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Belin</surname><given-names>Brittany J</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Terri</given-names></name><name><surname>Mullins</surname><given-names>R Dyche</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM061010, GM079556, 5F31AG39147-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Belin</surname><given-names>Brittany J</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Terri</given-names></name><name><surname>Mullins</surname><given-names>R Dyche</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Belin</surname><given-names>Brittany J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An efficient response to DNA damage requires the assembly of actin filaments in the nucleus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Actin was first identified in muscle over seventy years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Straub, 1942</xref>) and has been established as a component of non-muscle cells for nearly half a century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hatano and Oosawa, 1966</xref>). Subsequent work revealed how actin filaments help organize the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells, supporting many fundamental biological processes, including: motility, division, phagocytosis, endocytosis, and membrane trafficking. The first reports of actin inside the nucleus of a cell appeared forty years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LeStourgeon et al., 1975</xref>), and since that time, actin has been found in the nuclei of many different cell types, linked to a variety of nuclear processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pederson and Aebi, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Recent work has identified the molecular mechanisms that control the nuclear concentration of actin, uncovering new roles for the actin-binding proteins profilin and cofilin as co-factors for actin's nucleocytoplasmic transport. The nuclear export factor exportin-6 (XPO6) binds profilin-actin complexes in the nucleus—as well as a handful of other actin-binding proteins—and shuttles them into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stüven et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohnsack et al., 2006</xref>). Conversely, nuclear import of actin is regulated by importin-9 (IPO9), which transports cofilin–actin complexes from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dopie et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In many organisms, the export factor XPO6 is not expressed in the oocytes of, and so the germinal vesicles contain a high concentration of actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stüven et al., 2003</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, this germinal vesicle actin forms a filamentous mesh that protects nucleoli from gravity-induced aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feric and Brangwynne, 2013</xref>). Actin filaments associated with germinal vesicles of starfish oocytes facilitate nuclear envelope breakdown and form a contractile net that facilitates chromosome capture during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lénárt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mori et al., 2014</xref>). Several studies have also implicated nuclear actin filaments in oocyte transcription (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belin and Mullins, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, most somatic cells express some amount of XPO6, and therefore, have a much lower concentration of actin in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. Also, unlike <italic>Xenopus</italic> germinal vesicles, mammalian somatic nuclei contain relatively small amounts of filamentous actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belin et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that monomeric actin may play an important role. Monomers of actin and several actin-related proteins (Arps), for example, are conserved components of chromatin-remodeling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farrants, 2008</xref>), and nuclear actin monomers inhibit the activity of the serum-responsive transcriptional co-activator MRTF (myotonin-related transcription factor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vartiainen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mouilleron et al., 2008</xref>). Many reports have also linked actin to the regulation of RNA polymerases, although there are conflicting data on whether this activity depends on monomers or filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belin and Mullins, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Functions for filamentous actin in somatic cell nuclei are slowly beginning to emerge. Serum stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baarlink et al., 2013</xref>) and integrin engagement in spreading cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Plessner et al., 2015</xref>) induce transient (&lt;60 s) bursts of nuclear actin polymerization, driven by the nucleation activity of formin-family proteins mDia1 and mDia2. These short-lived filaments appear to promote activity of the transcriptional co-activator MRTF by depleting monomeric actin from the nucleus. Serum stimulation also activates the actin-severing protein MICAL-2, which reversibly oxidizes actin monomers, rendering them incapable of inhibiting MRTF-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lundquist et al., 2014</xref>). Environmental stresses also promote actin assembly in somatic cell nuclei. Heat shock, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), depletion of ATP, and oxidative stress all induce formation of nuclear filament bundles that contain large amounts of cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukui, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukui and Katsumaru, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iida et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pendleton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to its function as a co-factor for nuclear import, cofilin appears to play a structural role in these cofilin–actin rods, which are highly oxidized and appear to be held together by intermolecular disulfide bonds between cofilin molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pfannstiel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Little is known about the physiological role of these cofilin–actin rods but they sense and perhaps regulate the reducing potential of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Munsie et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Many functions proposed for nuclear actin have been controversial, due in part to a lack of molecular tools for visualizing and perturbing actin inside the nucleus without affecting cytoplasmic actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belin et al., 2013</xref>). The discovery of actin's nuclear import and export factors, along with the recent identification of some of the molecular mechanisms that create nuclear actin filaments, now enable us to make more specific perturbations of actin inside the nucleus. In addition, we and others have developed fluorescent probes that enable us to visualize actin monomers and filaments in the nuclei of live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baarlink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Plessner et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Using these recently developed tools, we discovered that DNA damage induced by various genotoxic agents triggers formation of actin filaments inside the nucleus of mammalian cells. These filaments promote efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and are required for a DNA damage-associated burst of oxidation in the nucleus. DNA damage-induced nuclear actin structures differ in both composition and mechanism of assembly from those triggered by serum stimulation or by non-specific cell stresses. Specifically, we find that the actin regulators Formin-2 (FMN2) and Spire-1/2 nucleate nuclear actin assembly in response to DNA damage. Homologs of Formin-2 and Spire-1/2 interact directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Quinlan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vizcarra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montaville et al., 2014</xref>) and collaborate to form functional actin networks in mouse and <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes. Murine oocyte FMN2 and Spire are required for migration of meiotic spindles to the cortex, extrusion of polar bodies, and radial transport of vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schuh and Ellenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schuh, 2011</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, homologs of FMN2 (Cappuccino) and Spire collaborate to build actin networks required for oocyte polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Quinlan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bor et al., 2015</xref>). We suggest that DNA damage-induced nuclear actin filaments may facilitate movement of chromatin and repair factors after DNA damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DNA damage induces formation of nuclear actin filaments</title><p>Previously, we developed and validated a fluorescent probe, Utr230-EGFP-3×NLS (Utr230-EN), capable of imaging actin filaments inside nuclei of live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belin et al., 2013</xref>). In mammalian tissue culture cells, the distribution of Utr230-EN exhibits one of three basic patterns: (i) accumulation on cytoplasmic stress fibers and diffuse localization throughout the nucleoplasm (∼53% of cells); (ii) cytoplasmic stress fibers and punctate structures in the nucleoplasm (∼40% of cells); and (iii) primarily cytoplasmic localization to stress fibers and/or aggregates at the nuclear periphery (∼7% of cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To test this idea, we damaged HeLa cell DNA using a variety of genotoxic agents: incubation with 0.01% methyl methanesulfonate (MMS); incubation with 50 pg/ml neocarzinostatin (NCS); or exposure to 50 J/m-s ultraviolet radiation. These various treatments all triggered assembly of actin filaments in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We compared nuclear actin filaments generated by telomere uncapping with those induced by genotoxic agents by counting the fraction of cells that contain nuclear filaments longer than 1 µm as well as the mean length of these long nuclear filaments in cells treated with either MT-hTer-47A for 5–7 days or 0.01% MMS for 2 hr. The fraction of cells with long filaments; the mean filament length; and the standard deviation of filament length were similar after the two treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–G</xref>). Further analysis of nuclear filaments induced by MMS revealed the formation of three distinct classes of nuclear actin structure: (i) elongated nucleoplasmic filaments (&gt;1 µm); (ii) amorphous, nucleoplasmic clusters; and (iii) nucleolus-associated filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The third class of structures includes both peri- and intra-nucleolar filaments, as judged by co-localization with the nucleolus marker, fibrillarin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p><p>To verify that DNA damage-induced nuclear actin filaments are endogenous structures, and not artifacts produced by expression of the Utr230-EN probe, we visualized them using other probes for filamentous actin. In HeLa cells not expressing Utr230-EN, fluorescent derivatives of phalloidin faintly but reproducibly detected all three classes of DNA damage-induced nuclear filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Detecting fluorescent phalloidin in the nucleus following DNA damage, however, presented technical challenges. High concentrations of fluorescent phalloidin bound to actin filaments in the cytoplasm swamp the much smaller signal from the nucleus. For example, the faint phalloidin fluorescence coming from the nucleus was difficult to detect by confocal microscopy, in part due to the relatively low light throughput of the pinholes. Wide-field deconvolution microscopy provided much more signal and enabled us to more easily observe the faint signal from phalloidin-bound filaments in the nucleus.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07735.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of nuclear-targeted actin reporters for detection of DNA damage-induced nuclear actin filaments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Faint detection of elongated nuclear actin filaments in the nucleoplasm and peri- and intra-nucleolar regions after 0.01% MMS treatment by phalloidin in untransfected cells.

Using these probes, however, we detected filaments in a smaller fraction of 0.01% MMS-treated cells than in our Utr230-EN cell line. This is likely due to the fact that the higher fluorescence baseline of Lifeact-EN and F-tractin-EN in the nucleus obscures filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and this is consistent with a parallel study in which we observed much higher levels of diffuse fluorescence from Lifeact- and F-tractin-based probes in the cytoplasm compared to Utr230 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belin et al., 2015</xref>). To test this interpretation, we calculated the percentage of cells with phalloidin-stainable nuclear filaments in untransfected cells and cell lines expressing Utr230-, Lifeact-, or F-tractin-EN. In all cases, ∼5% of untreated cells contain phalloidin-stainable nuclear actin, whereas after induction of DNA damage by 0.01% or 0.05% MMS incubation, the percent of cells with phalloidin-stainable nuclear actin increases to ∼15% and ∼20%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, the low frequency of cells with nuclear filaments detected by Lifeact- and F-tractin-EN does not correlate with fewer cells containing phalloidin-stainable nuclear actin. These results indicate that the DNA damage-induced nuclear filaments recognized by Utr230-EN are endogenous structures and that expression of nucleus-targeted actin probes does not significantly perturb nuclear actin assembly.</p><p>When we limited our analysis to cells that contain large (&gt;1 µm) nuclear actin structures, we observed—by all of our labeling methods—that the average number of actin structures per nucleus also increases significantly after DNA damage. We noticed, however, that the distribution filaments per nucleus is skewed toward both higher filament counts and longer filament lengths in cells expressing Lifeact-EN or Utr230-EN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). In the Lifeact-EN cell line, high filament density in the nucleus correlates with higher Lifeact-EN expression levels, suggesting that Lifeact stabilizes filaments or enhances polymerization rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The number of filaments per nucleus, however, does not correlate with Utr230-EN expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), suggesting that this probe does not promote filament formation in the same way as Lifeact. It is possible that Utr230-EN expression enhances the DNA damage response or that the effect of this probe on nuclear filament stability saturates at very low concentrations, below those required for live-cell imaging. Given the poor contrast of the F-tractin-EN and Lifeact-EN probes and the concentration-dependent stabilizing effects of Lifeact-EN, we regard Utr230-EN as the best available tool for imaging nuclear actin filaments generated by DNA damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Nuclear actin polymerization is required for efficient clearance of double-strand DNA breaks</title><p>Many DNA repair proteins have been identified by their effects on the kinetics of DSB detection and clearance. To determine whether nuclear actin plays a role in DNA repair, we compared the number of DSBs induced by MMS in cells with different concentrations of nuclear actin.

For these experiments, we employed siRNAs previously validated in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohnsack et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dopie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belin et al., 2013</xref>). Knocking down expression of XPO6 increased the fraction of cells with detectable nuclear actin structures as well as the average number of nuclear structures in each cell. This increase occurred in both untreated cells and cells treated with MMS. Conversely, cells from which IPO9 had been depleted lacked detectable nuclear actin structures, regardless of whether they were treated with MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Loss of XPO6 had no effect on the number of DSB foci generated by MMS treatment. Loss of IPO9, however, significantly increased the number of DSBs per cell, judged using antibodies against 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>) or pH2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also observed an increase in the number of DSB foci when we depleted nuclear actin by knocking down its nuclear import co-factor, cofilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>To verify that IPO9 knockdown affects the number of DSB foci by decreasing the concentration of actin in the nucleus rather than by some other, off-target effect, we attempted to rescue the phenotype by expressing actin targeted to the nucleus by an IPO9-independent mechanism. In these experiments, we expressed either: an mCherry-3×NLS control construct; wild-type actin fused to mCherry-3×NLS; or a non-polymerizing R62D actin mutant fused to mCherry-3×NLS. Overexpressing wild-type actin-mCherry-NLS—but not the R62D mutant actin construct—decreased the number of DSB foci but did not completely rescue the loss of IPO9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We figured that the partial rescue could be due to the fact that fluorescent actin fusions cannot be incorporated into some actin filaments, particularly those generated by formin-family nucleation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). We, therefore, modified our rescue constructs by inserting a 2A-peptide site to produce bicistronic expression of both a 3×NLS-tagged actin and an mCherry expression reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huss and Lansford, 2014</xref>). Overexpression of this non-fluorescent, wild-type actin-NLS, but not the R62D mutant, resulted in a complete rescue of DSB foci counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results indicate that nuclear actin polymerization is required for efficient DSB clearance and suggested that nuclear actin filaments may be generated by a formin-family actin nucleator.</p><p>Finally, we asked whether the number of nuclear actin filaments correlates with the severity of DNA damage by comparing nuclear filaments and 53BP1 foci in the same cells. Surprisingly, we found no correlation between the numbers of nuclear actin filaments and DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and we observed only limited overlap between the 53BP1 and nuclear actin signals for all classes of DNA damage-induced filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). More detailed analysis of our co-localization data revealed that, out of 198 filaments found in nuclei of cells treated with 0.01% MMS for 2 hr, only 22 (11.1%) overlap or lie adjacent to 53BP1 foci. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that some fraction of the observed overlap represents a functional interaction. One way to address this possibility would be to simultaneously track DSBs and nuclear actin filaments in live cells, but this would require a more reliable live-cell DSB marker. Given that expression of our fluorescent protein-tagged 53BP1 derivative is correlated with higher foci counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which may include numerous spuriously detected loci, we found this tool to be unsuitable for quantitative live-cell imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>DNA damage-induced filaments do not contain cofilin and are not affected by knockdown of mDia1 or mDia2</title><p>We hypothesized that the DNA damage-induced nuclear actin structures we observe might be created by the same mechanisms that produce cofilin–actin rods in response to cell stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukui, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iida et al., 1992</xref>) or nuclear actin filaments in response to serum stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baarlink et al., 2013</xref>).

To assess whether oxidative signaling is involved in regulation of nuclear actin filaments induced by MMS, we generated a construct containing the redox-sensing fluorophore roGFP2 fused with 3×NLS (roGFP2-NLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lohman and Remington, 2008</xref>). roGFP2 is variant of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) engineered to introduce 2 cysteines to the interior of the GFP beta barrel, and it has been extensively used to measure oxidation changes in live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merksamer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Mehdi et al., 2012</xref>)<italic>.</italic> The roGFP2 excitation spectrum contains 2 peaks, at 488 nm and at 405 nm. In the oxidized form of roGFP2, excitation at 405 nm is increased and excitation at 488 nm is decreased, relative to the reduced form. Thus, the ratio of emission intensities following excitation of roGFP2 at these wavelengths under different conditions can be used to measure the relative oxidation state.</p><p>We used roGFP2-NLS to measure nuclear oxidation levels and found that treatment with 0.01% MMS generates an oxidative burst in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).

We measured the distribution of classes of nuclear actin filaments at MMS doses ranging from 0.01% to 0.05%, and found that increased MMS levels correlate with increases in the fraction of cells containing clustered bodies of nuclear filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>).

For example, many chromatin-remodeling complexes contain monomeric actin or Arps as subunits, but the contribution these subunits make to chromatin remodeling remains poorly understood. In addition, cellular stresses such as ATP and nutrient deprivation, heat shock, and various chemical toxins induce the assembly of cytoplasmic actin bundles as well as cofilin–actin rods in the nucleus. Although they are thought to sense reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 2012</xref>), the precise function of nuclear cofilin–actin rods remains unclear. One of the most convincing functions proposed for nuclear actin is regulation of the actin-binding transcription factor MRTF. In this example, serum stimulation of quiescent cells induces assembly of actin filaments in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baarlink et al., 2013</xref>). Assembly of filaments in the cytoplasm drives MRTF into the nucleus, while the assembly of filaments inside the nucleus depletes monomeric actin from this compartment and relieves its inhibitory effect on MRTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vartiainen et al., 2007</xref>). This mechanism relies on the nucleation activity of Diaphanous-family formins, mDia1 and mDia2, and highlights the existence of a stable pool of polymerizable actin monomers inside the nucleus.</p><p>We have uncovered another, previously unknown signaling pathway that generates actin filaments inside the nucleus, one that relies on the Cappuccino-family formin, FMN2, and two Spire-family actin regulators, Spire-1 and Spire-2. In response to DNA damage, these nucleation factors create a variety of actin structures in the nucleus, including long nucleoplasmic filaments, nucleolus-associated filaments, and amorphous clusters. These may represent functionally distinct species or possibly different time points in the evolution of a single structure. Regardless, as judged by the number of 53BP1 foci, nuclear actin assembly promotes clearance of double-strand DNA breaks. In contrast to the role of nuclear actin in MRTF function, however, filament formation appears to be more important than monomer depletion in the response to DNA damage. A functional role specific to filaments is supported by the fact that removing <italic>all</italic> actin (monomer and polymer) from the nucleus has the same effect on MMS-induced 53BP1 foci as simply inhibiting filament formation by depleting the nucleation factor, FMN2. If monomer depletion were the primary function of DNA damage-induced filaments, then IPO9 knockdown would not have the same effect on DNA repair as filament inhibition.</p><p>Little work has been done on human FMN2, but mouse and <italic>Drosophila</italic> FMN2 homologs are relatively well studied. The nucleation activity of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> FMN2 homolog, Cappuccino, is regulated by intramolecular contacts between a C-terminal region near the actin-nucleating domain and an N-terminal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bor et al., 2012</xref>). This autoinhibitory interaction is structurally distinct from the DID/DAD interaction that regulates activity of the Diaphanous-family formins. We have identified two nuclear-localization sites in the N-terminus of human FMN2, which also contains two previously discovered DNA damage-induced phosphorylation sites. If human FMN2 is also autoinhibited by an interaction between N- and C-terminal regions, it is possible that DNA damage-induced phosphorylation promotes both nuclear translocation and actin nucleation.</p><p>Nuclear actin filaments could potentiate the DNA damage response by several mechanisms: (1) altering mobility or organization of chromatin; (2) recruiting or delivering repair factors to sites of damage; or (3) binding and sequestering nuclear factors that would otherwise inhibit DNA repair. The third possibility is consistent with the minimal co-localization we observe between nuclear actin filaments and 53BP1 foci. Recent studies, however, have also demonstrated that DNA damage alters the mobility of DNA loci, perhaps facilitating their interaction with DNA repair proteins that are expressed at extremely low concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dimitrova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miné-Hattab and Rothstein, 2013</xref>). One attractive possibility is that myosin motors in the nucleus may drive clustering of repair components or DSB sites to facilitate homologous recombination. This would be analogous to the role of FMN2/Spire-generated actin filaments in generating contractile structures that link cargo vesicles in mouse oocytes.</p><p>The DNA damage-induced recruitment of actin filaments to nucleoli is somewhat mysterious. We initially hypothesized that the nucleolar filaments may regulate some DNA damage-specific change in nucleolar morphology, analogous to the role of actin filaments in germinal vesicles of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Although we observed a 20% decrease in average nucleolar area after MMS treatment, depleting nuclear actin by knocking down IPO9 had no measurable effect on this phenomenon. Given that nucleoli are the sites of rRNA transcription, we speculate that nuclear actin filaments may play a role in rRNA production or export, perhaps promoting stress-induced changes in translation. Clarifying the potential nucleolar functions of actin will require the identification of more nucleolus-associated actin-binding proteins.</p><p>In addition to filamentous structures, DNA damage also induces formation of amorphous actin clusters in the nucleus. The number and size of these clusters increases with increasing doses of genotoxic agents, suggesting that they may be related to pre-apoptotic signaling. Consistent with this idea, we found that blocking nuclear filament assembly inhibits nuclear oxidation induced by high concentrations of MMS. Several prior studies suggested that actin acts as a sensor of cellular oxidation levels. For example, in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, cellular oxidation triggers formation of amorphous ‘actin bodies’ generated by intermolecular disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farah and Amberg, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2011</xref>). Similar sensing of nuclear oxidation has also been proposed for nuclear cofilin–actin rods, which contain disulfide-linked cofilin oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 2012</xref>). While more work will be required to determine whether DNA damage-induced nuclear filament clusters are also oxidation sensors, we demonstrate clearly that actin can alter the nuclear redox state. Given that all previously observed cases of nuclear actin assembly are connected to oxidation, we suggest that nuclear actin may be an important mediator of redox signaling.</p><p>Together with other recent studies, our work reveals that multiple cellular signals can trigger assembly of a variety of actin structures in the nucleus, each with a unique morphology, function, and regulatory mechanism. One common theme, however, appears to be a link between the state of actin in the nucleus and the state of actin in the cytoplasm. For example, both serum stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vartiainen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baarlink et al., 2013</xref>) and DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zuchero et al., 2012</xref>; and unpublished observations) induce a dramatic increase in cytoplasmic actin polymerization. In both cases, this cytoplasmic actin polymerization correlates with nuclear accumulation of formin-family actin nucleators. We, therefore, speculate that changes in the actin monomer/polymer ratio in the cytoplasm may facilitate nuclear accumulation of actin regulators, coordinating the cytoplasmic and nuclear responses to stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>We used pEGFP-C1 or pmCherry-C1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, United States) as the host vector for all EGFP fusions, with N-terminal EGFP fusions inserted into the unique AgeI and NheI sites.

We agree with the reviewers’ sense that the amount of data available for the comparison of all the various genotoxic stresses does not support use of such a strong word as “indistinguishable.”</p><p>We did, however, perform an additional experiment to confirm that telomere uncapping (5 and 7 days after treatment with RNAi agent) produces an identical nuclear actin response to DNA damage by 0.01% MMS (for two hours). We analyzed data from HeLa cells +/- telomere capping and +/- 0.01% MMS and quantified: (i) the % of cells with &gt;1 micron filaments, (ii) the distribution of the total number of &gt;1 micron filaments/nucleus, and (iii) the distribution of &gt;1 micron filament lengths for all of these conditions.</p><p>This new analysis is shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-G</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The data presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>are not particularly convincing. If possible, the authors should provide better quality images or alternatively perform more sophisticated data analysis including e.g. quantification of the average lengths of the nuclear filaments/bundles visualized by phalloidin alone or by the other probes</italic>.</p><p>This figure is not central to our argument and our major conclusions regarding the role of FMN-2/Spire-induced actin assembly and its role in the DNA damage do not rely on these results. We decided, however, to include the data in the manuscript for the sake of completeness. We have also analyzed the lengths of nuclear filaments in 0.01% MMS treated cells when visualized by NLS-Lifeact, phalloidin, and NLS-Utr230. This new analysis is shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>.</p><p>We take some exception to this comment, given that this type of experiment is not normally performed in the field. The difficulties in visualizing nuclear actin filaments with phalloidin are well known and part of the motivation for developing more sophisticated nuclear actin probes. We include these data as evidence that, even though it is extremely challenging, we can still observe DNA damage-induced nuclear actin by phalloidin.</p><p><italic>3) The authors should also more precisely discuss why only 15-20 % of the cells have detectable nuclear actin filaments following MSS treatment</italic>.</p><p>To address this point we performed additional analysis on the correlation between the number and morphology of nuclear actin filaments and the number of 53BP1 foci (a proxy for double-strand breaks). This analysis reveals no detectable correlation between DSB counts and number of nuclear actin filaments induced by 0.01% MMS. In the revised manuscript we now speculate on the reasons for this lack of correlation.</p><p>The new analysis is shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) The possible role of FMN2-assemled nuclear actin filaments in regulation of nuclear oxidation following DNA damage should be tested to better link the data presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref> <italic>to the study.

Briefly, we imaged and quantified the roGFP-NLS signal with and without 0.05% MMS treatment in cells that expressed either a control shRNA or an shRNA targeting FMN2.</p><p>Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that loss of FMN-2 ablates the nuclear oxidation in response to MMS treatment. We were unable to perform the rescue experiment because our rescue constructs are all fused to mCherry, whose fluorescence emission overlaps that of the rosGFP.</p><p>These new data and analysis are shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
