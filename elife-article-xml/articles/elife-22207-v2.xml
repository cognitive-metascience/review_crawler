including migration and cytoplasmic p27 can act as an oncogene. Furthermore, cytoplasmic p27 promotes invasion and metastasis, in part by promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Herein, we find that p27 promotes cell invasion by binding to and regulating the activity of Cortactin, a critical regulator of invadopodia formation. p27 localizes to invadopodia and limits their number and activity. p27 promotes the interaction of Cortactin with PAK1. In turn, PAK1 promotes invadopodia turnover by phosphorylating Cortactin, and expression of Cortactin mutants for PAK-targeted sites abolishes p27’s effect on invadopodia dynamics. Thus, in absence of p27, cells exhibit increased invadopodia stability due to impaired PAK1-Cortactin interaction, but their invasive capacity is reduced compared to wild-type cells. Overall, we find that p27 directly promotes cell invasion by facilitating invadopodia turnover via the Rac1/PAK1/Cortactin pathway.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22207.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22207.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22207.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When animals develop from embryos to adults, or try to heal wounds later in life, their cells have to move. Moving means that the cells must invade into their surroundings, a dense network of proteins called the extracellular matrix. The cell first attaches to the extracellular matrix; degrades it; and then moves into the newly opened space. Cells have developed specialized structures called invadosomes to enable all these steps. Invadosomes are never static, they first assemble where cells interact with extracellular matrix, they then release proteins that loosen the matrix, and finally disassemble again to allow cells to move. Invadosomes in cancer cells often become overactive, and can allow the tumor cells to spread throughout the body.</p><p>A lot of different proteins are involved in controlling how and when cells move. p27 is a well-known protein usually found in a cell’s nucleus along with the cell’s DNA. Inside the nucleus, p27 suppresses tumor growth by stopping cells from dividing. However, often in cancer cells p27 moves outside of the cell’s nucleus where it contributes to cell movement via an unknown mechanism.</p><p>To answer how p27 controls cell invasion, Jeannot et al. used a biochemical technique to uncover which proteins p27 binds to when it is outside of the nucleus. One of its interaction partners was called Cortactin. This protein is known to be an important building block of invadosomes, and is involved in both the assembly and disassembly of these structures. In further experiments, Jeannot studied mouse cells with or without p27 and human cancer cells that can be grown in the laboratory. The experiments revealed that p27 promotes an enzyme called PAK1 to also bind to Cortactin. PAK1 then modified Cortactin, causing whole invadosomes to disassemble, which in turn allowed cells to de-attach from the matrix and move forward. In contrast, cells lacking p27 had more stable invadosomes, attached more strongly to the matrix and were better at degrading it, but could not invade as well as cells with p27.</p><p>Overall these experiments showed a new way that p27 promotes cell invasion. The next steps will include finding out exactly how the modification of Cortactin causes the invadosomes to disassemble. Furthermore, it will be important to study whether forcing p27 back into the nucleus can reduce the spread of cancer cells in the body.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22207.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22207.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>p27/Kip1</kwd><kwd>invadopodia</kwd><kwd>cortactin</kwd><kwd>PAK</kwd><kwd>invasion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perchey</surname><given-names>Renaud T</given-names></name><name><surname>Manenti</surname><given-names>Stéphane</given-names></name><name><surname>Besson</surname><given-names>Arnaud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002717</institution-id><institution>Ministère de l'Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jeannot</surname><given-names>Pauline</given-names></name><name><surname>Nowosad</surname><given-names>Ada</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bennana</surname><given-names>Evangeline</given-names></name><name><surname>Mayeux</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name><name><surname>Guillonneau</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name><name><surname>Manenti</surname><given-names>Stéphane</given-names></name><name><surname>Besson</surname><given-names>Arnaud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manenti</surname><given-names>Stéphane</given-names></name><name><surname>Besson</surname><given-names>Arnaud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canceropole Ile de France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guillonneau</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name><name><surname>Mayeux</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>p27Kip1 directly controls invadopodia turnover by promoting the interaction of PAK1 with Cortactin, which induces Cortactin phosphorylation, invadopodia disassembly and facilitates invasion through extracellular matrix.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>p27<sup>Kip1</sup> is a cell cycle inhibitor that binds to a broad range of cyclin-CDK complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Besson et al., 2008</xref>). p27-mediated cyclin-CDK inhibition involves the N-terminal extremity (aa 28–89) of the protein that allows interaction with both cyclin and CDK subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Besson et al., 2008</xref>). The critical role of p27 as a negative regulator of cell proliferation is underscored by the phenotype of p27 knockout mice, which exhibit a hyperproliferative phenotype in multiple tissues and are more susceptible to tumor development than wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fero et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kiyokawa et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nakayama et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Besson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fero et al., 1998</xref>). While the tumor suppressive role of p27 is confirmed by the frequent loss of p27 expression in many types of cancers, p27 is also mislocalized in a fraction of tumors due to activation of various signaling pathways that cause its nuclear export and/or cytoplasmic retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu et al., 2008</xref>). Cytoplasmic p27 has been associated with decreased patient survival, high tumor grade and metastasis in several tumor types including breast carcinomas, acute myeloid leukemia, glioblastoma, melanoma and non-small cell lung carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Min et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>). The possibility that cytoplasmic p27 may confer a pro-tumorigenic advantage was confirmed in a mouse model expressing a mutant form of p27 that cannot bind cyclin-CDK complexes (p27CK-) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Serres et al., 2011</xref>). These mice are more susceptible than p27-null and wild-type mice to both spontaneous and induced tumor development, thus uncovering an oncogenic role for p27 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Serres et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besson et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>It now appears that p27 is a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of multiple cellular processes, some of which are regulated by p27 in a CDK-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Besson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sharma and Pledger, 2016</xref>). Indeed, p27 has been implicated in the control of cell migration, transcriptional repression, autophagy, stem cell specification and differentiation, cytokinesis, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Besson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sharma and Pledger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldassarre et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besson et al., 2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pippa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Serres et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nickeleit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nguyen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeannot et al., 2015</xref>). This functional versatility may stem from the intrinsically disordered structure of p27, which folds upon binding to other proteins, allowing p27 to interact with a wide variety of partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lacy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galea et al., 2008</xref>). While these various functions participate in homeostasis in normal cells and tissues, they may be co-opted by tumor cells to promote oncogenesis.</p><p>Metastasis, the process whereby cells from a primary tumor disseminate throughout the body and form secondary tumors at distant sites, is the leading cause of cancer related death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sethi and Kang, 2011</xref>). It requires tumor cells to migrate and invade through neighboring tissues, enter the blood flow and then extravasate to disseminate and form new tumors in host tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sethi and Kang, 2011</xref>). Regulation of cell motility was the first CDK-independent role ascribed to p27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nagahara et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Denicourt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besson et al., 2004b</xref>). In the cytosol, p27 can interact with RhoA, preventing RhoA activation by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and thereby modulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besson et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2004b</xref>). Consequently, mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking p27 have more RhoA activity, increased numbers of stress fibers and focal adhesions and exhibit a defect in migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besson et al., 2004b</xref>). This pathway is important for proper migration of bone marrow macrophages and developing cortical neurons and for cancer cell migration and invasion in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Godin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nguyen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Papakonstanti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">See et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Larrea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jin et al., 2013</xref>). p27 can also regulate cell migration by controlling microtubule stability through Stathmin or directly by binding to microtubules and promoting microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldassarre et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Godin et al., 2012</xref>). In a 3D environment, cells adopt different strategies to migrate and invade through surrounding matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Petrie and Yamada, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sethi and Kang, 2011</xref>). The mode of migration is influenced, at least in part, by the activities of Rho GTPases: RhoA activity favors an amoeboid migration, whereas Rac1 activity promotes mesenchymal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sahai and Marshall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vial et al., 2003</xref>). Accordingly, cytoplasmic p27 promotes mesenchymal migration via the inhibition of RhoA activity, while cells lacking p27 tend to adopt an amoeboid mode of migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belletti et al., 2010</xref>). More recently, p27 was reported to promote epithelial to mesenchymal transition by binding to JAK2, promoting STAT3 activation and the upregulation of Twist1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe a novel mechanism by which p27 directly regulates invadopodia formation and cell invasion through extracellular matrix (ECM) via Cortactin. Invadosomes (designating both invadopodia and podosomes) are thought to allow cells to coordinate ECM degradation with migration within the tissue microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murphy and Courtneidge, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Linder et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Martino et al., 2016</xref>). Cortactin plays a key role in the formation of actin protrusive structures such as lamellipodia and invadosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murphy and Courtneidge, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kirkbride et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacGrath and Koleske, 2012</xref>). Cortactin has been involved in all steps of the invadosome lifecycle, from assembly, maturation, proteolytic activity and disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacGrath and Koleske, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murphy and Courtneidge, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moshfegh et al., 2014</xref>). All these steps appear to be regulated by phosphorylation events on Cortactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moshfegh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murphy and Courtneidge, 2011</xref>). Overall, Cortactin is a scaffold protein composed of an N-terminal acidic domain, followed by several actin-binding repeats allowing its interaction with F-actin, a Pro-rich region and a SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacGrath and Koleske, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kirkbride et al., 2011</xref>). Phosphorylation of Cortactin by Src and Abl family tyrosine kinases has two effects: first, this releases the actin severing protein Cofilin from an inhibitory interaction with Cortactin and generates actin barbed ends; second, Arp2/3, N-WASP and Nck1 are recruited onto Cortactin, promoting the polymerization of branched actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Weaver et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oser et al., 2010</xref>). Dephosphorylation of Cortactin then allows the inhibition of Cofilin activity and stabilizes the invadopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oser et al., 2009</xref>). Cortactin also plays a key role in matrix metalloproteinase secretion in mature invadopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clark et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, invadopodia disassembly is induced by sequential activation of the Rac-GEF Trio, Rac1 and p21-Activated Kinase-1 (PAK1) pathway and presumably by PAK1-mediated phosphorylation of Cortactin on Ser113, since a Ser113 to Ala mutant blocked invadopodia disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moshfegh et al., 2014</xref>). How PAK-phosphorylated Cortactin mediates invadopodia disassembly is still unclear but could be due, at least in part, to a decreased affinity of Cortactin phosphorylated within its F-actin binding repeats (on S113, S150 and/or S282) for F-actin, potentially destabilizing the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Webb et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">2005</xref>).</p><p>We found that p27 binds to Cortactin and localizes to invadopodia following serum or growth factor stimulation and promotes cell invasion. Paradoxically, p27-null cells have more invadopodia and degrade gelatin more efficiently, but exhibit impaired invasive capacity. In fact, we found that p27 promotes the recruitment of PAK1 to Cortactin and invadopodia turnover and this is dependent on phosphorylation of S113/S150/S282 of Cortactin, the sites targeted by PAK kinases. Thus, in absence of p27, the dynamics of invadopodia is altered and prevents efficient invasion through ECM. Altogether, we have identified a novel mechanism by which p27 directly controls cell invasion that could contribute to the increased invasive and metastatic capacity of tumors where p27 is mislocalized in the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>p27 interacts with Cortactin and localizes to invadopodia</title><p>While the role of p27 in the regulation of cell migration is firmly established, how p27 is targeted to specific locations in the cytoplasm to control motility and invasion remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belletti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besson et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Godin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nguyen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Papakonstanti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">See et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Larrea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jin et al., 2013</xref>).

Thus, our data suggests that p27 limits invadopodia formation and that the domain mediating its interaction with Cortactin is required for this function.</p><p>The finding that p27 knockout cells more frequently form invadopodia and exhibit increased ECM degradation activity was surprising given the previous reports that p27 promotes migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Denicourt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Godin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nguyen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Papakonstanti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">See et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Larrea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besson et al., 2004b</xref>).

Taken together our results indicate that although p27 limits the number of invadopodia in MEFs, it also promotes cellular invasion through ECM.

In contrast, the presence of p27 increased the amount of Cortactin co-immunoprecipitated with PAK1 in Hela cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Conversely, in MEFs lacking p27, the amount of Cortactin co-precipitated with PAK1 was sharply decreased compared to p27+/+ cells, despite the fact that PAK1 levels were elevated in p27−/− cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Monitoring the kinetics of association of PAK1 with Cortactin in MEFs revealed that some PAK1 is already associated with Cortactin in serum starved cells, consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vidal et al., 2002</xref>) and progressively increase after serum stimulation, reaching a maximal level after 3 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>); mirroring the kinetics of association of p27 with Cortactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Nevertheless, to further characterize how the Rac1/PAK1/Cortactin signaling pathway is affected in function of p27 status, we inhibited Rac1 itself using either Rac1 siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>) or the Rac specific inhibitor NSC23766 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). Rac1 silencing by siRNAs was verified by immunoblot for Rac1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). When Rac1 was silenced or inhibited, more p27+/+ cells formed invadopodia and there was a dramatic increase in the area of matrix degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,E and C,F</xref>, respectively), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moshfegh et al., 2014</xref>).

Since RhoA plays a critical role in cell motility and the control of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, we determined whether RhoA was involved in p27-mediated regulation of invadopodia formation and function. Transfection of RhoA siRNAs in p27+/+ and p27−/− MEFs did not alter the proportion of cells forming invadopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and only mildly increased the ability of both p27+/+ and p27−/− cells to degrade ECM, although this was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). RhoA siRNA efficacy was checked by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

To test this possibility, we generated triple alanine mutant (TA) (S113A/S150A/S282A) and triple aspartic acid mutant (TD) (S113D/S150D/S282D) of Cortactin and expressed these constructs in p27+/+ and p27−/− E6 MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Cortactin TA and TD mutants gave essentially similar results as the Cortactin S113A and S113D mutants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G–J</xref>). Nevertheless, in p27+/+ MEFs, the Cortactin TA mutant was more potent than Cortactin S113A to promote invadopodia formation (13.5% p27+/+ cells forming invadopodia with Cortactin S113A versus 23.3% with Cortactin TA) and activity (6.17 fold increase in area of degraded gelatin with Cortactin S113A versus 10.02 fold with Cortactin TA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>, respectively). This data suggests that Cortactin phosphorylation on S150 and/or S282 also contribute with S113 to control invadopodia disassembly. To further confirm that PAK-mediated phosphorylation events on Cortactin are involved in this pathway, we evaluated Cortactin phosphorylation levels in HEK 293 cells expressing Myc-tagged Cortactin treated or not with the PAK1-3 inhibitor FRAX597. In presence of FRAX597, there was a 36% decrease in P-Ser Cortactin level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). This mild reduction in P-Ser levels is consistent with Cortactin also being a substrate for other Ser/Thr kinases such as ERK, Akt and PKC. The contribution of S113, S150 and S282 phosphorylation in the P-Ser signal observed in Cortactin immunoprecipitates was estimated in HEK 293 cells expressing either wild-type Cortactin, Cortactin S113A or Cortactin TA. P-Ser levels were reduced in Cortactin S113A immunoprecipitations compared to WT Cortactin and further decreased in Cortactin TA immunoprecipitates, confirming that phosphorylation of these sites contribute to the Cortactin P-Ser signal in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, to show that Cortactin was phosphorylated in vivo on PAK-targeted sites (S113, S150 and/or S282), we performed mass spectrometry analyses on Cortactin. For this, HEK 293 cells were transfected with Myc-Cortactin alone or Myc-Cortactin and the myristoylated second SH3 domain of Nck1 (Myr-SH3-2), which was previously shown to activate PAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lu and Mayer, 1999</xref>). MS/MS analyses from Cortactin immunoprecipitates indicated that Cortactin was phosphorylated on S150 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). This phosphorylation was detected only in samples from cells co-expressing Cortactin and Myr-SH3-2 suggesting that PAK1 activation is required for this event. Although no phosphorylation was detected on S113 or S282 in these experiments, phosphoproteome analyses from other studies have previously shown that Cortactin is phosphorylated in vivo on S113, S150 and/or S282: S113 phosphorylation was detected in prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2010</xref>), mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wiśniewski et al., 2010</xref>) and breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mertins et al., 2016</xref>).

The main finding presented here is that p27 directly controls cellular invasion by impinging on this pathway through the promotion of the Cortactin/PAK1 interaction and the phosphorylation of Cortactin on Ser113, S150 and/or S282 by PAK. Indeed, inhibiting the pathway upstream of Cortactin, either with Rac1 and PAK1 inhibitors or siRNAs converted the phenotype of p27+/+ cells to that of p27−/− cells. Conversely, artificially activating this pathway at the level of Cortactin using phosphomimetic mutants for the PAK-targeted sites efficiently rescued the phenotype of p27-null cells. All three phosphorylation sites on Cortactin appear to act synergistically as the phenotype caused by the triple mutants (Cortactin TA and TD) was more profound than that of mutating S113 alone. While mimicking the phosphorylation of Cortactin on PAK1-targeted sites clearly causes the disassembly of invadopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moshfegh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Webb et al., 2005</xref>), the mechanism involved is still unclear but may be due to decreased affinity of Cortactin phosphorylated within its Actin-binding repeats for F-Actin, which may destabilize invadopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Webb et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moshfegh et al. (2014)</xref> and the present study show that inhibition of the Trio/Rac1/PAK1/Phospho-Cortactin pathway stabilizes invadopodia and is associated with a dramatic increase in proteolytic degradation of ECM. Surprisingly, this phenotype is accompanied by a sharp decrease in the ability of cells to invade through matrix in 3D invasion assays. Thus, it appears that the turnover of invadopodia rather than elevated ECM degradation is required for efficient invasion. Affecting the dynamics of invadopodia formation, maturation and disassembly is therefore detrimental to invasion, as observed here when this last step is inhibited by interfering with Rac1/PAK1 signaling or when p27 is absent. Interestingly, p27 also regulates cell migration in a similar manner by interfering with RhoA activation by its GEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besson et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2004b</xref>). In absence of p27, cells accumulate actins stress fibers and focal adhesions and exhibit a migration defect due to an imbalance in the dynamic cycles of RhoA activation and inactivation (and concomitant Rac1 inactivation and activation) required for F-actin turnover, focal adhesion disassembly and efficient migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besson et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ren et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arthur and Burridge, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cox et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sahai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vial et al., 2003</xref>). Migration and invasion are two intimately linked processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedl and Wolf, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Petrie and Yamada, 2016</xref>). It is quite remarkable that p27 appears to regulate both of these processes, although by distinct mechanisms. Indeed, p27 binds to RhoA and Cortactin via the same domain located within the last 8 aa of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Larrea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Godin et al., 2012</xref>), but while RhoA preferentially binds p27 phosphorylated on T198 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Larrea et al., 2009</xref>), the interaction of p27 with Cortactin did not require the presence of T198 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that different pools of the protein are involved in their regulation. In addition, the regulation of invadopodia by p27 did not appear to involve RhoA, as RhoA silencing affected both p27−/− and p27+/+ cells in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). p27 also regulates invasion by promoting EMT, notably through JAK2/STAT3 signaling and induction of the transcription factor Twist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We found that p27 binds to Cortactin on its actin-binding repeats and this interaction promoted the association of Cortactin with PAK1. Since we were unable to detect an interaction between p27 and PAK1 using either endogenous or overexpressed proteins, it remains unknown how p27 promotes the PAK1/Cortactin interaction. Evidence suggest that Cortactin is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), especially its actin-binding repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shvetsov et al., 2009</xref>) and p27 is a well-known IDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lacy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ou et al., 2012</xref>). Since these proteins typically fold upon binding to their partners, an attractive possibility is that p27 binding causes a conformation change in Cortactin that would favor its interaction with PAK1.</p><p>p27 is a cyclin-CDK inhibitor and although p27 regulates migration and invasion in a CDK-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besson et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Larrea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gui et al., 2014</xref>), there is evidence to suggest that some cell cycle independent roles of CDKs and cyclins may be mediated via CDK inhibitors such as p27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hydbring et al., 2016</xref>). For instance, the regulation of cell migration by Cyclin D1 requires p27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2006</xref>) and the role of CDK5 in promoting neuronal progenitor migration in vivo is mediated via the phosphorylation of p27 on Ser10 which regulates the RhoA/ROCK/LIMK/Cofilin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nguyen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kawauchi et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, CDK5 was recently found to play an important role in invadopodia formation and cancer cell invasion, and CDK5 inhibition blocked both these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Quintavalle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bisht et al., 2015</xref>). CDK5 phosphorylated Caldesmon, causing its degradation by the proteasome and promoting invadopodia formation and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Quintavalle et al., 2011</xref>). Since p27 is a poor inhibitor of CDK5 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lacy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 1996</xref>), it would be interesting to test whether this role of CDK5 may involve p27. Indeed, an attractive hypothesis is that p27 could simultaneously interact with CDK5 complexes, via its N-terminal cyclin-CDK binding domain, and with Cortactin via its C-terminus, thereby recruiting CDK5 in proximity to Caldesmon bound to Cortactin and allowing Caldesmon phosphorylation.</p><p>Our study further defines the complex role played by p27 in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, migration, EMT and invasion and provides another element to explain why the <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> gene is rarely mutated in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Besson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kandoth et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, p27 is either downregulated, mostly via increased proteasomal degradation, or excluded from the nuclei of cancer cells. Given that upon cytoplasmic relocalization, p27 promotes both migration and invasion and may serve to coordinately regulate these processes, it appears likely that this feature may be selected for during tumor progression and could participate in the acquisition of a metastatic behavior by cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies, reagents and plasmids</title><p>Mouse anti c-Myc (9E10, sc-40, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_627268">AB_627268</ext-link>), p27 (F8, sc-1641, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_628074">AB_628074</ext-link>), p27 (SX53G8.5, sc-53871, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_785029">AB_785029</ext-link>), αPAK (A6, sc-166887, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10609226">AB_10609226</ext-link>), RhoA (26C4, sc-418, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_628218">AB_628218</ext-link>) and rabbit anti p27 (C19, sc-528, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_632129">AB_632129</ext-link>), Myc (A14, sc-789, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_631274">AB_631274</ext-link>), Cortactin (H191, sc-11408, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2088281">AB_2088281</ext-link>), Tks5 (M-300, sc-30122, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2254551">AB_2254551</ext-link>), αPAK (N-20, sc-882, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_672249">AB_672249</ext-link>), Arp2 (H-84, sc-15389, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2221848">AB_2221848</ext-link>), c-Src (SRC2, sc-18, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_631324">AB_631324</ext-link>) and ERK1 (K-23, sc-94, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2140110">AB_2140110</ext-link>) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Bands of interest were cut and placed in eppendorf tubes in 30 μl of 1% acetic acid solution and stored at −20C until MS/MS analysis.</p><sec id="s4-11-1"><title>Protein digestion</title><p>Excised gel bands were treated to remove salts, buffers and detergent using 3 washes of 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> intercalated with gel shrinkages in 50% acetonitrile (ACN). Disulfide bonds were disrupted with 20 mM DTT at 56°C for 30 min and subsequently alkylated in 55 mM chloroacetamide for 30 min at room temperature. A last wash with 50% ACN and 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> was performed before addition of 50 ng of trypsin (Promega Sequencing Grade) for an overnight digestion on an Eppendorf Thermomix at 30°C. Peptides were then extracted using 2 washes of 1% formic acid intercalated with gel shrinkages in 50% ACN. The two washes were pooled and evaporated before analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>LC-MS/MS</title><p>20% of each sample was analyzed in LC-MS-MS using an Ultimate 3000 Rapid Separation liquid chromatographic system coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (both from Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were directly loaded on a C<sub>18</sub> reverse phase analytical column (2 µm particle size, 100 Å pore size, 75 µm internal diameter, 50 cm length) with a 45 min effective gradient from 99% A (0.1% formic acid and 100% H2O) to 50% B (80% ACN, 0.085% formic acid and 20% H2O). The Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer acquired data throughout the elution process and operated in a data dependent scheme with full MS scans acquired with the orbitrap, followed by stepped HCD MS/MS (top speed mode in 3 s) on the most abundant ions detected in the MS scan. Mass spectrometer settings were: full MS (AGC: 4.0E<sup>5</sup>, resolution: 120,000, m/z range 350–1500, maximum ion injection time: 60 ms); MS/MS was performed using Stepped HCD Normalized Collision Energy at 30 plus and minus 5%, Orbitrap resolution was set at 17500, intensity threshold: 1.0E<sup>4</sup>, isolation window: 1.6 m/z, dynamic exclusion time setting: 30 s, AGC Target: 1.0E<sup>4</sup> and maximum injection time: 100 ms). The fragmentation was permitted of precursor with a charge state of 2 to 4. The software used to generate. mgf files is Proteome discoverer 1.4.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-3"><title>Peptide identification</title><p>Mass list were used to perform comparison of MS/MS experimental peak lists with the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> taxon of the Swiss-Prot database (November 2016, 20,204 sequences) using Mascot version 2.5.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Perkins et al., 1999</xref>). The cleavage specificity set was the trypsin with maximum four missed cleavages. The precursor mass tolerance was set to 4 ppm and the MS/MS mass tolerance to 0.55 Da. Cystein carbamidomethylation was set as a constant modification while methionine oxidation, tyrosine, serine and threonine phosphorylation were set as variable modification. With these settings, peptide identifications were considered as valid whenever their scores reached a minimum of 23, thus meeting the <italic>p</italic>-values criteria less than 0.05.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are very grateful to Dr Alan Mak (Queen’s University, Kingston, Canada), Dr Jonathan Chernoff (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, USA), Dr Bruce Mayer (University of Connecticut, Farmington) and Dr John Collard (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) for providing reagents.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>This study demonstrates that p27 binding to Cortactin promotes PAK1 interactions with Cortactin, and invadopodia disassembly by phosphorylation of Cortactin on Ser-113. Biochemical analysis is presented to support these conclusions, including the demonstration that a phosphomimetic mutant of Cortactin can complement the p27 deficiency phenotype on invadopodia disassembly. Together, these aspects of the manuscript represent significant strengths. However, the detailed reviews (appended) identify a number of weaknesses in the data used to support the presented conclusions. Given the extensive new experimentation that will be required to address these weaknesses, a decision to reject your manuscript was made. Please be assured that <italic>eLife</italic> is interested in this area of research. Indeed, we would welcome the submission of a new manuscript on this topic when findings from new experimentation are obtained.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This study demonstrates that p27 binding to Cortactin promotes PAK1 interactions with Cortactin, and invadopodia disassembly by phosphorylation of Cortactin on Ser-113. In general, the biochemical analysis is strong and convincing. Indeed, the demonstration that a phosphomimetic mutant of Cortactin can complement the p27 deficiency phenotype on invadopodia disassembly is very interesting. However, there are a number of areas that require strengthening.</p><p>1) The siRNA studies (Rac and RhoA) were performed with a single oligonucleotide. To exclude off0target effects, phenotypes should be confirmed with two independent siRNAs.</p><p>2) Some care should be taken concerning the PAK1/Cortactin connection. First, the studies presented are focussed on mutational analysis of the Cortactin phosphorylation site Ser-113 rather than the kinase. Second, in vitro studies demonstrate phosphorylation of Cortactin by PAK3 at more than one site (Webb et al.). Third, what is the evidence that PAK1 phosphorylates Cortactin in vivo? Fourth, the in vivo studies are reliant on a drug.</p><p>3) The conclusion that p27 regulates Cortactin/PAK mediated invadopodia disassembly are based on static images of invadopodia number. Conclusions about the dynamic nature of invadopodia would be best supported by images documenting the dynamics.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This work, building on prior publications from Webb et al. and Moshfegh et al., 2014 attempts to provide a mechanistic basis for the effects of cytosolic p27 on invadopodia dynamics and cell invasion. For the most part, the data appear sound, but there are a few key issues that are not adequately addressed.</p><p>1) The only experiment that identifies Pak1 as a link between p27 and invadopodia is treatment of MEFs with FRAX597 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). There are two issues here: this compound affects all three group A Paks (thus one can't say the effects are through Pak1) and FRAX597 has poor selectivity towards STE20 kinases such as Group A Paks as compared to tyrosine kinases. There are much more selective compounds (e.g., FRAX1036 and G5555) as well as other approaches (siRNA, CRISPR) that could and should be used to establish the link claimed by the authors. As things stand, the data do not adequately support the author's contentions.</p><p>2) There really isn't any proof that Cortactin gets phosphorylated by Pak at S113, only that substitutions at this residue affect invadopodia dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). What would have made the case much stronger are phospho-S113 blots and/or IFs showing that phosphorylation of this site is modulated by Rac/Pak. As far as I can tell, the initial paper from Webb et al., 2006, on which the present manuscript relies, only provided in vitro evidence that recombinant Pak3 could phosphorylate Cortactin at S113. As there are no available phospho S113 antibodies, the authors might instead IP Cortactin from p27-/- MEFs and blot with p-Ser antibodies or, better, ID sites by mass spec. I know this sort of experiments isn't fun or easy, but the use of phospho-mimics alone is not adequate to support their conclusions.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript identifies p27<sup>kip1</sup> as a regulator of invadopodia formation and cell invasion, increasing the surprising number of cellular processes known to be regulated by this protein. While cytoplasmic p27<sup>kip1</sup> was previously established to limit RhoA activity and stress fiber formation to promote cell migration, Jeannot et al., 2015 describe a new mechanism, where p27 promotes Cortactin phosphorylation by Pak1 to reduce invadopodia and increase cell invasion through collagen. While the authors include a strong set of experiments that convincingly demonstrates a p27/Cortactin/PAK1 pathway exists, the manuscript overall feels somewhat preliminary because it is not clear how inhibition of this pathway can increase invadopodia formation and prevent cell invasion. Presenting a mechanism to explain this puzzling observation and more clearly demonstrating p27 is localized to matrix degrading structures would strengthen the novel, and important conclusions made by the authors. Additional concerns are listed below.</p><p>Major Concerns:</p><p>The pre-fixation permeabilization/extraction of the cytoplasm prior to staining for p27 does not give a lot of confidence that p27 is localized to invadopodia (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, for example). Additionally, the Cortactin phosphomimetic construct decreases the number of invadopodia without significantly reducing the area of gelatin degradation, raising the strong possibility that the structures being identified by Cortactin (eg. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) are not actual invadopodia, despite their punctate appearance. To make confirm these structures are invadopodia, the authors should show p27 is enriched in Cortactin or Tsk5 positive puncta which coincide with regions of matrix degradation.</p><p>The authors' measure number of cells with invadopodia (eg. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), yet often conclude that cells have more invadopodia. If the authors are going to conclude that there are more invadopodia per cell, this is something that must be explicitly measured.</p><p>Importantly, the strikingly counterintuitive conclusion that increasing invadopodia inhibits invasion was not sufficiently justified. It remains a possibility that another pathway mediated by p27 is responsible for the invasion phenotype. One way to address this possibility would be to show expression of p27 1-190 is unable to rescue cell invasion.</p><p>It is not clear if the migration defect resulting from loss of p27Kip (Besson et al., 2006), is mechanistically distinct from the invasion phenotype reported here. In their previous publication, it was shown that inhibition of Rho kinase rescued migration. Does Rho kinase inhibition also restore the ability of the p27 -/- cells to invade through thin collagen layers?

In general, the biochemical analysis is strong and convincing. Indeed, the demonstration that a phosphomimetic mutant of Cortactin can complement the p27 deficiency phenotype on invadopodia disassembly is very interesting. However, there are a number of areas that require strengthening.</italic></p><p><italic>1) The siRNA studies (Rac and RhoA) were performed with a single oligonucleotide. To exclude off0target effects, phenotypes should be confirmed with two independent siRNAs.</italic></p><p>To strengthen the data obtained with single siRNAs for Rac1 and RhoA, we have repeated these experiments (# of cells forming invadopodia and area degraded/cell) with a pool of 4 siRNA against Rac1 (ON-TARGETplus Mouse Rac1 siRNA – SMARTpool (L041170000005)) and with a new pool of 3 siRNAs against RhoA (sc-36414). These results have been incorporated into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B-D</xref> for Rac1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A-C</xref> for RhoA. In addition, siRac1 results are also replicated using a pharmacological inhibitor of Rac1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E-F</xref>), arguing against an off-target effect of the siRNA.</p><p><italic>2) Some care should be taken concerning the PAK1/Cortactin connection. First, the studies presented are focussed on mutational analysis of the Cortactin phosphorylation site Ser-113 rather than the kinase. Second,</italic> in vitro <italic>studies demonstrate phosphorylation of Cortactin by PAK3 at more than one site (Webb et al.). Third, what is the evidence that PAK1 phosphorylates Cortactin</italic> in vivo<italic>? Fourth, the</italic> in vivo <italic>studies are reliant on a drug.</italic></p><p>We have modified the text and use more careful wording when describing the PAK1/Cortactin connection. We also have taken several steps to strengthen this point:</p><p>1) To investigate the importance of PAK1, we had data using the FRAX597 inhibitor, which targets the ATP-binding pocket in the kinase domain of PAK1-3 and inhibits the kinase activity of PAK, therefore suggesting that the kinase activity of PAK is involved.</p><p>As suggested by reviewer 2, we replicated these experiments (# of cells forming invadopodia and area degraded/cell) and with other, more specific inhibitors, of PAK1-3 (FRAX1036 and G5555). These inhibitors gave similar results as FRAX597, thus confirming the importance of PAK activity in p27-mediated control of invadopodia dynamics. This data has been included in the manuscript as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Since these inhibitors cannot discriminate between PAK1-3, we also performed similar experiments with siRNAs (a pool of 4 siRNAs) against PAK1 (ON-TARGETplus Mouse PAK1 (18479) siRNA – SMARTpool (L048101000005). Results with PAK1 siRNA are similar to those obtained with PAK pharmacological inhibitors, supporting the involvement of PAK1 in the pathway we describe. These data have been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-C</xref>.</p><p>Altogether, we now have data from 3 different PAK1-3 pharmacological inhibitors and from PAK1-specific siRNA that give similar results, thus strongly suggesting that PAK1 is indeed involved in the pathway regulating invadopodia dynamics.</p><p>2) Webb and colleagues (2006) have reported the phosphorylation of Cortactin by PAK3 in vitro on three different residues (S113, S150 and S282).</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we tested whether the other sites known to be phosphorylated by PAK on Cortactin were important in the phenotype observed, We generated triple S113/S150/S282 unphosphorylatable and phosphomimetic Cortactin mutants and measured the effect on # of cells forming invadopodia and area degraded/cell. Triple mutants give similar results as S113 Cortactin mutants, with a stronger effect of the triple unphosphorylatable mutant in p27+/+ cells (13.5% cells forming invadopodia with S113A versus 23.3% with tripleA mutant; 6.17 fold increased area degraded with S113A versus 10.02 fold with TripleA) suggesting that these sites (or at least one of them) also contribute to Cortactin regulation of invadopodia dynamics. These results have been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F-J</xref>. These results also reinforce the idea that phosphorylation of Cortactin is important in the control of invadopodia dynamics.</p><p>3) We now provide 4 lines of evidence indicating that these sites are indeed phosphorylated in vivo:</p><p>a) By IP Cortactin and anti Phospho-Ser immunoblot we found that Ser phosphorylation of Cortactin was reduced in presence of PAK1-3 inhibitor FRAX597. This data is provided as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>.</p><p>b) By IP Cortactin and anti Phospho-Ser immunoblot we found that expression of Cortactin S113A and Cortactin S113A/S150A/S282A exhibit decreased phospho-Ser signal compared to wild-type Cortactin, arguing that phosphorylation of these sites contribute to the phospho-Ser signal detected. This data is provided as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>.</p><p>c) Our initial attempt to obtain mass spectrometry data showing that Cortactin was phosphorylated in vivo was with a private company. We since established a collaboration with a group specialized in MS work at the Institut Cochin. We were able to detect a phosphorylation of Cortactin at Ser150 (one of the 3 sites reported to be phosphorylated by PAK1-3) when a myristoylated form of the second SH3 domain of Nck1 was co-expressed (previously shown to activate PAK1 by Bruce Mayer's lab: Lu et al., 1997 and Lu and Mayer, 1999) but not when only Cortactin was expressed. Therefore PAK activation in these cells appear to induce Cortactin S150 phosphorylation.

This data has been added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and shows that invadopodia in p27-/- cells have a longer lifetime than in p27+/+ cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>This work, building on prior publications from Webb et al. and Moshfegh et al., 2014 attempts to provide a mechanistic basis for the effects of cytosolic p27 on invadopodia dynamics and cell invasion. For the most part, the data appear sound, but there are a few key issues that are not adequately addressed.</italic></p><p><italic>1) The only experiment that identifies Pak1 as a link between p27 and invadopodia is treatment of MEFs with FRAX597 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). There are two issues here: this compound affects all three group A Paks (thus one can't say the effects are through Pak1) and FRAX597 has poor selectivity towards STE20 kinases such as Group A Paks as compared to tyrosine kinases. There are much more selective compounds (e.g., FRAX1036 and G5555) as well as other approaches (siRNA, CRISPR) that could and should be used to establish the link claimed by the authors. As things stand, the data do not adequately support the author's contentions.</italic></p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we replicated these experiments (# of cells forming invadopodia and area degraded/cell) with siRNAs against PAK1 and with the more specific inhibitors of PAK1-3, FRAX1036 and G5555, to better support the link between PAK1 and Cortactin in p27-mediated regulation of invadopodia dynamics. These results are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-C</xref> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) There really isn't any proof that Cortactin gets phosphorylated by Pak at S113, only that substitutions at this residue affect invadopodia dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). What would have made the case much stronger are phospho-S113 blots and/or IFs showing that phosphorylation of this site is modulated by Rac/Pak. As far as I can tell, the initial paper from Webb et al., 2006, on which the present manuscript relies, only provided</italic> in vitro <italic>evidence that recombinant Pak3 could phosphorylate Cortactin at S113. As there are no available phospho S113 antibodies, the authors might instead IP Cortactin from p27-/- MEFs and blot with p-Ser antibodies or, better, ID sites by mass spec. I know this sort of experiments isn't fun or easy, but the use of phospho-mimics alone is not adequate to support their conclusions.</italic></p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we performed additional experiments indicating that:</p><p>a) By IP Cortactin and anti Phospho-Ser immunoblot we found that Ser phosphorylation of Cortactin was reduced in presence of PAK1-3 inhibitor FRAX597.

While cytoplasmic p27<sup>kip1</sup> was previously established to limit RhoA activity and stress fiber formation to promote cell migration, Jeannot et al, 2015. describe a new mechanism, where p27 promotes Cortactin phosphorylation by Pak1 to reduce invadopodia and increase cell invasion through collagen. While the authors include a strong set of experiments that convincingly demonstrates a p27/Cortactin/PAK1 pathway exists, the manuscript overall feels somewhat preliminary because it is not clear how inhibition of this pathway can increase invadopodia formation and prevent cell invasion. Presenting a mechanism to explain this puzzling observation and more clearly demonstrating p27 is localized to matrix degrading structures would strengthen the novel, and important conclusions made by the authors. Additional concerns are listed below.</italic></p><p><italic>Major Concerns:</italic></p><p><italic>The pre-fixation permeabilization/extraction of the cytoplasm prior to staining for p27 does not give a lot of confidence that p27 is localized to invadopodia (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, for example). Additionally, the Cortactin phosphomimetic construct decreases the number of invadopodia without significantly reducing the area of gelatin degradation, raising the strong possibility that the structures being identified by Cortactin (eg. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) are not actual invadopodia, despite their punctate appearance. To make confirm these structures are invadopodia, the authors should show p27 is enriched in Cortactin or Tsk5 positive puncta which coincide with regions of matrix degradation.</italic></p><p>We performed co-immunostaining for Tks5, p27 and fluorescent gelatin providing evidence that p27 and Tks5 colocalize in structures capable of degrading ECM. These data in p27+/+ MEFs and in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>We had some variability in the last set of experiments using S113 Cortactin mutants. More experiments have now been performed and these experiments have been incorporated in the existing figure panels, improving the quality of the data presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B-E</xref>). In addition, we now provide new data using Cortactin mutants in which the three sites reported to be phosphorylated by PAK (S113/S150/S282) have been mutated to either unphosphorylatable and phosphomimetic residues. The triple unphosphorylatable mutant (Cortactin TA) give more robust responses in p27+/+ cells (13.5% cells forming invadopodia with S113A versus 23.3% with tripleA mutant; 6.17 fold increased area degraded with S113A versus 10.02 fold with TripleA) suggesting that these sites have a synergistic effect in Cortactin regulation of invadopodia dynamics. This data is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F-J</xref>.</p><p><italic>The authors' measure number of cells with invadopodia (eg. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), yet often conclude that cells have more invadopodia. If the authors are going to conclude that there are more invadopodia per cell, this is something that must be explicitly measured.</italic></p><p>We have modified the text to ensure that our conclusions are referring only to the number of cells forming invadopodia.</p><p><italic>Importantly, the strikingly counterintuitive conclusion that increasing invadopodia inhibits invasion was not sufficiently justified. It remains a possibility that another pathway mediated by p27 is responsible for the invasion phenotype. One way to address this possibility would be to show expression of p27 1-190 is unable to rescue cell invasion.</italic></p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we performed invasion assays with p27-/- MEFs infected with either empty vector, p27CK- or p27CK- 1-190 mutants. While p27CK- expression clearly increased the invasive capacity of p27-/- cells, the p27CK- 1-190 mutant had no effect, thus confirming that the ability of p27 to interact with Cortactin is required for the regulation of invasion. This data is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>.</p><p><italic>It is not clear if the migration defect resulting from loss of p27Kip (Besson et al., 2006), is mechanistically distinct from the invasion phenotype reported here. In their previous publication, it was shown that inhibition of Rho kinase rescued migration. Does Rho kinase inhibition also restore the ability of the p27 -/- cells to invade through thin collagen layers? If not, it would strengthen the conclusion that the authors are investigating a novel migration mechanism downstream of p27<sup>kip1</sup>.</italic></p><p>As the reviewer suggested, we performed transwell invasion assays with cells treated with the ROCK inhibitor Y26632. ROCK inhibition had no effect on the invasive capacity of p27+/+ and p27-/- MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This is in agreement with our data indicating that siRNAs against RhoA did not significantly affect the number of cells forming invadopodia and only slightly increased the ability of both p27+/+ and p27-/- MEFs to degrade ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>), suggesting that the regulation of RhoA by p27 is not involved in this phenotype.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic></p><p><italic>1) While the colocalization of p27 and Tks5 in regions of degraded gelatin is now included in the manuscript, increasing confidence that these structures are bona fide invadopodia, it is not clear how specific the colocalization is compared to regions of the cell that are not associated with regions of gelatin degradation. I suggest the authors include line scans of regions of the cell not associated with gelatin degradation to demonstrate the specificity and import of the colocalization they now measure near regions of degraded gelatin.</italic></p><p>As requested, we added line scans on the same images not associated with regions of gelatin degradation and the results indicate that individual spots of Tks5 and p27 do not colocalize extensively outside of these regions of gelatin degradation.
