In <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, this is now recognised as body odour, a key chemical component of which is the sulphurous thioalcohol, 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (3M3SH). Volatile 3M3SH is produced in the underarm as a result of specific microbial activity, which act on the odourless dipeptide-containing malodour precursor molecule, S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH, secreted in the axilla (underarm) during colonisation. The mechanism by which these bacteria recognise S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH and produce body odour is still poorly understood. Here we report the structural and biochemical basis of bacterial transport of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH by <italic>Staphylococcus hominis</italic>, which is converted to the sulphurous thioalcohol component 3M3SH in the bacterial cytoplasm, before being released into the environment. Knowledge of the molecular basis of precursor transport, essential for body odour formation, provides a novel opportunity to design specific inhibitors of malodour production in humans.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34995.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Human body odour contains a number of chemicals, but the most pungent and recognisable are thioalcohols.

Through the secretions of various glands, that open onto the skin or into hair follicles, this environment is nutrient-rich and hosts a unique microbial community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>). Esterified fatty acids and other lipids are secreted by the sebaceous gland, while the eccrine glands produce a dilute salt solution with lactate and other organic solutes being secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bovell, 2015</xref>). A third exocrine gland, the apocrine, which is more specialized and found only in the axilla, areolae, genitalia and external auditory meatus (ear canal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins, 1989</xref>), starts secreting an odourless lipid-rich viscous secretion with the onset of puberty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The lipid rich secretion is not involved in thermoregulation like the eccrine gland and in mammals has a likely role in scent generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins, 1989</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34995.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Biochemical route of axillary malodour precursor peptide S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the axilla. The surface of the skin is composed of the axillary microbiome, typically dominated by either <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> or Staphylococci. Axillary apocrine glands are subcutaneously located in the hypodermis. Apocrine glands secrete a variety of odourless precursors that are bio-transformed into odorous volatiles by the axillary microbiome. Sulfanylalkanols (e.g. 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (3M3SH)) are secreted as cysteinylglycine conjugated peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Starkenmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emter and Natsch, 2008</xref>). <italic>Staphylococcus hominis</italic> transport and metabolise cysteinylglycine- 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (<italic>S</italic>-Cys-Gly-3M3SH) to liberate the odorous volatile 3M3SH, which is one of the major components of axillary malodour.

(<bold>C</bold>) Synthesis of <italic>S</italic>-Cys-Gly-3M3SH. <italic>S</italic>-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is derived from the glutathione 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexanol conjugate (SG<italic>-</italic>3M3SH). SG<italic>-</italic>3M3SH is actively transported by the ATP-binding cassette transporter sub-family C member 11 (ABCC11) into apocrine secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baumann et al., 2014b</xref>). In the secretory vesicle, <italic>S-</italic>Gly<italic>-</italic>3M3SH is bio-transformed by <italic>γ</italic>-glutamyl transferase 1 (GGT1), which cleaves the terminal glutamyl residue generating S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH. S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is secreted to the surface of the skin by apocrine secretion, which characteristically involves pinching off the apical cytoplasm and partial shedding releasing intracellular components into the luminal region of the apocrine gland. Upon release the cytoplasm may be recovered and repaired and a new cycle of secretion can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Farkaš, 2015</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34995-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>In humans, the link between the axillary apocrine gland, underarm bacteria and body odour (BO), was first recognised over 50 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shelley et al., 1953</xref>) and early culture-based studies on this relationship found the axillary microbiota to be dominated by Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium species, with the <italic>Corynebacteria</italic> in particular correlating with malodour intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Leyden et al., 1981</xref>). More recent culture-independent meta-taxonomic studies have confirmed that the axilla is dominated by these genera, although the presence of additional taxa not previously indicated by culture-based methods is also evident, notably Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) belonging to the <italic>Anaerococcus</italic> and <italic>Peptoniphilus</italic> genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Costello et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Egert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Troccaz et al., 2015</xref>). Various molecules produced in the axilla have been linked to malodour, including 16-androstene steroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gower et al., 1994</xref>) and short-chain (C2-C5) volatile fatty acids (VFAs) produced by axillary bacteria via several metabolic routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">James et al., 2004</xref>). However, 16-androstenes are now believed to be only minor contributors to axillary malodour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">James et al., 2013</xref>), and it is accepted that the VFAs most heavily involved in BO are a series of structurally-unusual medium-chain (C6-C10) acids originating from <italic>N</italic>-acylglutamine precursors present in apocrine sweat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Natsch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Natsch et al., 2006</xref>). A third class of molecule, the thioalcohols (also called sulfanylalkanols), have recently been identified as important components of human body odour and a number of these have been detected within the volatiles released from the underarm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Troccaz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Natsch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hasegawa et al., 2004</xref>). They are particularly pungent and can be detected in pg.l<sup>−1</sup> quantities, an order of magnitude lower than many other volatile chemicals emanating from the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Natsch et al., 2004</xref>). The most abundant and pungent of these thioalcohols is 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (3M3SH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which is a primary causal molecule of axillary malodour and subsequent BO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Troccaz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hasegawa et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Thioalcohols are known to be released as a peptide-conjugated precursor from the apocrine gland, which secretes directly into the hair follicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The biosynthetic origin of the thioalcohol precursors is currently poorly understood, but they are thought to be secreted into the axilla via the ABC transporter ABCC11 as odourless glutathione conjugates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumann et al., 2014a</xref>). The glutathione conjugated form (SG-3M3SH) has never been detected in axillary sweat; however, the L-cysteinylglycine dipeptide conjugated form, S-[1-(2-hydroxyethyl)−1-methylbutyl]-L-cysteinylglycine (S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), is readily detectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Starkenmann et al., 2005</xref>) and recently a γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT1) has been demonstrated to localise to the apocrine sweat gland and convert SG-3M3SH to S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumann et al., 2014a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We and others have demonstrated that S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH can be taken up and metabolised by a highly limited range of staphylococcal species present in the axilla, namely <italic>Staphylococcus hominis</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus haemolyticus</italic> and <italic>Staphylocooccus lugdunensis</italic>, to liberate 3M3SH, that subsequently exits the cell through an undefined mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Troccaz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Starkenmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bawdon et al., 2015</xref>). A strong correlation between <italic>S. hominis</italic> and body odour production has recently been established using culture-independent taxonomic studies of the axillary microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Troccaz et al., 2015</xref>), confirming the biological significance of this low-abundance species within the axilla in BO production in humans. However, the mechanism by which the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH precursor molecule is taken up into <italic>S. hominis</italic> and related thioalcohol producers is currently unknown, hampering efforts to identify novel mechanisms to disrupt this process and control odour production in humans.</p><p>Here we identify the biochemical and structural basis for the recognition and specific transport of the malodour precursor peptide, S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH, into <italic>S. hominis</italic>. We first show that S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is actively taken up by <italic>S. hominis</italic> through a specific secondary active transporter, STAH0001_1446 (SH1446), a member of the proton coupled oligopeptide transporter (POT) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hagting et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Paulsen and Skurray, 1994</xref>). Through a combination of structural, biochemical and cell based assays we reveal how this peptide transporter is able to recognise a thioalcohol-conjugated peptide and further, show that transport is coupled to the inwardly directed proton electrochemical gradient. Our results suggest that SH1446 is a clear target for inhibitor design to prevent malodour production, thus providing further molecular insights into the role of the skin microbiota in human scent generation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>POT transporters are essential for transport of thiol-conjugated dipeptides in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p>To elucidate how thiol-conjugated dipeptides are transported by bacteria, we first examined the model organism <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which is able to recognise and metabolise the dipeptide version of the non-physiological malodour precursor <italic>S</italic>-benzyl-L-cysteine, namely, S-benzyl-L-cysteinylglycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">James et al., 2013</xref>). Resting cells of <italic>E. coli</italic> were indeed able to remove S-benzyl-L-cysteinylglycine from solution and break it down to release the thiol active product, benzyl mercaptan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Following transport into the cell, the dipeptide must be cleaved to release the benzyl mercaptan, most likely through a cysteine-<italic>S</italic>-conjugate β-lyase-type activity, for which a number have been described in <italic>E. coli</italic>, including MetC and MalY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dwivedi et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zdych et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Awano et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, TnaA which is a tryptophanase known to have L-cysteine desulfhydrase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Awano et al., 2005</xref>) is also capable of releasing benzyl mercaptan.</p><p>Individual disruption of <italic>metC</italic> and <italic>malY</italic> did not decrease the amount of benzyl mercaptan produced by <italic>E. coli</italic>, while disruption of <italic>tnaA</italic> led to an almost complete loss of biotransformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This suggests that <italic>E. coli</italic> takes up the S-benzyl-L-cysteinylglycine, whereupon a host dipeptidase cleaves the glycine residue prior to cleavage of the <italic>S</italic>-benzyl-cysteine by TnaA to release the benzyl mercaptan.</p><p>To discover the genetic basis of the transport and metabolism of these thiol-conjugated dipeptides, we exploited the knock out (KO) library of single gene disruptions in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baba et al., 2006</xref>). We hypothesised that the dipeptide moiety might direct the molecule through a peptide transporter. In <italic>E. coli</italic> the main peptide systems are relatively well characterised, the two main transport systems belong to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) family and the proton dependent oligopeptide transporter (POT) family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The <italic>E. coli</italic> Opp and Dpp ABC transporters have been extensively studied in <italic>E. coli</italic> and the closely related bacterium <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smith et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Klepsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abouhamad et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goodell and Higgins, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tame et al., 1995</xref>) and an <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 strain with non-functional Opp and Dpp system (ΔDB1), was used to assess the role of these transporters in the production of benzyl mercaptan. Surprisingly, benzyl mercaptan production was similar to the wild-type strain, suggesting that neither ABC transporter was important for Cys-Gly-conjugate transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Having ruled out transport via the ABC peptide transporters, we then broadened our search to include additional peptide transporters that have been described in <italic>E. coli</italic>. These were the four members of the proton dependent oligopeptide transporter, or POT family, encoded by <italic>dtpA-D</italic>, that have poorly defined physiological roles during growth on peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Prabhala et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casagrande et al., 2009</xref>), the CstA protein, orthologues of which have been demonstrated to be peptide transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garai et al., 2016</xref>) and the Sap system, which is implicated in uptake of cationic antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Groisman et al., 1992</xref>).

These data suggest that transporters belonging to the POT family are most likely responsible for Cys-Gly-conjugate transport, revealing a new biological role for bacterial POT transporters in the uptake of Cys-Gly-(S) conjugates.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34995.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Biotransformation of both model (S-Benzyl-L-cysteinylglycine) and physiological substrate <italic>S</italic>-Cys-Gly-3M3SH by model organism <italic>E.coli</italic> K-12.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Biotransformation of S-Benzyl-L-cysteinylglycine by <italic>E. coli</italic> strains containing deletion in known or predicted peptide transporters.

The four <italic>dtp</italic> genes were cloned into a pBAD vector commonly used for overexpression of membrane transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mulligan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mulligan et al., 2012</xref>) and transformed into the wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> background. The ability of the resulting strains to convert S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH to 3M3SH was subsequently measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bawdon et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with the reduction in benzyl mercaptan production reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the <italic>dtpB</italic> gene alone was able to confer a malodour production (BO<sup>+</sup>) phenotype to <italic>E. coli</italic>, which was not seen with any of the other <italic>dtp</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The same pattern was observed with S-benzyl-Cys-Gly as a substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting that DtpB has a unique ability to transport these unusual conjugated peptides.</p><p>The molecular basis for S-Cys-Gly-3M3H transport into malodour producing staphylococci is unknown, and the genetic intractability of these poorly studied coagulase negative <italic>Staphylococcal</italic> species makes it difficult to study using genetic approaches. We therefore used an alternative approach exploiting our discovery that expression of a transporter in trans could produce a BO<sup>+</sup> phenotype to <italic>E. coli</italic>. Given our discovery that <italic>E. coli</italic> POT family peptide transporters can transport S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH, we examined the genome of <italic>S. hominis</italic> SK1119, as <italic>S. hominis</italic> are the most abundant malodour producing Staphylococcal species in the underarm microbiota. Unlike <italic>E. coli, S. hominis</italic> contains only a single POT family member DtpT (SH1446), orthologues of which were seen in all sequenced staphylococci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The POT peptide systems remain largely uncharacterised in staphyoloccci, although in the well-studied pathogen <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the single POT transporter encoded by <italic>dtpT</italic> is the sole route for dipeptide uptake in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hiron et al., 2007</xref>). We also identified a second system, encoded by STAHO0001_0415 (SH0415), which is annotated as an MFS transporter and only present in <italic>S. hominis</italic> and <italic>S. haemolyticus</italic>, two known thioalcohol producers, and which is genetically linked to genes involved in peptide and amino acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Both transporters were cloned into pBADcLIC2005 and transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> for functional analysis. When levels of 3M3SH production were measured in these strains, uptake was only enhanced by the presence of SH1446, with SH0415 having little effect on 3M3SH activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, with S-benzyl-cysteinlyglycine as a substrate, there was no increase in production of benzyl mercaptan with SH1446 but a significant increase was observed with SH0415 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Together these data strongly support the conclusion that the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH transporter in <italic>S. hominis</italic> is the POT transporter STAH0001_1446 (SH1446).</p><p>To further demonstrate the importance of SH1446 in the physiological transport of <italic>S-</italic>Cys-Gly-3M3SH we used a biochemical approach to examine whether peptides could inhibit 3M3SH production by competing with <italic>S-</italic>Cys-Gly-3M3SH uptake. Firstly, we used our <italic>E. coli</italic> system where 3M3SH production is seen when SH1446 is expressed in trans and we observed clear inhibition of 3M3SH production with both di- and tri-Ala peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) but not with L-Ala alone nor tetra-Ala. The purified TnaA enzyme that cleaves Cys-3M3SH was not inhibited by any of these peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>) , supporting the hypothesis that the whole cell inhibition is due to inhibition of peptide transport.

It should be noted that a significant affect was observed for 25 mM tetra-Ala in <italic>S. hominis</italic> wild-type, however this affect is due to the acidic pH that was required to dissolve the peptide which appears to inhibit metabolism in <italic>S. hominis</italic> but not <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The <italic>S. hominis</italic> POT transporter, PepT<sub>Sh</sub> transports <italic>S</italic>-Cys-Gly-3M3SH</title><p>POT transporters belong to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) and use an inwardly directed proton electrochemical gradient to drive the concentrative uptake of di- and tri-peptides across the cell membrane for metabolic assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daniel and Kottra, 2004</xref>).

On addition of valinomycin (V) the membrane becomes highly permeable to potassium, generating a hyperpolarised membrane potential (negative inside), which drives the uptake of protons and ligand, protonating the pyranine dye and altering its fluorescent properties.

PepT<sub>Sh</sub> adopts the canonical MFS fold with helices H1-H6 forming the N-terminal bundle and H7-H12 the C-terminal bundle. PepT<sub>Sh</sub> was crystallised in an inward open state, observed previously for other members of the POT family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Newstead, 2015</xref>), wherein the extracellular gate, consisting of helices H1-2 and H7-8 from the N- and C-terminal bundles respectively, is closed and the intracellular gate, consisting of helices H4-5 and H10-11 is open.

The role of helices HA and HB in prokaryotic POT family transporters still remains unclear. However, the observation of lipid molecules bound between these helices and the transport domain suggests a possible role in stabilising these transporters in the membrane, which may be an adaption specific to prokaryotic members of the POT family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Newstead et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34995.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of PepT<sub>Sh</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Crystal structure of PepT<sub>Sh</sub> shown in the plane of the membrane.

The Cys-Gly part of the precursor is positioned such that the carboxy termini of the peptide faces towards the intracellular side of the binding site. The terminal carboxyl group makes two hydrogen bond interactions, one with Tyr41 on H1 and a second interaction to a water molecule (W107), which links the carboxyl group with Asn347 on H8. The carbonyl group of the CG peptide also makes a hydrogen bond to this water molecule, creating a well-coordinated interaction network between the peptide and Asn347 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The terminal amino group makes two further polar interactions, with a water molecule that sits next to Tyr41 and also to the carbonyl group of Gln344, which sits further up on H8. In contrast, the thioalcohol moiety points towards the extracellular gate, with the sulphur atom sitting close to Gln310 on H7, whereas the alcohol group extends towards helix H8 making interactions with backbone carbonyl and amide groups of Phe343 and Asn347, respectively. The acyl group extends into a large pocket nestled between helices H7 and H10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This long pocket (~10 Å) extends from the central peptide binding site into the C-terminal bundle of the transporter and is both hydrophobic and polar in character.</p><p>Previously, we showed that a related POT family transporter, PepT<sub>St</sub>, is able to bind peptides in different orientations in the binding site, with a di-peptide adopting a horizontal position and a tri-peptide a vertical one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lyons et al., 2014</xref>) and suggested this flexibility may be responsible for the accomodation of larger peptide ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newstead, 2017</xref>). Here we see that the <italic>S-</italic>Cys-Gly-3M3SH peptide adopts a more vertical orientation, similar to the tri-alanine position in PepT<sub>St</sub>. However, there are significant differences in the interactions. A structural overlay of the <italic>S-</italic>Cys-Gly-3M3SH peptide shows that it sits much further up in the binding site compared to the natural peptides captured in PepT<sub>St</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A &amp; B</xref>), most likely as a result of the requirement to accommodate the thioalcohol group in the extended pocket. This has a knock-on effect with respect to the position of the amino and carboxy termini. In PepT<sub>St</sub>, the amino terminal group of the di-peptide directly interacts with helix H8 and H10, whereas the tri-peptide makes a much weaker interaction through a carbonyl group. In contrast, in PepT<sub>Sh </sub>this interaction is achieved through a water mediated hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>The role of water in mediating interactions between peptides and their binding sites has been previously observed in the ABC transporter binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tame et al., 1995</xref>), albeit for side chain independent binding. A similar mechanism may be employed by PepT<sub>Sh</sub> to facilitate transport of modified peptides by replacing direct interactions between the peptide and the transporter when these are sterically restricted, as we observe with <italic>S-</italic>Cys-Gly-3M3SH. The interaction of the amino termini of peptides with both the mammalian and bacterial POT family transporters has been identified as facilitating high affinity binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weitz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meredith et al., 2000</xref>). The reduced IC<sub>50</sub> value for the modified peptide in PepT<sub>Sh</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), may therefore be a combination of steric restraints resulting in the accommodation of the extended side chain group, and the subsequent knock on effects on the position of the interactions between the amino and carboxy groups with conserved side chains in the binding site.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Functional characterisation of PepT<sub>Sh</sub> binding site</title><p>S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is the first human derived peptide with a modified side chain to be captured in a POT family transporter, and contains biochemical features similar to physiological peptides (Cys-Gly), but also incorporates the non-peptide thioalcohol group (3M3SH). We therefore wished to explore whether S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is recognised using a similar mechanism to physiological peptides. Several mutations in the binding site that have previously been shown to play an important role in peptide recognition within the bacterial POT family were therefore generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newstead, 2017</xref>). Tyrosine 41 forms part of a conserved E<sup>33</sup>xxERFxYY<sup>41</sup> motif on TM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Solcan et al., 2012</xref>), which plays a role in proton coupling and influences peptide uptake in several POT family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ernst et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guettou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lyons et al., 2014</xref>). In PepT<sub>Sh</sub> Tyr41 hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl terminus of the terminal glycine amino acid in S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Mutating Tyr41 to phenylalanine or alanine severely reduced transport of di-alanine compared to WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). A similar negative effect on transport was observed in the related POT family transporter PepT<sub>St</sub>, from <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Solcan et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting a common role for the conserved tyrosine in peptide recognition within the POT family. We then used the same variants in our whole cell assay for 3M3SH production. Interestingly, while both Tyr41Phe and Tyr41Ala variants had reduced activity, at about 50% of the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), the phenotype was not as severe as that observed in the liposome based assay.

In particular, we were interested in the contribution made by the Asn347 and Glu418, which coordinate a water molecule (W107) linking both the carboxyl and carbonyl groups of the ligand to the binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The equivalent residues in homologous POT family transporters have been implicated in both peptide recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lyons et al., 2014</xref>) and gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Solcan et al., 2012</xref>), and in the case of Glu418 may facilitate the coupling between peptide recognition, proton movement and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parker et al., 2017</xref>). Although a Glu418Ala variant had no activity in our assays, consistent with its proposed role in coordinating the intracellular gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fowler et al., 2015</xref>), we observed reduced uptake of di-Ala in the Asn347Ala variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, this reduction was far more severe in the in vivo assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that this interaction is more important for transport of the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH peptide than di-Ala. This may reflect the requirement of Asn347 to coordinate the water molecule linking the peptide to the intracellular gate side chain Glu418, which in the case of the di-peptide may interact directly as in PepT<sub>St</sub>, lessening the requirement for the Asn347 interaction.</p><p>The co-crystal structure also identified the acyl chain portion of the thioalcohol group was accommodated within an extended pocket, formed near the extracellular side of the binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). To test the importance of this pocket on <italic>S-</italic>Cys-Gly-3M3SH transport, we made a Tyr411Trp variant, which would block the cavity. Uptake was noticeably reduced, but still measurable at ~19% compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The same mutation resulted in a similar large decrease in the biotransformation of <italic>S-</italic>Cys-Gly-3M3SH, while a Tyr411Ala mutation had wild-type biotransformation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). It is clear that the hydrophobic pocket in PepT<sub>Sh</sub> plays an important role in facilitating the recognition of the thioalcohol group in the binding pocket and, as discussed below, is a potential site for inhibitor design.</p><p>Taken together the current data lend further support to our model of an adaptable binding site within the POT family that can accommodate chemically diverse peptides and their derivatives through the use of both side chain and water mediated interactions with conserved residues and different specificity pockets to accommodate the different chemical side chains.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The production of malodour by humans is an evolutionary ancient olfactory process that likely was involved in mate selection and evolutionary processes that relied on chemical signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stoddart, 1990</xref>). Evidence for the microbial origins of chemical signalling molecules is also seen in other animals such as foxes, deer, cats and beetles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wyatt, 2003</xref>), but the details of this process in humans is less well understood. The thioalcohol 3M3SH, a major component of body odour, is produced in the human axilla as a glutathione-conjugated precursor and is processed to a unique dipeptide structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The discovery that axilla-isolated strains of <italic>S. hominis</italic>, <italic>S. lugdunensis</italic> and <italic>S. heamolyticus</italic> are able to produce 3M3SH prompted the search for the molecular basis for this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bawdon et al., 2015</xref>). While S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is a highly modified and uniquely human dipeptide, we reasoned that this moiety might dictate the uptake mechanism into malodour producing bacteria and here we identify a peptide transporter, PepT<sub>Sh</sub> (SH1446), from the POT family of secondary active transporters as being responsible for this process. Each of these strains have a POT family transporter that is closely related to PepT<sub>Sh</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), and we would predict they will also be able to uptake S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH.</p><p>The genetic intractability of <italic>S. hominis</italic> dictated that we use a biochemical approach to demonstrate that SH1446 is likely the sole route of uptake of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH. First, this staphylococci has a similar repertoire of peptide transporters in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, in that it has a single POT transporter and one Opp ABC transporter, and previous work in <italic>S. aureus</italic> has demonstrated that the POT transporter, DtpT, is essential for growth on dipeptides and some tripeptides, while the ABC transporter (Opp3) has a function in transporting longer oligopeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hiron et al., 2007</xref>). The use of L-Ala containing peptides as inhibitors in this study demonstrates an inhibitory effect on 3M3SH production that is consistent with the properties of a POT family transporter. Several attempts were made to genetically disrupt SH1446 in <italic>S. hominis</italic>, using tools developed for <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, but these were unsuccessful, most likely due to the presence of multiple species-specific restriction modification (RM) systems which render this organism, as with many other coagulase negative (CoNS) species, genetically intractable.</p><p>The specific role for POT transporters in the transport of these unusually modified dipeptides is supported from the inability of the <italic>E. coli</italic> ABC transporters for oligopeptides and dipeptides, Opp and Dpp, to recognise and transport S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH. Given that S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is effectively a dipeptide with a highly extended R-group on the first amino acid, it is noteworthy that only the promiscuous nature of the POT binding site is able to recognise this ligand. For OppA and DppA, the substrate binding proteins that initially recognise peptides transported by the ABC systems, the binding pocket is well defined and makes general main chain-main chain interactions to ensure that the protein can bind peptides in a sequence independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tame et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sleigh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sleigh et al., 1999</xref>). However, the pocket has evolved to accommodate regular amino acid side chains and the unusually large structure of the thioalcohol attachment would likely be sterically incompatible with recognition by either OppA or DppA. The data presented here further support the idea that POT transporters have an unusually promiscuous binding site that may play an evolutionary advantageous role in accepting modified peptides as substrates.</p><p>Recently, the human POT family transporters, PepT1 and PepT2, have gained additional attention due to their role in the absorption and retention of several important classes of drug molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 2013</xref>), including peptide modified pro-drugs. Similar to S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH, these pro-drugs are drug molecules conjugated to a peptide or amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandsch, 2013</xref>). Pro-drugs are able to compete with natural peptides for transport via PepT1 and PepT2, and are therefore actively transported into the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ganapathy et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Terada and Inui, 2012</xref>). The promiscuous nature of the POT family binding site has been shown to derive, in part, from their ability to recognise peptides in different conformations and through the availability of different specificity pockets, which are able to accommodate chemically different classes of peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newstead, 2017</xref>). Our results here provide the first evidence that specificity pockets can also accommodate exotic chemical extensions. The observation that water plays a role in facilitating the interaction between the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH peptide and PepT<sub>Sh</sub> may also indicate a broader role for water in facilitating the recognition of xenobiotic peptides. In particular, the observation that water may bridge interactions between the binding site and either the amino or carboxy group of the ligand would greatly increase the number of conformations a peptide could adopt in the transporter and still trigger proton coupled transport.</p><p>Finally, we can ask the questions, why do these bacteria transport S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH and can this process be inhibited to provide effective malodour control? The presumed biochemical pathway for breakdown of the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The firststep is the likely removal of the glycine by a dipeptidase and then the lyase reaction that cleaves the carbon-sulphur bond to release pyruvate and ammonia in addition to 3M3SH. The route of export of 3M3SH is unknown, but currently assumed to be diffusion across the bacterial inner membrane. The bacterium will gain a nutritional benefit from the catabolism of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH via the release of both nitrogen and carbon as glycine, pyruvate and ammonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), which may have been the evolutionary trigger for the adaptation to catabolise this chemical. Asian individuals with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ABCC11, the transporters involved in the secretion of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) have been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baumann et al., 2014b</xref>). Recently, a microbiological investigation of individuals with wild-type alleles of <italic>ABCC11</italic> compared to heterozygous and double mutant genotypes revealed that the proportion of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> sp. is higher in the underarms of humans that produce the precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Harker et al., 2014</xref>). While these studies are limited in that they do not provide species level identification, they are at least consistent with the idea that the production of the precursor positively correlates with the presence of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> sp. in the underarm. The discovery of the transporter and molecular understanding of the mode of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH binding now suggests a specific route to develop inhibitors of malodour production by directly inhibiting the transporter SH1446 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grice, 2014</xref>). Importantly, such intervention would not impact on the overall axillar microbiome, but instead specifically target the reduction in body odour production.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34995.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Overview of transport and intracellular biotransformation of <italic>S</italic>-Cys-Gly-3M3SH in <italic>Staphylococcus hominis</italic>.</title><p>1.

The protein:lipid mixture was rapidly diluted with 50 mM KPO<sub>4</sub> (pH 7.0) buffer to below the CMC value of DM. Proteoliposomes were harvested by ultracentrifugation (234,000 <italic>xg</italic>) for 120 min. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mM KPO<sub>4</sub> and dialysed overnight against 3L of 50 mM KPO<sub>4</sub> (pH 7.0). Proteoliposomes were recovered and subjected to three rounds of freeze thawing before storage at −80°C.</p><p>Proteoliposomes were thawed and harvested by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 <italic>g</italic>. The resulting pellet was carefully resuspended in INSIDE buffer (120 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM HEPES pH 6.8) and 1 mM pyranine (trisodium 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate). Proteoliposomes underwent eleven freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen before the sample was extruded through a 0.4 μm polycarbonate membrane and harvested by ultracentrifugation as before. Excess pyranine dye was removed with a Microspin G-25 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with INSIDE buffer without pyranine. For the assay, proteoliposomes were diluted into OUTSIDE buffer (120 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES (pH 6.8), 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>).</p><p>A Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a cuvette and magnetic flea was used to carry out the transport assay. Dual fluorescence excitation was set to 460/415 nm with emission at 510 nm. Transport was initiated with 1 μM valinomycin, the resulting data was exported and analysed using Prism (GraphPad Software). Transport data was normalised to one to facilitate comparison with data collected from multiple conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Competition assays</title><p>Proteoliposomes were harvested as before, the resulting pellet was resuspended in INSIDE buffer, subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen, extruded through a 0.4 μm polycarbonate membrane and harvested by ultracentrifugation once more. For the assay, proteoliposomes were diluted in external buffer (110 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub> and 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>) supplemented with 50 μM di-alanine peptide containing trace amounts of tritiated <sup>3</sup>H-di-alanine (specific activity 30 Ci/mmol) and the competing substrate at increasing concentrations as indicated. Competition assays were performed at 30°C, samples were taken at specified time points and transport was stopped by addition of 2 mL H<sub>2</sub>O. Proteoliposomes were immediately filtered onto a 0.22 μm cellulose filter (Merck Millipore) using a vacuum manifold and subsequently washed twice more with 2 mL H<sub>2</sub>O. The amount of peptide transported into the liposomes was calculated based on the specific activity for each peptide as detailed by the manufacturer and counting efficiency for the radioisotope in Ultima Gold (PerkinElmer) counted in a Wallac scintillation counter (<sup>3</sup>H, 45% counting efficiency). Transport assays were performed a minimum of three times to generate an overall mean and S.E.M.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Data availability</title><p>Atomic coordinates for the atomic models have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession numbers 6EXS.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the staff of beamlines I24 Diamond Light Source, UK, and ID23eh2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) for assistance.

This important pathogen has been studied for many decades and its genetic tractability has been facilitated by the generation of restriction/modification (RM) deficient strains such as RN4220 that will accept DNA from a wide range of sources. Even so, such DNA often requires passage through special <italic>E. coli</italic> strains modified to give the correct modification patterns that prevents their immediate degradation when transformed into <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Coagulase negative species of <italic>Staphylococci</italic> include the dominant skin bacterium <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, for which a few of the tools developed for <italic>S. aureus</italic> can work, however <italic>S. hominis</italic> is poorly studied coagulase negative species of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> for which no genetic tools have previously been tested or developed. We have tried extensively to genetically manipulate <italic>S. hominis</italic> for this study; however, due the presence of multiple RM systems (it contains at least 4 from our in silicoanalysis) the strain is extremely refractory to the introduction of any foreign DNA, an essential initial step for undertaking any genetic engineering. There is not a single example in the literature of a gene knock-out in this species and to develop the tools to do this is a major project in itself.</p><p>However, we fully appreciated the reviewers concern that the evidence that the identified transporter “is the only or even the main transporter of <italic>S</italic>-Cys-Gly-3M3SH in <italic>S. hominis</italic>” and we have undertaken significant additional experimentation to demonstrate this.</p><p>Our strategy is to examine the inhibitory profile of peptides to whole cell systems that are able to produce 3M3SH. In the initial submission, we did not clearly explain that <italic>S. hominis</italic> and other <italic>Staphylcocci</italic> only contain a single POT transporter (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). In addition to one POT they contain between 1-4 ABC transporters of the Opp family. An important experimental study on the relative function of these peptides transporters in <italic>S. aureus</italic> demonstrated that only one of the ABC transporters (Opp-3) was important for use of oligopeptides (from 3 to 8 amino acids), while the POT transporter was essential for growth on all dipeptides and some tripeptides. (Hiron et al., 2007). Therefore, we reasoned that if di- and tripeptides could inhibit the production of 3M3SH whereas free amino acids and longer peptides could not then this would be strong biochemical support that they were entering via the POT transporter that we characterised in this study.</p><p>Using whole-cell systems we measure the ability of different peptides to inhibit production of 3M3SH. In our <italic>E. coli</italic> system, where the expression of the <italic>S. hominis</italic> POT protein SH1446 is essential to observe 3M3SH production, the process is inhibited by both di- and tri-peptides but not L-Ala or tetra-Ala (presented as new data in Figure 2—figure supplement 4). The same four molecules were tested at the same concentrations against purified TnaA, the cytoplasmic enzyme that cleaves the peptide-linked thioalcohol to 3M3SH and they have no effect (Figure 2—figure supplement 5), demonstrating that the observed inhibition is at the level of transport.</p><p>We then repeated these experiments in <italic>S. hominis</italic> directly and observed a similar pattern. This is especially significant for the di-peptide, which specifically inhibits the POT transporter and not the ABC transporter, while we do also see inhibition with the tripeptide. The inhibition observed at the highest concentration of tetra-Ala is an artefact of the low pH required to keep the chemical in solution, which is impacting negatively on the <italic>S. hominis</italic> cells.</p><p>From these data we are now really confident that the SH1446 protein is the major route of CysGly-3M3SH uptake in <italic>S. hominis</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional specific comments are:</p><p>1) The affinity for the modified peptide appears to be relatively low in high μM range. Is this affinity compatible with levels of peptide likely encountered under physiological conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>The physiological concentrations of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH in the axilla are not known, so it is difficult to comment on this. We note that the enzyme that produces S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH from glutathionyl3M3SH, the human GGT1 enzyme, has been partially biochemically characterised (Baumann et al., 2014) and 1 mM substrate was used in their assays perhaps suggesting that the concentration of the precursors for secretion in the axilla cells is in this region, although a precise <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> for this enzyme was not determined. We would not expect the affinity of the transporter to be particularly high given that SH1446 is likely the main route by which the organism acquires dipeptides and some tripeptides, but speculate that it is high enough to be able to result in the small flux required to move S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH into the cell for its biotransformation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How evolutionarily broad is the ability of Staph. species to transport S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH? Are there PepT<sub>Sh</sub> homologues that are likely unable to transport the peptide because of a mutated binding site? If yes, are these species still able to take up the peptide?</p></disp-quote><p>The single POT transporter present in <italic>S. hominis</italic> is present in most <italic>Staphylococi</italic> and therefore we speculate that most other <italic>Staphylococci</italic> can transporter the precursor. In related work we have discovered a particular CS-lyase enzyme specific to the malodour producing species of <italic>Staphylococci</italic> that we speculate influences whether bacteria make 3M3SH or not. In our phylogenetic analysis of the POT transporters, we show that most <italic>Staphylococci</italic> species contain an orthologous <italic>PepT<sub>Sh</sub></italic> system, with some CoNS stains possessing two proteins. All these proteins contain the conserved motif ExxERF/YY, essential for protonation and peptide binding (1). As outlined in the paper the conserved features of <italic>PepT<sub>Sh</sub></italic> classify it as an archetypal POT family transporter, the unique hydrophobic pocket that specifically accommodates our physiologically relevant substrate allows for this di- tri peptide (DtpT) permease to transport modified dipeptides. Without detailed structural information, we are unable to compare this <italic>PepT<sub>Sh</sub></italic> with closely related organisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Authors may want to be more transparent in the limitations of this study as the major components of this analysis are inferred from non-skin colonizing organisms. For example, the genomic searches were targeted and could not obviate additional proteins playing alternative pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognise one of the major limitations of this study is the inability to genetically manipulate <italic>S. hominis</italic> to create functional knockouts. We have now provided more evidence in our <italic>E. coli</italic> model for the role of <italic>PepT<sub>Sh</sub></italic>in S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH transport in terms of selectively inhibiting <italic>PepT<sub>Sh</sub></italic>. The new data further supports the inhibition seen for both wild-type <italic>S. hominis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> overexpressing <italic>PepT<sub>Sh</sub></italic>. We are confident in our <italic>in silico</italic> analysis that <italic>S. hominis</italic> contains a single DtpT POT system, and that this is the peptide transport system required for the transport <italic>S-</italic>CysGly-3M3SH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Does the 50% reduction of model substrate 5BLCG in E. coli-ΔdtpB cells suggest the existence of one more importer? Such an importer would probably help to explain the discrepancies seen with some mutant activity between proteoliposomes and whole cells. Does such an importer have a homolog in Staphylococcus hominis?</p></disp-quote><p>The 50% reduction, and not total loss of activity in the <italic>E. coli-ΔdtpB</italic> strain is not surprising given that <italic>E. coli</italic> contains 4 POT transporters, named DtpA-D, each with distinct and overlapping substrate specificities that are involved in di- and tri-peptide uptake (Figure 2B) (2) and so the residual activity is almost certainly through the activity of one of these systems. We have a separate publication in preparation on the physiological functions of these 4 transporters and can report that a strain with all 4 deleted has completely lost the ability to produce 3M3SH (Bawdon et al., in preparation). This data further supports our hypothesis that the POT transporters are the sole route of Cys-Gly-3M3SH entry into bacteria, remembering that <italic>S. hominis</italic> has only a single POT system (SH1446 in <italic>S. hominis</italic>) and there are not multiple homologs like in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The average B-factor of the structure is 57.0, which is fairly low and indicates rigidity for the protein. If the residues at the substrate binding site are flexible as suggested by the authors, do they display higher B-factor values?</p></disp-quote><p>The flexibility we refer to in the manuscript concerned the ability of the binding site to recognise ligands in different binding modes and conformations, as demonstrated in the homologous transporter PepT<sub>St</sub> (5). We did not intend to infer that the side chains are structurally flexible in the structure – or indeed, are any more flexible that in other related POT family transporters. Indeed, S-CG-3M3SH is well coordinated in the binding site and has similar B-factors to the surrounding side chains (80 vs 54 Å<sup>2</sup>). We have now revised the wording in the manuscript.</p><p>“Taken together the current data lend further support to our model of an adaptablebinding site within the POT family that can accommodate chemically diverse peptides and their derivatives through the use of both side chain and water mediated interactions with conserved residues and different specificity pockets to accommodate the different chemical side chains.<bold>”</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) From the data presented, is it possible to estimate the turnover rate of the transporter?</p></disp-quote><p>We have calculated the turnover number for the transporter as follows:</p><p>Wild-Type 189 ± 37 nmol/min/mg</p><p>Y41A: 7.2 ± 0.58</p><p>Y41F 6.5 ± 0.40</p><p>N347A 42.9 ± 0.30</p><p>Y411W 34.0 ± 3.45</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34995.024</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34995-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>All the variants we infer mechanistic information from are functional, although clearly some changes have more negative effects than others.

One of the reviewers has requested that you estimate the turnover rate of the transporter. You have provided the values in your response in nmol/min/mg. I believe that the reviewer wanted to see the numbers in mol/mol/min. It seems to me that this number comes up to approximately 1 mol/mol/min for the wild type transporter (assuming MW ca 50 kDa) unless I made an arithmetic error. This seems a bit slow. Could you please verify the turnover rate and include a comment on it in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for giving us the opportunity to submit our revised manuscript titled “Structural basis of malodour precursor transport in the human axilla’. Our calculations put the turnover number at 10. The WT transport rate was determined as ~189 nmol/min/mg using 50uM di-alanine as substrate. The MW of PepT<sub>Sh</sub> is 55361Da, giving 18.06 nmol in 1mg. So, 189/18 = 10.5. I have included this the paper after we describe the IC<sub>50</sub> data:</p><p>“To understand the recognition of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH compared to natural peptides, we determined IC50 values using competition with 3H-di-alanine. The IC<sub>50</sub> value for tri-alanine, dialanine and Cys-Gly were 23.7 ± 3.4, 72.2 ± 9.7 and 115 ± 22.2 μM, respectively (Figure 3B), indicating that PepT<sub>Sh</sub> is able to recognise tri-Ala more favourably than di-Ala. However, for S-Cys- Gly-3M3SH the IC<sub>50</sub> value was 362 ± 21.8 μM, three-fold higher than the Cys-Gly peptide. The turnover number of PepT<sub>Sh</sub> for di-peptide transport was calculated as ~10 per minute. Our data therefore show that while PepT<sub>Sh</sub> can transport the modified peptide, the addition of the thioalcohol group on the cysteine side chain has substantially impaired the recognition and transport versus natural peptides.”</p><p>10 turnovers per minute is at the lower end of activity for the bacterial peptide transporters we have worked with. PepTSo in contrast is ~ 10x faster at 100 turnovers/minute for example. I am happy to comment on this if the referee thinks this may have an impact on the interpretation of our competition results. I must admit, we didn’t consider 10 to be abnormally slow when interpreting the assay results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
