However, the molecular organization, functions, regulation of ERMCS, and the physiological roles of altered ERMCSs are not fully understood in higher eukaryotes. We found that Miga, a mitochondrion located protein, markedly increases ERMCSs and causes severe neurodegeneration upon overexpression in fly eyes. Miga interacts with an ER protein Vap33 through its FFAT-like motif and an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease related Vap33 mutation considerably reduces its interaction with Miga. Multiple serine residues inside and near the Miga FFAT motif were phosphorylated, which is required for its interaction with Vap33 and Miga-mediated ERMCS formation. The interaction between Vap33 and Miga promoted further phosphorylation of upstream serine/threonine clusters, which fine-tuned Miga activity. Protein kinases CKI and CaMKII contribute to Miga hyperphosphorylation. MIGA2, encoded by the <italic>miga</italic> mammalian ortholog, has conserved functions in mammalian cells. We propose a model that shows Miga interacts with Vap33 to mediate ERMCSs and excessive ERMCSs lead to neurodegeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91754103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tong</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31622034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tong</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31571383</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tong</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National key research and developmental program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFC1001100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tong</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National key research and developmental program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFC1001500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tong</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004731</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LR16C070001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tong</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Increasing endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–mitochondria contact sites leads to neurodegeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intracellular organelles with membranes are characteristic features of eukaryotic cells.

ERMCSs also function as platforms for mitochondrial division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>), coupling mitochondrial DNA synthesis with mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lewis et al., 2016</xref>), autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamasaki et al., 2013</xref>), and mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Böckler and Westermann, 2014</xref>). Although ERMCSs changes have been reported in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schreiner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hedskog et al., 2013</xref>) and metabolic diseases such as obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arruda et al., 2014</xref>), there is no direct evidence indicating that defective ERMCSs led to disease conditions. The physiological consequences of defective ERMCSs were not clear.</p><p>The tethering molecules mediating ERMCSs in yeast form a protein complex called ER–mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES) which contains the outer membrane mitochondrial proteins Mdm10 and Mdm34, cytosolic protein Mdm12, and integral ER protein Mmm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lang et al., 2015</xref>). The ER protein complex EMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lahiri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Voss et al., 2012</xref>) and Ltc1/Lam6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elbaz-Alon et al., 2015</xref>) have also been reported to regulate contacts between ER and mitochondria. In mammalian cells, multiple proteins have been reported to tether ER and mitochondria. Mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC1) and the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel IP3R are a pair of molecules mediating ERMCSs in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Szabadkai et al., 2006</xref>). Although debatable, MFN2, the mitofusin that is required for mitochondrial outer membrane fusion, has been reported to tether ER and mitochondria through homotypic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Naon et al., 2016</xref>). ER protein VAPB and the mitochondrial protein PTPIP51 bind to each other to tether the two organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stoica et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies in flies revealed that Miro, a mitochondrial protein containing two GTPase domains and two Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing EF hand domains, regulates ERMCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, proteins such as PACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Simmen et al., 2005</xref>), Drp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>), and Atg14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamasaki et al., 2013</xref>) have also been reported to be localized to the ERMCSs. The loss of single pair of tethering molecules usually has mild effects to ERMCS, which is likely due to redundancy. The components and the organization of ERMCS are still not fully understood.</p><p>Many studies showed that ERMCSs are dynamic structures that undergo active remodeling upon different stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Valm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is not clear how the tethering molecules are regulated in response to different cellular needs.</p><p>Our previous study identified a family of mitochondrial proteins called Mitoguardin (Miga) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Miga contains a function unknown domain that is highly conserved from <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to humans. Miga localizes on the outer membrane of mitochondria and promotes mitochondrial fusion through interaction with mitoPLD, a divergent family member of the phospholipase D family that is required for the fusion of mitochondrial outer membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2011</xref>). Loss of <italic>Miga</italic> leads to fragmented mitochondria and reduced mitochondrial functions. Flies lacking <italic>Miga</italic> do not grow beyond the early pupal stage. The mosaic eyes in flies with <italic>Miga</italic> mutant clones degenerate with aging. Mammals have two Miga proteins: MIGA1 and MIGA2. Mice with single or double knockout (KO) of <italic>Miga1</italic> and <italic>Miga2</italic> are viable. Both <italic>Miga2</italic> and <italic>Miga1/2</italic> KO mice showed reduced body weight and body fat. Under high-fat diet consumption, <italic>Miga2</italic> KO mice has minimal lipidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Podrini et al., 2015</xref>). In a combined association study, an SNP located in <italic>Miga1</italic> was shown to be associated with subscapular skin-fold thickness in humans and back fat thickness in pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the female <italic>Miga1/2</italic> KO mice were shown to be sub-fertile with reduced ovarian activity, oocyte quality, and embryo developmental potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Miga2</italic> KO mice also has immune defects and showed severe depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). A most recent study showed that MIGA2 binds VAP proteins in ER and is involved in forming contacts between mitochondria, the ER, and lipid droplets. They also demonstrated that MIGA2 is required for adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Freyre et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we found that Miga interact with Vap33 to mediate ERMCSs. Miga is phosphorylated by casein kinase I (CKI) and Ca²<sup>+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) at multiple sites, which affect the interaction between Miga and Vap33 and fine-tuned Miga activity. The extra ERMCSs caused by overexpression of Miga or other tethering molecules led to severe neurodegeneration, which might shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Miga overexpression led to increased ERMCS and severe retinal degeneration</title><p>Our previous studies indicated that a mitochondrial outer membrane protein Miga is required for neuronal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).

Miga has a conserved sequence that is similar to the FFAT motif but with two acidic amino acids changed to serine. We prepared an FFAT motif mutant form of Miga (Miga<sup>FM</sup>) with the 247<sup>th</sup> phenylalanine and the 249<sup>th</sup> serine residues changed to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Miga<sup>FM</sup> failed to bind to Vap33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We expressed a genomic rescue construct of Miga (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) that contains the genomic fragment of Miga and a 3 × HA tag fused at the C-terminus just before the stop codon of Miga and a Flag tagged Vap33 in S2 cells and performed IP experiments. Since the genomic rescue construct of Miga contains the regulatory sequences from Miga locus, it likely expresses Miga in an endogenous level. Indeed, the level Miga-HA was much less than the level of overexpressed ones. We found that Miga and Vap33 could pull down each other in this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We expressed both wildtype and mutant Miga with Vap33 in fly fat body tissues. Vap33 had a diffused pattern when it was expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Both Miga and Miga<sup>FM</sup> showed mitochondrial patterns when they were expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and H</xref>). When Vap33 and Miga were co-expressed, Vap33 was recruited by Miga and the two proteins were co-localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, Miga<sup>FM</sup> expression failed to recruit Vap33 and its own pattern did not change upon Vap33 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). To test whether Miga overexpression indeed could increase ERMCSs, we examined the fly fat body tissues with TEM. In the wildtype larvae fat body tissues, around 12% mitochondria had contacts with ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and Q</xref>) and ERMCS length occupied about 12% of the mitochondrial perimeter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and R</xref>). The average distance between ER and mitochondria at the ERMCSs is around 22 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and S</xref>). Vap33 overexpression alone increased the mitochondrial proportion that have contacts with ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and Q</xref>). However, it did not significantly change the ERMCS length for each mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and R</xref>). The distance between ER and mitochondria at the ERMCSs in fat body slightly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and S</xref>). Miga overexpression not only dramatically increased the mitochondrial frequency associated with ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L and Q</xref>), but also increased the average ERMCS length for each mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L and R</xref>). It also greatly reduced the proximity between ER and mitochondria at the ERMCSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L and S</xref>). Expressing Miga together with Vap33 further increased the ERMCS incidence and length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M and Q–R</xref>) suggesting that Miga and Vap33 together could establish ERMCSs. Vap33 RNAi did not significantly affect ERMCS formation in fly fat body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N and Q–R</xref>). However, ERMCS increase caused by Miga overexpression was canceled by Vap33 RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O and Q–R</xref>). Similarly, Miga<sup>FM</sup> overexpression failed to affect ERMCS formation in fat body tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P–S</xref>). These data suggest that the interaction between Miga and Vap33 through FFAT motif is critical for establishing ERMCSs. When Miga was overexpressd, we observed enhanced mitochondrial fusion and increased mitochondrial length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). However, when Miga<sup>FM</sup> was overexpressed, the mitochondria length was significantly shorter than that in the wild-type Miga overexpressed tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The interaction between Vap33 and Miga is required for Miga overexpression induced neurodegeneration</title><p>Since the interaction between Vap33 and Miga is required for establishing ERMCSs, we wondered whether it is also required for the eye degeneration caused by Miga overexpression.

There is no homolog of PTPIP51 in flies.

PTPIP51 overexpressed eyes had reduced rhabdomere numbers and sizes from day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O, U and V</xref>). The degeneration was progressively worse with aging. In the 30-day-old flies, most ommatidia lost all rhabdomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3W</xref>), which is similar to Miga overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3R and W</xref>). We also designed a molecular tether with a mitochondrial localization signal from human mitochondrial protein Akap1, a linker, an RFP, and 39 amino acids from the FFAT motif region of Miga (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The tether interacted with Vap33 nicely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

When this tether was expressed in the eyes, it also led to reduced rhabdomere numbers and sizes in 1-day-old flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P, U and V</xref>) and the majority of rhabdomeres were lost in the 30 day old flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3T and W</xref>).

The phosphatase-treated group showed only one band that run faster than the lowest band in the untreated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that the upper shift of the bands was due to Miga hyperphosphorylation. Due to technical difficulty, one large peptide with multiple serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) was missing in the mass spectrometry analysis. Since hyperphosphorylation usually takes place in clustered sites, we defined seven Ser/Thr clusters and performed the mutagenesis at one cluster per time to examine whether the upper shift of Miga was affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>). Consistent with the mass spectrometry data, mutated Ser/Thr in clusters I, II, III, and V but not in clusters IV, VI, and VII affected the Miga band shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>). Indeed, mutating Ser/Thr to Ala in I, II, and III clusters together abolished the shift of the upper band and mutating Ser/Thr to Glu in these clusters mimic the upper shift of Miga (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Mutating Ser/Thr in cluster V affected both upper and lower band shifts, suggesting that cluster V phosphorylation accounted for Miga basal phosphorylation.

We overexpressed CaMKII along with Miga and examined whether the addition of CaMKII changes the mobility shift of Miga. Considering that the mobility shift might be small, we used phospho-tag gel that increases the mobility shift of the phospho-proteins to detect the band shift of Miga. With co-expression of CaMKII, we observed slight up-shift of both lower and upper bands of Miga (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We also detected a slight band shift reduction for both lower and upper bands of Miga when CaMKII was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).

The ERMCSs (10–30 nm), especially the tight contacts (about 10 nm), are rare in the wild type fly fat body. It might be the reason for the difficulty to detect ERMCS reduction in this tissue. We introduced a <italic>Miga</italic> genomic rescue fragment with point mutations in the FFAT motif in <italic>Miga</italic> mutant animals in this study. Although it rescued the fatality of <italic>Miga</italic> mutant, the rescued animals were short lived and had eye degeneration. It suggested that the interaction between Miga and Vap33 had physiological importance. It is interesting that the rescued animals always losing R7/R8 upon aging but not other photoreceptor cells, while the loss of photoreceptor cells in <italic>Miga</italic> mutant animals during aging did not have preference to any particular photoreceptor cells. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has compound eyes composed with repeat units call ommatidia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chou et al., 1999</xref>). Each ommatidia consists of eight photoreceptors: the outer photoreceptor cells R1–R6 and the inner photoreceptor cells R7 and R8. The R1–R6 cells express a single opsin Rh1 and are involved in image formation and motion detection. The R7 cells express one of two opsins Rh3 and Rh4. The R8 cells are localized beneath the R7 and express one of the three opsins: Rh3, Rh5, and Rh6. R7 and R8 cells are involved in color vision and polarized light detection. However, we did not observe obvious difference of ERMCSs between the outer and inner photoreceptor cells. Further investigation is required to understand why the FFAT motif in Miga is particularly important for the inner photoreceptor cells. Miga<sup>FM</sup> rescued the lethality of Miga mutants, suggesting that at least some functions of Miga do not need its FFAT motif. The study in mammalian cells indicated that MIGA2 links mitochondria to lipid droplets (LD) through its C-terminal region and is required for adipocyte differentiation. The LD interaction region of MIGA2 is conserved in fly Miga protein. It needs further investigation whether Miga plays a role in lipid metabolism in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>It has been reported that the ERMCSs marked the mitochondrial fission positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>). However, presenting ERMCS is not sufficient to induce mitochondrial fission. It has been observed that both mitochondrial fission and fusion could happen at ERMCSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). When Miga is overexpressed, we observed increased number of mitochondria with ERMCSs, increased ERMCS length per mitochondrion, and decreased distance between ER and mitochondria at the ERMCSs. Instead of promoting mitochondrial fission, we observed enhanced mitochondrial fusion and dramatically increased mitochondrial length when Miga was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, when Miga<sup>FM</sup> was overexpressed, there is no increase of ERMCSs and the mitochondria length was also significantly shorter than that in the wildtype Miga overexpressed tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). It has been suggested that Miga function in mitochondrial fusion might be coupled with its function in mediating ERMCSs.</p><p>In this study, we found that Miga was hyperphosphorylated at multiple sites. The phosphorylation on the cluster V was essential for the interaction between Miga and VAP protein and the interaction mediated ERMCS establishment. Upon cell stress stimuli, such as starvation, the phosphorylation was increased and so was the ERMCSs. Therefore, the phosphorylation in the cluster V provides a switch to modulate ERMCSs and the subsequent communications between ER and mitochondria. In addition to the cluster V, Miga was also phosphorylated at multiple sites in the clusters I, II, and III. The phosphorylation of these sites was enhanced by the interaction between Miga and Vap33. However, the phosphorylation of these sites did not affect Miga ability to form ERMCSs. Our data indicated that the phosphorylation in the clusters I, II, and III could enhance Miga activity. It would be interesting to know how the phosphorylation affects Miga activity. Although phosphatase treatment abolished the higher molecular weight bands seen in western blot analysis, we cannot exclude that another unknown post-translation modification might also contribute to the molecular weight changes in Miga.</p><p>In this study, we identified that CKI and CaMKII were required for Miga phosphorylation. ERMCSs play a key role in calcium flux between ER and mitochondria. The activity of CaMKII is regulated by Ca²<sup>+</sup>/calmodulin. Therefore, the local concentration of calcium might function as a trigger to modulate CaMKII activity and further modify the ERMCSs through the phosphorylation of Miga. We found that the reduction of mobility shift of Miga upon the RNAi of CaMKII was much smaller than that in the cluster V mutants, suggesting that other kinases are involved in the phosphorylation of the cluster V in Miga. We did not perform experiments to test whether CKI or CamKII could modify Miga overexpression phenotypes in fly eyes because of the shutdown of facilities during COVID-19 pandemic. It would be interesting to know whether these kinases are required for Miga overexpression mediated eye degeneration.</p><p>It has been reported that presenilins and γ-secretase activity are concentrated in the ERMCSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Del Prete et al., 2017</xref>). Increased ERMCSs have also been observed in the fibroblasts from patients with sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Area-Gomez et al., 2012</xref>). However, whether ERMCS change is the cause or the consequence of the diseases was not known. Our data provided evidence that enhanced ERMCSs by Miga overexpression or other means cause severe degeneration in neurons and muscles. It provided a direct evidence that enhanced ERMCSs is devastating to the cellular homeostasis and leads to neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Identify Vap33, an ER protein, as a binding partner for Miga, a mitochondrial protein. They show that vap33 binds Miga through a FFAT motif. When overexpressing Miga, this causes a massive increase in ER mitochondria contacts, which is dependent upon binding to Vap33. This increase in contacts, whether it is caused by Miga overexpression of by more artificial means (expression of a mammalian or completely artificial tethering protein) is toxic for omatidial development. The authors also show that while loss of miga is lethal, the lethality can be complemented by the expression of a Miga mutant form unable to bind vap33, indicating that Miga's essential role is not via Vap33 binding and the promotion of ER-mitochondria contacts. Moreover, lack of Miga or Vap33 has little impact on existing ER-mitochondria contacts. Finally, the authors show that Miga's FFAT (two phenylalanines in acidic tract) motif is unconventional, in that it is not really acidic, but can be made acidic through phosphorylation of serine residues, thus tuning affinity to Vap33.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>As you will read from the attached reviews, the works was deemed interesting, yet insufficiently supported at places.

The study in mammalian cells indicated that MIGA2 links mitochondria to lipid droplets (LD) through its C-terminal region and is required for adipocyte differentiation.

The difference between the original Figure 5C and Figure 5F was because of the different sample preparation procedures. The samples in original 5C were prepared by adding SDS loading buffer directly to the pelleted cells. The samples in original Figure 5F were prepared by using lysis buffer to treat cells for 1hour, centrifuging for 10 minutes with high speed, collecting 20 uL supernatant and then adding SDS loading buffer (the rest of the supernatant was collected for IP experiments). The long preparation procedure for original Figure 5F likely reduced the phosphorylation in the protein samples. Now we changed Figure 5F with a new image in which the samples were prepared in the same way as Figure 5C. Since the phosphatase activity is very high in the lysates and the p-Miga is often de-phosphorylated. It is meaningful to compare the bands intensity and shift for the samples prepared side by side but not between different experiments.</p><p>Figure 5G and H were phostag gel, the band shift in both images indicating CamKII might contribute to the phosphorylation of Miga. The overall intensity was low in the CamKII RNAi groups. We repeated the experiment several times, the RNAi group always have lower expression of Miga (both higher bands and lower bands). It needs further investigation to know why the expression level of Miga was low in the CaMKII RNAi group. Never the less, the mobility shift of both the lower bands and the upper bands was slower than the controls, indicating CaMKII contributes to the mobility shift in the control cells. We changed the image of Figure 5H with a better exposure time to show both bands of Miga.

We tried to detect the phosphorylation of endogenous Miga with this antibody and fail to obtained positive signals with or without HBSS treatments. Therefore, the p-Miga signals detected in MIga-V5 expression samples likely is the phosphorylated Miga-V5 protein. RNAi CAMKII did not change the level of p-Miga significantly. We think CAMKII might phosphorylate cluster V on the other sites rather than the S246 and S249 in the FFAT motif recognized by the phosph-specific antibody of Miga.

The reduction of organelle contacts including ERMCSs might contribute to the disease conditions in the ALS patients.” In the revised manuscript, we further emphasized that both reduction and increase of ERMCS are devastating to the cellular homeostasis and leads to neurodegeneration.</p><p>For a similar reason described above, we did not perform the experiments suggested here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “Miga was phosphorylated at multiple clusters”.
