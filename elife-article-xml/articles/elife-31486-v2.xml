Multivalent interactions of modular binding domains and their target motifs can drive phase separation. However, forces promoting the more common phase separation of intrinsically disordered regions are less understood, with suggested roles for multivalent cation-pi, pi-pi, and charge interactions and the hydrophobic effect. Known phase-separating proteins are enriched in pi-orbital containing residues and thus we analyzed pi-interactions in folded proteins. We found that pi-pi interactions involving non-aromatic groups are widespread, underestimated by force-fields used in structure calculations and correlated with solvation and lack of regular secondary structure, properties associated with disordered regions. We present a phase separation predictive algorithm based on pi interaction frequency, highlighting proteins involved in biomaterials and RNA processing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein phase separation</kwd><kwd>protein interactions</kwd><kwd>pi interactions</kwd><kwd>protein structure</kwd><kwd>prediction</kwd><kwd>bioinformatics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>114985</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Forman-Kay</surname><given-names>Julie Deborah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>06718</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Forman-Kay</surname><given-names>Julie Deborah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000015</institution-id><institution>Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>703477</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Forman-Kay</surname><given-names>Julie Deborah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Statistics on the frequencies of pi interactions in folded protein structures enable successful prediction of intrinsically disordered protein phase separation, with clear implications for a physical understanding of cellular organization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein phase separation has important implications for cellular organization and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitrea and Kriwacki, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Su et al., 2016</xref>), RNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sfakianos et al., 2016</xref>), biological materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>) and pathological aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>). For some systems, multivalent interactions between modular binding domains and cognate peptide motifs underlie phase-separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banjade and Rosen, 2014</xref>). However, many phase-separating proteins contain large intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) with low complexity sequences that do not form stable folded structure (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitrea and Kriwacki, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chong and Forman-Kay, 2016</xref>]), including the Nephrin intracellular domain (NICD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pak et al., 2016</xref>), polyglutamine tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crick et al., 2013</xref>), tropoelastin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>), FUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kato et al., 2012</xref>), Ddx4 and the homologous LAF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</xref>) and FG-repeat nucleoporins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frey et al., 2006</xref>). The underlying physical principles and chemical interactions that drive phase separation in these IDRs are not well understood. Multivalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pierce et al., 2016</xref>) electrostatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2016</xref>) and cation-pi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sherrill, 2013</xref>) interactions and the hydrophobic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>) have all been proposed to contribute to IDR phase separation, the latter suggested to be dominant for tropoelastin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luan et al., 1990</xref>). For Ddx4, electrostatic interactions between charge blocks has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). The abundance of Phe-Gly/Gly-Phe and Arg-Gly/Gly-Arg dipeptides in Ddx4 and the fact that Phe to Ala mutations inhibit phase separation also point to pi-pi and/or cation-pi interactions. The Phe-Gly repeats in FG nucleoporins similarly indicate pi-pi interactions, but the lack of aromatics in elastins and designed phase-separating sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Quiroz and Chilkoti, 2015</xref>) seems to suggest that they are not essential. Clearly, a number of physical interactions may be sufficient for driving phase separation without being universally necessary, and a better understanding of these interactions is needed to define the balance of forces biological systems use for driving protein phase transitions.</p><p>Although pi-pi interactions are commonly associated with aromatic rings, where interaction energy is thought to involve induced quadrupolar electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sherrill, 2013</xref>), π (pi) orbitals of bonded sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized atoms are also found in peptide backbone amide groups and sidechain amide, carboxyl or guanidinium groups. Sidechains with pi bonds include Tyr, Phe, Trp, His, Gln, Asn, Glu, Asp and Arg. Small residues with relatively exposed backbone peptide bonds include Gly, Ser, Thr and Pro. Notably, low complexity IDRs implicated in phase separation of FUS, EWS, hnRNPA1, TIA-1, TDP-43 and the RNA Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitrea and Kriwacki, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kato et al., 2012</xref>) are very enriched in these residues that have high potential for formation of pi-pi interactions, relative to average occurrence in the proteome. Even elastins, which lack sidechain pi groups but have Val-Pro-Gly-Xxx-Gly repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>), are highly enriched in Pro and Gly residues with exposed pi-containing peptide backbones.</p><p>Given the high frequency of aromatic residues, arginine and glutamine in many phase-separating sequences, we were motivated to investigate the structural behavior of pi-pi interactions in order to better understand how their observed physical behavior relates to their potential role in phase separation. We first characterized the frequency and correlations of pi interactions in a non-redundant protein set from the RCSB protein data bank (PDB) of folded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berman et al., 2000</xref>). We discovered that planar pi-pi contacts involving a non-aromatic group, including those involving the backbone amide group, are the predominant form of pi-pi interaction, and we showed that planar pi-contact rates can be predicted from sequence. Then, we tested the relevance of these planar pi-pi interactions to phase separation by training a phase separation predictor using only these expected pi-contact rates. We then demonstrated that three of the predicted proteins, FMR1, a multifunctional RNA-binding protein and a neuronal granule component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">El Fatimy et al., 2016</xref>), engrailed-2, a DNA</p><p>-binding homeobox protein, and the pAP isoform of the Human cytomegalovirus capsid scaffolding protein phase separate in isolation in vitro. Analysis of predictions for the full human proteome suggests strong phase-separation propensities for proteins involved in biomaterials and RNA processing, with likely regulation by splicing and post-translational modifications (PTMs).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Prevalence of Pi contacts in the PDB</title><p>To determine the frequency of pi-pi interactions and better understand their nature and physical properties, we performed a bioinformatics analysis of folded proteins. We searched the PDB for pi-pi interactions by measuring contact distances between planar surfaces and comparing planar orientations (see Materials and methods), choosing to focus on interactions involving pi-orbital planar surfaces as this category shows the most enrichment over expectations, both in terms of overall frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>) and in relation to resolution. Face-to-face planar pi-pi contacts were defined using a simple distance- and orientation-based metric designed to consistently capture this enrichment across diverse sp<sup>2</sup>-containing groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A,B,C</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis was originally intended to explore the known interactions of aromatic sidechains with each other and with arginine, but in order to provide a control group we defined our contact parameters in a way that allowed us to treat all sp<sup>2</sup> groups in the same fashion. In high-resolution (≤1.8 Å) and low R-factor (≤0.18) protein crystal structures (N = 5718), we found that planar pi-pi stacking interactions involving non-aromatic atoms outnumber aromatic-aromatic stacking interactions by approximately 13 to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>) suggesting that, while aromatic sidechains may be enriched in stacking interactions relative to their frequency, there is a more general role for pi-contacts that involve non-aromatic atoms. The vast majority of planar pi-orbital contacts in proteins involve one of five non-aromatic sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized sidechains or the peptide bond itself. Fully 36% of observed pi-pi stacking interactions do not involve an aromatic partner, with face-to-face planar contacts between different backbone peptide bonds occurring as often as aromatic face-to-face contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Across the high-resolution set, we observe that 58% of heavy atoms are sp<sup>2</sup>, of which 10.5% are involved in pi-stacking. Furthermore, 28% of heavy atoms that are not directly involved in pi-stacking are found within van der Waals (VDW) contact distance (4.9 Å) of atoms that are. Thus, planar pi-pi interactions form a common feature of the protein chemical environment. Comparisons to previous work showing that aromatic-aromatic interactions in proteins are instead biased toward face-to-edge or parallel displaced geometries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hunter et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martinez and Iverson, 2012</xref>) are complicated by the observations that VDW contacts between aromatic sidechains coincide with face-to-face pi-pi stacking to a third sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized group 49% of the time, and that parallel displacement often accommodates an additional non-aromatic pi-contact to the same planar surface.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31486.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PDB statistics for planar pi-pi interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average number of sp<sup>2</sup> groups involved in planar pi-pi contacts per 100 protein residues binned by crystal structure resolution.

We observe that the increase in planar pi-pi contacts to arginine at higher resolution comes at the expense of non-planar VDW contacts (panels A, (<bold>C and E</bold>). In contrast, contacts made to an arbitrary surface plane at the end of lysine sidechains do not show this increase in planar orientation with resolution (panels B, <bold>D and F</bold>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31486-fig1-figsupp2-v2"/></fig></fig-group><p>Analysis of protein structures showed that the frequencies of planar pi interactions strongly correlate with the power of the experimental data to constrain the structure and with the fit to the data. We identified a linear relationship between contact frequencies and the resolution of crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We identify a similar dependence of contact frequency on the relative number of sidechain-specific distance constraints in NMR structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2A</xref>) and confirm that the dependence on resolution persists for identical sequences solved multiple times at different resolutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2B</xref>). These data suggest that the relative importance of pi-pi interactions are underestimated in the force-fields that are used in the structure calculations and thus appear more frequently in structures that are heavily constrained by experimental observations. In addition, pi-pi contact frequencies for amino acid and other small sp<sup>2</sup>-containing ligands bound to proteins (including non-aromatic ligands) are higher than the frequencies observed for the same chemical group found within proteins, despite or perhaps because of their relative freedom of movement (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>).</p><p>To examine whether sp<sup>2</sup>-containing sidechains engage in stacking behavior beyond what could be expected for average contact frequencies and overall packing considerations, we determined sidechain contacts to backbone peptide groups, focusing on the percentage of VDW contacts (with two or more pairs of atoms within 4.9 Å) which satisfy our planar-pi criterion, and then compared the frequencies observed for sp<sup>2</sup> sidechain groups to those observed for planar surfaces on the terminal end of sp<sup>3</sup> sidechains, using atom groups as listed in the Materials and methods section. This metric addresses the issue of amino acid composition effects by taking advantage of the even distribution of backbone groups and allows for normalization of contact frequency for sidechains of different size. Enrichment of sp<sup>2</sup> planar contacts relative to sp<sup>3</sup> is clearly observed for all sp<sup>2</sup> sidechains except Asn and Gln, which our previous analysis showed are more likely to form contacts with their backbone than with their sidechains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further analysis of the relative frequency of planar pi VDW contacts to other VDW contacts as a function of resolution demonstrates that for some contact types the increased pi-contact frequencies with increasing resolution (lower values in Å) are at the expense of decrease in other VDW contacts, suggesting that these contacts represent a specific geometric constraint present in the experimental data, rather than an overall increase in VDW contact frequency at higher resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Aromatic groups are known to have favorable interactions with other aromatics, with the peptide backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tóth et al., 2001</xref>), and with charged groups. We observed that the guanidine group of arginine is either the first or second most likely planar pi-stacking partner for any given aromatic sidechain, a phenomenon previously described as cation-pi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sherrill, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martinez and Iverson, 2012</xref>). However, we also observed planar stacking interactions between non-aromatic groups of all kinds, including both anion-to-anion and cation-to-cation, with relative frequencies shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>. Surprisingly, 3.6% of arginine sidechains are found in direct, parallel pi-stacking contact with another arginine, despite repulsive charges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that these guanidinium interactions are better described as pi-pi, rather than cation-pi (example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31486.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Examples of planar pi-pi contacts in folded protein structures.</title><p>Pi-pi interactions shown using rods to describe the normal vector of the plane.

To test the degree to which contact frequencies in solved structures derive from experimental constraints, rather than the force fields used, we explored how well planar pi interactions are captured by the simple energy functions used in certain protein modeling protocols. We examined a few different modeling protocols by either running available methods or downloading pre-computed datasets (see Materials and methods). In general, planar pi-pi contacts were lost during simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3A</xref>) and energy minimization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3B</xref>). In one older molecular dynamics simulation of folded proteins, made available for 100 proteins via Dynameomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kehl et al., 2008</xref>), 90% of the planar pi-pi contacts found in the starting structures were lost during simulation, with the majority being lost within the first few simulation steps. Similarly, modeling of the energetic effect of mutations, the ∆∆G of unfolding, using both FOLDX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schymkowitz et al., 2005</xref>) and Rosetta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kellogg et al., 2011</xref>), shows decreased prediction accuracy at positions involved in pi-contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3C-F</xref>), based on comparison to a reference set of ∆∆G measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bava et al., 2004</xref>). These observed issues in modeling pi-contacts may be overcome by more recent and sophisticated energy functions, but our results are consistent with the inherent energetic importance of planar pi interactions, rather than their observation being due to simple force fields used in refining protein structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Enrichment of pi-pi contacts in catalytic, capping and RNA-binding sites</title><p>For exploring the contribution of pi contacts to general structural and functional properties of proteins, we examined contact enrichment for sp<sup>2</sup> groups found in a diverse range of interactions.

Planar pi-pi interactions, in contrast, cannot be formed with water, but often involve groups with hydrogen bond acceptors and donors; thus, we predicted that the frequency of pi-pi interactions in proteins could be increased in more solvated environments. To test this, we identified high-resolution structures with an abundance of solved water and then counted the observed solvent interactions by the number of water oxygen atoms within a broad VDW contact radius (4.9 Å) to each residue. We saw an unambiguous positive correlation between the number of water contacts and the probability that a residue is involved in a planar pi-pi-contact, with a significant increase in average probability observed for each additional water contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), climbing even as the average number of protein:protein VDW contacts declines. This relationship is true for the general case (unspecified residue identity) and is also individually true for each of the nine residues with pi orbital-containing sidechains. However, both the contact frequencies and the amino acid frequencies themselves increase with a greater dependence on solvation for non-aromatic residues, especially for the charged amino acids Arg, Glu and Asp, such that non-aromatic contacts become the dominant form of interaction at high solvation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These led us to hypothesize that the number of pi orbitals available to make long-range multivalent contacts is an important feature in determining whether a disordered protein region can phase separate and, thus, that the sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridization of the arginine sidechain is more important to phase separation than its charge. We tested this hypothesis using the N-terminal 236 residues of Ddx4, an intrinsically disordered region that contains both Arg-Gly and Phe-Gly dipeptide sequences and that can phase separate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nott et al., 2015</xref>). We removed pi-character while leaving charge intact by replacing all 24 Arg residues with Lys. Matching our expectation, this protein region fails to phase separate under the conditions characterized for the wild-type Ddx4 sequence, even at concentrations of 400 mg/ml, 200 times higher than the lowest concentration for which phase separation is observed for the wild type, and four times higher than observed for constructs with an equivalent mass change from mutating nine phenylalanine residues to alanine (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table4">Appendix 1—table 4</xref>).

We recognize that multiple physical interactions can contribute to driving phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brangwynne et al., 2015</xref>), but our goal was not to predict subtle differences in phase separation propensity or quantitative phase diagrams. Instead, we aimed to merely classify proteins as having the potential to self-associate under particular biological conditions or not, as a test of our hypothesis of the involvement of planar pi interactions. In this exercise, we define phase-separating proteins as those that for presumed functional reasons self-associate in a way that is at least transiently reversible and dynamic, allowing for the protein to self-concentrate as a function of available protein concentration, temperature or other condition. This basic definition does not cover the complexity of the phase diagram, merely the ability to reversibly self-concentrate, and does not consider competing transitions, such as irreversible aggregation and precipitation, which have typically been selected against in the natural sequences on which the predictor is designed to be used.</p><p>Using this definition, we applied a constrained training approach divided into two stages. In the first stage, we required accurate prediction of contact propensities for folded proteins, using sequence propensities for both local and non-local contacts. For this aim, we developed a statistical method for predicting the expected number of contacts given a protein sequence, using frequencies taken from the PDB, splitting observations by distinct residue pairs with varying sequence separation and applying a statistical comparison of the full list of pairs associated with a given sp<sup>2</sup> group to calculate expectations (see Materials and methods).

We used a stochastic optimization approach to find optimal weights and sequence window normalizations for converting pi-contact frequency predictions into a score function able to discriminate known phase-separating proteins from sequences found in the PDB. The individual components weighted and normalized include: (i) short- and long-range contacts as defined by residue pair sequence separation ≤4 or &gt;4, respectively, (ii) sidechain groups vs. the backbone peptide bond, (iii) absolute predicted frequency vs. normalized frequency compared to the specific group, and (iv) number of carbon atoms in the specific group. In constraining this stage of the test, we defined the fixed goal for optimization as the PDB normalized z-score difference between the highest scoring 1% of the PDB and the lowest scoring member of the phase separation training set. We then trained until reaching a plateau, and at that point we finalized the score, running a single validation test against a testing set of 62 proteins directly associated with phase separation in the literature. This testing set can be divided into three subsets by the nature of the evidence available: (i) sufficient for in vitro phase separation as a purified single component (which matches the training set), (ii) evidence of in vitro phase separation involving a multi-component system (e.g., phase separates on the addition of RNA), without evidence of independent phase separation, and (iii) direct evidence of in cell phase separation (where the protein itself has been labeled and dynamic exchange demonstrated by FRAP or similar methods) without evidence of in vitro phase separation or sufficiency.</p><p>We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots comparing predictions of phase-separating proteins within the test set against predictions of phase-separating proteins in the human proteome to assay the ability of the predictor to rank known positives against the members of a set that we assume is primarily negative; the area under the curve (AUC) measurement describes the ability to discriminate between sets. For the human proteome as the negative set, we show an AUC of 0.88 ± 0.02 measured using the entire testing set as a positive, 0.93 ± 0.01 if we exclude sequences which only phase separate in complex with other polymers, and 0.96 ± 0.01 if we restrict to the 32 test set sequences that match the sufficiency criteria used for selecting the training set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7A</xref>). These measurements are complicated by the potential for homology between test set and training set proteins. To control for this, we also measured discrimination using another positive set of the 59 artificial sequences designed and shown to phase separate by the Chilkoti lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Quiroz and Chilkoti, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">MacEwan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simon et al., 2017</xref>) (details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1C</xref>), showing an AUC of 0.86 ± 0.03 against the human proteome as a negative set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>Interpreting these AUC values is complicated by the fact that the true positive rate of the human proteome is unknown, and our analysis will treat unknown phase-separating proteins as false positives, inaccurately decreasing the AUC.

This increase is matched by an increase in the percentage of human proteins in the same range, from 2.3% to 13.1%. Even though the score is trained for discrimination against folded proteins, we do not see a systematic increase in the scores of all disordered human proteins. Comparison against a top performing sequence homology-based disorder predictor (Disopred3, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones and Cozzetto, 2015</xref>]) and a physics-based disorder predictor (IUPRED-Long [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dosztányi et al., 2005a</xref>]) shows that disorder predictors are better at discriminating disordered proteins from the PDB and the human proteome, while the PScore is consistently better at identifying phase-separating proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table5">Appendix 1—table 5</xref>). The majority of the proteins in our phase separation test set show disordered character, and the analysis shows that, while PScore does correlate with disorder, it only highlights a subset of disordered proteins and does not reflect a general disorder prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). As a direct test of this discrimination, we find that using the subset of human proteins with known intrinsic disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Piovesan et al., 2017</xref>) as the phase separation negative set shows similar results as using the human proteome as the negative, at AUC:0.84 ± 0.03 for the full test set and AUC:0.93 ± 0.02 for the in vitro sufficient set.</p><p>We note that the optimization methodology used for developing our predictor, specifically training for discrimination against the PDB, was intended to exclude phase separation involving multivalent binding properties of folded proteins with multiple binding surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pierce et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marzahn et al., 2016</xref>) or multiple folded modular binding domains that interact with multiple linear sequence motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banjade and Rosen, 2014</xref>). Thus, we expect and find a lower success rate for prediction of phase separation of proteins using these mechanisms. We also note that the goal of the prediction experiment is to see whether observed phase separation can be predicted exclusively from contact probabilities as a test of the hypothesis that pi interactions are important for phase separation, but that our method uses probabilities found in the PDB, was trained on natural sequences, and was tested using sequences that are either found in nature or were designed based on sequences that are. The ability to predict contacts is expected to decrease for sequences not observed in nature and for sequences relying to a greater degree on other energetic contributions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Mechanistic implications of the optimized phase separation predictor</title><p>In order to identify the contact features that play the largest role in the optimized predictor, we did a retrospective analysis testing the predictive power of different scoring algorithms produced during the training process, and explored potential mechanistic implications by testing the power of individual score components, grouping contact predictions into long-range vs. short-range and backbone vs. sidechain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table6">Appendix 1—table 6</xref>). Our analysis shows that, while training did improve the predictor, a comparable result can be obtained by using only the long-range contact rate predictions for the peptide backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, as further described in Appendix 1). This property significantly upweights the role of residues, especially Gly and Pro, that are associated with high overall backbone pi-pi contact frequencies and with lower short-range contact frequencies for local sidechain groups, and is especially important for predicting elastin-like proteins, which often have very few sp<sup>2</sup>-containing sidechains. Thus, these results highlight the increased availability of sp<sup>2</sup> groups for non-local pi-interactions as a key driving force behind the phase separation predictions and is consistent with highly multivalent weak interactions leading to phase separation, both in non-polar structural proteins like elastin and highly charged RNA-binding proteins like FUS or Ddx4.</p><p>Many high contact frequency residue types are also associated with disordered proteins in general, so to control for that potential role we took a selection of 3501 human proteins predicted to have long disordered regions (as described in the methods), split them by PScore into high (PScore ≥4) and low (PScore &lt;1) subsets, and compared the sequence characteristics distinguishing high PScore and low PScore sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8A</xref>). We find that non-phase-separating intrinsically disordered proteins are actually depleted in Gly and Pro, especially relative to the enrichment seen in phase-separating sequences and sequences predicted to phase separate. Conversely, they are most enriched in Lys, which on average is depleted in phase-separating sequences.</p><p>While the division of the predictor into two distinct protocols was used to avoid scores that simply describe sequence similarity to the training set, it is still possible that the training process picked up on specific sequence features in the training set. To explore the contribution of sequence similarity to the score, we made a measurement of sequence profile similarity based on dipeptide composition (neighboring residue pair frequencies). We compared the high scoring regions selected by the predictor to each of the sequences used in the training set (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table7">Appendix 1—table 7</xref>, see Materials and methods). This analysis, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8B</xref>, finds that high scoring (PScore ≥4.0) human proteins are, on average, more similar to the training set than are human proteins in general, but that the majority fall within the normal range. Comparison to a set of 1000 BLAST-level sequence homologs of the training set suggests that the majority of the similarity is compositional preference, not homology.</p><p>Both sequence similarity and compositional behavior can also be related to the bias toward disorder regions observed in phase-separating proteins. To characterize this, we again took the high and low PScore subsets of our set of 3501 human proteins predicted to have long disordered regions and then compared their sequence profiles. It has previously been observed that disordered proteins have a Shannon entropy (a measurement of sequence complexity) that is lower, but significantly overlapping with ordered proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Romero et al., 2001</xref>). We find here that the high PScore set has a Shannon entropy that is far lower than the range seen for low PScore disordered proteins, which have Shannon entropies that fall in the range observed for folded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8C</xref>). Comparing our phase separation test set with the human disprot set we can confirm that this bias toward lower complexity sequences is observed in known phase-separating sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Analysis and validation of predictions of phase separation</title><p>Given the favorable characteristics of our predictor, we investigated correlations of phase separation scores with protein interactions, various biological mechanisms that may regulate phase separation and gene ontology (GO) terms. The principle of sequences with high propensity for non-local pi-pi contact being more likely to self-associate implies that different proteins with high phase separation propensity scores would be more likely to interact with one another. By comparing score pairs from protein interactions taken from the I2D metadatabase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Niu et al., 2010</xref>), we confirm that high-scoring proteins and low-scoring proteins are both over two-fold more likely to interact with proteins of similar score, relative to expectations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This holds true even when comparing interactions between largely hydrophobic or cytoskeletal proteins (such as elastin and collagen) and highly polar RNA-binding proteins (like Ddx4 and FUS).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31486.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Association of phase separation propensity scores with protein interactions, splice isoforms, PTMs, and GO localization, process, and function terms.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Protein-protein interaction enrichment by the PScore of partner 1 vs. the PScore of partner 2.

To test this aspect of the score, we looked at large complex formation and interaction propensity by examining the background ‘contamination’ rates observed in affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS). Large complex formation is measured by the number of negative control experiments in which each human protein appears, over a set of 411 experiments involving non-specific affinity purification steps performed without the specific affinity tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mellacheruvu et al., 2013</xref>). Within this dataset, we observe that 26/28 of our known human phase-separating proteins show up as a contaminant in at least one experiment (O/E = 3.51), and 17/28 show up more than 10% of the time (O/E = 14.9), confirming that phase-separating proteins show the expected behavior. By binning proteins by prediction scores, we show that this is also a trend for high PScore proteins in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that the pi contacts driving this score may play a general role in localizing proteins to large complexes.</p><p>Phase separation behavior could potentially be modulated by the addition, modification, or removal of even small segments with high phase separation propensity, leading to regulation of phase separation by alternative splicing and post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Romero et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hegyi et al., 2011</xref>). To test the possible regulation by splicing, we ran our predictor against human sequences in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Magrane et al., 2011</xref>) variable splicing database. We found that 40 ± 2% of included proteins strongly predicted to phase separate (PScore ≥4) have alternative splice variants which either remove the prediction or significantly change the score (ΔPScore &gt;1), often having multiple splice variants spanning a wide range of scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). By comparison, an overall rate of significant changes in score (ΔPScore &gt;1) of 23.0 ± 0.4% is observed for all proteins in the set.</p><p>To examine post-translational modifications (PTMs), we analyzed our scores against the database of known PTMs curated by PhosphoSitePlus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hornbeck et al., 2012</xref>). We tested the relationship between predicted propensities and number of PTM sites, controlling for protein length by taking PTM counts from the maximum number of annotations observed for any 100 residue window in a sequence. By comparing populations with an above average number of sites (greater than the average plus one standard deviation) against the baseline frequency, we see enrichment in high PScores (≥4) for a variety of PTM site annotations, including literature annotations of disease relevance and known regulatory function (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table8">Appendix 1—table 8</xref>). We also observe that for phosphorylation and methylation the absolute number of PTMs correlates with the average PScores observed, with methylation having a stronger effect than phosphorylation, and ubiquitination shown as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we compared our phase separation predictions to known localization or function, as annotated in the GO database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B,C</xref>). Ranking GO terms by enrichment of proteins with prediction values above our threshold (PScore ≥4) enabled us to generate a list of terms associated with significant enrichment of pi-pi contacts (p&lt;0.000001 and 5–50 fold observed over expected); this list includes 4.1% of the 27342 GO terms tested. This subset of the GO database demonstrates enrichment for phase separation propensity in known phase-separated compartments (stress granules, Cajal bodies, post-synaptic density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>]), in RNA processing (transcription, splicing, modification, transport, and stability), in the assembly and plasticity of structural components (cytoskeletal organization, extracellular matrix assembly), and in signaling, regulation, and development (Notch signaling, NF-κB, Wnt). We note that the sequence property predicted here is a physical behavior that occurs on a cellular scale, so the observation of a similar score distribution for a specific biological process, as observed for annotations involving localization to known phase-separating bodies, is an implicit prediction that phase separation is one of the physical mechanisms involved in the process. Consistent with that, we see similar score distributions for many processes involving organization of structural components, signaling, and cell-fate commitment. The property of phase separation is also strongly associated with the regulation and development of multicellular cooperation and neurogenesis. In contrast, the vast majority of GO terms (77.2%) show no enrichment in phase separation propensity, with significantly lower enrichment in categories involving metabolic processes and enzymatic catalysis.

One of these, synaptic functional regulator FMR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">El Fatimy et al., 2016</xref>), also known as fragile X syndrome protein FMRP, has a PScore of 4.7, and is involved in RNA binding, neurological development and regulation of translation, all GO terms enriched in high PScores. FMR1 is a multifunctional polyribosome-associated protein, which is highly expressed in the brain and in the testes, and is known to localize to granular bodies with two other proteins (FXR1 and FXR2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">El Fatimy et al., 2016</xref>) that are also predicted with high PScores (at 2.9 and 5.3). In order to validate that high PScore predicts sufficiency for phase separation and not associated properties like miscibility in the separated phases of other proteins, or other interactions with phase-separating proteins, we purified the highest scoring region (residues 445–632) and confirmed the ability to spontaneously undergo liquid phase separation at low temperature and high concentrations in physiological buffer conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The concentration required for visual confirmation of liquid phase separation behavior is quite high, at 1 mM FMRP-LCR, but can be reduced through the use of crowding reagents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Both sequences have little overlap with any of the sequence motifs found in our training set (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table7">Appendix 1—table 7</xref>), aside from general enrichment in glycine and proline residues.

While this association is demonstrably useful for identifying phase-separating proteins in proteomic datasets, these contacts may not be the predominant interaction driving the physical process of phase separation for each case, and could instead reflect a modulatory role since it is not exclusive of other interactions like hydrogen bonds and charge interactions. However, tests showing that arginine to lysine mutations abrogate phase separation behavior do provide evidence of the importance of planar sp<sup>2</sup> groups for phase-separating systems.</p><p>The finding that a single contact potential can generate a reasonably accurate classifier of phase separation behavior suggests that a sequence-based prediction of phase separation behavior is a tractable problem, and that future development of an algorithm that can predict the complexities of the phase transition, environmental effects and concentration requirements is a reasonable goal. This goal could potentially be addressed by introducing the range of phase separation associated sequence properties that were intentionally excluded by our empirical test of the pi-contact association, including the electrostatic effects of charge patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Das and Pappu, 2013</xref>), multivalency of PTM sites and PTM-binding motifs, and transient structural interactions, including strand formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murray et al., 2017</xref>) and helical interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conicella et al., 2016</xref>). There is also a role for incorporating predictions of competing states, the irreversible aggregation propensity of a sequence or its amyloidogenic potential. Incorporating annotation data associated with phase-separating proteins could be another avenue for generating a physiological classifier in a more comprehensive predictor.</p><p>The physical nature of pi-pi contacts and their underlying mechanistic relationship to phase separation are not revealed by the simple contact frequency measurements used in our predictions. These contacts are observed in folded proteins, both internally and near solvated interfaces and, while that suggests they play a general role in the energetics of protein-protein interactions, the nature of that role is not clear. There is potential for electrostatic or induced dipole and quadrupolar interactions, especially in the context of other dipole interactions and hydrogen bonds, but the flat surfaces of sp<sup>2</sup> groups could also enable solvation to drive contacts and lead to entropic contributions due to the relative freedom of movement inherent in packing flat plates, compared to the more rigid shape complementation involved in packing aliphatic groups. It is interesting to note that these proposed mechanisms could be affected by temperature in opposite ways, and that our predictor using pi-contact frequencies is useful in identifying phase-separating proteins regardless of whether they associate more readily as temperatures decrease (such as Ddx4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nott et al., 2015</xref>) or increase (such as elastin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>As part of characterizing the proteomic associations highlighted by our empirical prediction test, we point out that manual inspection of our prediction results across the human proteome suggests that planar pi-contact associated phase separation likely facilitates a wide range of cellular functions. To highlight this, we selected a range of examples by taking the highest scoring member of gene ontology categories we found to be generally enriched in high PScore proteins. We see enrichment of phase separation propensity in proteins associated with cytoskeletal organization. These include proteins with known structural roles such as the cytoskeletal intermediate filament proteins desmin and vimentin (PScores 4.3 and 4.4), as well as keratins 8 and 18 (PScores 5.9 and 5.4), with scores deriving primarily from the disordered head and tail domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9</xref>). Intermediate filaments form through dynamic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>) consistent with a model in which phase separation-induced condensation concentrates proteins prior to the formation of (often fibrillar) structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, helical domain mutations impeding structure formation cause these four proteins to instead accumulate in protein-rich membraneless inclusions such as Mallory-Denk bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strnad et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goebel and Bornemann, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ogrodnik et al., 2014</xref>). We also predict high PScores for non-structural proteins involved in regulating cytoskeletal organization and in binding some of the previously mentioned cytoskeletal proteins, including focal adhesion kinase 1 (PScore 4.2) and DNAJB homolog 6 (PScore 8.8), the latter of which is also a chaperone that can prevent huntingtin aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chuang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hageman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gillis et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Many of the high PScore predictions involve proteins that are both involved in signaling pathways and known to either localize to membraneless organelles or interact with phase-separating proteins. For example, adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC) (PScore 3.2) and axin1 (PScore 2.2), involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, interact in a dynamic fashion in the large and multimeric β-catenin destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pronobis et al., 2015</xref>), and we find high PScores for other critical members of the complex, including β-catenin (PScore 5.5) and GSK3α (PScore 6.4). The β-catenin destruction complex formation is regulated by GSK3 phosphorylation, and we note that the predictor shows a difference between the two human GSK3 orthologs, with GSK3β having a PScore of 2.2. These orthologs are often functionally interchangeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doble et al., 2007</xref>), but there is evidence of isoform-specific roles for GSK3α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma, 2014</xref>) and the predicted differences could reflect a difference in modulating phase-separation behavior.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that planar pi-pi interactions are more prevalent in protein structures than previously described, with potential roles in structural motifs, catalysis and RNA binding. Planar pi-pi contact frequencies are increased in protein segments that lack regular secondary structure or have increased solvent exposure, pointing to their relevance for disordered protein regions. This, together with the enrichment of pi-containing groups in protein regions known to phase separate, provided an impetus for development of a phase-separation predictor based on the likelihood of forming non-local planar pi-pi contacts. The performance of the predictor supports the hypothesis that these pi-pi interactions can drive phase separation. While experimental data and computational work suggest other contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brangwynne et al., 2015</xref>), including the hydrophobic effect, electrostatics and multivalent binding of folded protein domains, our prediction test shows that an algorithm focused solely on pi-interactions performs well for the majority of proteins that we identified as phase-separating from the literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1B</xref>). These results strongly suggest that most phase-separating proteins can make significant non-local planar pi-interactions, even in cases where there are other dominant or required forces driving phase separation.

The sp<sup>2</sup> systems were defined by atom names for each of nine sidechain groups (from W,F,Y,H,R,Q,N,E,D), the backbone peptide bond, and the C-terminal carboxyl group. Planar axes were defined as normal vectors by using the cross product method against defined lists of three sequential atoms. VDW contacts between sp<sup>2</sup> groups were determined by the full set of heavy atom (C, N, O) distance measurements, using a threshold of ≤4.9 Å to define contacts. This represents the upper range of VDW contacts between sp<sup>2</sup> groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1E</xref>), because we intended to compare contact frequencies by data resolution and did not want to introduce arbitrary energetic cutoffs for atoms with potentially unreliable positions.</p><p>In analyzing the planar orientations of sp<sup>2</sup> groups found in VDW contact, we found enrichment of in-plane contacts, predominantly face-to-face, so we devised a simple system for identifying them that can be generalized across groups with variable numbers of atoms.

Contact distances were further restricted by requiring that surfaces 1.7 Å above the sp<sup>2</sup> plane be ≤1.5 Å apart (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref>).

Contacts to crystal symmetry partners were also measured but were kept separate and, except where specifically investigated to probe inter-chain contacts, were excluded from analysis based on the observation that VDW contacts made to symmetry partners can contain a small (&lt;1%) population of extreme clashes (atoms &lt;1 Å from one another).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Pi-contact frequency vs. resolution</title><p>PDBs were sorted into 77 non-overlapping bins first by exact resolution and then by rolling any bins with less than 100 PDBs into the next acceptable bin within 0.25 Å.

Contact frequencies were determined across the full list of ligands in these non-redundant sets, with contacts to amino acid ligands being divided into backbone carboxyl and sidechain sp<sup>2</sup> groups. As an internal control for amino acid contact frequencies, contact frequencies were determined for each amino acid based on the same set of structures used to define the ligand frequency.

interactions, we examined the contact frequencies at positions with known enzymatic function. We observe that residues in our non-redundant protein set which are annotated as being catalytic in the Catalytic Site Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Furnham et al., 2014</xref>) (N = 912 PDBs, 2914 catalytic residues) are more likely to be involved in planar pi-pi contacts than expected by the contact frequency of the given residue type, at 1.87 ± 0.07 times expectation overall and 1.42 ± 0.07 when normalized by catalytic residue frequency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>), with Glu, Gln, Asn, and Asp having the largest increases, going from 12–19% average contact frequency to 21–39% in catalytic positions. In addition, by normalizing contact frequency by the number of van der Waals contacts each residue is involved in we observe that catalytic residues are 2.1 ± 0.2 times more likely to have pi-pi stacking interactions with their VDW contacts that are also annotated as being catalytic than they are to non-catalytic neighbors, suggesting that the contacts themselves play a role in defining the constrained geometries of the active site. This analysis only covers the protein-protein interactions made within the binding pocket, and does not cover the nature of the contacts made by catalytic residues to ligands, which, judging from our small molecule binding data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>), could significantly increase the overall rate. (An example of a catalytic side with both protein-protein and protein-ligand pi-pi contacts is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.). We note that the effect of these interactions may involve some energetic cooperativity with other interactions, as they are often found in large networks, and commonly involve sidechains stacked simultaneously to both the donor and acceptor groups of an sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2</sup> hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s7-2"><title>Backbone interactions</title><p>Roughly half of the observed pi-pi contacts involve the peptide backbone and seem to be particularly important in defining structure at the termini of strands and helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We found that contact frequency increases at backbone positions located at the transition points between different types of secondary structure, with up to a 3–4 fold increase in contact frequency around the terminal positions in strands and helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>) primarily involving local sidechain contacts to the last peptide bond involved in hydrogen bonding. We further observed that many of these contacts are directly involved in motifs known to be important for stabilizing secondary structure during folding, including β-hairpins and helix-caps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Serrano and Fersht, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Trevino et al., 2007</xref>). These interactions have previously been recognized for aromatic sidechains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tóth et al., 2001</xref>), but we find that non-aromatic sp<sup>2</sup> sidechains are, in aggregate, more likely to form these backbone contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>To examine the relevance of these backbone contacts in defining structural motifs we searched for examples of specific motifs with exceptionally high contact frequencies. We present our top examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5A</xref> shows a β-hairpin with DSSP assignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kabsch and Sander, 1983</xref>) ‘ETTTTE’, a motif found in 14.4 ± 0.5% of the structures in our high resolution PDB set (N = 822/5718). Across these observations we find a planar pi-pi contact frequency at the peptide position involved in the hydrogen bond defining the turn 38 ± 2% of the time (N = 401/1051),~22 times the median contact frequency (of 1.7%) over all backbone groups, suggesting that these pi-pi contacts play a role in defining the motif.</p><p>As a way of providing a sidechain specific test that excludes aromatic interactions and cation-pi, we looked at arginine residues and found that when arginine is in a helix (≥4 residues from the N-terminal position, by DSSP) the sidechain group forms a pi-pi contact to the peptide bond between residues i-3 and i-2 on average 9.2% of the time (N = 18507), where the arginine is effectively stacking to the surface of the helix. When looking at sidechains found closer to the helix N-terminus we find that this frequency increases to 13.6% for the position where the i-3/i-2 peptide group forms the terminal hydrogen bond (N = 2495), and then drops to 0.14% when it is no longer part of the helix (N = 1438).</p></sec><sec id="s7-3"><title>RNA binding</title><p>We also examined the planar pi-pi contact frequencies in RNA/protein complexes, using 94 X-ray structures with at least 10 RNA bases from our non-redundant proteins set. Overall, 9.2 ± 1.4% (N = 3847) of RNA bases in these RNA/protein complexes form planar pi-pi interactions with protein. This is heavily biased towards bases that are not already stacking to other bases. Thus, bases that have no base stacking interactions (16.2 ± 1.8% of all bases) have planar pi-pi contacts to protein 31.2 ± 4.4% of the time, and those that only stack to RNA on one side (17.3 ± 1.1% of all bases) have planar pi-pi contacts to protein 17.7 ± 2.6% of the time. This often situates the protein/RNA interface at positions for which the RNA secondary structure is disrupted.</p><p>Arginine sidechains are the largest contributor to RNA/protein planar pi-pi interactions, found in 35.0 ± 3.3% of cases, compared to 34.7 ± 4.0% involving any of the four aromatic sidechains (Phe, Tyr, His, Trp) and 21.9 ± 2.8% the peptide backbone. Arginine’s role in binding RNA is well known and can also be explained by its abilities to form charge interactions with the phosphate backbone and hydrogen bonds to base pairs. We observe that arginine residues in VDW contact with RNA form planar pi-pi interactions 28% of the time, and that planar pi-pi contacts are, relative to other arginine to RNA VDW contacts, more likely to be found in simultaneous contact to the phosphate group. Thus, arginine in VDW contact with RNA has a 36% and 9% chance of being in contact with PO<sub>4</sub> or hydrogen bonded to a base, respectively, while arginine with a pi-pi contact to RNA has a 63% and 15% chance of being in contact with PO<sub>4</sub> or hydrogen bonded to a base, demonstrating that these interactions do not compete and may be synergistic or cooperative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31486.025</object-id><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Contact definitions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Contacts are identified first as sp<sup>2</sup> planes in which at least two pairs of atoms come within 4.9 Å of one another, and then by restricting to the subset with (<bold>B</bold>) planar surfaces (at the carbon VDW radius of 1.7 Å) with points along the planar normal vectors coming within 1.5 Å of one another and (<bold>C</bold>) a planar orientations for which the absolute value of the dot product of normal vectors is ≥0.8.

Of these, interactions with only one atom-atom pair within VDW contact (shown in blue) have no bias.

To this end, we defined strict training sets, with 11 phase-separating sequences as the positive standard and sequences in our PDB sets as our negative standard, we kept the testing sets internally blind until choosing an arbitrary point to finalize the predictor, and we intentionally excluded any analysis of sequence features, such as charge patterns, amyloid propensity, and direct homology, that could improve predictor quality without testing this hypothesis.</p><p>Our protocol was split into four design steps and one test step, as follows. (1) We defined sequence dependent contact rates for different sp<sup>2</sup> groups by taking statistics from the PDB, (2) we measured average frequencies observed for groups found in specific sequence context, (3) we used the context data to train a sequence-based pi-contact rate predictor against the PDB, (4) we then optimized a weighting function for combining pi-contact predictions against the ability to discriminate the phase separation training set proteins from the PDB, and (5) we finalized the weight optimized predictor and tested it against the phase separation test set and proteomic test sets a single time, shown in the main text, with supplemental analysis of predictor quality throughout the design process done as a retrospective analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s8-2"><title>Step 1: Pi-contact rate measurement</title><p>From the non-redundant PDB chains previously used for structure analysis, we selected nonredundant structures into the training set by randomly selecting 17388 structures. The remaining 4347 structures were taken as the leave out set, being removed and held for the final testing step. Independence of the two sets is restrained only by the 60% identity cutoff used in obtaining the full list, which prevents broadly identical proteins from showing up in both sets. The ability to further guarantee independence is limited by the nature of homology, and was considered outside of the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>Sequences were extracted from the PDB REFSEQ annotations and then mapped to residues found in the structure, with missing density annotated as such. Pi-contact observations were then mapped to their involved residues with contacts split by sequence separation into long-range (≥5 or different chain) and short-range (≤4 residue). Contact rates were determined for individual sp<sup>2</sup> groups using nine residue identities for the sidechain groups and 400 residue identities for backbone groups, with backbone groups defined by both flanking residues. To measure local sequence effects we also calculated rates for non-flanking residue pairs, up to 40 residues apart, which when combined with the backbone groups produced 16400 residue pair types (20 n-terminal residues x 40 sequence separation distances x 20 C-terminal residues), which are observed in the training set at a median sample size of N = 8622, ranging from N = 563 to N = 41796 from the least to most populated.</p></sec><sec id="s8-3"><title>Step 2: Pi-contact averaged frequencies</title><p>For the initial sequence-based pi-contact predictor contact rate, observations for pairs of residues found within a fixed window length were averaged to produce a context-dependent estimate. To account for sampling error in rare sequence pairs we estimated the standard error of these measurements by a limited bootstrap analysis, using 200 randomly sampled (without replacement) 70% cut subsets of the training set. To average observation values, a given sp<sup>2</sup> system was first defined by its residue type (a single amino acid for sidechain groups or the sequential amino acids for backbone groups). Next, residues less than 40 residues away in the primary sequence (both sides) were compared to our precomputed database, to obtain a comprehensive list of rate values for all residue-distance-residue pairings found in this window. These values were then averaged using a sampling error correction, intended to weight observations by confidence, using the following equation, where <italic>R</italic> is the error weighted contact frequency at position <italic>x</italic> as obtained by averaging over the closest <italic>l</italic> positions, <italic>P</italic> is the database frequency observed for <italic>x</italic> a given residue pair (<italic>x</italic> and <italic>x + y</italic>), and σ is the standard error of the mean obtained for that database frequency.<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtable columnspacing="1em" rowspacing="4pt"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>≠</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:munder></mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtable columnspacing="1em" rowspacing="4pt"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>≠</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:munder></mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1.0</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>This average value, which represents a very limited sequence-based prediction, does not contain information on whether or not local sequence increases or decreases the group’s contact rate relative to what is expected by the nature of the group on its own.

While analyzing these scores for their ability to predict contact rates, we observed that the separate z-scores for long-range and short-range contacts, each derived from distinct non-overlapping sets of observations, are not independent; they each contain information on the probability expectation of the other, with sequence dependent correlations that could contain data on competition and cooperation.</p></sec><sec id="s8-4"><title>Step 3: Pi-contact predictor</title><p>To capitalize on the observation that short-range and long-range contact rates carry information on each other, we added an additional rate prediction step where the previous averaged rates are used in tandem short-range/long-range pairs to extract matching observation data from the original rate database. To do this we created a system of lookup tables in which our training set observations are tallied in two-dimensional arrays by half z-score bins. To obtain frequency values using these lookup tables we calculate the pair of z-scores for the query group and match them to a corresponding bin in the lookup tables.</p><p>Splitting observations into bins is problematic at extreme z-scores, as it significantly increases sampling error. To address this problem, we developed a smoothing method involving iterative sampling across a range of window-length dependent tables in order to use the natural random variance of the database to average the observations.</p><p>This method starts with the initial z-score calculation on a window of sequences covering the group itself and up to one flanking residue on either side, collecting values for observed contacts and total number of database entries from a look up table built using the same window size. We then add additional flanking residues, re-calculate the corresponding z-scores for the new window length, and then add the observed contacts and total entry numbers for that window size to the previous observation. From here, additional residues are added iteratively, one flanking residue and window specific score calculation at a time, up to a maximum window length of 40 residues on either side. The final frequency is determined by the total number of pi-contacts observed for similar groups in the database, summed over all windows, divided by the total number of similar groups found in the database. This is defined in the following equation, where <italic>F</italic> is the contact frequency for position <italic>x</italic>, <italic>O</italic> is the number of database pi-pi contacts observed within a bin defined by a pair of long-range (LR) and short-range (SR) z-scores (Z) calculated for window length <italic>i</italic>, and <italic>T</italic> is the total number of groups observed for the same bin.<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>40</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>40</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Our selection criterion in developing this method, for determining scores, window lengths, grid spacing, and other details, was to test options against one another by filling statistical databases from defined 70% cuts of the training set and then testing how well the sum of frequency predictions made for each protein in the remaining 30% correlated with the total number of contacts found in each protein. Once our final pi-contact rate prediction method was selected we then filled our final databases using the full training set and did a single prediction quality test against the leave out database.</p></sec><sec id="s8-5"><title>Step 4: Phase separation prediction</title><p>As a starting point, we ran the pi-contact predictor developed for the PDB on each sequence in the PDB and in our 11 protein phase-separating protein training set and returned the highest number of contacts predicted for any 100 residue window. These contact frequency predictions showed a reasonably normal distribution for the PDB (skew and kurtosis of 0.22 and 0.62, as calculated using the scipy.stats python package) and above PDB-average predictions for our set of 11 phase-separating proteins (8/11 in the 99th percentile). Additional analysis showed that this enrichment was higher for long-range contact predictions than for short-range contacts. As an aside, the phase-separating protein with the lowest contact frequency, elastin, also has fewer sidechain groups and a lower average mass per residue. However, elastin still has a predicted contact frequency greater than the PDB average because of very high contact frequency predictions for its backbone.</p><p>Since different categories of contacts utilized in our predictor could have different effects on phase separation propensity, we trained a phase separation predictor by optimizing contact prediction weights and normalization methods against the ability to discriminate the lowest scoring member of the phase separation training set from the highest scoring members (the top percentile) of the non-redundant PDB set, by using a single score value per protein, as defined in the following equation where D is the relative discrimination score and S is the score function being tested.<disp-formula id="equ4"><label>(4)</label><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>min</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>%</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>We then ran the pi-contact predictor on every sequence with ≥140 residues (based on the length of the smallest phase-separating protein in our training set) and stored prediction values for four contact frequencies (long-range/short-range vs. sidechain/backbone) and four corresponding relative frequencies (the average identity normalized z-scores produced as intermediate values during the contact prediction protocol).</p><p>To optimize weights against these eight values, we built a machine learning toolbox for stochastic optimization against our discrimination function. Both random and manual sampling of score functions and weights were tested, with weights determined by brute force sampling against a Metropolis Monte Carlo acceptance criterion, and score function changes tested by branching the weight optimization into parallel runs tested against the same criterion.</p><p>In terms of the general flow, we started with score functions that were a weight averaging of contact predictions over fixed window sizes throughout each sequence with the sequence score being the highest score observed. We used the optimization toolbox to test window sizes against one another, with each weight starting at the same value and allowed to deviate by sequential rounds of small random additions and subtractions. In order to avoid scoring the full set of PDB sequences for every small weight change we added fast diversification screening steps, where we introduced sub-optimization rounds against a small select subsets of the PDB (100–2000 sequences), returning new weight sets to the primary optimization protocol for re-scoring against the full PDB and the primary acceptance/rejection step.</p><p>After the first few thousand rounds this results in a diverse population of weights associated with similar performance, which can be mined to capture the range of values that are acceptable for any given weight. At this point, we introduce weight changes using random selections from that population, instead of by random addition and subtraction, which allows for more aggressive sampling (how many weights can change per step, and how far they can change) at a lower observed rejection rate. This weight resampling method also allowed for better parallel computing, as the most successful weight combination were able to automatically propagate between processes.</p><p>During this process weight optimization was entirely stochastic, but we also tested a variety of score formulations and window lengths by parallel competition. This branched optimization strategy added a series of changes to the base protocol, including normalizing window averages by the number of carbon atoms in the window, adding multiple overlapping window lengths to allow for weights to differ by sequence distance, and finally, by changing how the final score is determined per sequence, which went from the top scoring position in the sequence, to the top decile position, and then to an average over all positions within 5 residues of the top scoring 60.</p><p>The final propensity score can be described as the following steps. Raw contact prediction numbers are generated for each residue in the sequence as an initial step. For every residue in the sequence, we then start iterating over the flanking residues while summing up values for eight contact prediction terms (long/short-range vs. backbone/sidechain vs. frequency/z-score) as well as one residue-based term (number of carbon atoms), with final sums being kept for three windows, defined as the closest 40, 80, and 120 flanking residues.

The vast majority of proteomic sequences are simply untested. Our experimental design attempts to address this by limiting training to a single test approach, validated against proteomic data a single time, but this setup meant that many design decisions were made blind, and the relative final impact of the different steps in the protocol remain untested.</p><p>To address this, we went through each step, creating matched predictors using the frequency and weight data available at the time, with new score functions returning the highest contact prediction sum observed over any 100 residue window.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Yibing Shan, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Vernon et al. describes an analysis of (planar) Pi-Pi interactions in proteins, and uses the resulting insights to further our understanding of liquid-liquid phase separating proteins. It concludes that Pi-Pi interactions are generally an important yet overlooked factor in folded proteins. Based on the analysis, the authors propose that these interactions are a key driver of phase separation. These are potentially important findings for our basic understanding of phase separation as well as for our understanding of protein structures.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have identified trends of PDB structures without providing any information on the expected prior. Are there more planar Pi-Pi interactions involving non-aromatic residues because there are overwhelmingly more non-aromatic sidechains than aromatic sidechains in the PDB? Throughout the manuscript, the authors present analyses of enrichment/depletion or correlation of Pi-Pi interactions in various settings. These are generally presented clearly and honestly, but at the same time the authors do not adequately discuss the issues of confounding or indirect effects.</p><p>1a) The reviewers realize that it is not trivial to device a good prior, given that the distribution of amino acids are not random throughout protein structures. One of the reviewers suggested a prior as the following:</p><p>PDB analysis: The analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is very interesting, but a little hard to interpret when the numbers are not normalized by the expected background values. For example, there are ~5x more H/R/Q/N/E/D/G residues in the human proteome than there are Y/F/W residues. If we blindly assume pairwise interactions without any bias, we should naively expect ~20x more interactions amongst H/R/Q/N/E/D/G residues than amongst Y/F/W residues. This naive random network approximation is clearly not appropriate, but some accounting of the drastically different numbers of these residues should be included for the reader to make sense of what these analysis mean. Is 13x the expected value without any bias, given the combination of 3D distribution of residues across folded structures and the amino acid frequencies? For example, the counter hypothesis to this is that Y/F/W residues are typically buried in protein cores generally lack cavities, and so through a simply packing-effect there are necessarily many aromatic to non-aromatic contacts. If you consider other atom types (i.e., non sp2 carbon atoms) how do these compare?</p><p>When examining different types of inter-residue interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) the sidechain and backbone accessible surface area (and numbers of sp2 atoms) differ wildly between different residues. The intention of this figure is to demonstrate that certain types of residues engage more frequently in planar Pi interactions, but without a prior that takes the number/size of those sidechains into account, can one infer any causation from the fact that bigger sidechains with more sp2 atoms are more frequently engaged in planar sp2-X interactions?</p><p>1b) Another example of the confounding effects is the enrichment of the Pi-Pi interactions in the active site (Appendix 1 Supplementary Results). Is it clear that this cannot be explained by the fact that active sites have more of the residues that can form the Pi-Pi interactions? Similarly, to what extent that the occurrence of Pi-Pi interactions near water molecules can be explained by the fact that a dominating majority of the residues are polar there? These issues are important because the authors need to establish not just a correlation, but also causation.</p><p>1c) It appears that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B and 1C</xref> are exclusively examining planar pi-pi interactions (given the absence of any sidechain interactions in residues that lack sp2 carbons in their sidechains). These analyses provide a relative picture with respect to one another, but there is no information on the global importance of these interactions in the greater context of all interactions in folded proteins. For example, how do these numbers compare to hydrogen bonds or to interactions between non- sp2 atoms and sp2 atoms. Such analysis is needed to understand if planar pi-pi interactions are more frequent than other planar interactions involving sp3 atoms in planar systems.</p><p>2) The authors develop a predictor and a PScore for phase separation based on the idea that Pi-Pi interactions are important for this behaviour. This is potentially of widespread interest, but the authors need to clarify the premise of a &quot;phase separation predictor&quot; which is important to this work conceptually. Assigning a score that will be referred to as a phase separation propensity assumes a gross simplification to the physics of phase separation. How should one think about this predictor? For a given set of solution conditions such as pH, salt concentration, type of salt, and temperature are we to think of the score as a predictor of the saturation concentration? Would it be of the low or high concentration arm of the binodal and what if the phase diagram is replete with complexities? It would help if the authors provide a coherent description of the key concepts and parameters that underlie the physics of phase separation for a generic protein under a given set of solution conditions, and with these parameters in hand explain if the Pscore serves as a proxy for one or more of the physical parameters. If so, the authors could assemble a data set from extant measurements to calibrate the Pscore. If the Pscore does not or should not be viewed as a proxy for any physical parameter, then this should be made clear and a detailed explanation of how the parameter should be used and what insight one might gather from its usage would be essential.</p><p>The authors fall short of explaining what signals the predictor captures and fully discussing its limitations. It is unclear what goes into the PScore. To this point, for polyNE the Pscore is -10, polyFG gives -6.5 and polyRG +3, while polyH gives +57, polyC gives +28 and polyD gives +12. The PScore is highest for a protein that is basically an Asn-Glu polyelectrolyte repeat, highly unlikely a sequence that will drive phase separation on its own. It will most certainly need a complexing partner and it is this type of caveats that can mislead a naive user. The PScore would be much more interesting if the authors can really demonstrate that the reason why it works (if it does work) is because of some specific mechanistic (e.g. Pi-Pi) insight. As it stands, the link is somewhat poorly explained because there is a lot of fitting and tweaking in the development of PScore. And so it is not clear why it works, and what physical mechanisms – if any – it captures. The authors should both discuss/demonstrate better the limitations of the PScore, and demonstrate that the reason it works is because of the specific mechanism proposed (rather than e.g. some correlated variable etc.).</p><p>Overall, the work that concerns the predictor is more of a preliminary nature and its weight should be reduced and the claims should be tone down in the revision.</p><p>2a) The authors effectively train a predictor on known sequences. While this has some basis in the information mined from the PDB, to what extent is the predictor simply finding sequences that are similar to known sequences? For example, what is the correlation between proteins identified in the authors' prior study published in Molecular Cell in 2015?</p><p>2b) The final optimization appears to involve separating known phase separating proteins from the top scoring proteins in the PDB. How can the authors distinguish between developing a predictor for phase separation vs. one for (long-range) intrinsic disorder? How well would a disorder predictor (e.g. one with a similarly long window size) do? This is important because the goal is not just to separate the two classes of proteins, but also to provide mechanistic insight. Are the Pi-Pi interactions causative, or is it a (spurious) correlation? As the authors are well aware, there are differences in amino acid composition between IDP/IDRs and folded proteins, that include some of the Pi-containing residues (in particular Asn, Glu, Phe, Tyr, Trp have rather different occurrences in IDPs vs. folded proteins). How can it be demonstrated that the optimization isn't merely picking out differences in disorder? One of the reviewers performed a rudimentary comparison between PScores and disorder for a subset of proteins and found a substantial correlation. The authors should use one of the better disorder predictors, perhaps creating a score like the one used (max score over a similar window) and see how well this performs compared to the one actually optimized from the liquid phase separation data.</p><p>2c) The authors show a number of examples of predictions in Appendix—Figure 9. It is, however, unclear how these proteins were chosen. It would be useful to have an argumentation for why these particular proteins were selected, since they are obviously not at the top of the list (e.g. FAK1 is #822). This is in part to ensure that the authors haven't selected proteins that they know, via other avenues, will form droplets. For example, one of the proteins presented (Androgen receptor) has been presented at a couple of conferences to form droplets. While I want to stress that I am not implying that the authors have somehow cheated, I think it is crucial that the authors haven't chosen the proteins in Appendix—Figure 9 based on specific knowledge that some of them have already been shown to form droplets. Many RGG domains have been shown to phase separate. Using the predictor to 'select' one (out of the entire proteome) does not help demonstrating the value of their predictor. It would be far more compelling if the authors found a sequence that does not share features with the set of sequences that are already known to phase separate.</p><p>2d) The PScore appears to provide the maximum value observed over any 100-residue window. If that's the case, then larger proteins will obviously have a greater likelihood of reaching a high PScore. While this may be fully realistic, it wasn't clear to me whether this has indeed been observed experimentally.</p><p>2e) The authors benchmark their predictions using a ROC analysis (Appendix—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It is not fully clear what the &quot;negative&quot; set is, but it appears to be the entire proteome. Is that correct? In general, one should be cautious when using ROC analyses and reporting AUC when there is a large imbalance in the size of the two datasets. If the negative set is very large, one can get a rather large AUC even with a somewhat poor predictor. At the same time, if the goal is just to predict the top few percent hits, then a good predictor could have a relatively low AUC, but still find most true positives at a low false discovery rate (see e.g. Berrar and Flach, Briefings in Bioinformatics, 2011). What is the AUC when e.g. averaged over random subsets of &quot;negatives&quot; that are of the same size as the positive subset? Also, although it might become a bit arbitrary, it would be useful to have an idea on a &quot;standard value&quot; above which one would consider the predictions &quot;reliable&quot;.</p><p>2f) The sequence tested phase separates at 1 mM after incubation on ice for 5 minutes. It would be surprising if, under those conditions, it had not phase separated. For context, many of the other proteins studied undergo phase separation at room temperature at concentrations that are 10^4 lower. If the selected region from FMR1 does undergo phase separation at something closer to physiological conditions including this would be critical, otherwise, this 'experimental validation' is less convincing.</p><p>3) The analyses of MD, Rosetta, FoldX are maybe interesting, but would require a much more detailed analysis which is out of scope for a revision. As is, the analyses fall far short of establishing that the Pi-Pi interaction is not represented in these computational models. It is difficult to believe that MD can fold so many proteins while entirely missing something supposed to be so fundamental. The importance of this work does not lie on the notion that the planar Pi-Pi interaction is not accounted for in existing computational models (molecular dynamics, FoldX, and Rosetta). The reviewers suggest the authors to strongly tone down the related statements, if not to delete the MD simulation analysis or move it to a supplemental section. Many of the strong assertions, including statements declaring that this analysis uncovers unappreciated facts should be toned down.</p><p>3a) Subsection “Prevalence of Pi contacts in the PDB” and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: &quot;These data suggest that the relative importance of pi-pi interactions are underestimated in the force-fields that are used in the structure calculations and thus appear more frequently in structures that are heavily constrained by experimental observations.&quot; It might be worth noting here that these are generally extremely primitive FFs, that are in general unrelated to those used e.g. in molecular dynamics simulations. The fact that these force fields do not include Pi-Pi interactions is not surprising, nor very interesting; these force fields are really minimal and capture almost no physical effects well.</p><p>3b) Although the analysis of the dynameomics simulations looks interesting, it should be noted that these simulations were performed with a relatively old force field, and that more recent and accurate force fields exist. Although all fixed charge force fields share the same basic functional form, the higher accuracy in more modern force fields would likely mean greater structural stability overall. Thus, whether or not the Pi-Pi interactions are lost in these simulations have little to say about the force fields that are more commonly used in the field nowadays. An interaction not accounted for explicitly in a MD force field could still be accounted for implicitly by the force field which is obtained by fitting to empirical data. For a reference point, past studies (Gallivan and Dougherty, PNAS 1999) showed that although pi-cation interactions are not explicitly accounted for in OPLS-AA force field for MD, but the energy calculation of Lys-Phe and Arg-Phe interaction using this force field correlates reasonably well with the quantum results. MD force fields have been much improved from then.</p><p>3d) Both in the MD calculations and Rosetta calculations the benchmark is the number of Pi-Pi contacts found in the crystalline state. In the case of salt bridges, it has been demonstrated by NMR in at least one case that a set of salt bridges found in the crystal structure are absent in solution (JH Tomlinson et al., JACS, 2009). In such cases, the expected (real) behaviour would be that the interactions found in the XR structure should dissolve in solution. From a cursory comparison between the contact frequencies in Xray structures (Appendix—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and NMR structures (Appendix—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), it appears there are fewer contacts in the solution state – even when the NMR structures have many constraints. Could this be due to real differences between the two states (and also temperature differences), and would this imply that the loss of contacts e.g. upon minimization (Appendix—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) represents reality?</p><p>3e) The way the data is presented in Appendix—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> is confusing. Why not simply compare the experiment and calculated numbers? Also, the Protherm database is notoriously problematic, and curated versions exist (e.g. Conchuir et al., PLOS ONE, 2015 or Kellogg et al., Proteins, 2010).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31486.045</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have identified trends of PDB structures without providing any information on the expected prior.

For the contact frequency by residue type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we have added a line for the expectation given an average residue identity (the average across all residue types). This measurement is primarily to demonstrate the relative involvement of different residue types in the contacts, and does not address the root expectation issue, which is the question of whether or not these occur at the rate expected by random chance given the overall composition and packing of protein structures. To address this, we chose to normalize for packing by normalizing pi-contacts by the total number of VDW contacts, and to reduce the effect of amino acid composition by looking specifically at sidechain to backbone contacts. We have added a section describing this analysis, demonstrating that overall sp2 sidechains show enrichment in planar contacts relative to terminal planes taken from sp3 sidechains.</p><p>To examine whether sp<sup>2</sup> containing sidechains engage in stacking behavior beyond what could be expected for average contact frequencies and overall packing considerations, we determined sidechain contacts to backbone peptide groups, focusing on the percentage of VDW contacts (with two or more pairs of atoms within 4.9Å) which satisfy our planar-pi criterion, and then compared the frequencies observed for sp<sup>2</sup> sidechain groups to those observed for planar surfaces on the terminal end of sp<sup>3</sup> sidechains, using atom groups as listed in the Materials and methods section. This metric addresses the issue of amino acid composition effects by taking advantage of the even distribution of backbone groups and allows for normalization of contact frequency for sidechains of different size. Enrichment of sp<sup>2</sup> planar contacts relative to sp<sup>3</sup> is clearly observed for all sp<sup>2</sup> sidechains except Asn and Gln, which our previous analysis showed are more likely to form contacts with their backbone than with their sidechains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further analysis of the relative frequency of planar pi VDW contacts to other VDW contacts as a function of resolution demonstrates that for some contact types the increased pi-contact frequencies with increasing resolution (lower values in Å) are at the expense of decrease in other VDW contacts, suggesting that these contacts represent a specific geometric constraint present in the experimental data, rather than an overall increase in VDW contact frequency at higher resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

These issues are important because the authors need to establish not just a correlation, but also causation.</p></disp-quote><p>Non-aromatic pi-containing sidechains are polar, and these are more common in general and particularly near solvated surfaces. To account for this, we now show data for the relationship between pi-pi contacts and water contacts after normalizing by the total number of VDW contacts, and have separated the statistics for all distinct sidechain-sidechain interactions independently, showing that pi-pi contact frequency increases with water contacts for the majority of distinct residue pair interactions, with some aromatic interactions being notable exceptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, referred to in the first paragraph of the subsection “Correlation of pi-pi contacts with solvation and lack of regular structure”). We have also been careful to avoid implying causation in this analysis, with the exception of the role of solvation in modulating contacts between sidechains of like charge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1c) It appears that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B and 1C</xref> are exclusively examining planar pi-pi interactions (given the absence of any sidechain interactions in residues that lack sp2 carbons in their sidechains). These analyses provide a relative picture with respect to one another, but there is no information on the global importance of these interactions in the greater context of all interactions in folded proteins. For example, how do these numbers compare to hydrogen bonds or to interactions between non- sp2 atoms and sp2 atoms. Such analysis is needed to understand if planar pi-pi interactions are more frequent than other planar interactions involving sp3 atoms in planar systems.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an enrichment comparison against a selection of sp3 planes, normalizing by overall VDW contact rates, showing that sp2 sidechains are more likely than sp3 sidechains to form planar contacts when normalized by total number of VDW interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), as described in more detail in the response for point 1a.</p><p>However, the issue of global importance relative to other interactions is more difficult. Hydrogen bonds far outnumber pi-contacts, but the vast majority of protein hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are always in a hydrogen bond. They either form a hydrogen bond internally or they hydrogen bond with solvent. Thus, the global energetic importance is determined not by the presence of a hydrogen bond but by its relationship to solvent and other context specific non-pairwise energies. We now address an aspect of this issue by analyzing the co-prevalence of hydrogen bonding and pi-pi contacts (Appendix—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, referred to in the subsection “Enrichment of pi-pi contacts in catalytic, capping and RNA-binding sites”), demonstrating that non-aromatic pi sidechains are more likely to be observed in hydrogen bonds when they are in pi-pi contact. Addressing the question of the relative importance of pi-pi to other interactions more comprehensively involves energetic considerations that are outside of the scope of the current manuscript, particularly given our emphasis on the greater association of pi-pi interactions with lack of ordered structure and solvation, properties attributed to disordered protein regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors develop a predictor and a PScore for phase separation based on the idea that Pi-Pi interactions are important for this behaviour. This is potentially of widespread interest, but the authors need to clarify the premise of a &quot;phase separation predictor&quot; which is important to this work conceptually. Assigning a score that will be referred to as a phase separation propensity assumes a gross simplification to the physics of phase separation. How should one think about this predictor? For a given set of solution conditions such as pH, salt concentration, type of salt, and temperature are we to think of the score as a predictor of the saturation concentration? Would it be of the low or high concentration arm of the binodal and what if the phase diagram is replete with complexities? It would help if the authors provide a coherent description of the key concepts and parameters that underlie the physics of phase separation for a generic protein under a given set of solution conditions, and with these parameters in hand explain if the Pscore serves as a proxy for one or more of the physical parameters. If so, the authors could assemble a data set from extant measurements to calibrate the Pscore. If the Pscore does not or should not be viewed as a proxy for any physical parameter, then this should be made clear and a detailed explanation of how the parameter should be used and what insight one might gather from its usage would be essential.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified in the text that the phase separation property being predicted is defined as a binary classification of an observed physiological behavior.</p><p>We recognize that multiple physical interactions can contribute to driving phase separation (Brangwynne, Tompa and Pappu, 2015), but our goal was not to predict subtle differences in phase separation propensity or quantitative phase diagrams. Instead, we aimed to merely classify proteins as having the potential to self-associate under particular biological conditions or not, as a test of our hypothesis of the involvement of planar pi interactions. In this exercise, we define phase separating proteins as those that for presumed functional reasons self-associate in a way that is at least transiently reversible and dynamic, allowing for the protein to self-concentrate as a function of available protein concentration, temperature or other condition. This basic definition does not cover the complexity of the phase diagram, merely the ability to reversibly self-concentrate, and does not consider competing transitions, such as irreversible aggregation and precipitation, which have typically been selected against in the natural sequences on which the predictor is designed to be used. [subsection “Prediction of phase separation using pi-pi contacts”, first paragraph]</p><p>Detailed prediction of the physics of phase separation is hindered by the fact that the known phase-separating proteins have not been analyzed in a systematic fashion. Different categories of proteins are typically characterized in distinct ways according to the ways in which their phase separation behavior is specifically involved in physiological roles. However, others and we are interested in such a goal. This would include incorporation of other known physical interactions and we now explicitly define the potential aspects of such a predictor in the discussion of the limitations of the PScore, described below in the response to point 2c.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors fall short of explaining what signals the predictor captures and fully discussing its limitations. It is unclear what goes into the PScore. To this point, for polyNE the Pscore is -10, polyFG gives -6.5 and polyRG +3, while polyH gives +57, polyC gives +28 and polyD gives +12. The PScore is highest for a protein that is basically an Asn-Glu polyelectrolyte repeat, highly unlikely a sequence that will drive phase separation on its own. It will most certainly need a complexing partner and it is this type of caveats that can mislead a naive user. The PScore would be much more interesting if the authors can really demonstrate that the reason why it works (if it does work) is because of some specific mechanistic (e.g. Pi-Pi) insight. As it stands, the link is somewhat poorly explained because there is a lot of fitting and tweaking in the development of PScore. And so it is not clear why it works, and what physical mechanisms – if any – it captures. The authors should both discuss/demonstrate better the limitations of the PScore, and demonstrate that the reason it works is because of the specific mechanism proposed (rather than e.g. some correlated variable etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>The sequence features of the training and testing sets are all found in the PDB to a degree enabling reasonable computation of relative enrichment. This is not the case for simple repeat polymers such as polyC. We have added a section highlighting that the predictions are derived based on pi-contact frequencies observed in natural sequences, and that we specifically do not expect useful predictions on unnatural polymers.</p><p>We also note that the goal of the prediction experiment is to see whether observed phase separation can be predicted exclusively from contact probabilities as a test of the hypothesis that pi interactions are important for phase separation, but that our method uses probabilities found in the PDB, was trained on natural sequences, and was tested using sequences that are either found in nature or were designed based on sequences that are. The ability to predict contacts is expected to decrease for sequences not observed in nature and for sequences relying to a greater degree on other energetic contributions. [subsection “Prediction of phase separation using pi-pi contacts”, last paragraph]</p><p>In order to address physical mechanisms, we have added a section contrasting the features of phase separating sequences from non-phase separating disordered sequences, showing that disordered sequences which don’t phase separate have sp3 enrichment relative to phase separating sequences, and are especially enriched in lysine content.</p><p>Many high contact frequency residue types are also associated with disordered proteins in general, so to control for that potential role we took a selection of 3501 human proteins predicted to have long disordered regions (as described in the Materials and methods), split them by PScore into high (PScore ≥4) and low (PScore &lt;1) subsets, and compared the sequence characteristics distinguishing high PScore and low PScore sequences (Appendix—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We find that non-phase separating intrinsically disordered proteins are actually depleted in Gly and Pro, especially relative to the enrichment seen in phase separating sequences and sequences predicted to phase separate. Conversely, they are most enriched in Lys, which on average is depleted in phase separating sequences. [subsection “Mechanistic implications of the optimized phase separation predictor”, second paragraph]</p><p>Importantly, we have also reorganized how the prediction experiment is presented to stress that the predictor itself is the test of mechanistic relationship, highlighting a section previously relegated to the supplemental text, which shows that prediction by pi-contacts works even without the fitting and tweaking steps used to develop the final predictor.</p><p>In order to identify the contact features that play the largest role in the optimized predictor we did a retrospective analysis testing the predictive power of different scoring algorithms produced during the training process, and explored potential mechanistic implications by testing the power of individual score components, grouping contact predictions into long range vs. short range and backbone vs. sidechain (Appendix—Table 6). Our analysis shows that, while training did improve the predictor, a comparable result can be obtained by using only the long-range contact rate predictions for the peptide backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, as further described in Appendix 1). This property significantly upweights the role of residues, especially Gly and Pro, that are associated with high overall backbone pi-pi contact frequencies and with lower short-range contact frequencies for local sidechain groups, and is especially important for predicting elastin-like proteins, which often have very few sp<sup>2</sup>-containing sidechains. Thus, these results highlight the increased availability of sp<sup>2</sup> groups for non-local pi-interactions as a key driving force behind the phase separation predictions and is consistent with highly multivalent weak interactions leading to phase separation, both in non-polar structural proteins like elastin and highly charged RNA-binding proteins like FUS or Ddx4. [subsection “Mechanistic implications of the optimized phase separation predictor”, first paragraph]</p><p>We have also added a section to the Discussion describing potential mechanisms driving pi-contact formation, as well as our limitations in assessing these properties from statistical analysis of the PDB.</p><p>The physical nature of pi-pi contacts and their underlying mechanistic relationship to phase separation are not revealed by the simple contact frequency measurements used in our predictions. These contacts are observed in folded proteins, both internally and near solvated interfaces and, while that suggests they play a general role in the energetics of protein-protein interactions, the nature of that role is not clear. There is potential for electrostatic or induced dipole and quadrupolar interactions, especially in the context of other dipole interactions and hydrogen bonds, but the flat surfaces of sp<sup>2</sup> groups could also enable solvation to drive contacts and lead to entropic contributions due to the relative freedom of movement inherent in packing flat plates, compared to the more rigid shape complementation involved in packing aliphatic groups. It is interesting to note that these proposed mechanisms could be affected by temperature in opposite ways, and that our predictor using pi contact frequencies is useful in identifying phase separating proteins regardless of whether they associate more readily as temperatures decrease (such as Ddx4) (Nott et al., 2015) or increase (such as elastin)(Yeo, Keeley and Weiss, 2011). [Discussion, third paragraph]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the work that concerns the predictor is more of a preliminary nature and its weight should be reduced and the claims should be tone down in the revision.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the Discussion section to begin by re-stating that the predictor is not just preliminary, it isn’t even a properly designed predictor, but is instead an experiment to test whether or not a single interaction frequency can provide general predictive value. In the Discussion section we now describe the many known properties of phase separating proteins that could be included in producing an actual single purpose predictive algorithm, which is a goal outside the scope of this work.</p><p>We tested the potential role played by pi-contacts in mediating phase separation by using the single property of pi-contact frequency to train a simplistic predictor of phase separation behavior found in natural sequences, finding that the single property of long-range pi-contact propensity is sufficient for marking the majority of known phase-separating proteins as outliers relative to the proteome, supporting the hypothesis that this sequence property is commonly associated with phase-separating proteins. While this association is demonstrably useful for identifying phase separating proteins in proteomic datasets, these contacts may not be the predominant interaction driving the physical process of phase separation for each case, and could instead reflect a modulatory role since it is not exclusive of other interactions like hydrogen bonds and charge interactions. However, tests showing that arginine to lysine mutations abrogate phase separation behavior do provide evidence of the importance of planar sp<sup>2</sup> groups for phase separating systems.</p><p>The finding that a single contact potential can generate a reasonably accurate classifier of phase separation behavior suggests that a sequence-based prediction of phase separation behavior is a tractable problem, and that future development of an algorithm that can predict the complexities of the phase transition, environmental effects and concentration requirements is a reasonable goal. This goal could potentially be addressed by introducing the range of phase separation associated sequence properties that were intentionally excluded by our empirical test of the pi-contact association, including the electrostatic effects of charge patterning(Nott et al., 2015; Lin, Forman-Kay and Chan, 2016; Das and Pappu, 2013), multivalency of PTM sites and PTM binding motifs, and transient structural interactions, including strand formation (Murray et al., 2017) and coil-coil interactions (Conicella et al., 2016). There is also a role for incorporating predictions of competing states, the irreversible aggregation propensity of a sequence or its amyloidogenic potential. Incorporating annotation data associated with phase separating proteins could be another avenue for generating a physiological classifier in a more comprehensive predictor. [Discussion, first and second paragraphs]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2a) The authors effectively train a predictor on known sequences. While this has some basis in the information mined from the PDB, to what extent is the predictor simply finding sequences that are similar to known sequences? For example, what is the correlation between proteins identified in the authors' prior study published in Molecular Cell in 2015?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a section describing similarity to the training set proteins, both to assess the average degree of similarity and to highlight how difficult it is to actually categorize low complexity sequences by similarity. For comparing similarity between the wide range of primarily non-homologous low complexity regions in our phase separation sets, we chose to compare dipeptide profiles, defined as the frequency of pairs of i &amp; i+1 residue sets, enumerated over the full 400 pairs, with similarity measured by the sum of absolute distances between profiles. This metric captures data on both overall composition and specific motifs and repeats. While the division of the predictor into two distinct protocols was used to avoid scores that simply describe sequence similarity to the training set, it is still possible that the training process picked up on specific sequence features in the training set. To explore the contribution of sequence similarity to the score we made a measurement of sequence profile similarity based on dipeptide composition (neighboring residue pair frequencies). We compared the high scoring regions selected by the predictor to each of the sequences used in the training set (Appendix—Table 7, see Materials and methods). This analysis, shown in Appendix—Figure 8B, finds that high scoring (PScore ≥4.0) human proteins are, on average, more similar to the training set than are human proteins in general, but that the majority fall within the normal range. Comparison to a set of 1000 BLAST-level sequence homologs of the training set suggests that the majority of the similarity is compositional preference, not homology. [subsection “Mechanistic implications of the optimized phase separation predictor”, third paragraph]</p><p>Measuring the overall correlation of PScore values with previous classifiers is left out because in prior work the difficulty of comparing distant sequences was addressed by setting some minimum similarity threshold and then excluding analysis for everything outside of that. For example, the algorithm published in the Nott 2015 Molecular Cell work excludes sequences which don’t have specific residue types with defined spacings, and as such returns a flat score of 0.0 for ~75% of the human proteome and ~75% of our phase separation test set. It does perform well on the subset of proteins for which it can return a score, but that subset represents a small minority of phase-separating sequences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2b) The final optimization appears to involve separating known phase separating proteins from the top scoring proteins in the PDB. How can the authors distinguish between developing a predictor for phase separation vs. one for (long-range) intrinsic disorder? How well would a disorder predictor (e.g. one with a similarly long window size) do? This is important because the goal is not just to separate the two classes of proteins, but also to provide mechanistic insight. Are the Pi-Pi interactions causative, or is it a (spurious) correlation? As the authors are well aware, there are differences in amino acid composition between IDP/IDRs and folded proteins, that include some of the Pi-containing residues (in particular Asn, Glu, Phe, Tyr, Trp have rather different occurrences in IDPs vs. folded proteins). How can it be demonstrated that the optimization isn't merely picking out differences in disorder? One of the reviewers performed a rudimentary comparison between PScores and disorder for a subset of proteins and found a substantial correlation. The authors should use one of the better disorder predictors, perhaps creating a score like the one used (max score over a similar window) and see how well this performs compared to the one actually optimized from the liquid phase separation data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new section showing the relationship between disorder predictions and our phase separation prediction, highlighting that the correlation comes from the fact that the majority of known phase separating proteins are also disordered, but that they then represent a clear subset of all disordered proteins, distinctly different from non-phase separating disordered proteins in ways that are captured by the phase separation predictor but not by disorder predictors.</p><p>Even though the score is trained for discrimination against folded proteins we do not see a systematic increase in the scores of all disordered human proteins. Comparison against a top performing sequence homology-based disorder predictor (Disopred3, (Jones and Cozzetto, 2015)) and a physics-based disorder predictor (IUPREDLong (Dosztanyi et al., 2005)) shows that disorder predictors are better at discriminating disordered proteins from the PDB and the human proteome, while the PScore is consistently better at identifying phase-separating proteins (Appendix—Table 5). The majority of the proteins in our phase separation test set show disordered character, and the analysis shows that while PScore does correlate with disorder it only highlights a subset of disordered proteins, and does not reflect a general disorder prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). As a direct test of this discrimination, we note that using the subset of human proteins with known intrinsic disorder (Piovesan et al., 2017) as the phase separation negative set shows similar results as using the human proteome as the negative, at AUC:0.84 ± 0.03 for the full test set and AUC:0.93 ± 0.02 for the in-vitro sufficient set. [subsection “Prediction of phase separation using pi-pi contacts”, sixth paragraph]</p><p>A section comparing the sequences of high PScore and low PScore disordered proteins has been added in order to describe these differences, showing that high PScore is associated with lower sequence complexity due to exclusion of a wide range of amino acid types relative to low PScore disordered proteins.</p><p>Both sequence similarity and compositional behavior can also be related to the bias towards disorder regions observed in phase-separating proteins. To characterize this, we again took the high and low PScore subsets of our set of 3501 human proteins predicted to have long disordered regions and then compared their sequence profiles. It has previously been observed that disordered proteins have a Shannon’s entropy (a measurement of sequence complexity) that is lower, but significantly overlapping with ordered proteins (Romero et al., 2001). We find here that the high PScore set has a Shannon’s entropy that is far lower than the range seen for low PScore disordered proteins, which have Shannon entropies that fall in the range observed for folded proteins (Appendix—Figure 8C). Comparing our phase separation test set with the human disprot set we can confirm that this bias towards lower complexity sequences is observed in known phase-separating sequences. [subsection “Mechanistic implications of the optimized phase separation predictor”, last paragraph]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2c) The authors show a number of examples of predictions in Appendix—Figure 9. It is, however, unclear how these proteins were chosen. It would be useful to have an argumentation for why these particular proteins were selected, since they are obviously not at the top of the list (e.g. FAK1 is #822). This is in part to ensure that the authors haven't selected proteins that they know, via other avenues, will form droplets. For example, one of the proteins presented (Androgen receptor) has been presented at a couple of conferences to form droplets. While I want to stress that I am not implying that the authors have somehow cheated, I think it is crucial that the authors haven't chosen the proteins in Appendix—Figure 9 based on specific knowledge that some of them have already been shown to form droplets. Many RGG domains have been shown to phase separate. Using the predictor to 'select' one (out of the entire proteome) does not help demonstrating the value of their predictor. It would be far more compelling if the authors found a sequence that does not share features with the set of sequences that are already known to phase separate.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the issue with the examples. Our goal was to show the diversity of function in the 943 human sequences above our confidence threshold so as to highlight the complexity and scale of the underlying predictions, but even selecting examples by known function ends up adding a lot of bias. We’ve clarified this issue by simplifying the list to the highest scoring individual examples in various function annotation categories, and by stating in the text that these examples do not represent a validation set. Since we also don’t want examples that are already known to phase separate, we’ve removed androgen receptor and replaced it with the vitamin D receptor.</p><p>A selection of high-scoring human proteins associated with enriched functions are shown with per-residue scores and PTM annotations in Appendix—Figure 9, with examples chosen from the highest scoring protein in any given gene ontology function/localization annotation related to neuronal plasticity or behavior in A, cytoskeletal biomaterials in B, signaling in C, and extracellular biomaterials in D. [subsection “Analysis and validation of predictions of phase separation”, fifth paragraph]</p><p>In response to the issue with selecting a single RGG domain to test, we have also selected two sequences which, as recommended, do not share features with the set already known to phase separate, and have confirmed their ability to phase-separate, as described in the response below to point 2i.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2d) The PScore appears to provide the maximum value observed over any 100-residue window. If that's the case, then larger proteins will obviously have a greater likelihood of reaching a high PScore. While this may be fully realistic, it wasn't clear to me whether this has indeed been observed experimentally.</p></disp-quote><p>The summation score used by the final predictor was selected by the training process, in which both length-biased (highest scoring region) and length-independent (percentile values) scores were trialed against the acceptance criterion. The best performing setup involves taking the highest scoring 60 residue positions, even if scattered throughout a larger sequence, and then averaging the score of all residues within five positions of any of those sixty. The length bias and opportunity for distributed patches of motifs that this provides are then actually part of the training, and in essence represents a general prediction. Length dependency has also been observed for polymer systems that phase separate and we do have experimental data on Ddx4 confirming these trends (unpublished data). Since it is not a systemic test, however, we feel it falls outside of the scope of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2e) The authors benchmark their predictions using a ROC analysis (Appendix—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It is not fully clear what the &quot;negative&quot; set is, but it appears to be the entire proteome. Is that correct? In general, one should be cautious when using ROC analyses and reporting AUC when there is a large imbalance in the size of the two datasets. If the negative set is very large, one can get a rather large AUC even with a somewhat poor predictor. At the same time, if the goal is just to predict the top few percent hits, then a good predictor could have a relatively low AUC, but still find most true positives at a low false discovery rate (see e.g. Berrar and Flach, Briefings in Bioinformatics, 2011). What is the AUC when e.g. averaged over random subsets of &quot;negatives&quot; that are of the same size as the positive subset? Also, although it might become a bit arbitrary, it would be useful to have an idea on a &quot;standard value&quot; above which one would consider the predictions &quot;reliable&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We use a range of negative sets to show the discriminatory power measured against different expectations. The PDB test set and <italic>E. coli</italic> proteome are closer to a gold standard negative set, but the lack of disordered proteins means that discrimination is too easy so we focus primarily on the human proteome, where the AUC represents a lower bound for discrimination based on a likely to be incorrect assumption that phase separation is a very rare property. To test the effect of set size we have run the suggested calculations, measuring AUC over random negative subsets with the same size as the positive, and the average values are consistently within bootstrap error, at +/- 0.01 AUC.</p><p>We have clarified in the text that a PScore of ≥ 4.0 is our standard confidence value.</p><p>Using a defined standard confidence threshold of ≥ 4.0 standard deviations from the PDB average for the propensity score (PScore) captures 0.3%, 2.2%, and 5.1% of the <italic>E. coli, S. cerevisiae</italic>, and human proteome sets, respectively, as compared to 0.1% of our full PDB set and 81% (26/32) of the self-sufficient for in vitro phase separation test set (dropping to 36/62 for the entire proteomic test set and to 35/59 for the synthetic test set).

It would be surprising if, under those conditions, it had not phase separated. For context, many of the other proteins studied undergo phase separation at room temperature at concentrations that are 10^4 lower. If the selected region from FMR1 does undergo phase separation at something closer to physiological conditions including this would be critical, otherwise, this 'experimental validation' is less convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>The conditions used to assess phase separation of FMR1 were chosen primarily to allow the visual confirmation of liquid behavior and reversibility for a physiologically reasonable buffer solution that only contains FMR1, where the goal was to confirm the physical property. We do have data showing FMR1 phase separating at lower concentrations in more physiological conditions, and have included a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>) showing that the addition of even a small amount of crowding agent (20 mg/ml ficol) is enough to reduce the concentration required for visual confirmation of phase separation five-fold (from 1 mM to 200 µM). We have additional data involving the effects of known physiological binding partners, but that begins to move away from the predicted property of self-sufficient phase-separation, so we have left it out.</p><p>Instead of further characterizing FMR1 we have also addressed the experimental validation issue by testing two additional proteins that do not fall in any of the sequence or structure classes currently associated with phase separation and reporting their ability to phase separate.</p><p>To test whether or not the predictor is applicable to sequences that do not share motifs or functions with any of our training set proteins we did a manual search for predictions with sequence properties and functions dissimilar from the training set proteins and selected two proteins, human engrailed-2 (UID: P19622, PScore 5.0), a DNA binding homeobox protein, and the pAP isoform of the Human cytomegalovirus capsid scaffolding protein (UID: P16753-2, PScore 3.8), a protein that plays an essential structural role in assembling the viral capsid, a novel function relative to those known to involve phase separation. Both sequences have little overlap with any of the sequence motifs found in our training set (Appendix—Table 7), aside from general enrichment in glycine and proline residues. Experimentally we observe reversible liquid phase separation of pAP protein with increasing temperature, with viscoelastic properties similar to the complex coacervation of elastins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). We did not observe phase separation of engrailed-2 under the same buffer conditions, even at 1mM protein concentration, but did observe temperature dependent liquid droplet formation in the presence of a crowding reagent (20mg/ml ficol) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). While these observations do not represent a robust or comprehensive test of prediction quality, they do suggest that the predictions provide a useful tool for selecting natural proteins capable of self-sufficient liquid demixing.

As is, the analyses fall far short of establishing that the Pi-Pi interaction is not represented in these computational models.

The importance of this work does not lie on the notion that the planar Pi-Pi interaction is not accounted for in existing computational models (molecular dynamics, FoldX, and Rosetta).

To test the degree to which contact frequencies in solved structures derive from experimental constraints, rather than the force fields used, we explored how well planar pi interactions are captured by the simple energy functions used in certain protein modeling protocols. We examined a few different modeling protocols by either running available methods or downloading pre-computed datasets (see Materials and methods). In general, planar pi-pi contacts were lost during simulations (Appendix—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and energy minimization (Appendix—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In one older molecular dynamics simulation of folded proteins, made available for 100 proteins via Dynameomics (Kehl et al., 2008), 90% of the planar pi-pi contacts found in the starting structures were lost during simulation, with the majority being lost within the first few simulation steps. Similarly, modeling of the energetic effect of mutations, the ∆∆G of unfolding, using both FOLDX (Schymkowitz et al., 2005) and Rosetta (Kellogg, Leaver-Fay and Baker, 2011), shows decreased prediction accuracy at positions involved in pi contacts (Appendix—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-F</xref>), based on comparison to a reference set of ∆∆G measurements (Bava et al., 2004).</p><p>These observed issues in modeling pi-contacts may be overcome by more recent and sophisticated energy functions, but our results are consistent with the inherent energetic importance of planar pi interactions, rather than their observation being due to simple force fields used in refining protein structures. [subsection “Prevalence of Pi contacts in the PDB”, last paragraph]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3b) Although the analysis of the dynameomics simulations looks interesting, it should be noted that these simulations were performed with a relatively old force field, and that more recent and accurate force fields exist. Although all fixed charge force fields share the same basic functional form, the higher accuracy in more modern force fields would likely mean greater structural stability overall. Thus, whether or not the Pi-Pi interactions are lost in these simulations have little to say about the force fields that are more commonly used in the field nowadays. An interaction not accounted for explicitly in a MD force field could still be accounted for implicitly by the force field which is obtained by fitting to empirical data. For a reference point, past studies (Gallivan and Dougherty, PNAS 1999) showed that although pi-cation interactions are not explicitly accounted for in OPLS-AA force field for MD, but the energy calculation of Lys-Phe and Arg-Phe interaction using this force field correlates reasonably well with the quantum results. MD force fields have been much improved from then.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified in the text that this is not a systemic analysis of modern force fields, and specifically refer to the database as “older”, shown above in the response to point 3b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3d) Both in the MD calculations and Rosetta calculations the benchmark is the number of Pi-Pi contacts found in the crystalline state. In the case of salt bridges, it has been demonstrated by NMR in at least one case that a set of salt bridges found in the crystal structure are absent in solution (JH Tomlinson et al., JACS, 2009). In such cases, the expected (real) behaviour would be that the interactions found in the XR structure should dissolve in solution. From a cursory comparison between the contact frequencies in Xray structures (Appendix—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and NMR structures (Appendix—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), it appears there are fewer contacts in the solution state – even when the NMR structures have many constraints. Could this be due to real differences between the two states (and also temperature differences), and would this imply that the loss of contacts e.g. upon minimization (Appendix—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) represents reality?</p></disp-quote><p>The temperatures at which crystal structures are solved likely play a role in the frequency of contacts, but, other than crystal packing artifacts, those contacts do represent a real low energy state for the groups involved. In terms of assessing whether or not the NMR frequencies represent the real solution state behavior, we point out that i) the top values obtained from the most constrained quartile measurements in Appendix—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> do not imply that those constraints are comprehensive, ii) even in NMR structures with many constraints overall specific residues types can be still be left completely unassigned, and iii) in the handful of structures in which every sp2 group type can be observed in the constraints there are never any constraints to oxygen atoms, so planar geometry of oxygen containing groups is largely unconstrained. This problem with the geometry of the constraints is true even for otherwise well-assigned residues like aromatic sidechains, because there is also the issue that planar atoms are often ambiguous, and modeling protocols have a variety of ways of treating that. One of the most common ways involves treating ambiguous pairs of atoms (e.g., Phe Hdelta1, Hdelta2) as a single pseudoatom located at the center of the plane, and we can show that this modeling decision alone results in a significant drop in pi-contact frequencies. Thus, while the actual solution state sampling rate of these contacts is expected to be lower than those seen in crystal structures solved at low temperatures, even the highest frequencies observed in the NMR set are likely lower than the expected real solution state behavior. By extension, the loss of 90% of contacts upon minimization would not represent reality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3e) The way the data is presented in Appendix—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">figure 3C</xref> is confusing. Why not simply compare the experiment and calculated numbers? Also, the Protherm database is notoriously problematic, and curated versions exist (e.g. Conchuir et al., PLOS ONE, 2015 or Kellogg et al., Proteins, 2010).</p></disp-quote><p>We have redone this analysis with the Conchuir et al. curated version, and have changed the presentation to focus on correlation values (both with and without the removal of outliers).
