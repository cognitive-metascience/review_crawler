cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) drives the transition between planktonic and biofilm growth in many bacterial species. <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> has two surface sensing systems that produce c-di-GMP in response to surface adherence. Current thinking in the field is that once cells attach to a surface, they uniformly respond by producing c-di-GMP. Here, we describe how the Wsp system generates heterogeneity in surface sensing, resulting in two physiologically distinct subpopulations of cells. One subpopulation has elevated c-di-GMP and produces biofilm matrix, serving as the founders of initial microcolonies. The other subpopulation has low c-di-GMP and engages in surface motility, allowing for exploration of the surface. We also show that this heterogeneity strongly correlates to surface behavior for descendent cells. Together, our results suggest that after surface attachment, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> engages in a division of labor that persists across generations, accelerating early biofilm formation and surface exploration.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacteria can adopt different lifestyles, depending on the environment in which they grow. They can exist as single cells that are free to explore their environment or group together to form ‘biofilms’. The bacteria in biofilms stick to a surface, and produce a slimy ‘matrix’ that covers and thereby protects them. Biofilms have been found in lung infections that affect people with the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis, and can also form on the surface of medical implants. Because the biofilm lifestyle protects bacteria from the immune system and antimicrobial drugs, learning about how biofilms form could help researchers to discover ways to prevent and treat such infections.</p><p>Many bacteria switch between the free-living and biofilm lifestyles by altering their levels of a signaling molecule called cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (called c-di-GMP for short). Bacteria living in biofilms have much higher levels of c-di-GMP than their free-living counterparts, and bacteria that have high levels of c-di-GMP produce more biofilm matrix.</p><p>Bacteria called <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> use a protein signaling complex called the Wsp system to sense that they are on a surface and increase c-di-GMP production. Questions remained about how quickly this change in production occurs, and whether bacteria pass on their c-di-GMP levels to the new descendant cells when they divide.</p><p>Armbruster et al. monitored individual cells of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> producing c-di-GMP as they began to form biofilms. Unexpectedly, not all cells increased their c-di-GMP levels when they first attached to a surface. Instead, Armbruster et al. found that there are two populations – high and low c-di-GMP cells – that each perform complementary and important tasks in the early stages of biofilm formation.</p><p>The high c-di-GMP cells represent ‘biofilm founders’ that start to produce the biofilm matrix, whereas the low c-di-GMP cells represent ‘surface explorers’ that spend more time traveling along the surface. Armbruster et al. found that the Wsp surface sensing system generates these two populations of cells. Moreover, the c-di-GMP levels in a bacterial cell even affect the behavior of the descendant cells that form when it divides. This effect can persist for several cell generations.</p><p>More work is needed to examine exactly how the biofilm founders and surface explorers interact and influence how biofilms form, and to discover if blocking c-di-GMP signaling prevents biofilm formation. This could ultimately lead to new strategies to prevent and treat infections in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas

opportunistic pathogen that engages in a range of surface-associated behaviors and is a model bacterium for studies of surface-associated communities called biofilms. Biofilms are dense aggregates of cells producing extracellular matrix components that hold the community together. The biofilm mode of growth is beneficial for bacteria in that it allows cells to maintain close proximity to nutrients, promotes exchange of genetic material, and confers cells protection from a variety of chemical and environmental stresses (e.g. nutrient limitation, desiccation, and shear forces), as well as engulfment by protozoa in the environment or by phagocytes in a host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davey and O'toole, 2000</xref>). Collectively, these advantages make biofilm formation integral to prokaryotic life.</p><p>The secondary messenger signaling molecule cylic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) controls the transition between the planktonic to the biofilm mode of growth. In many bacterial species, including <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, elevated c-di-GMP results in repression of flagellar motility genes, while promoting expression of genes involved in producing a biofilm matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Römling et al., 2013</xref>). The <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm matrix is composed of a combination of polysaccharides (including Pel and Psl), proteins (including the adhesin CdrA), and extracellular DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al., 2009</xref>). Biofilm matrix production is an energetically costly process that is regulated at multiple levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wei and Ma, 2013</xref>). The <italic>cdrA, pel</italic> and <italic>psl</italic> genes are all transcriptionally induced under conditions of high c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Starkey et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>For many species, the initial step in biofilm formation involves adherence of free swimming planktonic cells to a surface and the initiation of surface sensing. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has at least two distinct surface sensing systems, the Wsp and the Pil-Chp systems, that when activated, lead to biofilm formation. The Wsp system senses an unknown surface-related signal (recently proposed to be membrane perturbation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>]) through WspA, a membrane-bound protein homologous to methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs). Activation of this system stimulates phosphorylation of the diguanylate cyclase WspR, which leads to the formation of aggregates of phosphorylated WspR (WspR-P) in the form of visible subcellular clusters. This aggregation of WspR-P potentiates its activity, increasing c-di-GMP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huangyutitham et al., 2013</xref>). In comparison, the Pil-Chp chemosensory-like system initiates a hierarchical cascade of second messenger signaling in response to a surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luo et al., 2015</xref>). First, an increase in cellular cAMP levels occurs through activation of the adenylate cyclase CyaB by the Pil-Chp complex. This increases expression of genes involved in type IV pilus biogenesis, including PilY1. PilY1 is associated with the type IV pilus and harbors a Von Willebrand motif, which is involved in mechanosensing in eukaryotic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuchma et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, it has been proposed that this protein may be involved in the mechanosensing of surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Persat et al., 2015</xref>). The output of this second signal is through the diguanylate cyclase, SadC, resulting in an increase in cellular c-di-GMP levels. Unlike the Wsp system, which localizes laterally along the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Connor et al., 2012</xref>), PilY1 is required to be associated with polarly-localized type IV pili in order to stimulate c-di-GMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuchma et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> deploys both polar and laterally localized systems to promote c-di-GMP synthesis in response to a surface.</p><p>Bacteria in biofilms have long been appreciated to exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity due to chemical variation within the biofilm itself, including gradients of oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wessel et al., 2014</xref>), nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schreiber et al., 2016</xref>), and pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vroom et al., 1999</xref>). These environmental conditions are sensed by individual bacterial cells, leading to differential gene expression and metabolic activities even within a genetically homogeneous population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stewart and Franklin, 2008</xref>). Specifically, the term ‘division of labor’ refers to cases where genetic or phenotypic heterogeneity results in subpopulations of cells cooperating to perform distinct tasks that provide an overall fitness benefit to the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">West and Cooper, 2016</xref>). Through task allocation, subpopulations of cells can engage in behaviors that are impossible to perform simulataneously (e.g. bet-hedging strategies between biofilm and planktonic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lowery et al., 2017</xref>]), energetically costly to switch between (e.g. task-switching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldsby et al., 2012</xref>]), or are metabolically incompatible (e.g. photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation in cyanobacteria ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rossetti et al., 2010</xref>]).

We also observed long tails of high GFP fluorescence, particularly at 2 and 4 hr. This suggests that the reporter ‘on’ subpopulation represents cells with a range of high c-di-GMP levels.

Fewer than 1% of wild-type cells grown in broth have a visible WspR-YFP cluster. However, after a short period of growth on an agar surface, WspR-YFP clusters were visible in 30–40% of wild type PAO1 cells, and this is dependent on sensing by the membrane-bound protein WspA, which is laterally distributed in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuchma et al., 2010</xref>). To directly link WspR cluster formation with diguanylate cyclase activity at the cellular level and with surface sensing, we constructed a version of the c-di-GMP reporter that expresses mTFP1 instead of GFP (pP<italic><sub>cdrA</sub>::mTFP1</italic>) to avoid the issue of spectral overlap with WspR-YFP. We monitored reporter activity in two point mutants of WspR (L170D and E253A) that are driven by an inducible promoter, translationally fused to eYFP, and have been previously shown to form large subcellular WspR clusters in a higher percentage of cells than wild-type WspR. The WspR[L170D] protein is highly active for c-di-GMP production, and it forms subcellular clusters in about 75% of agar surface-grown cells. A WspR[E253A] point mutation abolishes diguanylate cyclase activity, but this protein still forms clusters in about 70% of surface-grown cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huangyutitham et al., 2013</xref>).

We predicted that the subpopulation of cells with high c-di-GMP after surface attachment would produce biofilm matrix exopolysaccharides and contribute to initial microcolony formation, while the cells with low c-di-GMP would exhibit increased surface motility and detachment, which is known to be inhibited by exopolysaccharide production. To test this hypothesis, we tracked both reporter activity and surface behavior for cells within a single field of view for 40 hr. From our single-cell tracking data, we generated family trees across at least four generations of cells, using a previously described technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). We tracked the time-averaged P<italic><sub>cdrA</sub>::gfp</italic>ASV reporter activity (I<sub>c-di-GMP</sub>), surface motility behavior (F<sub>motile</sub>, defined as the fraction of time that cells are motile), and detachment behavior (tree asymmetry λ, where λ = 0 represents both daughter cells remaining attached to the surface and λ = 1 represents when one daughter cell detaches or travels outside the field of view).</p><p>In <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, surface exploration is mainly accomplished by type IV pili-mediated twitching motility, and does not appear to be influenced by levels of intracellular c-di-GMP when analyzing single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ribbe et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, when analyzing correlations between c-di-GMP and motility for entire lineages in family trees, we found clear inverse correlations between I<sub>c-di-GMP</sub> and F<sub>motile</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, ρ = −0.53, p=0.0012) and between I<sub>c-di-GMP</sub> and λ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, ρ = −0.45, p=0.0068), suggesting that c-di-GMP levels are strongly inversely correlated with surface motility behavior and detachment behavior over multiple generation of cells. Analyzing these correlations across multiple cell divisions is important because it tells us when and how bacteria respond to c-di-GMP signaling events in terms of their surface motility and detachment. When looking at correlations between c-di-GMP and surface motility, the time between seeing a signaling event (i.e., rise or drop in reporter fluorescence intensity) and seeing a response (i.e., change in motility) can span a broad range (from a few minutes to well over a cell division time). Using a cell’s entire lineage history (i.e., tracking daughter cells across cell divisions) will capture all of these events, whereas using single cell history (i.e., within one generation) will only capture a portion of them. For example, this lineage-level tracking of the influence of signaling events on bacterial behavior was recently shown for correlations between cyclic AMP signaling and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> surface motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, Lee <italic>et al</italic>. found that correlations between cell motility and signaling activity were stronger when they took into account lineage history, rather than using single cell history. However, if there are enough instances where the time between a signaling event and a cell’s corresponding behavioral response are within a single generation, then correlations can still be found when using single cell history. For wild type PAO1 (WT), we observe weaker correlations when looking at individual cells in these lineages. I<sub>c-di-GMP</sub> vs F<sub>motile</sub> for single cells had a Spearman correlation value ρ = −0.40 (p&lt;0.0001), which is smaller than the lineage-level correlation value, suggesting that lineage-level correlations are stronger.</p><p>To illustrate these correlations, we chose three representative families, with either high, intermediate, or low I<sub>c-di-GMP</sub> and plotted their family trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and spatial trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

In contrast, families of cells with low I<sub>c-di-GMP</sub> had the highest F<sub>motile</sub> and λ. For these families, daughter cells frequently detached or traveled outside the field of view, had lower c-di-GMP levels, traveled larger distances on the surface, and ultimately did not form microcolonies (Family 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–E</xref>).</p><p>Tracking and lineage analyses were also performed on a PAO1 mutant with the Wsp system inactivated (PAO1 Δ<italic>wspR</italic>). We observed that the range of tree asymmetry values is like that of WT and that the Δ<italic>wspR</italic> mutant eventually reaches WT c-di-GMP levels despite initially being lower, which is consistent with the observation that the mutant eventually forms WT-like biofilms. What our analysis revealed about the Δ<italic>wspR</italic> strain was quite unexpected: The WspR mutant has overall lower surface motility and, importantly, lacks correlations between c-di-GMP, surface motility, and detachment behavior (both at the level of lineages and at the level of single cells). For single cell surface motility, 23% of Δ<italic>wspR</italic> mutant cells (48 of 210 cells) have non-zero F<sub>motile</sub> (the metric for surface motility) compared to 44% of WT cells (251 of 565 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The overall lowered surface motility and the lack of correlations between c-di-GMP and surface motility in the Δ<italic>wspR</italic> mutant suggest that the Wsp system is involved in translating the heterogeneous c-di-GMP signaling events into the corresponding motility-related responses for cells and their progeny. Therefore, the Wsp system’s multi-generational temporal propagation of surface sensing signaling and behavior is important for the generation of heterogeneous populations of surface motile and immotile cells during early biofilm formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Use of an optogenetic reporter to control bacterial surface behavior at the single-cell level</title><p>One important question is what happens to early biofilm development if we were to effectively remove heterogeneity in c-di-GMP output rooted in the WspR surface sensing system. To address this question, we used a strain in which c-di-GMP production could be easily controlled using an optogenetic system. The precise control of c-di-GMP expression in individual cells was made possible by the use of a chimeric protein that fused a diguanylate cyclase domain to a bacteriophytochrome domain. Flow chambers were seeded with the optogenetic strain encoding a heme oxygenase (<italic>bphO</italic>) and light-responsive diguanylate cyclase (<italic>bphS</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ryu and Gomelsky, 2014</xref>). We initially characterized the optogentic strain and verified the reporter activity increased with exposure of the optogentic strain to red light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and that the laser light did not impact growth or motility (data not shown). Following validation of the strain, cells inoculated on a glass surface were tracked and continuously stimulated with red-light over ~8 hr using adaptive tracking illumination microscopy (ATIM), which allows for precise stimulation of the initial attached cells and their offspring and ensures sustained intracellular c-di-GMP production for a fixed number of surface cell generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Cellular lineages (a cell and all of its offspring) and c-di-GMP reporter activity were continually monitored for at least 12 hr. Families that were not stimulated with light demonstrated a heterogeneous surface response (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>) similar to that of Families 1–3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–E</xref>. Some lineages were dominated by surface explorers, whereas others were seen to commit to microcolony formation. In contrast, in families stimulated with light for more than one generation, the resulting c-di-GMP production artificially forced lineages to have low surface motility and commit to microcolony production (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>) similar to that of Family one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–E</xref>. Families stimulated with light in this manner had higher I<sub>c-di-GMP</sub> and lower λ values than those that were not stimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). We also found that optogenetic control of c-di-GMP results in phenotypes that are consistent with the wild-type behavior presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, with illuminated cells (high c-di-GMP) displaying the least motility and control (non-illuminated) cells displaying comparatively greater surface motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, families stimulated with light for one generation or less are not significantly different from un-illuminated controls (data not shown). Our data show that the generation of c-di-GMP can deterministically lead to the creation of an entire lineage of sessile cells with post-division surface persistence, low motility, and initiation of microcolony formation. Altogether, these results show that c-di-GMP levels, surface motility, and detachment are inversely correlated at the lineage level, and that the time scale for this occurs over multiple generations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Optogenetic control of c-di-GMP production drastically affects family architecture and surface motility.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Spatiotemporal plot of 3 illuminated families (<bold>A</bold>) and three control families (<bold>B</bold>).

Phenotypic heterogeneity of single cells is a common phenomenon in bacteria that can be beneficial at the population level by allowing a single genotype to survive sudden environmental changes. Sources of phenotypic heterogeneity among genetically homogeneous populations include bistability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dubnau and Losick, 2006</xref>) and stochasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>) of gene expression, unequal partitioning of proteins during cell division due to low abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>), epigenetic modifications resulting in phase variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casadesús and Low, 2006</xref>), or through asymmetrical cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kulasekara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laventie et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we show that the Wsp system generates heterogeneity in c-di-GMP signaling, and it is never fully activated in 100% of wild-type, surface-attached cells. One possible outcome of phenotypic heterogeneity is a division of labor between costly behaviors that support the growth and survival of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>). We found that abolishing c-di-GMP heterogeneity through inactivation of WspR leads to defects in early biofilm formation. This suggests that the subpopulations of high c-di-GMP, polysaccharide producers and low c-di-GMP, surface explorers are both required for efficient biofilm formation and that they represent a division of labor during early biofilm formation.</p><p>The data show that Wsp-generated c-di-GMP heterogeneity results in phenotypic changes for entire family lineages of cells. It is interesting that correlations between c-di-GMP, surface motility, and surface detachment probability are stronger when considered for an entire lineage in a bacterial family tree, but weaker when considered at the individual cell level. We think that this difference in the strength of correlations between c-di-GMP and bacterial behavior at the lineage versus single cell level is biologically meaningful and likely reflects the complex relationship between c-di-GMP signaling and type IV pili-mediated motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ribbe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jain et al., 2017</xref>). The time between initiation of a signaling event (i.e., increased intracellular c-di-GMP) and the associated response (i.e., attenuation of motility or initiation of polysaccharide production) can span a large range, depending on the behavior. When examining polysaccharide production, signal propagation appears to be quick, with high c-di-GMP cells initiating exopolysaccharide production within minutes of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> encountering a surface. However, when examining a different bacterial behavior—surface motility—we found the strongest correlation between c-di-GMP signaling and cellular behavior at the lineage level. For many cells, there was a lag between when c-di-GMP first increased and surface motility decreased. While a mother cell may still be surface motile upon initiating c-di-GMP signaling, we found that following cell division, daughter cells with high c-di-GMP eventually became immotile. Thus, whereas an increase in c-di-GMP relatively quickly results in increased biofilm matrix production, this same increase in c-di-GMP likely indirectly influences surface motility. Supporting this, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is known to produce Psl polysaccharide while engaging in type IV pili mediated motility across a surface, leaving behind a trail of Psl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, this apparent multigenerational influence of c-di-GMP signaling on bacterial behavior resembles the recently observed multigenerational memory of cAMP signaling in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Additional work is needed to determine whether surface-naïve daughter cells have any ‘memory’ of surface attachment by a mother cell, through the maintenance of elevated c-di-GMP across one or more cell divisions. Another future direction of this work is to examine whether other bacterial signaling modalities, including other nucleotide or non-nucleotide signaling systems (e.g. ppGpp or quorum sensing), may exhibit similar multigenerational features.</p><p>We observed that the Pil-Chp surface sensing system did not play a role in early c-di-GMP signaling in our experimental system. There are numerous potential explanations for this. For example, it is possible that the Pil-Chp system is the dominant surface sensing mechanism under different environmental conditions than the ones we used for this study. Alternatively, the Pil-Chp system might not contribute to general cytoplasmic pools of c-di-GMP (for which the reporter is sensitive) and instead participates in specific localized c-di-GMP signaling events. In support of this notion, inactivation of individual diguanylate cyclases is well known to lead to distinct changes in c-di-GMP-regulated behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kulasakara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Merritt et al., 2010</xref>). It is interesting to note that whereas the other Pil-Chp inactivation mutants tested did not have a phenotype, the <italic>pilA</italic> deletion mutant strain displayed a slight defect in surface sensing in our study, although why is currently unknown.</p><p>If we overwhelm WspR-generated c-di-GMP heterogeneity by using optogentically-induced sustained c-di-GMP production, we find that phenotypic heterogeneity is lost, and that illuminated cells deterministically become sessile and form microcolonies. Interestingly, our optogenetic experiments show that sustained c-di-GMP production for more than one generation is required before commitment to the sessile lifestyle. This observation is consistent with the fact that we see stronger correlations between c-di-GMP levels and motility behavior at the lineage level compared to the individual cell level. Moreover, since the Wsp surface sensing system generates heterogeneous c-di-GMP levels, this requirement of sustained c-di-GMP production for more than one generation is inherently difficult for wild-type cells to meet, and virtually guarantees the simultaneous existence of motile and sessile subpopulations.</p><p>The heterogeneity we observed in Wsp signaling shares many similarities with phenotypic heterogeneity generated from other c-di-GMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Petersen et al., 2019</xref>) and quorum sensing systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grote et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramalho et al., 2016</xref>). Nucleotide second messenger and quorum sensing (QS) signaling systems are traditionally thought to coordinate cellular behavior in response to information regarding the cell’s environment. However, rather than functioning to initiate a completely homogeneous response at the population level to environmental conditions, a growing body of literature suggests that a common theme of these signaling systems is that they introduce some level of behavioral heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grote et al., 2015</xref>). For example, QS-induced phenotypic heterogeneity in <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> is attributable to variability in the phosphorylation state of LuxO and influences bioluminencence and biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anetzberger et al., 2009</xref>). In <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, heterogeneity in the very low levels of c-di-GMP present during planktonic growth is achieved through asymmetrical cell division and influences swimming motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kulasekara et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> appears to have at least two distinct mechanisms of generating c-di-GMP heterogeneity, which it employs during different modes of growth. In the case of the Wsp system, this phenotypic heterogeneity, which has been ‘hardwired’ into the structure of the Wsp surface sensing network, allows for a division of the labor during early biofilm formation, with one subpopulation committing to initiating the protective biofilm lifestyle, while the other subpopulation is free to explore the surface and potentially colonize distant, perhaps more favorable, locations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>)</td><td>PAO1</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/111024">111024</ext-link></td><td/><td>The version of PAO1 used in this study can be obtained from Matthew Parsek's laboratory.</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pP<italic>cdrA</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic>ASV</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22582064">22582064</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>PAO1 attCTX::<italic>bphS</italic> attMiniTn7:: <italic>mCherry</italic> pP<italic>cdrA</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic>ASV</td><td>This study</td><td>NA</td><td>This strain can be obtained from Fan Jin's laboratory.</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit</td><td>Agilent Technologies</td><td>210519</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Gateway BP Clonase II Enzyme mix</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>11789020</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>LR Clonase II Plus enzyme</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>12538120</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>QIAquick gel extraction kit</td><td>Qiagen</td><td>28115</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>QIAquick PCR purification kit</td><td>Qiagen</td><td>28104</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Antarctic phosphatase</td><td>New England BioLabs</td><td>M0289S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>TRIzol LS</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>10296010</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>RQ1 RNase-Free DNase</td><td>Promega</td><td>M6101</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>iTaq Universal SYBR Green One-Step kit</td><td>Bio-rad</td><td>172–5150</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>TRITC Conjugated Wisteria floribunda lectin</td><td>EY laboratories</td><td>R-3101–1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>TRITC Conjugated Hippeastrum hybrid Lectin (Amaryllis)</td><td>EY laboratories</td><td valign="bottom">R-8008–1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Volocity Image Analysis Software</td><td>Quorum Technologies Inc</td><td valign="bottom">Version 6.00</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>NIS-Elements AR</td><td>Nikon</td><td valign="bottom">Version 4.00</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MATLAB code for tracking experiments</td><td>This study</td><td>Version R2015a</td><td>The code and datasets are available to download as source data files associated with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>.</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox for MATLAB</td><td>MathWorks</td><td>Version R2015a</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Flow cell for time course experiments</td><td>University of Iowa Machine Shop</td><td>Standard dimension flow cell</td><td>Flow cell dimensions: 5 mm x 35 mm x 1 mm</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Flow cell for cell tracking experiments</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18770573">18770573</ext-link></td><td>Standard dimension flow cell</td><td>This flow cell can be ordered from Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>The strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains were routinely grown in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium and on LB agar at 37°C.

Mid-log cells were back diluted into 1% LB or FAB +0.6 mM glutamate and flow chambers were inoculated at a final OD<sub>600</sub> 0.1 and inverted for 10 min to allow cells to attach before induction of flow. Clean media was used to wash non-attached cells by flow at 40 mL per hour for 20 min. Flow was then reduced to a final constant flow rate of 3 mL per hour and bacteria were imaged immediately on a Zeiss LSM 510 scanning confocal laser microscope (t = 0 hr). Flow cells were incubated at a constant flow rate at room temperature and imaged hourly for up to 24 hr. For every strain and time point, 5 fields of view and a minimum of 300 cells were captured using identical microscope settings to image GFP fluorescence across all experiments. Images were analyzed using using Volocity software (Improvision, Coventry, UK). We binned cells by their mean GFP fluorescence intensity per pixel, in incremints of 20 fluorescence units, and determined the cut-off bin that corresponded to cells clearling produced GFP when images were examined by eye. Therefore, cells were counted as pP<italic><sub>cdrA</sub>::gfp</italic><sub>ASV</sub> reporter ‘on’ if their mean GFP fluorescence intensity per pixel was ≥321 fluorescence units.

GFP fluorescence intensities were normalized by calculating the distribution of intensities per cell per frame (extracted by using the binary image as a mask) and then setting the minimum and maximum intensities to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 99<sup>th</sup> percentiles of this distribution for each dataset. I<sub>c-di-GMP</sub> (relative normalized c-di-GMP reporter intensity) was calculated by averaging the normalized fluorescence intensities across all members of a family. F<sub>motile</sub> (fraction of time that cells in a family are motile) was calculated as follows. For each family, every cell trajectory in the family was divided into time intervals. For each time interval, presence or absence of motility was determined using a combination of metrics, including Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) slope, radius of gyration, and visit map. MSD slope quantifies the directionality of movement relative to diffusion. Radius of gyration and visit map are different metrics for quantifying the average distance traveled on the surface. F<sub>motile</sub> was then calculated by the fraction of these time intervals that have motility. This calculation was modified from the ‘TFP activity metric’ previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Setup of Adaptive Tracking Illumination Microscopy</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> shows a schematic of the Adaptive Tracking Illumination Microscopy (ATIM) setup. An inverted fluorescent microscope (Olympus, IX71) was modified to build the ATIM. The modification includes: 1) a commercial DMD-based LED projector (Gimi Z3) was used to replace the original bright-field light source, in which the original lenses in the projector were removed and three-colored (RGB) LEDs were rewired to connect to an external LED driver (ThorLabs) controlled by a single chip microcomputer (Arduino UNO r3); 2) the original bright-field condenser was replaced with an air objective (40× NA = 0.6, Leica); and 3) an additional 850 nm LED light (ThorLabs) was coupled to the illumination optical path using a dichroic mirror (Semrock) for the bright-field illumination. The 850 nm LED bright field light source does not affect optogenetic manipulation. An inverted fluorescent microscope (Olympus, IX71) equipped with a 100× oil objective and a sCMOS camera (Zyla 4.2 Andor) was used to collect bright-field images with 0.2 frame rate. The bright-field images were further analyzed to track multiple single cells in real time using a high-throughput bacterial tracking algorithm coded by Matlab. The projected contours of selected single cells were sent to the DMD (1280 × 760 pixels) that was directly controlled by a commercial desktop through a VGA port. The manipulation lights were generated by the red-color LED (640 nm), and were projected on the single selected cells in real time through the DMD, a multi-band pass filter (446/532/646, Semrock) and the air objective. Our results indicated that feedback illuminations could generate projected patterns to exactly follow the cell movement (Figure 5 – Supplemental 2B) or single cells divisions (Figure 5 – Supplemental 2C) in real time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Manipulation of c-di-GMP expression in single initial-attached cells</title><p>The bacterial strain PAO1-<italic>bphS</italic>-P<italic>cdrA</italic>-GFP-mCherry was inoculated into a flow cell (Denmark Technical University) and continuously cultured at 30.0 ± 0.1 °C by flowing FAB medium (3.0 mL/h). The flow cell was modified by punching a hole with a 5 mm diameter into the channel, and the hole was sealed by a coverslip that allows the manipulation light to pass through. An inverted fluorescent microscope (Olympus, IX71) equipped with a 100× oil objective and a sCMOS camera (Zyla 4.2 Andor) was used to collect bright field or fluorescent images with 0.2 or 1/1800 frame rate respectively. The power density of the manipulation lights was determined by measuring the power at the outlet of the air objective using a power meter (Newport 842-PE). GFP or mCherry was excited using a 480 nm or 565 nm LED lights (ThorLabs) and imaged using single-band emission filters (Semrock): GFP (520/28 nm) or mCherry (631/36 nm). Initial-attached cells were selected to be manipulated using ATIM with the illumination at 0.05 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, which allowed us to compare the results arising from illuminated or un-illuminated mobile cells in one experiment. The c-di-GMP levels in single cells were gauged using the ratio of GFP and mCherry intensities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Lectin staining and flow cytometry</title><p>Glass culture tubes were inoculated with 1 mL of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in LB or Jensen’s minimal media at an OD<sub>600</sub> 0.8 and incubated statically at 37°C for 4 hr. Non-adhered cells were removed by washing three times with 2 mL sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Biofilm cells were harvested by vortexing in 1 mL PBS with tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC) conjugated lectins (TRITC-labeled WFL lectin (100 μg/mL; Vector Laboratories) for Pel, TRITC-labeled HHA (100 μg/mL; EY Laboratories) for Psl) and incubated on ice for 5 min. Cells were washed 3 times to remove non-adhered lectin, resuspended in PBS, and immediately analyzed for GFP and TRITC fluorescence on a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Events were gated based on forward and side scatter to remove particles smaller than a single <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cell and large aggregates.</p><p>We used PAO1 cells that did not express GFP (wild type PAO1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>) or constitutively expressed GFP (PAO1 Tn7::P(A1/04/03)::GFPmut; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>) to define a gate for high GFP fluorescence. We validated this gate using a strain in which we expect very high levels of reporter activity (surface grown PAO1 Δ<italic>wspF</italic>Δ<italic>pelA</italic>Δ<italic>pslBCD</italic> harboring pP<italic>cdrA::gfp</italic><sub>ASV</sub>) and saw that 91.6% of cells had high GFP levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>), in agreement with our flow cell characterization of this strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We determined gating for TRITC using cells that had not been stained with TRITC-conjugated lectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A</xref>), as well as two strains that overproduced either Psl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6B</xref>) or Pel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6C</xref>) that were stained with the appropriate TRITC-conjugated lectin.

Cells were fixed with 6% paraformaldehyde for 20 min on ice, then rinsed once with sterile PBS prior to analysis with a FACSAriaII (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Events were gated first to remove debris and large cellular aggregates, and then gated into cells with low and high GFP fluorescence intensity. The low GFP gate was drawn using wild type PAO1 cells without the gfp gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7A</xref>) and the high GFP gate was drawn using both PAO1 Tn7::P(A1/04/03)::GFPmut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7B</xref>) and PAO1 Δ<italic>wspF</italic> Δ<italic>pelA</italic> Δ<italic>pslBCD</italic> P<italic><sub>cdrA</sub>::gfp</italic><sub>ASV</sub> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7C</xref>). As expected, wild type PAO1 pP<italic><sub>cdrA</sub>::gfp</italic><sub>ASV</sub> reporter cells that had been harvested after 4 hr of surface attachment to glass in static LB liquid culture displayed subpopulations of high GFP, reporter ‘on’ cells (30.8% of the population) and ‘off’ (57.2%) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7D</xref>), whereas this same strain grown to mid-log planktonically in LB displayed mostly reporter ‘off’ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7E</xref>). Cells were sorted at 4°C by flow assisted cell sorting (FACS) to collect 100,000 events into TRIzol LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA was extracted from sorted cells by boiling immediately for 10 min and following the manufacturer’s instructions for RNA isolation. DNA was digested by treating with RQ1 Dnase I (Promega, Madison, WI) and samples were checked for genomic DNA contamination by PCR to detect <italic>rplU</italic>. Expression of <italic>pelA</italic>, <italic>pslA</italic>, and <italic>ampR</italic> was measured by quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) using the iTaq Universal SYBR Green One-Step kit (Biorad, Hercules, CA) and a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The ΔΔC<sub>q</sub> was calculated for three independent samples of sorted wild type PAO1 P<italic><sub>cdrA</sub>::gfp</italic><sub>ASV</sub> reporter biofilm cell populations by normalizing PelA and PslA to relative levels of AmpR expression. Data were presented as the average fold change in PelA or PslA expression in the P<italic><sub>cdrA</sub>::gfp</italic><sub>ASV</sub> sorted ‘on’ population (high GFP) relative to the ‘off’ population (low GFP) for the three biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>WspR-YFP foci and pP<italic><sub>cdrA</sub></italic>::<italic>mTFP1</italic> reporter</title><p>A version of the pP<italic>cdrA</italic> reporter was constructed in the pBBR1MCS5 plasmid to express mTFP1 instead of GFP, for use with YFP-tagged WspR proteins. The P<italic>cdrA</italic> promoter and an enhanced ribosomal binding site from the gene 10 leader sequence of the T7 phage (g10L) was amplified from pUC18-miniTn7T2-P<italic><sub>cdrA</sub></italic>-RBSg10L-<italic>gfp</italic><sub>AGA</sub> using primers SacI-PcdrA-F and SOE-PcdrA-RBSg10L-R. The primers mTFP1-F and KpnI-mTFP1-R were used to amplify the mTFP1 gene from plasmid pNCS-mTFP1 (Allele Biotech, San Diego, CA). The P<italic><sub>cdrA</sub></italic>::RBSg10L::<italic>mTFP1</italic> allele was constructed by SOE-PCR using primers SacI-PcdrA-F and Kpn1-mTFP1-R, then pBBR1MCS5 and the SOE PCR product were doubly digested with SacI/KpnI. Digested pBBR1MCS5 was treated with Antarctic phosphatase, then both digests were gel purified and ligated. The ligation was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α, and plasmid from clones growing on LB with 10 μg/mL gentamycin were sequenced with primers M13F and M13F(−21) (GeneWiz). Fluorescence of the pP<italic><sub>cdrA</sub>::mTFP1</italic> reporter was measured in Wsp mutants in a fluorimeter (BioTek Synergy H1 Hybrid Reader, BioTek Instruments, Inc, Winooski, VT, USA) and in flow cells to confirm its activity resembled that of pP<italic><sub>cdrA</sub>::gfp</italic><sub>ASV</sub>. The pP<italic>cdrA::mTFP1</italic> reporter was electroporated into <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains with the native WspR deleted and harboring an arabinose-inducible copy of WspR-YFP on its chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huangyutitham et al., 2013</xref>). Cells were grown on LB agar plates with 100 μg/mL gentamycin and 1% arabinose for 10 hr, then transferred to an agar pad for imaging of Differential Interference Contrast (DIC), YFP, and TFP. WspR-YFP foci and mTFP1 fluorescence was imaged using a Nikon Ti-E inverted wide-field fluorescence microscope with a large-format scientific complementary metal-oxide semiconductor camera (sCMOS; NEO, Andor Technology, Belfast, United Kingdom) and controlled by NIS-Elements. WspR-YFP foci were detected and pP<italic>cdrA::mTFP1</italic> reporter activity were analyzed using NIS-Elements AR software (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY, USA). Regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to individual cells were determined using DIC images and the average mTFP1 fluorescence was measured within these ROIs. Next, we used essentially the same protocol as previously described for detecting WspR-eYFP foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huangyutitham et al., 2013</xref>), by examining the ratio of the maximum eYFP signal to the mean eYFP signal for each ROI. We verified by eye that the previously determined cut-off ratio of 1.7 accurately represented cells with at least one visible WspR-eYFP focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huangyutitham et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

division of labor in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> populations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Alexandre Persat as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes how heterogeneity in cyclic-di-GMP among <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells drives the early stages of biofilm formation. Specifically, the authors provide evidence that this variation arises largely through the response of the Wsp surface sensing system.</p><p><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> proceeds to form biofilms by initially exploring surfaces. During this stage, surface sensing systems are activated and respond by expressing genes required for robust biofilm formation. At early times, the Pil-Chp system promotes the expression of genes associated with high levels of the second messenger molecule cyclic AMP. Genes associated with the biofilm state are overexpressed through activation of multiple other two-component systems that regulate levels of c-di-GMP, another second messenger. Some of these systems are sensitive to surface contact or shear on longer timescales. However, how single cell surface sensing and increase in c-di-GMP at the single cell level lead to the formation of biofilms remains unknown. Here, the authors track single cell c-di-GMP levels in surface-associated <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> populations to probe how heterogeneity in these levels leads to successful biofilm formation.</p><p>This manuscript is filling a gap in our understanding of how surface sensing and c-di-GMP signaling leads to biofilm formation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We have a few suggestions that we think will help improve the manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) In Figures 1 and 2, measurements are based on a percentage of population being above a threshold fluorescence. The threshold is calculated from background value (not sure if this is cell or camera background) but nevertheless this is arbitrary. The authors should focus on highlighting the complete distribution of fluorescence, including some analysis on the evolution of fluorescence intensity over time for single cells.</p><p>2) Figure 2B assumes that a standing cell has been standing for the whole duration of the experiment, but c-di-GMP levels are likely a result of its history. Thus, information on history of these cells is missing. To draw a conclusion on standing vs. non-standing one needs to look at history of a given cell.</p><p>3) The data presented demonstrates heterogeneity in surface sensing. However, there is no clear demonstration of a link of heterogeneity with surface sensing, and even less of a division of labor. The title is therefore misleading and should probably be revised, unless the authors provide more evidence for the division of labor. A division of labor and phenotypic variation do not necessarily go hand in hand.</p><p>4) Do c-di-GMP levels vary among planktonic cells prior to binding the surface? The variance of the mean in c-di-GMP levels in planktonic cells (Figure 1A) likely represents technical noise, but the broad distribution of c-di-GMP reporter activities in the flow cytometry experiments suggests that the so-called planktonic cells that &quot;leave&quot; the biofilm due to low c-di-GMP (Figure 4) will have varying levels. Figure 1—figure supplement 2 shows that the reporter activity at time 0 (i.e. planktonic) appears &quot;off&quot; but this alone does not confirm that the c-di-GMP levels are not already varying below the detectable level. The main reason why we bring this point to the table is that the detectable heterogeneity in reporter activity, which is already evident at 1 hour (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), could be simply due to the amplification of pre-existing heterogeneity even before &quot;surface sensing&quot;.</p><p>5) As the author showed that cells lacking WspR can still form biofilms after 24h (Figure 4A). It would be interesting to show whether there is a tree asymmetry or a difference in motility (like Figure 4B and C) in WspR deletion mutants. This would definitely show the importance of the Wsp system in generating the heterogeneity of phenotypes in the population upon surface contact. Tracking and lineage analysis should be done in the <italic>wspR</italic> deletion mutant.</p><p>6) Subsection “Cyclic di-GMP heterogeneity leads to diversification in surface exploration at the lineage level”, last paragraph: The optogenetic construct does not appear to have been validated in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Can the authors independently confirm that the construct increases c-di-GMP, either by measuring c-di-GMP or through lectin staining?</p><p>7) &quot;…pP<italic><sub>cdrA</sub></italic> activity was significantly higher in cells with at least one subcellular WspR-eYFP focus…&quot; It is very difficult for the reader to come to this conclusion based on the images given. Can the authors provide quantification of pP<italic><sub>cdrA</sub></italic> for no foci and with foci?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45084.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We have a few suggestions that we think will help improve the manuscript for publication in eLife.</p><p>1) In Figures 1 and 2, measurements are based on a percentage of population being above a threshold fluorescence.

One possibility is that while the overall percentage of “on” cells remains constant, the mean/median fluorescence intensity of the “on” cells may change over time in a biologically meaningful way. To address this comment, we have performed new analyses of the fluorescence intensity of single cells of wild type PAO1 over 12 hours, resulting in two new figures to accompany Figure 1.</p><p>First, new Figure 1—figure supplement 3 shows individual fluorescence values of wild type PAO1 reporter cells over the course of 12 hours and a dotted line is drawn at the cut-off for “off” versus “on” used throughout this study. We also overlaid the median and interquartile range on each timepoint. Examining changes in the median fluorescence value allows us to investigate whether the long tails of GFP fluorescence particularly at 2 and 4 hours represent an early “spike” in c-di-GMP production that levels off over time. Consistent with the message in the initial submission, each timepoint after 0 hours, we can clearly see a subpopulation of “off” cells with GFP fluorescence intensities similar to that of the 0 hours and vector control and an “on” population that increases over time, but never reaches 100% of the population. These results are added in the first paragraph of the subsection “The P<italic><sub>cdrA</sub>::gfp</italic> reporter suggests heterogeneity in c-di-GMP levels during surface sensing”.</p><p>We then examined the evolution of fluorescence intensity over time for single cells by bootstrap sampling of the single cell fluorescence intensity values in the new Figure 1—figure supplements 4 and 5 (p values of time points in Figure 1—figure supplement 4). The purpose of this bootstrapping analysis is to examine whether the distributions of fluorescence intensity differ at each time point. We found that the median fluorescence intensity was significantly different at every timepoint except between 4 and 6 hours, and between 8, 10, and 12 hours. This single cell analysis supports a model in which c-di-GMP signaling is initiated rapidly upon surface attachment in the first 4-6 hours, then the rate of c-di-GMP increase tends to level off at later timepoints. These results have been added to the second paragraph of the aforementioned subsection.</p><p>Finally, we also addressed the reviewers’ concern about the “on/off” cut-off value being arbitrary by clarifying how the cut-off is determined in the Materials and methods subsection “Flow cell time course experiments and confocal microscopy”. Briefly, we found that given the microscope settings used throughout this study, a cell with a mean fluorescence intensity of greater than 320 was visible by eye as expressing GFP. To validate this cutoff value of “on” versus “off”, we confirmed that our vector control strain (the same plasmid containing GFP, but lacking a promoter) was reliably classified as “off” across many experiments, as expected. Importantly, we used the same cut-off value of “on” versus “off” throughout all experiments and have clarified this point throughout the manuscript as needed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2B assumes that a standing cell has been standing for the whole duration of the experiment, but c-di-GMP levels are likely a result of its history. Thus, information on history of these cells is missing. To draw a conclusion on standing vs. non-standing one needs to look at history of a given cell.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge this important point and respectfully disagree with the reviewers’ suggestion that we assume standing cells have been standing for the entire experiment. These data are snapshots in time of cells that are either polarly or laterally-attached, with a certain c-di-GMP level. To address this comment, we have clarified in the Results that the distinction of polar versus lateral refers to the cell’s attachment state at that point in time (and does not reflect the cell’s history) (subsection “The Wsp system is required for surface sensing”, last paragraph).</p><p>We strongly agree with the reviewers on the importance of history, particularly in the history of the entire lineage and not just a single cell. Notably, the polar versus lateral designation of cells in this figure was heavily manually curated because we currently lack a reliable way to make this distinction, while taking into account the fact that growing and dividing cells may be misclassified. This type of analysis, which relies on the ratio of the length to width of the cell, is technically very challenging. For example, a shorter cell that is laterally attached can have the same apparent length/aspect ratio as a more tilted and longer cell. We are currently developing a better technique based on using finite element methods to calculate all diffracted light fields and then perform cross correlation calculations between measured and calculated images to reduce ambiguity in tilt state and utilizing this technique in longitudinal studies (de Anda et al., ACS Nano, 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The data presented demonstrates heterogeneity in surface sensing. However, there is no clear demonstration of a link of heterogeneity with surface sensing, and even less of a division of labor. The title is therefore misleading and should probably be revised, unless the authors provide more evidence for the division of labor. A division of labor and phenotypic variation do not necessarily go hand in hand.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that phenotypic variation and “division of labor” are not equivalent terms. To address this important point and to better support our claim that the subpopulations we identified represent a division of labor specifically, we have expanded our review of these topics as they pertain to biofilm formation and c-di-GMP in the Introduction and expanded our discussion of division of labor in the conclusion section. Specifically, we have linked the heterogeneity we have seen in the surface sensing response to the heterogeneity observed an already published in the Wsp system. Briefly, we found that the Wsp system is required for the phenotypic heterogeneity we observed and that inactivation of WspR leads to defects in early biofilm formation (Figure 4A). This defect in biofilm formation caused by the <italic>wspR</italic> mutation, which abolishes the specialization of cells into surface explorers and polysaccharide producers, supports our claim that this specialization is a division of labor. We have specifically addressed this point in the Results (subsection “Heterogeneity in c-di-GMP levels among cells correlates with Wsp system activity”, last paragraph) and Discussion (first paragraph). In addition, we have amended the title of the article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Do c-di-GMP levels vary among planktonic cells prior to binding the surface? The variance of the mean in c-di-GMP levels in planktonic cells (Figure 1A) likely represents technical noise, but the broad distribution of c-di-GMP reporter activities in the flow cytometry experiments suggests that the so-called planktonic cells that &quot;leave&quot; the biofilm due to low c-di-GMP (Figure 4) will have varying levels. Figure 1—figure supplement 2 shows that the reporter activity at time 0 (i.e. planktonic) appears &quot;off&quot; but this alone does not confirm that the c-di-GMP levels are not already varying below the detectable level. The main reason why we bring this point to the table is that the detectable heterogeneity in reporter activity, which is already evident at 1 hour (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), could be simply due to the amplification of pre-existing heterogeneity even before &quot;surface sensing&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this thoughtful line of inquiry regarding whether c-di-GMP heterogeneity exists prior to surface sensing, which brought to our attention an important citation that we inadvertently left out of our original manuscript. We agree that the variance in c-di-GMP levels at t = 0 hours in our assays likely represents technical noise; however, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells are known to display heterogeneity at very low c-di-GMP levels. We have addressed this question through expanding the review of literature on c-di-GMP heterogeneity in the Introduction section (fifth paragraph), by including a new figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 5) and Results (subsection “The Wsp system is required for surface sensing”, first paragraph), and by including a discussion of c-di-GMP heterogeneity during planktonic versus biofilm growth (Discussion, last paragraph).</p><p>In Kulasekara et al. (2013), they used a FRET-based c-di-GMP reporter to show that planktonic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has heterogeneous, albeit very low, concentrations of c-di-GMP which it achieves through asymmetrical partitioning of a phosphodiesterase (PA5017, also called Pch) to the flagellated cell pole during cell division. We have currently ruled out this mechanism as responsible for the heterogeneity we see during surface sensing by examining a mutant of PA5017 and showing that this strain still exhibited heterogeneity during surface sensing. We feel that the inclusion of this experiment strengthens our conclusion that the heterogeneity we observe during surface sensing represents a distinct mechanism.</p><p>The reviewers also bring up an interesting point relevant to a previous paper (Lee et al., 2018). Cells can attach to and detach and reattach to the surface during the early stages of biofilm formation that we are monitoring. Because of this, sampling the “planktonic” liquid population inside the flow cell at a given time point will give you a heterogeneous mixture of cells that may or may not have been surface-associated at some point. In principle, one can develop the technology to simultaneously track the full multigenerational history of c-di-GMP reporter activity for both cells on the surface and cells swimming in the flow cell volume over the course of biofilm formation. We are working along these directions, but they are outside the scope of the present paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) As the author showed that cells lacking WspR can still form biofilms after 24h (Figure 4A). It would be interesting to show whether there is a tree asymmetry or a difference in motility (like Figure 4B and C) in WspR deletion mutants. This would definitely show the importance of the Wsp system in generating the heterogeneity of phenotypes in the population upon surface contact. Tracking and lineage analysis should be done in the wspR deletion mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>Tracking and lineage analysis have been performed on the Δ<italic>wspR</italic> mutant. From this analysis, we see that the range of tree asymmetry values is like that of WT and that the Δ<italic>wspR</italic> mutant eventually reaches WT c-di-GMP levels despite initially being lower, which is consistent with the observation that the mutant eventually forms WT-like biofilms. What our analysis revealed about Δ<italic>wspR</italic> is quite unexpected: The mutant has overall lower surface motility and importantly, unlike WT, lacks correlations between c-di-GMP, surface motility, and detachment behavior (both at the level of lineages and at the level of single cells). For single cell surface motility, 48/210=23% of Δ<italic>wspR</italic> mutant cells vs. 251/565=44% of WT cells have non-zero F<sub>motile</sub>, the metric for surface motility. The overall lowered surface motility and the lack of correlations between c-di-GMP and surface motility in the Δ<italic>wspR</italic> mutant suggest that the Wsp system is involved in translating the heterogeneous c-di-GMP signaling events into the corresponding motility-related responses for cells and their progeny. This multi-generational temporal propagation of surface sensing signaling and behavior is important for the generation of heterogeneous populations during biofilm formation. One important point we want to emphasize is that one cannot consider the temporal evolution of a single cell independently of the temporal evolution of that cell’s entire lineage. These new data are discussed in the last paragrapah of the subsection “Cyclic di-GMP heterogeneity leads to diversification in surface exploration at the lineage level”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “Cyclic di-GMP heterogeneity leads to diversification in surface exploration at the lineage level”, last paragraph: The optogenetic construct does not appear to have been validated in P. aeruginosa. Can the authors independently confirm that the construct increases c-di-GMP, either by measuring c-di-GMP or through lectin staining?</p></disp-quote><p>To monitor the intracellular c-di-GMP levels, we constructed the c-di-GMP reporter plasmid and electroporated it into mCherry marked <italic>bphS</italic> mutant (see original manuscript Materials and methods). The c-di-GMP levels in single cells were gauged using the ratio of GFP and mCherry intensities (F<sub>G</sub>/F<sub>R</sub>, original manuscript). Huang et al. (2018) had described how they manipulated the c-di-GMP levels via the optogenetic tools in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. To address this comment and validate the c-di-GMP levels dependence of the red light intensity, we have now measured the ratio of GFP and mCherry of strain PAO1-<italic>bphS</italic> -P<italic><sub>cdrA</sub></italic>-GFP-mCherry after illumination with red light of variable intensity(0~0.268 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) and obtained the curve of the time versus the ratio of GFP and mCherry (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1), which had shown that the c-di-GMP levels had increased significantly when strains was illuminated at more than 0.038 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. This new validation is described in the Results subsection “Use of an optogenetic reporter to control bacterial surface behavior at the single-cell level” and in new Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) &quot;…pP<sub>cdrA</sub> activity was significantly higher in cells with at least one subcellular WspR-eYFP focus…&quot; It is very difficult for the reader to come to this conclusion based on the images given. Can the authors provide quantification of pP<sub>cdrA</sub> for no foci and with foci?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the original Figure 3B needed a quantitative analysis. We have now quantified reporter activity in cells with and without a WspR focus. We replaced the old Figure 3C with this quantification, moved the microscopy image to Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and added information regarding this image analysis to the Materials and methods subsection “WspR-YFP foci and pP<italic><sub>cdrA</sub>::mTFP1</italic> reporter”. Importantly, this quantification confirms that cells with a WspR focus have much higher reporter activity, supporting a role for the Wsp system in introducing c-di-GMP heterogeneity during surface sensing.</p></body></sub-article></article>
