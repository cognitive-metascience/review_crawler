However, how PNNs tune cortical function and plasticity is unknown. We found that PNNs modulated the gain of visual responses and γ-oscillations in the adult mouse visual cortex in vivo, consistent with increased interneuron function. Removal of PNNs in adult V1 did not affect GABAergic neurotransmission from PV cells, nor neuronal excitability in layer 4. Importantly, PNN degradation coupled to sensory input potentiated glutamatergic thalamic synapses selectively onto PV cells. In the absence of PNNs, increased thalamic PV-cell recruitment modulated feed-forward inhibition differently on PV cells and pyramidal neurons. These effects depended on visual input, as they were strongly attenuated by monocular deprivation in PNN-depleted adult mice. Thus, PNNs control visual processing and plasticity by selectively setting the strength of thalamic recruitment of PV cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41520.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our brains continue to develop after we are born. As sights, sounds and smells flood our senses, networks of neurons go through periods of rapid rewiring. Known as ‘postnatal critical periods’, the brain uses these periods to adapt to the signals supplied by our senses. For example, a postnatal critical period exists where infants develop the ability to process what they can see. If their vision is blocked until after the end of the critical period, they may not ever fully gain normal vision.</p><p>In the outer layer of the brain, known as the cortex, neurons called parvalbumin basket cells appear to help to regulate critical periods. The basket cells synchronize the activity of groups of neurons, creating rhythmic patterns of neural impulses. In the visual cortex these patterns are the brain's way of representing incoming information from the eyes.</p><p>When a critical period ends, dense nets of protein and sugar start to form around the basket cells in the neural circuit. Dissolving the nets in adult animals re-activates the ability of the circuit to rewire its connections. How the nets limit this rewiring in the first place was not known.</p><p>Faini et al. have now investigated the role of the nets on the visual cortex of adult mice. Monitoring the activity of neurons revealed that the nets around basket cells ‘muffle’ an important circuit that forms part of the visual pathway. The nets reduce the strength of incoming signals from the eyes before they reach the basket cells. Disrupting the nets allows the visual signals to get through and enables the connections between neurons to respond in a similar way to their behaviour during the postnatal critical period. However, these changes in neural activity were much reduced in mice that had been prevented from seeing out of one eye. This emphasizes the importance of sensory input for rewiring neural circuits.</p><p>Faini et al. propose that the build-up of nets helps to protect basket cells in the visual cortex from being over-activated by sensory circuits. But this comes at the cost of reducing the ability of the neurons to form new connections, hence making learning and acquiring new skills more difficult.</p><p>The brains of individuals with psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and some forms of autism show disrupted nets around basket cells. Investigating the roles of these nets in more detail could therefore help researchers to develop new treatments for such conditions. More widely, understanding precisely how cortical circuits lose their ability to rewire themselves improves our knowledge of how we learn and store memories.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During postnatal maturation, sensory processing goes through a critical period (CP), a developmental interval, in which neural circuits are shaped by sensory experience. After this time window, plasticity declines significantly, and learning becomes more difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hensch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Espinosa and Stryker, 2012</xref>). In the visual cortex, the closure of the CP is paralleled by the structural maturation of the extracellular matrix, and, in particular, of perineuronal nets (PNNs). These are composed by a conglomeration of chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans, extracellular matrix and cell-adhesion molecules that, in the neocortex, accumulates selectively around fast-spiking, PV basket cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pizzorusso et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berardi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernard and Prochiantz, 2016</xref>). Importantly, chemical breakdown of PNNs reactivates ocular dominance plasticity in the adult visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pizzorusso et al., 2002</xref>), promotes juvenile forms of extinction of fear memories in the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gogolla et al., 2009</xref>) and functional recovery after brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bradbury et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gherardini et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, PNNs were proposed to act as a structural brake to experience-dependent plasticity, restricting the extent to which a neural circuit can change during late postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berardi et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>PV cells represent a major subtype of cortical GABAergic interneurons, specialized in providing fast and reliable perisomatic inhibition to principal neurons (PNs), thereby controlling their output spiking properties and driving network oscillations in the β-γ-frequency range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freund and Katona, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to controlling cortical circuit activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hensch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>), PV cells shape sensory plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fagiolini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hensch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donato et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Toyoizumi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuhlman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gogolla et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lensjø et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takesian et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, the strength of inhibition from PV cells was proposed to define the temporal window of the CP of cortical plasticity: increasing GABAergic neurotransmission accelerates the onset of the CP, whereas a reduction of inhibition delays the onset of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fagiolini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hensch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hensch and Fagiolini, 2005</xref>). Despite the mechanisms underlying the CP have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hensch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hübener and Bonhoeffer, 2014</xref>), very little is known about how PNN accumulation around PV cells changes the cellular and synaptic properties of these interneurons, thus affecting cortical circuits and limiting plasticity. In this context, it is crucial to pinpoint the functional mechanisms linking PNN accumulation around PV cells to its modulation of activity-dependent plasticity. Indeed, accumulating evidence indicates that dysfunctions of cortical circuits involving PV cells as well as PNN maturation are implicated in several psychiatric diseases including autism and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marín, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sorg et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe how PNN removal in adult mice altered the gain of visual processing and the power of γ-oscillations in vivo; we reveal the underlying synaptic circuitry and its sensitivity to sensory plasticity. In particular, we found that PNNs set the strength of thalamic inputs to PV cells selectively, leaving neuronal excitability and unitary synaptic GABAergic transmission from these interneurons intact. This resulted in a strong and differential modulation of feed-forward inhibition onto PNs and other PV cells. Importantly, plasticity induced by short monocular deprivation (MD) strongly attenuated these effects, indicating that PNN-mediated modulation of thalamic input onto PV cells depends on visual activity. These results reveal the synaptic and circuit mechanisms by which PNNs restrict sensory plasticity in the adult visual cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PNN removal in adult mice increases the contrast adaptation gain and the power of γ-oscillations</title><p>To test the effects of in vivo PNN removal on adult cortical circuit function, we stereotaxically injected the primary visual cortex (V1) of adult mice (&gt;P70) with the bacterial enzyme chondroitinase ABC (ChABC), 2–3 days prior to electrophysiological experiments (see Materials and methods). This is a standard procedure to effectively and locally disrupt PNNs, revealed by the absence of <italic>Wisteria floribunda</italic> agglutinin staining (WFA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pizzorusso et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lensjø et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, this approach was shown to re-open adult cortical plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pizzorusso et al., 2002</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vivo et al., 2013</xref>). We first measured gain adaptation of contrast perception, which is a fundamental computation performed by the primary visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carandini and Ferster, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atallah et al., 2012</xref>). We recorded visually-evoked extracellular potentials (VEPs) in V1 of adult mice in response to an alternating checkerboard of varying contrast presented to the contralateral eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). We found an enhancement of adaptation in ChABC-injected animals, measured as a significant decrease of the slope of the transfer function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Moreover, the spectral power of the local field potential during both resting state and visual activity was increased by ChABC treatment in the high γ-frequency band (40–80 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–I</xref>) consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lensjø et al., 2017</xref>). It should be pointed out that the power increment associated to the visual stimulation has a large bandwidth, consistent with the fact that the checkerboard reversal is an intrinsically transient stimulus that produces a response of brief duration. More prolonged stimuli, like drifting gratings, cause a longer response associated to a stricter bandwidth of the oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Welle and Contreras, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Veit et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, PV cells are known to strongly modulate the gain of contrast sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atallah et al., 2012</xref>), and improve network synchrony during γ-oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sohal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>).

First, we studied intracortical circuitry but, surprisingly, we found a very low yield of connected intracortical PN-PV cell pairs in L4 of adult mice (5%, n = 104), as opposed to young animals (40%, n = 20; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), likely because of re-routing of PN axons to L2/3 in adult mice. Therefore, we focused our attention on the thalamocortical pathway, which carries sensory information. Using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), we expressed the light-sensitive opsin channelrhodospin 2 (ChR2) in the dorsolateral geniculate visual thalamic nucleus (dLGN) of adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>; see Materials and Methods). After 10–12 days, we injected either sham solution or ChABC in V1 of the same mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A</xref>), and, in some cases, MD was performed at the time of ChABC/sham injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A</xref>). In the absence of PNNs, PV cells exhibited larger light-evoked monosynaptic thalamocortical responses (in the presence of TTX and the K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker 4-aminopyridine, 4-AP; see Materials and Methods) than in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, Table S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We analyzed threshold responses to reduce the risk of misinterpreting our results due to variable expression of ChR2 in different mice. Threshold responses were obtained by setting the power of light stimuli yielding alternating synaptic failures and responses (see Materials and Methods). Of note, light stimulation parameters used to evoke threshold responses were overall similar across different animal groups in all conditions (Table S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; p &gt; 0.05). Importantly, plasticity induced by MD significantly attenuated the potentiated recruitment of PV cells by thalamic afferents in the absence of PNNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>; Table S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; size effect Glass’ delta: 2.11 vs. 1.75; control vs. MD, respectively, see Materials and Methods). Similarly to spontaneous glutamatergic neurotransmission, PNN digestion did not affect monosynaptic thalamocortical recruitment of PNs, both in the absence and presence of MD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M,N</xref>; Table S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). AAVs can produce anterograde infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zingg et al., 2017</xref>). However, in our hands, we never detected mCherry- (and thus ChR2-) positive cell bodies in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6C,D</xref>), thus excluding a possible contamination of intracortical responses in our experiments.</p><p>These results indicate that PNN accumulation controls the strength of thalamic glutamatergic synapses onto PV cells selectively, and this is forcibly modulated by visual activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PNNs do not directly affect GABAergic synapses to and from PV cells</title><p>Cortical plasticity is strongly modulated by inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fagiolini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hensch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Toyoizumi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuhlman et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, we found that removal of PNNs is consistent with a more strongly inhibited cortical network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sohal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atallah et al., 2012</xref>), and enhanced recruitment of PV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To test directly if PNN disruption in adult mice changed inhibitory synapses onto PV cells and PNs, we pharmacologically isolated spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (s- and mIPSCs), using a high-chloride intracellular solution, in the continuous presence of glutamate receptor antagonists (see Materials and Methods). We found that sIPSC amplitude and frequency onto PV cells were increased upon removal of PNNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>; Table S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Interestingly, however, AP-independent quantal mIPSC transmission was not affected by PNN removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>; Table S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These results indicate that spontaneous GABAergic transmission onto PV cells was due to a network effect, rather than a direct synaptic alteration. Plasticity induced by sensory deprivation prevented the ChABC-mediated increase of sIPSC amplitudes, whereas frequency was still increased in PNN-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref>; Table S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Importantly, we did not find any change in sIPSCs in PNs following ChABC injection, both in the absence and presence of MD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4E–H</xref>; Table S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To directly test whether local GABAergic synapses to and from PV cells were not affected by PNN removal, we performed simultaneous recordings in PV-PV and PV-PN connected pairs, in the presence and absence of MD. In addition, PV-PV inhibitory connections were also examined as autaptic self-inhibiting responses, which are highly common in neocortical PV cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deleuze et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Overall, we found that PNN disruption did not alter unitary GABAergic transmission from PV cells onto themselves, other PV cells and PNs, in terms of magnitude and short-term plasticity, both in the absence and presence of MD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–T</xref>; Table S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41520.017</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>PNNs do not directly affect GABAergic synapses to and from PV cells.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Example voltage-clamp traces (<bold>A</bold>) and summary plots (<bold>B</bold>) of sIPSCs recorded in PV cells in control animals (Sham, grey) and after ChABC treatment (ChABC, red).

Increased thalamic recruitment of PV cells in the absence of PNNs strongly affects FFI differentially in PV cells and PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

This primary direct effect leads to a secondary network effect, namely an increase of feed-forward inhibition onto PV cells as well as onto PNs.

However, CSPGs are also diffusely present in the entire extracellular environment. Thus, ChABC disrupts the entire extracellular matrix beyond PNNs, possibly leading to compounding effects on PV cell circuits, unrelated to PNNs. For these reasons, in all our experiments (both in control and MD), we have recorded from both PV cells and PNs. We did not observe any change in PNs in any parameter we investigated (AP waveform, firing dynamics, sEPSCs, sIPSCS, uIPSCs and thalamic glutamatergic activation), as opposed to PV cells. We thus conclude that the effects that we report in the manuscript are due to PNN accumulation around these interneurons. Importantly, our approach is known to re-open visual plasticity in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pizzorusso et al., 2002</xref>). Accordingly, it has been recently demonstrated that genetic ablation of aggrecan (and thus PNN structure) in adult mice results in the re-opening of cortical plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rowlands et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Reduced gain of contrast sensitivity and increased power of γ-oscillations are consistent with increased activity of PV interneurons. Indeed, optogenetic activation of PV cells was shown to have a strong effect on the gain of visual contrast sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atallah et al., 2012</xref>), and determine the level of γ-power and information transfer in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sohal et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the PNN-dependent effects shown here are consistent with either increased PV-cell excitability and firing, and/or altered synaptic transmission to and from these cells. Indeed, it has been suggested that removal of PNNs in the adult results in alterations of AP waveform and firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dityatev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balmer, 2016</xref>). In contrast, here we show that intrinsic excitability of PV cells and PNs is not affected by in vivo enzymatic digestion of PNNs in the adult visual cortex. This discrepancy could be due to different approaches used to remove or diminish the expression of PNNs: in vivo vs. in vitro digestion, or genetic downregulation. Indeed, acute in vitro digestion of PNNs might not entirely recapitulate the actual remodeling of cortical networks induced by visual input. In addition, genetic downregulation of brevican (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Favuzzi et al., 2017</xref>), a key component of the extracellular matrix, could be prone to developmental and/or homeostatic processes that we did not induce here, due to the relatively short depletion of PNNs in adult animals, known to re-open visual plasticity in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pizzorusso et al., 2002</xref>). The enzymatic disruption of PNNs is advantageous, because it relies on an acute degradation (2–3 days) at a mature developmental stage when cortical circuits are fully developed. Compensatory effects are minimal during such a short time of PNN degradation, thus allowing dissecting the exact mechanism underlying the re-opening of cortical plasticity, without other developmental effects present when PNNs are removed genetically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Favuzzi et al., 2017</xref>). These developmental studies are extremely important, but they address a different question, centered on the development of cortical circuits in the absence of PNNs. Interestingly, recent evidence indicates a similar re-opening of cortical plasticity in a specific mouse model, in which PNNs were genetically knocked out in PV cells from adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rowlands et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Another important mechanism by which PNNs might limit cortical plasticity could be attributed to decreased inhibition from PV cells. A recent study suggest that reduced cortical GABAergic neurotransmission is responsible for unlocking juvenile plasticity in adult animals, although this was not tested directly, but inferred by spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lensjø et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, here we show that network-induced FFI and AP-dependent spontaneous synaptic inhibitory neurotransmission were rather enhanced by PNN removal, although quantal and unitary GABAergic neurotransmission were not affected. These results strongly suggest that increased thalamic glutamatergic strength onto PV cells increases network-dependent FFI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The enhanced thalamic recruitment of PV cells and the consequent network-driven increase of GABAergic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>) explain the reduction of the gain of contrast adaptation and the enhancement of γ-oscillations measured in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), as they are both consistent with increased activity of PV cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sohal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atallah et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Increased FFI onto PV cells and PNs was most likely due to a ChABC-mediated effect on PV-cell recruitment and not on unitary GABAergic responses, as they were not affected by PNN depletion, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Interestingly, FFI on PV interneurons was much more sensitive to the presence of PNNs than FFI on PNs. This well agrees with the PV cell-specific modulation of sIPSCs by PNNs. The stronger sensitivity of FFI onto PV cells, could be due to the significantly stronger unitary PV-PV connections, as compared to PV-PN synapses (p &lt; 0.05). The preferential PNN-mediated alteration of FFI onto PV cells might favor L4 circuit disinhibition (and thus paradoxical excitation) for visual stimulations at low intensities, whereas FFI on PNs becomes more prominent at stronger visual stimuli, thus reducing the gain of the visual adaptation curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, PNN-dependent modulation of FFI in L4 might affect spike-timing precision of both PV cells and PNs, and change the integration window during the initial steps of sensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gabernet et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The increased glutamatergic recruitment of PV cells induced by PNN degradation could result from alterations induced in the pre- or postsynaptic site (or both). Our optogenetic approach does not allow dissecting the precise synaptic site affected by PNN degradation. This is especially true for the protocol used to isolate thalamocortical inputs onto PV cells and PNs, which is nonetheless useful to prevent unwanted multi-synaptic activity, typical of these powerful synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>), but it compromises the analysis of presynaptic release probability. The increase of mEPSC frequency but not amplitude on PV cells, induced by PNN degradation, suggests a presynaptic modulation. Yet, future experiments will be necessary to unequivocally determine whether the absence of PNNs alters thalamic synapses via pre- or postsynaptic mechanisms.</p><p>Our MD results demonstrate that the potentiated thalamic recruitment in the absence of PNNs depends on visual activity. A small, albeit significant, reduction of PV-cell and PN recruitment induced by sensory deprivation in adult mice is present also in control conditions (p &lt; 0.05; not shown), suggesting that 2–3 days of MD are sufficient to slightly downregulate contralateral thalamic input in the binocular cortex. However, in the absence of PNNs, MD effects are more pronounced. Therefore, we conclude that the MD-dependent reduction of PV-cell recruitment is likely the mechanism that is responsible for re-opening cortical plasticity following PNN degradation in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pizzorusso et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rowlands et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, this effect is similar to that occurring in young animals during the CP, in which sensory deprivation reduces the firing rate of PV cells due to a decrease of synaptic excitatory drive onto these interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuhlman et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, we found a significant reduction of glutamatergic synaptic strength selectively on PV cells, during a post-CP maturation window that is paralleled by enrichment of PNNs around PV cells. The lack of changes of the inhibitory strength during the post-CP development suggest that the accumulation of PNNs is associated to a change in the excitatory-to-inhibitory ratio only onto PV cells, and that might be responsible for the closure of cortical plasticity in the adult.</p><p>Importantly, visual cortical plasticity during CP results from overall decreased inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hensch, 2005</xref>). Accordingly, we also detect a decrease of action potential-dependent inhibition (both on PV cells and PNs), when we induce plasticity with MD. In order to induce plasticity in the adult, however, glutamatergic recruitment of PV cells (and consequently their inhibitory activity) has to increase (as it happens during the CP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuhlman et al., 2013</xref>). When PNNs are removed, glutamatergic synapses are enhanced, AP-dependent inhibition too, and this boost is subject to sensory-dependent plasticity that we measured as a decreased level of inhibition.</p><p>We conclude that PNN accumulation during post-CP development might exert a protective role, selectively dampening thalamic excitation of PV cells (and thus excessive cortical circuit inhibition) at the expense of reducing cortical plasticity. Age-dependent reduction of plasticity of thalamic synapses onto PV cells might be thus instrumental for correct mature sensory representation. Accordingly, deficits in PNN formation during development have been associated with brain diseases involving altered sensory perception, such as schizophrenia and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sorg et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experimental procedures followed National and European guidelines, and have been approved by the authors' institutional review boards (French Ministry of Research and Innovation and Italian Ministry of Health).

The brain was then quickly removed (for groups of mice aged &lt;P20, this procedure started right after deep anesthesia) and immersed in the same cutting choline-based solution (4°C, equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Slices were cut with a vibratome (Leica VT1200S) in cutting solution and then incubated in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aSCF) composed of (in mM): 126 NaCl, 20 glucose, 26 NaHCO<sub>3,</sub> 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.35, 310-320mOsm/L), initially at 34°C for 30 min, and subsequently at room temperature, before being transferred to the recording chamber where recordings were obtained at 30–32°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Slice electrophysiology and optogenetic stimulation</title><p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in L4 of the primary visual cortex neurons V1. In MD animals, cells were patched in the binocular portion V1b. Inhibitory PV-expressing interneurons, labeled with GFP, were identified using LED illumination (OptoLED, blue, λ = 470 nm, Cairn Research, Faversham, UK) and by their typical fast-spiking firing behavior in response to depolarizing DC current steps. Excitatory principal neurons (PNs) were visually identified using infrared video microscopy by their relatively small size round cell body and no apical dendrites. Accordingly, when depolarized with DC current pulses PNs exhibited a typical firing pattern of regular-spiking cells. We used different intracellular solutions depending on the type of experiment and the nature of the responses we wanted to assess. To study intrinsic excitability, AP waveform and glutamatergic spontaneous transmission, electrodes were filled with an intracellular solution containing (in mM): 127 K-gluconate, 6 KCl, 10 Hepes, 1 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP; pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH; 290–300 mOsm. The estimated reversal potential for chloride (E<sub>Cl</sub>) was approximately −69 mV based on the Nernst equation. To measure GABAergic currents (both sIPSCs and uIPSCs in paired recordings), neurons were recorded using an intracellular solution containing (in mM): 65 K-gluconate, 70 KCl, 10 Hepes, 1 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP; pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH; 290–300 mOsm. The estimated E<sub>Cl</sub> was approximately −16 mV based on the Nernst equation. Under these recording conditions, activation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors resulted in inward currents at a holding potential (V<sub>h</sub>) of −70 mV. Experiments using optical stimulation of ChR2-positive thalamocortical fibers were done with a cesium-based intracellular solution containing (in mM): 125 CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 3 CsCl, 10 Hepes, 5 EGTA, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 5 QX314-Cl; pH adjusted to 7.3 with CsOH; 290–300 mOsm. This solution allowed voltage-clamping neurons at various membrane potentials. E<sub>Cl-</sub> was approximately −63 mV based on the Nernst equation. Voltage values were not corrected for liquid junction potential. Patch electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries and had a typical tip resistance of 2–3 MΩ. Signals were amplified with a Multiclamp 700B patch-clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices), sampled at 20–50 KHz and filtered at 4 KHz (for voltage-clamp experiments) and 10 KHz (for current-clamp experiments). Signals were digitized with a Digidata 1440A and acquired, using the pClamp 10 software package (Molecular Devices).</p><p><italic>For intrinsic excitability experiments,</italic> neurons were recorded in current-clamp mode. In order to avoid any contribution of differences and variations in the membrane resistance (R<sub>m</sub>) on the frequency-current curves, the injected current was adjusted in each cell as a function of R<sub>m</sub>. This value was determined by the Ohm’s law (I= ΔV/R<sub>m</sub>): we injected an amount of current (I) to obtain a ΔV of ~10 mV, depending on the actual R<sub>m</sub> of each cell, and increasing the amount of depolarizing current to obtain a ΔV of 5 mV, for a total of 15 current steps.</p><p>Single AP were obtained by injecting brief (2 ms) current steps of increasing amplitude from a Vm of ~ −70 mV in order to determine the minimal current intensity required to elicit a spike in each cell. This current was then injected 20 times and we averaged the trials for each cell from which we calculated the first derivative of the Vm and constructed planar phase plots to extract AP threshold values.</p><p><italic>Synaptic events</italic> were recorded in voltage clamp mode for at least 2–3 min. EPSCs (spontaneous and miniatures) were isolated by clamping the cells at −70 mV, using an intracellular solution containing [Cl<sup>-</sup>] yielding a E<sub>Cl-</sub> ~ −69 mV. In some experiments, we applied the glutamate receptor antagonist DNQX at the end of the recording and we could not detect any residual response (not shown). GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated currents where pharmacologically isolated by applying 10 µM of DNQX while recorded neurons at −70 mV, using an intracellular solution with a [Cl<sup>-</sup>] yielding a calculated E<sub>Cl-</sub> of ~ −16 mV.</p><p><italic>For paired recordings</italic>, unitary synaptic responses were elicited in voltage-clamp mode by brief somatic depolarizing steps evoking action currents in presynaptic cells. We used a high-chloride intracellular solution (E<sub>Cl</sub> ~ −16 mV), which allowed us measuring glutamatergic (PN-PV) and GABAergic synaptic responses (PV-PN, PV-PV and autapses) simultaneously. Neurons were held at −80 mV and a train of 5 presynaptic spikes at 50 Hz was applied to infer short-term plasticity of synaptic responses.</p><p><italic>Optical stimulation:</italic> ChR2 activation was obtained by brief (0.3 and 1.0 ms) light flashes on cortical slices, using a blue LED (λ = 470 nm; Thorlab) collimated and coupled to the epifluorescence path of an Olympus BX51 microscope mounting a 60 X water immersion objective (1.0 NA). Light intensity was controlled by the analog output of an A/D card (Digidata 1440A) via a power supply (Thorlabs, LEDD1), and calibrated with a photodiode and a power meter. Light power ranged between 0.053 and 1.12 mW, over a spot of 0.28 mm of diameter. Although thalamocortical axons innervating cortical L4 were severed from their cell bodies, activation of ChR2-expressing fibers generated robust responses onto postsynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kloc and Maffei, 2014</xref>). Light-evoked responses were recorded in voltage clamp mode in L4 PV cells and PNs. Direct recruitment of cortical neurons was examined in ACSF containing 1 µM of TTX, to remove polysynaptic activity, and 100 µM of the K<sup>+</sup>-channel antagonist 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), to enhance axonal depolarization. This approach ensures monosynaptic transmission from thalamocortical afferents selectively, without contamination of polysynaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>). Yet, in the presence of TTX and 4AP, the depolarization of presynaptic terminals differs from an action potential, as it is likely slower and broader. Consequently, glutamate released by ChR2-positive thalamic fibers is temporally dispersed due to a strong asynchronous release component. We therefore measured charge transfer of thalamocortical synaptic responses on both PV cells and PNs. Disynaptic inhibition was measured in regular ACSF and IPSCs were isolated by holding neurons at the reversal potential for glutamate-mediated responses (between + 10 and+15 mV, taking into account the liquid junction potential and series resistance).</p><p>In order to minimize response variability due to potential different level of expression of ChR2 across animals and slices, we performed optical stimulations at a light intensity inducing detectable responses with occasional failures. This light intensity was refereed as <italic>threshold stimulation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gabernet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagnall et al., 2011</xref>). The duration of light stimulations were 0.3 ms for feed-forward (FFI), and 1 ms for thalamocortical glutamatergic activation. The stimulus duration was longer in the latter case, due to the presence of TTX and 4-AP. With these constant pulse durations and by varying illumination intensity, the <italic>threshold stimulation</italic> was determined for each cell.</p><p>For all experiments, neurons were discarded from the analysis if the access resistance was &gt;30 MΩ. All drugs were obtained from Tocris Cookson (Bristol, UK) or Sigma-Aldrich (St-Louis, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Thick slices used for electrophysiology experiments (350 µm) were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4) at 4°C.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor.

However, the underlying mechanisms remained largely unknown. The authors provide a thorough examination of synaptic effects of ChABC treatment on the feed-forward inhibition circuit from thalamus to layer 4 parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons in the primary visual cortex. Interestingly, they find that the treatment did not affect GABAergic neurotransmission from PV cells, but potentiated glutamatergic thalamic inputs selectively targeting PV cells in layer 4. Inputs onto pyramidal neurons remained unaffected. The authors propose that the observed increase in mEPSCs frequency in PV interneurons is dependent on visual inputs, because the effect mediated by ChABC treatment is attenuated by monocular deprivation. This is a thorough, solid and convincing work that reveals several interesting functions of the PNNs, from the selective gating of thalamic inputs towards feed forward inhibition onto PV cells, to the consequences of PNNs removal in cortical networks (increase in γ power). However, the reviewers formulated some concerns, which need to be addressed by the authors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Because the enzyme ChABC is not specific to PNNs, but degrades the CS glycosaminoglycan (GAG) component in extracellular matrix in general, the authors must rephrase their statements in relation to the function of PNNs.</p><p>2) Not all PV cells are enwrapped by PNNs. The authors should therefore verify that recorded neurons are PNN-bearing cells (e.g. in sham experiments). Because the current results are quite different to previous studies such as the genetic removal of brevican, and because compensatory effects could occur, the authors should discuss these differences. Please also refer to the very recently published paper including a specific PNN knockout mouse model (Rowlands et al., 2018).</p><p>3) From the histology in Figure 2, it is not clear that ChR2 expression is limited to dLGN. Expression in other areas of thalamus could affect the results as other areas have input to the primary visual cortex (V1) such as LP. From Figure 2L (bottom) it is unclear whether the difference between ChABC and sham treatment is due to the three outliers. Because most of the cells responded to optogenetic stimulation similarly in ChABC and sham treated animals it is important to know if this relates to the level or pattern of expression. Please provide histology for all animals.</p><p>4) &quot;All effects depend on visual input&quot;. Please rephrase. All optogenetic experiments have been performed in vitro, without visual input. Although the effects of MD are well described, is not given that the observed effect was due to a lack of visual stimulation.</p><p>5) Increased γ synchrony does not necessary mean stronger inhibition. Indeed, it can be that PV interneurons pace pyramidal cells at a higher frequency. Therefore, please rephrase the statement “… our results suggest that the enzymatic disruption of PNNs results in stronger inhibitory interneuron activity during visual stimulation.”</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41520.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Because the enzyme ChABC is not specific to PNNs, but degrades the CS glycosaminoglycan (GAG) component in extracellular matrix in general, the authors must rephrase their statements in relation to the function of PNNs.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct in highlighting the fact that ChABC degrades CSPG GAGs all over the extracellular matrix. Infusion of ChABC in adult animals has the advantage of acutely degrading CSPGs, allowing studying their role in the adult animal. This avoids possible effects due to long-lasting manipulations of the extracellular matrix during development. Moreover, since the great majority of the studies showing PNN regulation of cortical plasticity have used ChABC treatment, we wanted to better connect our results with the current existing literature.</p><p>However, we were aware that ChABC can disrupt the entire extracellular environment without limiting its action to the WFA-positive PNNs surrounding PV cells. For these reasons, in all our experiments (both in control and MD), we have recorded from both PV cells and PNs. We did not observe any change in any parameter we investigated in PNs (AP waveform, firing dynamics, sPSCs, uIPSCs, thalamic glutamatergic activation), as opposed to PV cells. We thus conclude that the effects that we report in the manuscript are due to PNNs around these interneurons. This is in line with the recently published paper (Rowlands et al., 2018) that is mentioned in point #2 below. By using a clever genetic approach, Rowlands et al., demonstrate that ablation of aggrecan (and thus PNNs) in adult mice promotes ocular dominance plasticity. We agree that this issue is nevertheless important, and we have discussed it (Discussion, second paragraph) in the revised manuscript, in which Rowlands et al. is cited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Not all PV cells are enwrapped by PNNs. The authors should therefore verify that recorded neurons are PNN-bearing cells (e.g. in sham experiments).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise a good point. Although PNN expression is much lower in layers 2/3, 5 and 6 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) than in layer 4, we cannot exclude the possibility that we might have recorded from a fraction of PV cells without PNNs in sham experiments. Recovering the actual recorded cells and verify each time whether they were enwrapped by PNNs is very difficult. This is true especially after lengthy recordings in acute slices obtained from &gt;P70 animals. We have therefore performed a new analysis on fixed tissue, and quantified the number of PV cells with and without PNNs in layer 4 of adult V1 (where all recordings were performed). We found that &gt;99% of PV cells are enwrapped by PNNs. This is in line with previous published quantifications of PNNs in V1 (Lensjo KK et al., 2017; Ueno H et al., Neuroscience 2017; Ueno H et al., Neurochem. Int. 2018). This analysis indicates that the vast majority of PV cells in the adult cortical layer 4 is enwrapped by PNNs to some degree, although in superficial and deep cortical layers the amount of PNNs is much lower. We conclude that the probability of recording from PNN-free PV cells in layer 4 of sham-treated animals is very low. We have changed the panel A of Figure 2—figure supplement 1, added a new panel C, and we described this finding in the Results section (subsection “Enhanced glutamatergic recruitment of PV cells by thalamocortical fibers in the absence of PNNs is modulated by sensory deprivation”) of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Because the current results are quite different to previous studies such as the genetic removal of brevican, and because compensatory effects could occur, the authors should discuss these differences. Please also refer to the very recently published paper including a specific PNN knockout mouse model (Rowlands et al., 2018).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for pointing this out. Indeed, we used a protocol that is an accepted method to disrupt PNNs and re-open cortical plasticity in adult animals. This approach is advantageous because it relies on an acute degradation (2-3 days) at a mature developmental stage when cortical circuits are fully developed. Compensatory effects are minimal during such a short time of PNN degradation, thus allowing dissecting the exact mechanism underlying the re-opening of cortical plasticity without other effects occurring during development that are present in genetic removal of PNN component. These developmental studies are extremely important, but they are focused on the development of cortical circuits in the absence of PNNs. Our experiments using ChABC demonstrated that PNNs muffle thalamic synapses onto PV cells. Nevertheless, these synapses retain their potential of being plastic even in adults, after PNN accumulated normally. We had mentioned this issue in the original version of our manuscript, and we have now extended the Discussion in the revised manuscript. Interestingly, during the review of our manuscript, Rowlands et al. published their paper in J. Neurosci, illustrating a clever approach to remove PNNs selectively in PV cells in adult mice. We cited this important paper in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) From the histology in Figure 2, it is not clear that ChR2 expression is limited to dLGN. Expression in other areas of thalamus could affect the results as other areas have input to the primary visual cortex (V1) such as LP.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in pointing that AAV infection of ChR2 might have spread to LP in some cases. However, LP axons projecting to V1 are confined in layers 1 and 5a, excluding layer 4 (Roth MM et al., 2016). Our light stimulations were delivered with a 63X objective centered in layer 4. The experiments detailed in Figure 2 were done in TTX (and 4AP), thus preventing unwanted network effects. For the experiments in Figure 4, FFI was measured within a latency of 6.36 ± 0.15 ms (Table S7 in Supplementary file 1), which is consistent with disynaptic inhibition (Gabernet et al., 2005). This has been discussed in the revised manuscript (subsection “In vivo expression of the light-sensitive channel ChR2 in the dLGN”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From Figure 2L (bottom) it is unclear whether the difference between ChABC and sham treatment is due to the three outliers.</p></disp-quote><p>Threshold thalamic responses of PV cells were highly variable, as often are synaptic responses (see sPSC and mPSC values). Consequently, they were plotted on a log scale. Since distributions were not normal (in both control and ChABC) we could not run tests for outliers, such as z-score or Grubbs test, which both require a normal distribution in order to be able to classify something as lying outside the range of expected values.</p><p>As shown in the current figure, the P value is 0.014. Of note, since the distributions were not normal, we used a non-parametric test, which compares medians (Mann–Whitney U test). If we remove the three largest points in ChABC and the max value in Sham, the two datasets are still significantly different (P = 0.02). The two data sets are still significantly different if we drop the two largest values in ChABC without removing the max value in Sham (P = 0.04). We went back to the original data and we could not find any objective reason to exclude those three points and consider them as outliers. We feel that removing data points would be arbitrary.</p><p>Based on all these considerations, we remain confident that the difference between ChABC and sham treatment is due to potentiated thalamic input. This is in agreement with ChABC-mediated increased thalamic strength (albeit less) in MD as well on sEPSCs and mEPSCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Because most of the cells responded to optogenetic stimulation similarly in ChABC and sham treated animals it is important to know if this relates to the level or pattern of expression. Please provide histology for all animals.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise an important point. To reduce variability due to possible different pattern of expression of ChR2 in different animals in our optogenetic experiments, we recorded from many neurons (n = 215) and mice (N = 70). Moreover, we recorded threshold responses to stimulate an approximate equal amount of ChR2-positive thalamic fibers. Responses were defined as threshold when they occurred with intermingled failures. This procedure was inspired by previous classical papers using electrical thalamocortical stimulations of neurons in the barrel cortex (e.g. Bagnall et al., 2011). Tables S4 and S7 in Supplementary file 1, includes the threshold intensity, latency and failure rate of photo-stimulations in all experiments and conditions. None of these parameters was significantly different. These results suggest that the pattern of expression of ChR2 was not overall different in ChABC- and sham-treated animals and likely did not account for the different responses we measured.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) &quot;All effects depend on visual input&quot;. Please rephrase. All optogenetic experiments have been performed in vitro, without visual input. Although the effects of MD are well described, is not given that the observed effect was due to a lack of visual stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Although optogenetic experiments were performed in vitro, MD was accomplished in vivo. The loss of visual input in mice before the recordings is likely responsible for the effects observed in slices. We nevertheless changed the sentence with: “All effects depended on the presence of normal visual input after ChABC in vivo treatment”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Increased γ synchrony does not necessary mean stronger inhibition. Indeed, it can be that PV interneurons pace pyramidal cells at a higher frequency. Therefore, please rephrase the statement “… our results suggest that the enzymatic disruption of PNNs results in stronger inhibitory interneuron activity during visual stimulation.”</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that increased γ-synchrony does not necessarily mean stronger inhibition. Our sentence was admittedly misleading, but did not imply stronger inhibition per se, rather increased activity of GABAergic neurons, as indicated by Atallah et al., 2012 (for the decreased gain of contrast adaptation) and Sohal et al., 2009 (for increased γ power). We rephrased the sentence with: “Our results suggest that the enzymatic disruption of PNNs results in increased activity of inhibitory interneurons”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
