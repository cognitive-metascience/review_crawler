The mechanically-coupled ears of <italic>Ormia ochracea</italic> are specialized for hyperacute directional hearing, but the possible role of SRM, or whether such specializations exhibit limitations for sound source segregation, is unknown. We recorded phonotaxis to a cricket song masked by band-limited noise. With a masker, response thresholds increased and localization was diverted away from the signal and masker. Increased separation from 6° to 90° did not decrease response thresholds or improve localization accuracy, thus SRM does not operate in this range of spatial separations. Tympanal vibrations and auditory nerve responses reveal that localization errors were consistent with changes in peripheral coding of signal location and flies localized towards the ear with better signal detection. Our results demonstrate that, in a mechanically coupled auditory system, specialization for directional hearing does not contribute to source segregation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20731.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20731.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Ormia ochracea</kwd><kwd>cocktail-party-problem</kwd><kwd>sound localization</kwd><kwd>mechanically coupled pressure receiver</kwd><kwd>song recognition</kwd><kwd>spatial release from masking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003579</institution-id><institution>University of Toronto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ontario Graduate Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Norman</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology grants-in-aid of research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Norman</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009702</institution-id><institution>Animal Behavior Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Student Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Norman</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PGS D3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Norman</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mason</surname><given-names>Andrew C</given-names> </name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The auditory periphery of <italic>Ormia ochracea</italic> does not allow for spatial release from masking.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Natural soundscapes are composed of numerous biotic and abiotic sound sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brumm and Slabbekoorn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Theunissen and Elie, 2014</xref>). Even in the presence of natural noise, auditory systems are adept at detecting, recognizing, and localizing sound sources of interest for animals that rely on hearing to mediate appropriate behavioural decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bee and Micheyl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Segregating sounds of interest from noise can be challenging because sound waves from multiple sources combine to form a composite waveform prior to auditory transduction. From this input, coherent representations of various sources are derived from the composite waveform and signals of interest are segregated from other competing sound sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McDermott, 2009</xref>). In humans, this sensory challenge is known as the ‘cocktail party problem’ and it describes difficulties encountered in perceiving speech in noisy social settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bregman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bronkhorst, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brumm and Slabbekoorn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cherry, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hulse, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McDermott, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Non-human animals may encounter analogous situations in natural acoustic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bee, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bee and Micheyl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hulse, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Römer, 2013</xref>). Some insect choruses are known to produce sustained levels of background noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerhardt and Huber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Römer, 2013</xref>). These choruses are often composed of mixed species with communication signals that may share spectral, temporal, and spatial overlap. Such background noises have the potential to negatively impact the performance of auditory systems in perceiving relevant signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brumm, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brumm and Slabbekoorn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wiley, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Hearing with two ears provides important computational advantages for sound localization and sound source segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schnupp and Carr, 2009</xref>). When two ears are spatially separated, each will experience different sound arrival times and sound pressure levels in response to an incident sound wave. Interaural time and level differences (ITD and ILD respectively) are binaural cues that the auditory system can utilize to compute sound direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knudsen and Konishi, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Michelsen, 1998</xref>). Spatially separated sound sources will give rise to different ITDs and ILDs for each source and sound diffraction between the two ears can generate different signal-to-noise ratios associated with each source leading to a ‘better ear advantage’ for detecting a particular sound source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blauert, 1997</xref>). Both these auditory cues may contribute to spatial release from masking (SRM), a sensory mechanism that allows for improved reception of target signals that are spatially separated from noise sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bee and Micheyl, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Spatial release from masking has been documented in ears that function as independent pressure receivers and in ears that are internally (acoustically) coupled to function as pressure difference receivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bee and Christensen-Dalsgaard, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brunnhofer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caldwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dent et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hine et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nityananda and Bee, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saberi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwartz and Gerhardt, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sümer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ward et al., 2013</xref>). Whether spatial release from masking may contribute to sound source segregation in mechanically coupled pressure receivers remains unknown. Mechanically coupled ears have been described in some tachinid and sarcophagid flies that rely on directional hearing to localize the advertisement signals of suitable host species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cade, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lakes-Harlan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Robert et al., 1999</xref>). Upon source localization, larvae are deposited and develop as parasites within hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cade, 1975</xref>).</p><p>The ability of <italic>Ormia ochracea</italic> (Diptera: Tachinidae) to localize cricket calling songs is remarkable because their small physical size severely limits conventional acoustic cues for sound localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Michelsen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robert, 2005</xref>). With bilaterally symmetric ears that are separated by a mere 500 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robert et al., 1996a</xref>), diffraction of the ~7 cm wavelength field cricket calling song is insufficient to result in measurable acoustic ILDs and the best possible ITD is 1.45 µs for a sound source at 90˚ relative to the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Robert et al., 1996b</xref>). Despite these minuscule sound field directional cues, <italic>O. ochracea</italic> are still capable of localizing sound sources to the accuracy of 2˚ azimuth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mason et al., 2001</xref>). This hyperacute directionality is made possible by the mechanical coupling of the two tympana with a flexible cuticular lever that amplifies the sound field ITDs into larger mechanical ITD and ILDs sufficient for neural processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oshinsky and Hoy, 2002</xref>). The surprising acuity of directional hearing in <italic>O. ochracea</italic> has led to considerable interest in mechanically coupled auditory systems as models for novel acoustic technology (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuntzman and Hall, 2014</xref>), as well as other applications involving localization of signal sources subject to the so-called ‘aperture problem’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akçakaya and Nehorai, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In addition to computing sound direction, <italic>O. ochracea</italic> must also recognize the calling songs of preferred host crickets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gray et al., 2007</xref>). Field cricket calling songs consist of tonal sound pulses with a dominant frequency of about 5 kHz that are repeated at a species-specific pulse rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walker, 1962</xref>). After song detection, <italic>O. ochracea</italic> engage in flying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Müller and Robert, 2001</xref>) and/or walking phonotaxis to the source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mason et al., 2005</xref>). Success in localizing host crickets requires the auditory system to integrate two types of temporal information. The auditory system must measure a difference in the timing of sound pulses that arrive at the two ears to determine sound direction, and the timing between consecutive sound pulses for song pattern recognition (species recognition). In this study, we examine whether spatial release from masking may contribute to improved host song recognition and localization in the presence of masking noise. We exploit the directional characteristics of the mechanically coupled tympana and use a point-source band-limited noise to asymmetrically interfere with the temporal pattern input to both sides of the auditory system. If spatial release from masking confers hearing advantages in <italic>O. ochracea</italic>, behavioural response thresholds are expected to decrease while localization accuracy is expected to increase when noise is spatially separated from a signal of interest (relative to noise and signal sources in close proximity). However, over a range of spatial separations between a target signal and masker (from 6° to 90° of spatial separation), we find no support for SRM in auditory responses of <italic>O. ochracea</italic>. Rather, a localized masker interferes with auditory directionality, and this effect is more severe for a larger spatial separation between the target signal and masker.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In behavioural experiments, we used a spherical treadmill system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lott et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mason et al., 2001</xref>) to measure walking phonotaxis to a frontal target signal (attractive synthetic cricket trill) and a laterally positioned masker (band-limited noise) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

During this time frame, flies reactively steered to the masker, followed by steering movements away from the masker that were maintained for the remainder of stimulus presentation. Steering responses were minimally affected by SNR but were enhanced at greater signal and masker separation. At song onset, forward velocities increased to speeds well above responses to the masker onset. Average forward velocities depended on SNR but not signal and masker separation.

We applied signal detection theory to determine the masker level at which masking occurred for the frontal target signal masked by an ipsilateral or contralateral masker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In quiet, auditory-evoked impulses were stereotypically timed with the occurrence of the pulse pattern (target signal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). As masker intensity was increased, acoustically evoked impulses occurred at the onset of the masker and continued to occur randomly in time throughout masker presentation. Target signal-driven activity was readily discernible at high SNR, but became obscured by masker-driven activity at lower SNRs (greater masker levels). The SNR at which target-signal driven activity was masked was lower for the masker-contralateral ear compared to the masker-ipsilateral ear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). For the masker-contralateral ear, signal detection occurred up to a masker level of 66.75 ± 0.73 dB.

Broadcasting the masker over the target signal increased response thresholds and compromised the ability of flies to resolve signal location at all SNRs. Changes in SNR altered walking distance, and to a lesser extent, walking direction. However, increasing the spatial separation from 6° (small separation) to 90° (large separation) between the target signal and masker did not improve signal localization or decrease behavioural response thresholds, but caused flies to divert their walking responses even further away from both sources. More interestingly, the direction of diverted walking was not random, but depended on the masker location.</p><p>Beyond demonstrating the potential lack of SRM in <italic>O. ochracea</italic>, our goals were to show how spatial separation between a target signal and masker affects localization responses, and peripheral sensory mechanisms that may account for localization behaviour. In experiments that test for SRM, a masker can be presented from a forward location while a target signal is displaced relative to the masker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caldwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holt and Schusterman, 2007</xref>). Similar to some previous studies that have successfully shown SRM, we chose to present a target signal from a fixed forward direction while a masker was displaced relative to the target signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dent et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Litovsky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Turnbull, 1994</xref>). This target signal location allowed us to easily assess the accuracy of sound localization (i.e. localization to 0° azimuth in response to a forward target signal). Several response characteristics of open-loop walking phonotaxis in <italic>O. ochracea</italic> would render assessment of localization accuracy difficult when a target signal is displaced relative to a forward masker. Under open-loop tethered walking phonotaxis, <italic>O. ochracea</italic> receive no corrective sensory feedback when orienting on the treadmill. As a result, turns toward a lateral target signal location tend to overshoot actual source azimuth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mason et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>O. ochracea</italic> exhibit graded turning responses that vary with sound direction, but saturate for sound presentation angles greater than ±30° azimuth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mason et al., 2001</xref>). Both of these considerations would make it problematic to quantify the accuracy of phonotaxis, since the predicted orientation is only clearly defined for a forward-located source.</p><p>Diverted walking responses appear to be driven by directional response properties of the two tympana that altered the perceived location of the target signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). For a frontal sound source, both left and right tympana are expected to respond equally in timing and amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Robert et al., 1996b</xref>), resulting in equivalent afferent activity on both sides of the auditory system. Under this symmetrical stimulation, flies perceived the target signal location to be straight ahead and responded by phonotaxis to a forward location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Our laser vibrometry measurements indicate that adding a masker positioned off the midline axis caused the two tympana to vibrate asymmetrically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). The masker-ipsilateral tympanum exhibited a stronger masker-driven response compared to the masker-contralateral tympanum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Consequently, the masker-contralateral tympanum responded with a lower noise floor that allowed for a greater signal-driven effective amplitude of vibration relative to the masker-ipsilateral tympanum. Neural measurements from the left and right auditory nerve also revealed that target signal detection was possible at higher masker levels for the masker-contralateral ear and thus, resulted in better signal detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, flies orient to a sound-source direction that is a function of the relative effective amplitude between the two tympana and in the direction of the ear with the best signal detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). When a second identical masker was broadcast to equalize masking interference on both sides of the auditory system, symmetry in target signal temporal pattern input was restored and diverted walking responses were corrected so that flies localized the target signal location accurately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20731.032</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Current model of diverted walking phonotaxis in <italic>Ormia ochracea</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 6° and (<bold>B</bold>) 90° spatial separations between the target signal (cricket song) and masker (band-limited noise). The forward target signal results in equal (symmetrical) stimulation to both tympana while the masker provides greater (asymmetrical) stimulation to the masker-ipsilateral tympana compared to the masker-contralateral tympana (exemplar vibration measurements shown). This results in binaural effective amplitude differences in the detection of the target signal above the masker-driven random noise floor. Such binaural effective amplitude differences are larger for larger spatial separations between the target signal and masker. This translates to better signal detection in the masker-contralateral ear (exemplar multi-unit recordings from the auditory nerve shown when the target signal and masker are separated by 90°). Binaural effective amplitude differences potentially encode ‘perceived’ target signal location. Flies respond by localizing a direction that is diverted away from the target signal and masker.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20731.032">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20731.032</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-20731-fig9-v4"/></fig></p><p>The nature of auditory coding in <italic>O. ochracea</italic> suggests that an effect of continuous noise would be to decrease the effective (or perceived) intensity of an attractive stimulus. At the neural level most auditory receptors in <italic>O. ochracea</italic> are Type I afferents that are phasic and precisely mark the onset of a sound pulse with a single spike followed by a refractory period of approximately 4 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oshinsky and Hoy, 2002</xref>). Type II afferents respond similarly but with several spikes at pulse onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oshinsky and Hoy, 2002</xref>). This is a coding strategy that exploits the predictable, pulsatile pattern of cricket songs by registering the onset timing of successive pulses within a chirp with synchronous bursts of phasic afferent activity. A smaller population of afferents, Type III, are tonic and maintain spiking activity throughout the duration of sound pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oshinsky and Hoy, 2002</xref>). Continuous noise is not expected to elicit regular activity in Type I or II afferents (although stochastic amplitude fluctuations in the noise envelope may elicit synchronous afferent spikes). The overall effect, therefore, is to set the noise floor above which a signal-driven increment in vibration amplitude is required to elicit a neural response. For a point-source noise, these effects are greater in the noise-ipsilateral ear and will tend to simulate a directional bias of the song location in the direction of the noise-contralateral ear.</p><p>At the onset of the masker, our noise stimulus may have evoked Type 1 afferents to fire similarly to the onset of sound pulses within a cricket song. Thus at the onset of the masker, flies oriented transiently to the masker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) but did not sustain walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) in the absence of an attractive temporal pattern. When flies perceived an attractive source over the masker, the strength of phonotaxis increased in a SNR-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).</p><p>In our experiments, band-limited noise was used to interfere with temporal pattern input. In similar experiments, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wendler (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stabel et al. (1989)</xref> presented a constant tone from an azimuthal location that asymmetrically disrupted temporal pattern input to the cricket auditory system. This resulted in diverted walking responses away from the tone location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stabel et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wendler, 1989</xref>). Neural measurements revealed that the activity of the tone-contralateral auditory interneurons (AN1 and AN2) better represented the song temporal pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stabel et al., 1989</xref>). More recent behavioural experiments have shown that song pattern recognition modulates the strength of phonotaxis, while the direction of localization depends on reactive steering to individual sound pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hedwig and Poulet, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poulet and Hedwig, 2005</xref>). These results suggest that crickets responded to a direction that should balance auditory input. When we introduced a second coherent masker on the opposite side of the auditory system to balance temporal pattern interference, symmetrical auditory input was restored and flies accurately localized the frontal attractive sound source. Our results extend these previous findings to show that the mechanically coupled ears of <italic>O. ochracea</italic> function as a sensitive bilateral symmetry detector for song temporal pattern. Flies engage in turning responses in attempt to balance temporal pattern input for accurate sound localization.</p><p>Animals often experience lower masked thresholds when masking noise is spatially separated from signals of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Caird et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dent et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hine et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holt and Schusterman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ison and Agrawal, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schmidt and Römer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwartz and Gerhardt, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Warnecke et al., 2014</xref>).

This is in stark contrast to some other animals that undoubtedly experience SRM over similar target signal and noise separations (i.e. from 7.5° to 90° separation between a target signal and masker) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bee, 2007</xref>). However, our current results do not exclude the possibility that SRM may occur at smaller azimuthal separations (&lt;6° azimuth). Further experiments that measure behavioural response thresholds to a target signal and masker presented from the same spatial location would address this possibility. Even if SRM occurs at smaller spatial separations, our results would suggest that any SRM in <italic>O. ochracea</italic> is rather limited and saturates quickly beyond 6° of spatial separation.</p><p>We suggest two reasons that may explain this unexpected result. When signal and noise arise from the same spatial location, each ear will experience identical binaural cues (ITD and ILD) from both sources. As signal and noise are spatially separated, differences in these cues associated with each source will occur at both ears. First, the auditory system of <italic>O. ochracea</italic> may be unable to segregate interaural cues of the target signal from those that are associated with the noise source and this may be one limitation to the function of mechanically coupled ears. SRM does not appear to function in grasshoppers for similar reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ronacher and Hoffmann, 2003</xref>). In grasshoppers, directional information and temporal recognition are processed in parallel such that input from both sides of the auditory system are summed internally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">von Helversen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">von Helversen and von Helversen, 1995</xref>) and thus, binaural cues associated with an attractive signal would be mixed with binaural cues associated with noise. Second, when a point source noise was positioned asymmetrically about the midline axis, flies performed phonotaxis in the direction of the ear with better temporal pattern detection (‘better ear’). The noise source provided directional masking that caused a shift in the perceived location of the target signal location away from the actual source location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) and flies responded by turning in a direction that would balance temporal pattern input. Under more natural conditions (with freely walking flies), this would still allow successful localization of the target (host) source. Initially, misdirected movement would result in a shift of the relative spatial positions of the target and noise sources allowing flies to arrive at the target by an indirect path. Previous work has shown that for multiple competing attractive sources, flies rely on temporal cues for source segregation, via a precedence effect, combined with a preference for forward locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). We now show that noise can bias the perceived directionality of attractive sources. Future studies will examine how these processes interact to support the surprising spatial hearing abilities of <italic>O. ochracea</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were conducted on lab-reared gravid female <italic>Ormia ochracea</italic> derived from a population originally collected in Gainesville FL.

The treadmill system consists of a light-weight table tennis ball held afloat by a constant airstream above a modified optical mouse sensor (ADNS 2620, Avago Technologies, USA). Walking responses were transduced as rotations of the treadmill that actuated the optical mouse sensor to record changes in x and y pixel units at a sampling rate of 2160 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lott et al., 2007</xref>). Pixel units were calibrated to actual walking distances by measuring displacement of points on the ball from highspeed video footage (Lightning RDT) synchronized to pixel data captured by the treadmill system (Midas, Xcitex). Data collection by the treadmill system was controlled by Stimprog version 5.14b ‘treadmill’ developed as a MATLAB GUI that interfaced with the National Instruments data acquisition system to ensure synchronous sound presentation and the recording of walking traces.

In experiments involving a small spatial separation between the target signal and masker, the maskerwas broadcast from a speaker directly adjacent and to the left or right of the target signal, giving 6° of spatial separation. In experiments involving a large spatial separation, the masker was broadcast from a laterally positioned speaker located at ±90° azimuth.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Experiment 1: Estimating behavioural response thresholds</title><p>Behavioural response thresholds were estimated using an adaptive tracking procedure as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bee and Schwartz (2009)</xref>. We considered translational movements greater than 1 cm to be valid behavioural responses. To estimate behavioral response thresholds in quiet (absence of a masker), the initial target signal level was set to 76 dB SPL and was decreased in 3 dB steps until a non-response was reached. In a final test, the target signal level was increased by half a step size (1.5 dB). If the subject responded to this final test, this signal level was specified as the upper bound (UB) of the estimate. Otherwise, the final signal level was deemed to be the lower bound (LB) of the estimate. The estimated response threshold was calculated as:</p><p>Recognition threshold = 10*log<sub>10</sub> [(10<sup>(UB/10)</sup>+10<sup>(LB/10)</sup>)/2]</p><p>In a within-subjects design, this procedure was repeated for signal and masker speakers separated by 6° and 90° angles.

The target signal (see above) presented at 76 dB SPL in the absence of a masker served as the positive control stimulus. The masker was also broadcast at 76 dB SPL in the absence of an attractive signal as a negative control. Test stimuli consisted of a combination of the standard cricket trill (target signal) broadcast at different levels (70, 76, and 82 dB SPL) simultaneously with the masker to achieve three signal-to-noise ratios (−6 dB, 0 dB, +6 dB SNR) in two different spatial configurations (6° and 90° spatial separations) to form a 2 by 3 factorial design. Stimuli were timed such that the target signal occurred midway through the masker presentation (beginning one second after the onset of the masker playback and finishing one second before the masker offset) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Flies were tested under a repeated measures design such that 3–6 responses were collected for each unique combination of SNR and spatial separation (number of responses differed because response probability decreased at lowest SNR). A test sequence for a fly commenced with three negative controls, a block of half the test stimuli in random order, one mid-sequence control stimulus, the remaining block of test stimuli in random order, and ended with three more positive and negative control stimulus presentations.</p><sec id="s17"><title>Data analysis</title><p>X and Y coordinates from treadmill data traces were collected at 2160 Hz to construct virtual walking trajectories.

Angular heading was calculated as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mason et al. (2005)</xref>. Responses collected under the same speaker separations but for the reversed position were combined by mirroring responses relative to 0° azimuth. Repeated responses for the same stimulus conditions were averaged within individuals. Unless otherwise specified, data given as mean ± SEM.</p><p>Response latencies and walking distances may indicate signal detectability, but we cannot rule out the possibility that they may also be influenced by the motivation to respond. Steering and forward velocities are associated with walking direction. Steering velocities indicate the strength of turning towards or away from a laterally positioned masker. Forward velocities indicate response strength directed to the song location. Angular headings indicate the actual direction of walking. Separate repeated measures ANOVAs were used to assess the dependence of latency, distance, steering and forward velocities, on spatial separation and SNR. Each ANOVA consist of 2 spatial separations (within subjects)×3 SNRs (within subjects). Currently, there is no consensus on statistical models equivalent to a repeated measures ANOVA for circular data. Repeated measurements of angular data across factors were treated as independent groups and a two-factor circular ANOVA (hk test) was used to compare the effects of SNR and spatial separation on angular heading.</p><p>If target signal localization is impaired by the presence of a point-source masker, we predicted that flies would exhibit longer response latencies, shorter walking distances, and walking directions (angular heading) that deviate from the target signal location in the presence of a masker. We further predicted that flies would show improvements in these response measures if the target signal and masker are spatially separated and broadcast at greater SNRs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Experiment 3: Examining the effects of balanced temporal pattern interference on localization accuracy</title><p>The goal of this experiment was to test if symmetry in temporal pattern input may correct deviated localization responses observed in Experiment 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). A frontally located song results in symmetrical temporal pattern input to both sides of the auditory system. Asymmetry in temporal pattern input was achieved by exploiting the inherent directional response characteristic of the ears to a point source masker. We manipulated the degree of asymmetry by varying the spatial separation between a target signal and masker with identical speaker arrangements as in Experiment 2 (referred to as: <italic>Asymmetric with a 6°</italic> (<italic>small) spatial separation</italic> and <italic>Asymmetric and with a 90° (large) spatial separation</italic>). To induce symmetrical temporal pattern input in the presence of a point source masker, we introduced an identical (coherent) masker positioned at a location that is a direct mirror reflection of the other noise speaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D,G</xref>). In the <italic>Symmetric and small spatial separation</italic> condition, the signal speaker is flanked by two maskers at ±6˚, while in the <italic>Symmetric and large separation</italic> condition the maskers are located at ±90˚ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,G</xref>). The control condition was identical to that of Experiment 2. The test stimulus consists of the attractive stimulus broadcast at 76 dB SPL along with a single masker broadcast at 76 dB SPL (<italic>Asymmetric</italic> conditions) or two coherent maskers each broadcast at 70 dB SPL to result in an overall level of 76 dB SPL (<italic>Symmetric</italic> conditions). The timing of signal and masker broadcast was kept identical to timing relationships established in Experiment 2. Each fly was tested five times per acoustic condition (type of symmetry and target signal masker separation) in random order, for a total of 30 test responses per fly.</p><sec id="s19"><title>Data analysis</title><p>If symmetrical temporal pattern input to both sides of the auditory system is critical for accurate song localization, we predicted that the addition of a second masker (see above) should re-establish symmetry and correct deviated localization responses. Mid-response angular heading is a direct measure of walking direction, and was extracted from virtual walking trajectories as in Experiment 2. According to our prediction, mid-angular headings to target signal alone should not differ from responses to <italic>Symmetric</italic> acoustic conditions, but should significantly differ from responses to <italic>Asymmetric</italic> acoustic conditions. We applied the <italic>Watson’s U test</italic> to compare differences in angular headings under different acoustic conditions.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Experiments examining peripheral sensory mechanisms</title><p>In separate experiments, we explored peripheral sensory mechanisms that may contribute to diverted walking responses at the level of the tympanum and the auditory nerve. Prior to experiments, flies were mounted on a custom holder. In laser vibrometry experiments, the fly’s head was removed to provide access to the two tympana. A laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) (Polytec OFV 3001 controller, OFV 511 sensor head, or PSV-400) was used to record tympanal vibrations. Responses from the masker-ipsilateral and masker-contralateral tympanum were measured by positioning the focused laser beam on each tympanal pit in separate measurements. In neurophysiology experiments, the fly’s head was left intact but the wings, dorsum, flight muscles, and gut were removed to provide access to the location at which the frontal (auditory) nerve converges onto the prothoracic ganglion (CNS). Tungsten electrodes (A-M Systems Inc., 5 MΩ) were positioned on each of the left and right frontal nerves using Leica micromanipulators (model # 117777). Multi-unit recordings were made simultaneously from both auditory nerves and amplified using an A-M Systems Microelectrode Amplifier (Model 1800). Analog signals from laser vibrometry and neurophysiology experiments were digitized with National Instruments data acquisition hardware (sampling rate of 44100 Hz) and saved using custom software (Stimprog 5.2) developed in MATLAB.</p><p>Target signal and masker speakers were positioned in the large (90˚) spatial separation configuration (as above) and presented at varied SNRs. In laser vibrometry experiments, different SNRs were achieved by varying the signal level relative to the masker at 76 dB SPL. We recorded three sweeps in response to each of 3 SNRs (−6, 0, +6 dB) within subjects. In neurophysiology experiments, different SNRs were achieved by varying the masker level relative to a 76 dB SPL target signal. We recorded 20 sweeps per SNR and tested 6 SNRs (−18 to +6 dB in 6 dB intervals) within subjects.</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Data analysis</title><p>In laser vibrometry experiments, we calculated a sliding RMS amplitude for the masker alone during a 1 s epoch leading up to the simultaneous presentation of the signal and masker. A sliding RMS amplitude value was also calculated over an equivalent time window during the signal and masker epoch. RMS values were converted to dB to calculate a dB difference between the response of the tympanum during the masker alone epoch compared to the signal and masker epoch. This dB difference represents the magnitude of tympanal response to the target signal that is above the ‘noise floor’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These dB differences were computed in response to an ipsilateral and contralateral masker and statistically compared in a repeated measures ANOVA.</p><p>Target signal-driven effective interaural vibration amplitude differences (IVADs) were computed using the dB difference values. Based on these IVAD measurements, we predicted the direction of sound localizations by using eardrum directionality measurements from a previously published study.

The predicted direction of apparent source location was determined as the angle of sound incidence along the fitted curve that corresponded with our calculated IVAD measurements. These predictions were compared to the actual direction of sound localization measured in behavioural experiments.</p><p>In neurophysiology experiments, we applied signal detection theory to determine masked thresholds for the target signal embedded in the masker. Thresholds for counting auditory evoked impulses were determined as three standard deviations above the RMS over an epoch of the recording in the absence of any acoustic stimulation.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Catherine Carr (Reviewer#1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andrei Kozlov (Reviewer #2) and Ole Næsbye Larsen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Typically, when two sounds are separated in space, they can be more readily differentiated than when they are close. This spatial release from masking is surprisingly not present in the parasitic fly, <italic>Ormia ochracea</italic>, although it has excellent directional hearing. The authors used behavioral measures, modeling, laser vibrometry and extracellular recordings to show that this deficit is a function of the mechanically coupled ears. Their key behavioral result used phonotaxis to show that increasing the spatial separation between the target and masker did not decrease behavioural response thresholds, or the time an animal takes to decide on target location (or its heading). In their experiments, maskers next to the target and at 90° had the same effect on the fly's heading on the trackball (diverted away from the signal and masker locations).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One of the reviewers would like to see laser responses for maskers at the two locations (close and far). They also observe that improved physiological analyses would strengthen the argument about which response types contribute to the multiunit response. Another reviewer raises the potentially serious question of why the locations of the signal speaker and noise source were selected. Further details may be found in the reviewer comments below; this point should be addressed with care. Many other useful suggestions were made.</p><p>1) Some insights into the fly's choice of heading were obtained by Laser Doppler Vibrometry measurements of tympanal vibrations; the ear contralateral to the stimulus had a larger response. One issue with the laser data is that the authors do not show laser responses when the maskers are at the two locations (close and far). These data should be shown.</p><p>2) The ear's response reflects tympanic amplitude, since recordings from where the auditory nerve converges onto the prothoracic ganglion show stronger responses from the nerve contralateral to the source. Although it's understood that physiological recordings from <italic>Ormia</italic> are difficult, the neural data shouldn't be used for raster plots unless the authors can show adequate isolation of single units. Other types of physiological analyses are better for multiunit data.</p><p>3) The speculation in the discussion about which response types contribute to the multiunit response could be improved; most auditory receptors are reported to be Type I, firing one spike at stimulus onset, yet these recordings show continuous responses. There are many reasons why this should be so.</p><p>4) I am confused by the choice of the speakers' positions. First of all, I do not understand why the authors did not broadcast both the signal and the noise from the same speaker as a control? Since these flies can localize with a precision of about 2°, is it possible that 6° is already sufficiently far apart? What if the spatial release from masking happens partially (or fully) at less than 6<sup>°</sup>?</p><p>5) More generally and more importantly, I do not understand why the authors did not position a noise source at 0° (straight ahead) and use a range of positions for the signal speaker? When both the signal and the noise are played from the same location, all auditory input would be equal for the two ears-and the fly would walk straight ahead when the behavioural threshold SNR is reached. Then the measurements can be repeated as the signal speaker is displaced away from the fixed noise speaker (which is always located straight ahead). A change in the SNR threshold for the fly movement towards the signal speaker at a new position would reveal the presence or absence of the spatial release from masking. In addition, when only noise is present straight ahead, the distribution of movement vectors away from the noise source should be symmetrical about the zero-degree axis (i.e., the same probability to walk to the right or to the left). Introducing the signal at different positions and varying its relative strength (loudness) would skew this vector distribution towards the signal speaker, providing another quantitative measure of the spatial release from masking.</p><p>6) How is this experimental design different from the one used in this study? It is different because the noise level would always be identical for the two ears, and the signal level in the ipsi- and contralateral ears would vary as a function of the signal location. In contrast, in the authors' design, the signal level is always the same across the two ears while the noise level varies. Hence, the authors' experiments test how the flies walk away from a noise source as a function of its relative strength and location (in the absence and in the presence of the spatially fixed signal), whereas the design suggested here would test how they walk towards a signal source as a function of its relative strength and location (in the absence and in the presence of the spatially fixed noise). These are different variables.</p><p>Indeed, imagine two separate neural systems: one controlling the positive phonotaxis towards the signal (the cricket song), the other controlling the negative phonotaxis away from the noise. By changing the relative level of the signal across the two ears one modulates the former, whereas by changing the relative level of the noise across the two ears, one modulates the latter.</p><p>Perhaps I am missing something, but it seems to me that in order to quantify the positive phonotaxis it is necessary to vary the location of the signal speaker while using a fixed noise source, rather than the other way around.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;How Spatial Release from Masking May Fail to Function in a Highly Directional Auditory System&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Andrew King (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before a final decision about acceptance can be made, as outlined below. In particular, Reviewer 2 would prefer that you do the suggested experiment, and test what happens when the signal and noise arise from the same location. They provide some suggestions if you cannot do this.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>&quot;Despite the peripheral directionality provided by the mechanically coupled ears of <italic>O. ochracea</italic>, our behavioural results indicate that <italic>O. ochracea</italic> does not experience SRM. We suggest two reasons that may explain this unexpected result. When signal and noise arise from the same spatial location, […]&quot;</p><p>I do not think that the authors can make this conclusion because they did not test what happens when the signal and noise arise from the same location. Indeed, the authors write in their reply to one of my questions: &quot;It is possible that masked thresholds will be greater for a co-localized signal and masker and some release from masking may occur when the signal and masker is spatially separated by 6° azimuth- our data do not eliminate this possibility.&quot;</p><p>The following claim is therefore also not justified. &quot;First, the auditory system of <italic>O. ochracea</italic> may be unable to segregate interaural cues of the target signal from those that are associated with the noise source and this may be one limitation to the function of mechanically coupled ears.&quot; Having read this paper, I still don't know whether the fly does not have SRM or whether it has a super-acute SRM, matching the 2° superacuity of its spatial hearing. I therefore recommend that the authors either specify in the discussion the range of applicability of their claims, for example: our behavioural results indicate that <italic>O. ochracea</italic> does not experience SRM in the range 6-90° or they do the experiment with the signal and noise broadcasted from the same location (0°) as I had suggested. This experiment does not seem technically more difficult than the experiments they already did, and it would, in my opinion, strengthen the paper by demonstrating conclusively whether these files do or do not have SRM.</p><p>The authors' reply to my question about the relative locations of the signal and noise seems reasonable, but why are these arguments (the text following &quot;This is an interesting issue.&quot;) and the three listed practical considerations not included in the manuscript? Readers would have to read both the article, and the reviews and the authors' replies to have access to this information. It would be better if the article contained it, including the four supporting references, none of which is included in the manuscript.</p><p>The authors' reply to my last question (about the two systems) does not make sense to me. The authors write: &quot;More importantly, the direction of these transient walking responses to noise onset is towards the speaker, reinforcing the conclusion that the noise effect in our experiments is a modulation of the perceived direction of the positive phonotactic response, rather than a separate negative response.&quot; It does not make sense to me because the authors themselves write that the flies orient transiently to any sound, signal or noise. Within the first 150 ms, the flies simply can't tell the difference. Therefore, the flies' responses within the first 150 ms when they can not tell the difference between the signal and the noise does not reinforce any interpretation of the flies' responses after the 150 ms when they can tell the difference.</p><p>It is, however, an interesting and useful paper and I hope it is published after the revisions are made.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors carefully answered all questions and greatly improved the manuscript.

They also observe that improved physiological analyses would strengthen the argument about which response types contribute to the multiunit response. Another reviewer raises the potentially serious question of why the locations of the signal speaker and noise source were selected. Further details may be found in the reviewer comments below; this point should be addressed with care. Many other useful suggestions were made.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Some insights into the fly's choice of heading were obtained by Laser Doppler Vibrometry measurements of tympanal vibrations; the ear contralateral to the stimulus had a larger response. One issue with the laser data is that the authors do not show laser responses when the maskers are at the two locations (close and far). These data should be shown.</italic> </p><p>We have added these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The ear's response reflects tympanic amplitude, since recordings from where the auditory nerve converges onto the prothoracic ganglion show stronger responses from the nerve contralateral to the source. Although it's understood that physiological recordings from Ormia are difficult, the neural data shouldn't be used for raster plots unless the authors can show adequate isolation of single units. Other types of physiological analyses are better for multiunit data.</italic> </p><p>Our rationale for this unorthodox application of raster analysis was as follows. Previous work has indicated that <italic>Ormia</italic> auditory responses are characterized by synchronous bursts of receptor action potentials with small interaural latency differences encoding sound direction. Thus peaks in multi-unit recordings, representing bursts of synchronous receptor firing, may be treated as salient neural events, with the temporal patterning of bursts reflecting the quality of signal copying in the afferent response. We were attracted to this approach because it illustrates the signal detection question clearly and intuitively. We now recognize that because rasters are usually used to represent single-unit spikes, the original figure is potentially misleading. Multiunit data has therefore been re-analyzed and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, we now show averaged multiunit recordings made simultaneously from the left and right side of the auditory system. Multiunit responses were converted to RMS values and signal detection theory was applied to the RMS values to determine neural detection thresholds. Our new analysis reveal almost identical results and does not change the interpretation of the data.</p><p><italic>3) The speculation in the discussion about which response types contribute to the multiunit response could be improved; most auditory receptors are reported to be Type I, firing one spike at stimulus onset, yet these recordings show continuous responses. There are many reasons why this should be so.</italic> </p><p>This section of the Discussion has been rewritten.</p><p><italic>4) I am confused by the choice of the speakers' positions. First of all, I do not understand why the authors did not broadcast both the signal and the noise from the same speaker as a control? Since these flies can localize with a precision of about 2</italic>°<italic>, is it possible that 6</italic>° <italic>is already sufficiently far apart? What if the spatial release from masking happens partially (or fully) at less than 6</italic>°<italic>?</italic> </p><p>It is possible that masked thresholds will be greater for a co-localized signal and masker and some release from masking may occur when the signal and masker is spatially separated by 6° azimuth- our data do not eliminate this possibility. Our data show that with greater increases in spatial separation (i.e. from 6 to 90°), response thresholds do not change, so there is no evidence of SRM over this range. There is, however, a pronounced effect on the accuracy of signal localization and this effect is opposite to what would be expected if spatial separation of signal and noise sources were to enhance signal detection.</p><p><italic>5) More generally and more importantly, I do not understand why the authors did not position a noise source at 0° (straight ahead) and use a range of positions for the signal speaker? When both the signal and the noise are played from the same location, all auditory input would be equal for the two ears-and the fly would walk straight ahead when the behavioural threshold SNR is reached. Then the measurements can be repeated as the signal speaker is displaced away from the fixed noise speaker (which is always located straight ahead). A change in the SNR threshold for the fly movement towards the signal speaker at a new position would reveal the presence or absence of the spatial release from masking. In addition, when only noise is present straight ahead, the distribution of movement vectors away from the noise source should be symmetrical about the zero-degree axis (i.e., the same probability to walk to the right or to the left). Introducing the signal at different positions and varying its relative strength (loudness) would skew this vector distribution towards the signal speaker, providing another quantitative measure of the spatial release from masking.</italic> </p><p>We answer Points 5 and 6 together (below).</p><p><italic>6) How is this experimental design different from the one used in this study? It is different because the noise level would always be identical for the two ears, and the signal level in the ipsi- and contralateral ears would vary as a function of the signal location. In contrast, in the authors' design, the signal level is always the same across the two ears while the noise level varies. Hence, the authors' experiments test how the flies walk away from a noise source as a function of its relative strength and location (in the absence and in the presence of the spatially fixed signal), whereas the design suggested here would test how they walk towards a signal source as a function of its relative strength and location (in the absence and in the presence of the spatially fixed noise). These are different variables.</italic> </p><p><italic>Indeed, imagine two separate neural systems: one controlling the positive phonotaxis towards the signal (the cricket song), the other controlling the negative phonotaxis away from the noise. By changing the relative level of the signal across the two ears one modulates the former, whereas by changing the relative level of the noise across the two ears, one modulates the latter.</italic> </p><p><italic>Perhaps I am missing something, but it seems to me that in order to quantify the positive phonotaxis it is necessary to vary the location of the signal speaker while using a fixed noise source, rather than the other way around.</italic></p><p>This is an interesting issue. We used a frontal target signal (at 0º azimuth) and displaced a masker relative to the target to test for spatial release from masking (SRM). We acknowledge that this approach is only one of several spatial arrangements that may be used to test for SRM. However, we followed an approach that has proven to be effective in studying SRM in other animals (humans: Litovsky, 2005, Best et al., 2005, birds: Dent et al., 2009, harbour seal: Turnball, 1994). Beyond measuring response thresholds, we also wanted to establish how spatial separation between a target signal and masker affects localization accuracy and our approach provided a straightforward means of testing the specific expectation that <italic>O. ochracea</italic> should localize straight head in response to a forward attractive source.</p><p>Several practical considerations justify using a forward signal and lateral noise.</p><p>1) In the open-loop condition, forward is the only “correct” localization that can be specified. Because the flies get no corrective feedback when orienting on the treadmill, their turns toward laterally located sources tend to overshoot the actual source azimuth.</p><p>2) Turning responses (and the underlying sensory correlate) saturate at larger stimulus angles (above ~30-40° azimuth).</p><p>3) Freely walking flies (closed-loop condition) orient to face a source within ~150 ms of stimulus onset and thereafter walk to the source directly, rather than using a series of corrective turns (Mason et al., 2005).</p><p>So under normal conditions, forward (0 azimuth) is the only stable source location for <italic>Ormia</italic> phonotaxis. Using the treadmill, we can “force” them to respond continuously to a lateral stimulus. But points 1 and 2 above will make it difficult to clearly predict the effect of SRM (or its absence).</p><p>Our interpretation of the data is that flies respond to cricket song by detecting the onsets of sound pulses within the temporal pattern of the song. Individual pulse onsets are detected based on the increment in the stimulus envelope relative to the noise floor, which generates synchronous (or near-synchronous) activity in the receptor populations of the two ears. Spatially balanced noise will decrease the effective stimulus amplitude equally in both ears (masking). As the target source is moved to more lateral azimuth, there will be no effect on the perceived source direction, as both ears will be equally masked. At larger source angles, however, there may be some conditions where the stimulus would be completely masked in the contralateral ear, but not in the ipsilateral, due to the directional asymmetry of the stimulus. In this condition, for some stimulus amplitudes, the flies could respond with a larger turn angle than they would in the absence of masking noise. This would be a similar effect to what our data show (deviation of walking direction away from noise), but only for a specific range of stimulus angles.</p><p>In contrast, spatially biased noise with a forward-located source generates unequal binaural masking, and imposes a “perceived” directionality on the non-directional stimulus. The noise effect is to modulate positive phonotaxis via differential binaural masking of the attractive stimulus. The overall effect is that flies are “deflected” from the accurate path to the signal source by spatially biased noise. We show that this effect is present in the mechanical response of the tympanal membranes (more clearly now, with the addition of tympanal measurements matching the behavioural conditions), and in the responses of peripheral auditory receptors.</p><p>The possibility of independent modulation of two neural systems (for positive and negative phonotaxis, respectively), as suggested by the reviewer, must also be considered. We have revised the figures, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> now shows fly walking responses to noise and signal alone. Flies typically make a transient turn towards the direction of a sound source at the onset of any sound in their audible frequency range, but only show sustained walking for cricket-like patterns of amplitude modulation. More importantly, the direction of these transient walking responses to noise onset is towards the speaker, reinforcing the conclusion that the noise effect in our experiments is a modulation of the perceived direction of the positive phonotactic response, rather than a separate negative response.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>&quot;Despite the peripheral directionality provided by the mechanically coupled ears of O. ochracea, our behavioural results indicate that O. ochracea does not experience SRM.

Let us suppose for the moment that SRM does occur at spatial separations less than 6°. If this is the case, our data would suggest that the magnitude of release from masking saturates at and beyond 6° of spatial separation and that <italic>O. ochracea</italic> gain no further advantage in having greater spatial separations between the signal and masker. Even if <italic>O. ochracea</italic> experiences SRM, our data shows that <italic>O. ochracea</italic> are still unable to separate cues associated with the target signal from those that are associated with the masker. Localization responses are diverted away from the target signal and masker regardless of the whether there is a small (6°) or large (90°) spatial separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). In these diverted walking responses, we believe that the masker introduced directional cues that were not successfully segregated from target-driven directional cues.</p><p><italic>Having read this paper, I still don't know whether the fly does not have SRM or whether it has a super-acute SRM, matching the 2</italic>°<italic>superacuity of its spatial hearing.

Initial responses to sound onset are indiscriminate and therefore we cannot argue that they are indicative of any sustained response to the noise stimulus. The main intention of this argument, however, was to point out that there is no sustained response to a noise stimulus, only this indiscriminate onset-response. Flies do not walk away from noise by itself.</p><p>This being the case (no response to noise alone), then the distinction between our interpretation (directionality of positive response is modulated by interaural differences in noise-floor, and consequently perceived signal amplitude) and the proposed two-system model (separate positive and negative responses to signal and noise) becomes somewhat esoteric, since the negative response to noise is only manifest as a bias in the positive signal-driven response.</p><p>In addition, our measurements of peripheral auditory responses show that the interaural difference in effective signal amplitude matches the interaural amplitude difference that would be expected for a source azimuth (in quiet conditions) corresponding to the observed behaviour (angle of phonotaxis). The simplest interpretation for all of this is that the signal, at the noise-ipsilateral ear, is more strongly masked than at the noise-contralateral ear, resulting in an asymmetry of signal input that mimics a directional source location.</p></body></sub-article></article>
