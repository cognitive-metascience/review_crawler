(VEGF). However, little is known about when and how individual endothelial cell (EC) responds to angiogenic inputs in vivo. Here, we visualized endothelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in zebrafish and found that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations occurred in ECs exhibiting angiogenic behavior. Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations depended upon VEGF receptor-2 (Vegfr2) and Vegfr3 in ECs budding from the dorsal aorta (DA) and posterior cardinal vein, respectively. Thus, visualizing Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations allowed us to monitor EC responses to angiogenic cues. Vegfr-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations occurred in migrating tip cells as well as stalk cells budding from the DA. We investigated how Dll4/Notch signaling regulates endothelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and found that it was required for the selection of single stalk cell as well as tip cell. Thus, we captured spatio-temporal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics during sprouting angiogenesis, as a result of cellular responses to angiogenic inputs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08817.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08817.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08817.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Throughout life, new blood vessels grow out like branches from existing vessels in a process called “sprouting angiogenesis”. This involves some of the endothelial cells that line the inner surface of the blood vessel migrating outwards, creating a vessel sprout made up of tip cells and stalk cells.</p><p>Sprouting is controlled by two opposing signaling systems. One pathway is triggered by a molecule called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This molecule binds to receptor proteins to activate a range of signaling processes that stimulate endothelial cells to become tip cells, and so encourage the formation of new sprouts. However, it was not known exactly when or how the endothelial cells respond to these signals.</p><p>By contrast, the Notch signaling pathway inhibits sprouting angiogenesis. The two signaling pathways interact with each other: VEGF signaling in tip cells activates Notch signaling in neighboring cells, which then prevents VEGF signaling in these cells. This feedback mechanism helps a new sprout to form by suppressing tip-like activity in the cells surrounding a new tip cell, forcing these cells to become stalk cells.</p><p>Activating VEGF receptors also causes brief increases, or oscillations, in the level of calcium ions inside the endothelial cells. Now, Yokota, Nakajima et al. have investigated VEGF activity by genetically engineering zebrafish embryos so that fluorescent proteins inside their endothelial cells emit more light when calcium ion levels inside the cell increase. As zebrafish embryos are transparent, this change in fluorescence can be seen in the living animal. Imaging the embryos revealed that calcium ion oscillations occur in both tip and stalk cells in response to VEGF signaling as they bud from vessels. Notch signaling can also regulate the calcium ion oscillations; this controls whether an individual cell becomes a tip or a stalk cell, and restricts the number of stalk cells in the sprout.</p><p>The flow of blood through the vessels is also thought to influence calcium ion oscillations in endothelial cells. Future studies could therefore use the imaging technique developed by Yokota, Nakajima et al. to investigate how blood flow influences the development of new blood vessels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08817.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08817.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>imaging</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>VEGF</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22122003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mochizuki</surname><given-names>Naoki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CREST 13414779</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mochizuki</surname><given-names>Naoki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15K18976</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakajima</surname><given-names>Hiroyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mochizuki</surname><given-names>Naoki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008695</institution-id><institution>Japan Foundation for Applied Enzymology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakajima</surname><given-names>Hiroyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Visualization and quantitative analyses of calcium ion oscillations in the endothelial cells of zebrafish embryos reveal how vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Dll4/Notch signaling regulate sprouting angiogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An extensive branched blood vessel network is crucial to deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues and organs. Such branched structures of blood vessels form mainly by sprouting angiogenesis, which involves the emergence of new vessels from the pre-existing vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eilken and Adams, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herbert and Stainier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</xref>). In the early steps of sprouting angiogenesis, specific motile endothelial cells (ECs) activated by angiogenic cues become leading tip cells and migrate outward from the parental vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerhardt et al., 2003</xref>). As the tip cell migrates from the parental vessel, neighboring ECs migrate by following the tip cell as stalk cells to keep connection between the tip cell and the parental vessel. While tip cells guide the sprouts, stalk cells constitute the base of the sprouts and are, therefore, considered to be less active than tip cells.</p><p>Sprouting angiogenesis is triggered by extracellular stimuli. Among them, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A induces EC motility and loosen interendothelial cell junction by activating a tyrosine kinase receptor, VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2), to induce sprouting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferrara, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lohela et al., 2009</xref>). VEGF-A stimulates proliferation of ECs as well as survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koch and Claesson-Welsh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lohela et al., 2009</xref>). VEGFR3 (also known as Flt4), a receptor of VEGF-C, is also required for developmental or tumor angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tammela et al., 2008</xref>). Especially, Vegfr3 is essential for venous sprouting from the posterior cardinal vein (PCV) in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hogan et al., 2009</xref>). However, little is known about how VEGF-A/VEGFR2 or VEGF-C/VEGFR3 signaling in ECs induces initial sprouting in vivo.</p><p>While sprouting angiogenesis is promoted by VEGFR, it is negatively coordinated by delta-like 4 (Dll4)/Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eilken and Adams, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lohela et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</xref>). During sprouting angiogenesis, Dll4/Notch signaling between ECs determines the selection of single tip cells among ECs of the pre-existing vessel by restricting the angiogenic behavior of neighboring ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hellström, et al., 2007</xref>). In studies using mouse and zebrafish, loss of Dll4/Notch signaling results in an increased number of ECs showing tip cell behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hellström, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leslie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siekmann and Lawson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suchting et al., 2007</xref>). While VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling and Dll4/Notch signaling have opposing roles in regulating blood vessel sprouting, they are tightly linked in a negative feedback loop. VEGFR2 activation in tip cells leads to an up-regulation of the Notch ligand Dll4 and subsequent activation of Notch signaling in the following stalk cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lobov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suchting et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zarkada et al., 2015</xref>). Increased Notch activity leads to the downregulation of VEGFR2 and/or VEGFR3, thereby restricting VEGFR2- or VEGFR3-dependent signaling in the stalk cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benedito et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siekmann and Lawson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zarkada et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, VEGFR3 expression is suppressed by Dll4/Notch signaling in zebrafish and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benedito et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siekmann and Lawson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tammela et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zygmunt et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, it is unclear to what extent VEGFR2 expression is suppressed by Dll4/Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benedito et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jakobsson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suchting et al., 2007</xref>). VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 are responsible for the aberrant angiogenesis induced by loss of Dll4/Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hogan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leslie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siekmann and Lawson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suchting et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zarkada et al., 2015</xref>); however, it is still unclear how ECs behave in response to VEGFR-dependent angiogenic cues and how their behavior is spatio-temporally regulated by Dll4/Notch signaling.</p><p>Binding of VEGF-A to VEGFR2 induces dimerization of VEGFR2 and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in VEGFR2, leading to the activation of various downstream signaling pathways. Autophosphorylated VEGFR2 associates with phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ) and increases intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> via accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koch and Claesson-Welsh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moccia et al., 2012</xref>) and store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Besides VEGF-A, various chemical and mechanical stimuli induce an increase of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a common second messenger in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ando and Yamamoto, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moccia et al., 2012</xref>). However, little is known about when and where the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in ECs occur during vascular development in vivo. We considered that we could precisely monitor Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in vivo by using genetically encoded fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> monitoring probes which can be used for detecting rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in living animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rose et al., 2014</xref>). We hypothesized that Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics might represent one of EC responses to angiogenic cues during sprouting angiogenesis.</p><p>In this study, we succeeded in visualizing the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in ECs at single-cell resolution in zebrafish by performing high-speed, three-dimensional (3D) time-lapse imaging, and uncovered how Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics are spatio-temporally regulated during sprouting angiogenesis. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations occurred in migrating tip and stalk cells, in a manner dependent upon VEGFR signaling. By investigating when and how Dll4/Notch signaling regulates endothelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, we demonstrated how suppressive Dll4/Notch signaling was involved in the selection of tip cells from the dorsal aorta (DA) and that of stalk sells in intersomitic vessels (ISVs).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in budding tip cells from the DA</title><p>To understand how individual EC responds to angiogenic stimuli, we examined the dynamics of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in ECs during sprouting angiogenesis in vivo. We conducted in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging by expressing a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, GCaMP7a (GFP-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muto et al., 2013</xref>) in ECs of zebrafish. GCaMP7a is an improved version of GCaMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakai et al., 2001</xref>), an engineered GFP that increases fluorescence upon the Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Firstly, we established a transgenic fish line, <italic>Tg(fli1:Gal4FF);(UAS:GCaMP7a)</italic>, in which GCaMP7a was driven by the endothelial specific promoter <italic>fli1</italic> via the Gal4/UAS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asakawa et al., 2008</xref>). This Tg line showed an increase of fluorescence exclusively in ECs in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Secondly, to distinguish each EC, we developed a Tg fish line, <italic>Tg(fli1:H2B-mC)</italic>, in which EC nuclei was labeled by H2B-mCherry, and crossed this line with the <italic>Tg(fli1:Gal4FF);(UAS:GCaMP7a)</italic> line. We confirmed that almost all ECs expressed GCaMP7a in developing trunk vessels of these triple Tg embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), although the expression of GCaMP7a varied among ECs. To monitor fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in ECs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>), we used a light sheet microscopy, which allows rapid acquisitions in living embryos by illuminating the sample with a focused light sheet perpendicularly to the direction of observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huisken et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>We examined intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in budding ECs of the DA close to somite boundaries at 24–27 somite stages (ss). We defined these budding ECs as tip cells, because we confirmed that they eventually became tip cells. These tip cells showed sustained and non-periodic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). To avoid missing the fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations by taking z-axis images, we performed the time-lapse 2D imaging and confirmed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations could be observed at more than every min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). In every oscillation, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike occurs throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The time to reach the peak of individual oscillations was varied 5.6–18.7 s (average, 9.0 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, hereafter we performed 3D time-lapse imaging analyses at 5 s intervals to capture all Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels of individual ECs were quantified at each time point by measuring fluorescence intensity of GCaMP7a, while tracking H2B-mC-labelled cell nuclei over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>; see Materials and methods). We analyzed Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations by the frequency and average increases in relative fluorescence intensity of GCaMP7a from the base line (mean ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>). Frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations is elevated by increased levels of agonists in some cases in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carter et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacob et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moccia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mumtaz et al., 2011</xref>) and non-ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Woods et al., 1986</xref>). Meanwhile, the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise and total Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases may possibly reflect the dose of agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brock et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fewtrell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sage et al., 1989</xref>). Thus, in this study, we quantified the oscillations to describe the oscillatory activity in individual EC (see ‘Materials and methods’). Our quantification analyses clearly revealed that budding tip cells exhibited oscillatory activity at 24–27 ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Repetitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were not detected in other ECs within the DA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,D</xref>). These results indicate that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging method we used precisely detects the endogenous intracellular increase or decrease of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in vivo.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08817.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in tip cells during budding from the dorsal aorta (DA).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 3D-rendered time-sequential images of the trunk regions of <italic>Tg(fli1:Gal4FF);(UAS:GCaMP7a);(fli1:H2B-mC)</italic> embryos during vessel sprouting from the DA (24 somite stage (ss)). 3D images were acquired using a light sheet microscope.

To examine which angiogenic stimuli are responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations during vessel sprouting from the DA, we first tested the involvement of Vegfr2 since VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling is essential for sprouting angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koch and Claesson-Welsh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lohela et al., 2009</xref>) and can increase intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brock et al., 1991</xref>). Firstly, we examined the effect of inhibiting Vegfr2 on Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations by using an inhibitor of VEGFR2, ki8751 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kubo et al., 2005</xref>).

Tip cell migration stopped in ki8751-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), confirming that ki8751 inhibits Vegfr2 of zebrafish. ki8751 might also inhibit Vegfr3 activity, because, in our previous results, ki8751 treatment blocked Vegfr3-dependent venous sprout from the PCV in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>).

Since ISV sprouts emerge bilaterally from the DA, we analyzed one side of sprouting ISVs. When ECs within the DA started to sprout dorsally (19–22 ss), Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations were detected in two neighboring ECs (45.2%) or single ECs (52.4%) at somite boundaries, either of which sprouted dorsally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We confirmed that two neighboring ECs were not the result of a recent division (86%, n = 7, data not shown). These results suggest that the initial selection of single tip cells is not completed just after the onset of vessel sprouting. Ca<sup>2+</sup> response became restricted to single tip cells at later stage (24–27 ss) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting the completion of tip cell selection. Then, to visualize the process of tip cell selection between two neighboring cells exhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, we performed Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging for a longer period and found that only one cell maintained the oscillations over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). We also noticed that the ECs losing Ca<sup>2+</sup> response retracted their sprout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), implying that these cells lost their ability to respond to angiogenic cues. The ECs showing sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations eventually became tip cells (18/18, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, our results provide evidence that the initial selection of tip cells is determined even after ECs start to migrate from the DA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08817.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Iinitial tip cell selection in the DA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The number of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-oscillating ECs within the DA at each somite boundary of <italic>Tg(fli1:Gal4FF);(UAS:GCaMP7a);(fli1:H2B-mC)</italic> embryos at 19–22 and 24–27 ss.

We generated a dominant-negative Vegfr2 by deleting the C-terminus of zebrafish Vegfr2 (Vegfr2-ΔC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Millauer et al., 1994</xref>). Firstly, to validate whether Vegfr2-ΔC can block Vegfa/Vegfr2 signaling in zebrafish ECs, we established a Tg fish line, <italic>Tg(fli1:Gal4ff);(UAS:Vegfr2-ΔC,NLS-mC),</italic> that expresses Vegfr2-ΔC simultaneously with NLS-mC in ECs. In primary culture cells dissociated from the Tg embryos, Vegfaa-induced Erk phosphorylation was blocked in the Vegfr2-ΔC-expressing ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>; Vegfr2-ΔC+NLS-mC). In contrast, in the cells dissociated from the control <italic>Tg(fli1:Gal4ff);(UAS:NLS-mC)</italic> embryos that expressed NLS-mC alone in ECs, the Erk phosphorylation was not blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>; NLS-mC). These results confirmed that Vegfaa/Vegfr2 signaling is blocked by Vegfr2-ΔC expression. Consistently, ISV sprouting was blocked in the Tg embryos expressing Vegfr2-ΔC in ECs. We, then, observed the behavior of ECs expressing Vegfr2-ΔC in a mosaic manner by injecting the plasmids expressing Vegfr2-ΔC at one-cell stage. While expression of NLS-mC alone neither affect tip, stalk, nor DA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>; NLS-mC), the cells expressing both Vegfr2-ΔC and NLS-mC rarely became tip and stalk cells and remained in the DA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>; Vegfr2-ΔC+NLS-mC).

To investigate whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations were due to either mechanism, we measured how often the oscillations in tip or stalk cells were synchronized with adjacent stalk or tip cells, respectively. We found that 78.9% of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in stalk cells occurred independently of tip cells, and 91.6% of oscillations in tip cells occurred independently of stalk cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These results clearly indicate that most Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations observed in tip and stalk cells occurs independently of each other and not through ICWs. Therefore, our findings suggest that not only tip cells but also stalk cells have potential to respond to angiogenic cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Similarly to the earlier stage, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations were not detected in the ECs within the DA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>), except in ECs that were budding from the DA and following stalk cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Dll4/Notch signaling is crucial for suppressing Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in ECs adjacent to tip cells during budding</title><p>To understand how tip cell behavior is spatio-temporally regulated by Dll4/Notch signaling, we examined the effect of the inhibition of Dll4/Notch signaling on Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Previous reports have shown that MO-mediated knockdown of Dll4 leads to an increased number of ECs exhibiting tip cell behavior in zebrafish ISVs, which phenocopies loss of Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siekmann and Lawson, 2007</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations before and during vessel sprouting in <italic>dll4</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siekmann and Lawson, 2007</xref>). Before sprouting of ISVs, the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-oscillating ECs and their oscillatory activity were significantly increased in the entire DA in <italic>dll4</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>), suggesting that Dll4 suppresses the Vegfr2-dependent angiogenic responses in entire ECs of the DA. When ECs start budding at 19–22 ss, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were restricted to single ECs in 44.5% at somite boundaries in the control morphants, whereas those were, in 20.8% in <italic>dll4</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A;</xref> 19–22 ss). Most <italic>dll4</italic> morphants had two or more budding ECs exhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (79.2%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A;</xref> 19–22 ss). Thus, our findings support the hypothesis that Dll4 restricts the number of ECs showing tip cell behavior when they sprout from the pre-existing vessels. In the later stages (24–27 ss), while the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses became restricted to single tip cells in the control embryos, two or more neighboring ECs exhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in <italic>dll4</italic> morphants (74.1%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A;</xref> 24–27 ss).

Treatment with ki8751 completely abolished the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations observed in the <italic>dll4</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that an increase in the number of oscillating cells in the <italic>dll4</italic> morphants reflects an increase in the number of ECs showing either Vegfr2 or Vegfr3 activation. In zebrafish, arterial overproliferation and hypersprouting in the absence of Dll4/Notch signaling is, at least partially, attributed to ectopically enhanced Vegfr3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hogan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siekmann and Lawson, 2007</xref>). Accordingly, Vegfr3 might be involved in the ectopic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations during vessel sprouting in <italic>dll4</italic> morphant. To assess the contribution of Vegfr3 to the ectopic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, we examined Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in <italic>vegfr3/dll4</italic> double morphants at 24–27 ss when the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses became restricted to single tip cells in wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Thus, Vegfr3 is partially involved in increases in oscillating cells in the absence of Dll4/Notch signaling. On the other hand, these results imply that ectopic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations occur even in the absence of <italic>vegfr3</italic> after inhibiting Dll4/Notch signaling. Considering that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in <italic>dll4</italic> morphants were completely abolished by ki8751 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>), our findings suggest that Dll4/Notch signaling might restrict the tip cell number mainly by suppressing Vegfr2 signaling. Since Vegfr3 is responsible for hypersprouting of ISVs in the dorsal part of the <italic>dll4</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hogan et al., 2009</xref>), Dll4/Notch signaling might not suppress Vegfr3 signaling in the early stage but suppress it in the later stage.</p><p>To investigate the mechanism how Dll4/Notch signaling suppresses Vegfr2 signaling in ECs of zebrafish, we tested the effect of inhibiting Dll4/Notch signaling on the expression of <italic>vegfr2</italic> during sprouting of the ISVs.

Because Dll4/Notch signaling regulates the selection of single tip cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eilken and Adams, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lohela et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</xref>), we hypothesized that it might also regulate the selection of single stalk cell.

Since intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations generally occur through the concerted action between several Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smedler and Uhlen, 2014</xref>), further studies are needed to delineate whether Vegfr2 signaling directly regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> store or Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in ECs in vivo. Furthermore, it is also required to detect where intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases during sprouting angiogenesis. Although we observed an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> throughout the cytoplasm, if ECs respond to Vegfa, the initial increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> might be found in a manner dependent upon the distribution of Vegfr2. In cultured ECs, they exhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations only in the front of the cells but not in the rear during migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). These polarized Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations might be detected if we can improve the time/spatial resolution of imaging of zebrafish in vivo.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging at single-cell resolution pointed to the new regulatory mechanism underlying the formation of stalk cells following tip cells in the ISV. Lateral inhibitory action of Dll4/Notch signaling is essential for selection of tip cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eilken and Adams, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lohela et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</xref>); however, it is unknown how stalk cells are specified and migrate from the parental vessels. We found that stalk cells have Vegfr-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations when they start budding following tip cells and that Dll4/Notch signaling is required for the selection of single stalk cell similarly to tip cell selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling is active in stalk cells and is important for cell proliferation in mouse retina angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerhardt et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we propose that Vegfr2 activation in stalk cells is also necessary for the selection of stalk cells and their exit from the parental vessels during ISV formation. Thus, our Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging highlighted a novel role of Vegfr2 in stalk cells.</p><p>Tip cells and stalk cells are selected during sprouting angiogenesis. In the present study, we focused on the stage of ECs budding from the DA and observed that even two cells showing Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations budded from the DA and that one of them finally became single tip cell. Jacobsson et al. report that tip cells and stalk cells change their positions in elongating vessels sprouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jakobsson et al., 2010</xref>), whereas in the earlier stage, we did not observe interexchange of tip cells and stalk cells, suggesting that their plasticity of tip and stalk depends upon the stage and type of angiogenesis.</p><p>Dll4/Notch signaling is required for selection of single tip cell and single stalk cell during budding from the DA. Our findings support the notion that Dll4 in tip cells suppresses tip cell behavior in adjacent cells for the initial selection of tip cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eilken and Adams, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herbert and Stainier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lohela et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</xref>). Meanwhile, it has not been determined whether tip cells also suppress angiogenic responses in stalk cells via Dll4/Notch signaling during vessel elongation. Our results indicate that inhibitory activity of Dll4 toward Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in stalk cells diminishes after stalk cells come out from the DA. Instead, Dll4/Notch signaling restricts the number of stalk cells. Thus, our results suggest that Dll4/Notch-mediated lateral inhibition leads to suppression of angiogenic responses mainly in ECs within the DA adjacent to budding tip or stalk cells to restrict excess budding from the DA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). Our Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging provide novel insights into how Dll4/Notch signaling spatio-temporally controls angiogenic behavior.</p><p>Endothelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses can be used as an indicator of cellular responses to extracellular stimuli. In this study, we show that endothelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations occur during sprouting angiogenesis in response to Vegfa/Vegfr2 and Vegfc/Vegfr3 signaling. We could investigate endothelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses induced by other chemical or mechanical stimuli. Among them, blood flow is a well-studied input that induces an intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ando and Yamamoto, 2013</xref>). Blood flow-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases were recently reported in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goetz et al., 2014</xref>). Our Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging analyses have captured flow-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in various types of vessels (Yokota et al., unpublished data): therefore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging analysis will be a useful system for understanding quantitatively how individual ECs are regulated by blood flow in vivo. Thus, in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in ECs presented here will become a powerful tool to investigate the dynamic behavior of individual ECs in vascular development and homeostasis in the future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish husbandry</title><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were maintained and bred under standard conditions.

Time-lapse images were collected every 5 s for 1000–2000 s with a z-interval of 4 μm. Z-stack images were 3D volume-rendered and analyzed with IMARIS 7.7.1 software (Bitplane AG). ISV sprouts emerge bilaterally from the DA. Thus, to focus on sprouting angiogenesis occurring on one side, our analyses were performed at either side (left or right side) of the embryos by cropping. To quantify intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels of individual ECs at each time point, the cell nuclei labeled with H2B-mC were automatically (or manually in some cases) tracked over time using IMARIS software. Then, for each individually tracked EC, we set a spherical region of interest (ROI) of 4–11 μm in diameters that is slightly larger than the nucleus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The diameters of every spherical ROI were carefully set to cover the nucleus and part of the cytoplasm but do not overlap with adjacent ECs. We then defined the highest voxel intensity of the GCaMP7a fluorescence within the ROI as the florescent intensity (F) of GCaMP7a in the EC. Because intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves spread rapidly and uniformly throughout the cytoplasm of each EC (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), the spherical ROIs including part of the cytoplasmic region are enough to detect intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves. ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> was calculated as (F − F<sub>0</sub>)/ F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>0</sub> is the baseline florescent intensity of GCaMP7a averaged over a 50-s period. Fluorescence changes in GCaMP7a of individual ECs are represented as ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> traces in the graphs, and mean ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> was calculated by taking the average of every ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>. The frequency of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations was counted as the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations per min. ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> increase of 20% from the baseline was defined as an oscillation, while 100% is the average of the three highest ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> peaks in oscillating ECs of wild-type embryos.

It was felt that the conclusions in the Results section and discussion on using GCaMP7 as a bonafide read out of VEGFR2 activity dynamics in vivo is premature and problematic. In order to address this issue, the reviewers made the following recommendations which need to be addressed in any revised version of the manuscript:</italic> </p><p>First of all, we thank the editor and the reviewers for their practical suggestions and comments to improve our manuscript. As the reviewers pointed out, our claim that endothelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations are a bonafide readout of Vegfr2 signaling is premature, because Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations are only a branch of multiple Vegfr2 downstream signaling. According to the reviewers’ advice, we weakened the conclusion by changing the title and rewriting the manuscript accordingly. We now believe that the results obtained by our new additional experiments thoroughly fulfill the reviewers’ concerns. Our replies to each point are as follows.</p><p><italic>1) The authors should tone down their conclusions that they have a live readout for VEGFR signaling and focus on the correlation with endothelial activity in migration and sprouting, rather than as a direct readout of VEGFR signaling.</italic> </p><p>According to the reviewers’ advice, we have toned down our conclusions that Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses are a live readout for Vegfr2 signaling and have instead highlighted the conclusions that endothelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses correlate with angiogenic cellular behaviors such as migration and sprouting. We have focused on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations as a result of responses to angiogenic cues. We have changed the title and rewritten the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) In order to further explore whether the calcium oscillations are directly related to VEGF signaling, it is suggested that you examine whether similar oscillations occur in endothelial cells that sprout in response to Vegfc/Vegfr3 or Bmp signaling. This recommendation is essential for further consideration.</italic> </p><p>The angiogenesis we looked at is about the sprouting from the main trunk vessels of zebrafish. Therefore, according to the reviewers’ suggestions, we examined the possibility that Vegfc/Vegfr3 signaling instead of BMP might also induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations.</p><p>We have monitored Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in ECs of the venous sprouts (secondary sprouts) from the posterior cardinal vein (PCV), which occurred in response to Vegfc/Vegfr3 signaling (Hogan et al. Development 136:4001-4009, 2009). Tip cells in the venous sprouts exhibited apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in a manner dependent on Vegfr3. These data are included as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A-D</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) It is also suggested that you might attempt mosaic overexpression of Vegfr2 in ECs, in order to assess whether this gain of function could induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses during the angiogenic process. This recommendation may be harder to perform and interpret and so is not absolutely mandatory</italic> </p><p>According to the reviewers’ advice, we have overexpressed Vegfr2 and NES (nuclear export signal) tagged-mCherry to mark the cells in which overexpressed Vegfr2 is distinguished from other ECs in a mosaic manner. However, we could not detect significant enhancement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in the ECs expressing exogenous Vegfr2 before or during sprouting angiogenesis from the dorsal aorta (DA). We consider that overexpression of Vegfr2 could not cause a gain of function effect, because ECs might have a surplus amount of endogenous Vegfr2 to respond to endogenous Vegfa. Then, we examined the effect of Vegfr2 over-expression in <italic>vegfr2</italic> morphants. Whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations were abolished in ECs within the DA in <italic>vegfr2</italic> morphants, exogenous Vegfr2 recovered Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in the morphants (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-F</xref>). These new results support our notion that Vegfr2 is an essential regulator of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in the DA.</p><p><italic>4) Because the transgenic reporter line is new, some control experiments are crucial for publication. The authors should show that the endothelial-specific Ca probe responds as expected by looking at well-established agonists and antagonists of Ca signaling.</italic> </p><p>Precisely following the reviewers’ comments, we have confirmed that GFP from GCaMP7 reflects changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in ECs. While inonomycin treatment markedly enhanced GCaMP7a fluorescence in HUVECs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and in zebrafish (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), BAPTA-AM treatment blocked enhancement of GCaMP7a fluorescence induced by VEGF-A (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
