on rod photoreceptors and the well-studied rod bipolar (RB) cell pathway. The central neuron in this pathway, the AII amacrine cell (AC), exhibits a spatially tuned receptive field, composed of an excitatory center and an inhibitory surround, that propagates to ganglion cells, the retina’s projection neurons. The circuitry underlying the surround of the AII, however, remains unresolved. Here, we combined structural, functional and optogenetic analyses of the mouse retina to discover that surround inhibition of the AII depends primarily on a single interneuron type, the NOS-1 AC: a multistratified, axon-bearing GABAergic cell, with dendrites in both ON and OFF synaptic layers, but with a pure ON (depolarizing) response to light. Our study demonstrates generally that novel neural circuits can be identified from targeted connectomic analyses and specifically that the NOS-1 AC mediates long-range inhibition during night vision and is a major element of the RB pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retinal circuitry</kwd><kwd>amacrine cell</kwd><kwd>night vision</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY017836</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singer</surname><given-names>Joshua H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY014454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Demb</surname><given-names>Jonathan B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY029820</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>In-Jung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-EY026878</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>In-Jung</given-names></name><name><surname>Demb</surname><given-names>Jonathan B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>In-Jung</given-names></name><name><surname>Demb</surname><given-names>Jonathan B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY029323</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Demb</surname><given-names>Jonathan B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001209</institution-id><institution>Knights Templar Eye Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Silvia JH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Anatomical and physiological analyses identified an inhibitory interneuron that is an integral part of the rod bipolar cell pathway, the circuit for night vision, of the mammalian retina.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In dim light, vision originates with rod photoreceptors, which are sensitive enough to respond to single photons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ingram et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pugh, 2018</xref>). In mammals, rod output is conveyed to ganglion cells (GCs), the retinal projection neurons, via a specialized circuit: the rod bipolar (RB) cell pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Demb and Singer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Famiglietti and Kolb, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Field et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The central neuron in the RB pathway is the AII amacrine cell (AC), which receives excitatory, depolarizing input from the RBs at light stimulus onset, and is therefore an ON cell. The AII provides feedforward signals that simultaneously drive depolarizing and hyperpolarizing responses in ON and OFF GC types, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murphy and Rieke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Strettoi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Strettoi et al., 1992</xref>).

Signaling from AIIs to ON and OFF pathways is compartmentalized by the morphology of the AII, a bistratified cell with distinct neurites in the ON and OFF sublaminae of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). (Aii). Proximal (OFF-layer) dendrites provide glycinergic synapses (Aiii) onto the terminals of some OFF cone bipolar (CB) cells [primarily type 2 CBs; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graydon et al., 2018</xref>)] and onto the dendrites of some OFF ganglion cells (GCs), including OFF α and δ GCs as well as suppressed-by-contrast GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaudoin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demb and Singer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jacoby et al., 2015</xref>). At their distal (ON-layer) dendrites, AIIs are coupled by electrical synapses to the terminals of ON CBs (Aiv) (particularly type 6 CBs presynaptic to ON α GCs); depolarization of AIIs drives excitatory transmission to GCs, including ON α GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>) (Av). Thus, the AII mediates so-called ‘cross-over’ inhibition, whereby one pathway (ON, in this case) suppresses the other (OFF) and thereby decorrelates their outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Demb and Singer, 2015</xref>). (Bi-Bvi) In blue: rods are coupled electrically to cones by gap junctions (Bi), and cones make synapses onto ON and OFF CBs (Bii). Depolarization of the ON CB by the cone not only drives glutamatergic transmission to ON GCs (Biii), it also depolarizes AIIs via the electrical synapses (Biv) and thereby elicits glycinergic transmission to OFF GCs and perhaps OFF CBs (Bv). (Ci-Cii) In green: rods make direct chemical synapses onto some types of OFF CB (Ci), which in turn contact OFF GCs (Cii).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56077-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Although well-studied, several uncertainties about RB pathway function remain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demb and Singer, 2012</xref>). Most significantly, we do not understand the cellular basis for the spatial receptive field of the AII, which is composed of an excitatory center, driven by RB input, and an antagonistic, inhibitory surround. The surround is apparently generated by the activity of a spiking, GABAergic AC that makes direct inhibitory synapses with the AII, but the identity of this critical interneuron and the retinal circuitry in which it participates remain unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloomfield and Xin, 2000</xref>). Understanding mechanisms contributing to surround inhibition of the AII would explain how the retina encodes spatial information in dim light.</p><p>Here, we identified the major inhibitory input to the AII by combining anatomical, genetic, and electrophysiological analyses in a three-step process. One, we reconstructed ACs that provided synaptic input to AIIs in a volume of mouse retina imaged by scanning block-face electron microscopy [SBEM; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denk and Horstmann, 2004</xref>). Two, we evaluated published descriptions of reporter mouse lines to identify genetically-accessible ACs that had the anatomical characteristics of the cells reconstructed from SBEM images. And three, we used electrophysiological recordings and genetics-based circuit analysis to demonstrate that a candidate AC, which provided the great majority of the inhibitory synaptic input to AIIs, exhibited a light response predicted by its anatomy and made GABAergic synapses onto AIIs. This spiking, GABAergic AC is a multistratified, ON AC denoted NOS-1 AC and identified in the nNOS-CreER mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). We conclude that the NOS-1 AC is an integral component of the RB pathway and a significant source of long-range inhibition during night vision. More generally, our study demonstrates the utility of targeted, small-scale ‘connectomic’ analysis for identification of novel neural circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AIIs in the mouse retina exhibit a TTX-sensitive, GABAergic receptive field surround</title><p>The inhibitory receptive field surround of AIIs has been studied extensively in the rabbit retina, where it is GABAergic and appears to be generated by spiking ACs because it is suppressed by the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloomfield and Xin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xin and Bloomfield, 1999</xref>).

Recording at V<sub>hold</sub> = E<sub>cation</sub> = +5 mV during spot presentation in control (Ames’) medium yielded an evoked current comprising a mixture of genuine inhibitory current and unclamped coupling current. In the presence of TTX, the inhibitory input was suppressed, leaving the coupling current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The difference current (Ames’ – TTX; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) is the isolated, TTX-sensitive, rod-driven inhibitory input, which increased as a function of spot diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We observed as well that TTX exerted a mild suppressive effect on the excitatory light-evoked current, suggesting that spiking interneurons influence synaptic transmission from the presynaptic bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Propagation of the AII surround to downstream GCs</title><p>The surround suppression of AIIs is expected to propagate to the GCs that receive input from the RB-AII network.

The IPSCs recorded in OFF α and δ GCs were similar, although not identical, likely reflecting shared inputs from the AII combined with cell type-specific inhibitory inputs from unique AC types. Nevertheless, in all three GC types, surround suppression was blocked similarly by TTX, suggesting that it was mediated by a common presynaptic mechanism: inhibition of the AII. Thus, the mouse AII exhibits a TTX-sensitive receptive field surround mediated by direct inhibitory synapses and this surround is propagated to GCs. To understand the mechanism for surround inhibition, we searched for the inhibitory ACs presynaptic to the mouse AII.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Anatomical identification of inhibitory synaptic inputs to AIIs</title><p>We began by skeletonizing three AII ACs distributed across serial block face electron microscopy (SBEM) volume k0725 [mouse retina; 50 × 210 × 260 µm; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 2016</xref>); available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://webknossos.org/datasets/Demo_Organization/110629_k0725/view">https://webknossos.org/datasets/Demo_Organization/110629_k0725/view</ext-link>].

For each of these three AIIs, we annotated all the inputs from ribbon synapses, arising from RBs, as well as all the conventional synaptic inputs, presumed to arise from inhibitory ACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Of the 63 AC skeletons created, 61 were of neurites, generally unbranched, that extended through the volume and appeared to be axons: each of these originated from an AC not contained in the SBEM volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C2</xref>). After annotating their output synapses, we determined that these axons made synapses with AIIs almost exclusively; the remainder of the output was to RBs with very few synapses to ON CBs and unidentified cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C1</xref>, left, and 3C2). This determination was made by tracing the postsynaptic neurites sufficiently to identify RBs from their characteristic axon terminals, which are large and make dyad synapses with presumed AIIs and A17 ACs, and to identify AIIs based on several characteristic features: a soma position at the border of the INL and IPL; very thick proximal dendrites; and a postsynaptic position at RB dyad synapses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graydon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mehta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Strettoi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Strettoi et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>These 61 axons made 130 synapses onto the three reconstructed AIIs, giving rise to ~25% of the total inhibitory input to each AII. Therefore, assuming that each axon arises from a distinct cell, most AIIs receive ~2 inputs (i.e. ~130 synapses/61 axons) from each presynaptic AC; these inputs occur mostly (~80%) within 4 µm of RB→AII synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>), with a median distance of 2.3 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C4</xref>). Thus, the inhibitory AC inputs to the AII are well positioned for shunting local excitatory RB input.</p><p>The inputs to the AII somas and proximal (OFF layer) dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C1</xref>, right) were not considered in as much detail because these were few in number and presumed to arise from dopaminergic ACs (DACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Contini and Raviola, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gustincich et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Voigt and Wässle, 1987</xref>). Indeed, when we traced 8 neurites presynaptic to the soma and proximal dendrites of a single AII, we identified 113 output synapses in total, 90 (80%) of which were to neighbor AIIs and 23 to other cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C5</xref>). The AII soma appeared to be enveloped in a ‘basket’ of such neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C6</xref>), as noted previously for DAC→AII synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gustincich et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Voigt and Wässle, 1987</xref>).</p><p>Two of the 63 AC skeletons that made inputs to the AII distal dendrites could be traced to a relatively complete neuron contained within the SBEM volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>).

Both ACs exhibited very similar patterns of connectivity, as quantified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>. Interestingly, the vast majority of synaptic output was to AIIs (AII identity confirmed as described above); a smaller but significant portion was to RBs (again, confirmed as above), with the remainder to ON CBs (which were skeletonized completely; below). We did not observe any synapses onto other ACs or onto GCs. Thus, these two ACs appear to be representatives of a singlecell type that contacts preferentially neurons in the RB pathway, specifically AIIs. Given the similarity of the postsynaptic target neuron populations of these ACs and the axons reconstructed partially and described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left, and 3C2, 3), we believe all to be representative of the same AC type, a cell that contacts AIIs preferentially and provides the vast majority of inhibitory synapses to the AII.</p><p>Both ACs received very similar numbers of inputs from conventional and ribbon synapses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The conventional synapses were presumed to arise from ACs; these synapses were annotated, but we did not attempt to identify the presynaptic cells apart from following their processes for a short distance through the volume to ensure that they indeed were ACs (e.g. they lacked presynaptic ribbons and made other conventional synapses). We presume that these conventional synapses are inhibitory, given that most ACs are either GABAergic or glycinergic, but given the existence of at least one type of excitatory AC—the VGLUT3 AC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2016</xref>)—it is possible that some subset are excitatory. The VGLUT3 AC itself, however, is unlikely to be a presynaptic partner given that its synaptic inputs and outputs are confined to the central portion of the IPL, whereas the dendrites of the two reconstructed ACs were at the inner and outer margins of the IPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hsiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>). Synaptic inputs both from <italic>en passant</italic>, axonal ribbon synapses and from more typical, axon terminal ribbon synapses were observed; analysis of the presynaptic cells revealed them to be ON bipolar cells—both RBs and ON CBs—exclusively, and the synapses therefore are glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Thus, this AC appears to receive only excitatory ON bipolar input despite its being a multi-stratified cell with processes in both ON and OFF sublaminae of the IPL.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Connetivity of ACs presynaptic to AIIs.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C2</xref>)</th><th>Cell 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>)</th><th>Cell 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><bold>Inputs (from)</bold></td><td>Total: 2</td><td>Total: 314</td><td>Total: 297</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">AC</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">200 (63.5%)</td><td valign="bottom">183 (61%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">RB</td><td valign="bottom">1</td><td valign="bottom">47 (15%)</td><td valign="bottom">56 (19%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ON CB</td><td valign="bottom">1</td><td valign="bottom">66 (21%)</td><td valign="bottom">55 (18.5%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Unidentified</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">2 (&lt;1%)</td><td valign="bottom">3 (1%)</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Outputs (to)</bold></td><td>Total: 1425</td><td>Total: 115</td><td>Total: 106</td></tr><tr><td>AII</td><td>1212 (85%)</td><td>93 (81%)</td><td>86 (81%)</td></tr><tr><td>RB</td><td>173 (12%)</td><td>11 (9.5%)</td><td>18 (17%)</td></tr><tr><td>ON CB</td><td>35 (2%)</td><td>11 (9.5%)</td><td>2 (2%)</td></tr><tr><td>Unidentified</td><td>5 (&lt;1%)</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The 121 ON CB synapses onto the 2 ACs arose from 67 presynaptic ON CBs, and we skeletonized these ON CBs in order to identify them based on morphological characteristics and axon terminal depth within the IPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Manookin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sabbah et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stabio et al., 2018</xref>). Most of the presynaptic ON CBs belonged to the type 6 population; the others were a mix of types 5, 7 and 8 CBs (two cells could not be fully reconstructed and were unidentified) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Fifteen <italic>en passant</italic> (axonal) synapses onto the outer (OFF-layer) dendrites of the reconstructed ACs were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>): 13 from type 6 cells and 2 from the unidentified cells (likely type 6 CBs). Both the occurrence of these axonal ON bipolar cell synapses and their general appearance are consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dumitrescu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lauritzen et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, <italic>en passant</italic> synapses in axons of type 6 cells had a markedly distinct appearance from those in the other CB types: for <italic>en passant</italic> synapses in type 6 cells, ribbons tended to occur in clusters of at least three, all apposed to the same postsynaptic process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). In this respect, they resemble strongly the axonal ribbons observed in calbindin-positive ON CBs of the rabbit retina, which are likely homologous to mouse type 6 CBs because both share similar morphology and make synapses with ON α GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tien et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, <italic>en passant</italic> synapses were identified in the axons of some, but not all, reconstructed type 5, 7 and 8 ON CBs, indicating that such synapses are a common feature of ON CBs. None of these synapses, however, were presynaptic to the reconstructed ACs, suggesting that <italic>en passant</italic> synapses are formed with a high degree of target specificity.</p><p>The 103 RB synapses with these two ACs arose from 77 RBs (all of which were skeletonized; not shown). All RB→AC synapses were dyads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>); at 75% of these dyads, the AC replaced the A17 (i.e. the other postsynaptic cell was an AII), and at the remainder of the dyads, the AC either replaced the AII (18%) or else the identity of the second postsynaptic cell could not be confirmed (7%). In at least two of the cases in which the second cell at the dyad could not be identified, the dendrite had the appearance of those of the skeletonized ACs: a very thick dendrite containing clear cytoplasm. Thus, it appears that this AC receives a significant portion of its excitatory input (48%; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) from the RB population but that any individual RB provides only one or two synapses to a single AC; the latter finding is consistent with the vast majority of RB output being at dyad synapses with AII and A17 amacrine cells, in agreement with the standard model of RB synaptic output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demb and Singer, 2012</xref>).</p><p>A number of multistratified AC types have been reported in anatomical studies of the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badea and Nathans, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin and Masland, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pérez De Sevilla Müller et al., 2007</xref>).

Based on an earlier description of this driver line, we assumed that labeled cells in the GCL included a mixture of NOS-1 and NOS-2 ACs, with NOS-1 cells having the bistratified morphology described here and NOS-2 cells exhibiting thick, spiny dendrites that project into the central level of the IPL, between the layers marked by dendrites of ON and OFF starburst ACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jacoby et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>).

Negative contrast evoked a reduction of this baseline holding current, consistent with temporary suppression of ongoing presynaptic glutamate release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H,J</xref>). Excitatory input was blocked completely by L-AP4, which suppresses the responses of ON bipolar cells, and therefore, excitation was mediated exclusively by the ON pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Slaughter and Miller, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Inhibitory synaptic input (V<sub>hold</sub> = E<sub>cat</sub>) was measured at both positive and negative contrast, but the amplitude of the modulated current typically was small under control conditions.

As noted above, we did not measure directly the NOS-1 AC response threshold to dim light due to the laser exposure required for cell targeting, but the response threshold of the NOS-1 AC is presumably among the most sensitive in the retina due to its input from RBs and type 6 CBs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional relevance</title><p>As luminance increases from visual threshold to 10–20 R*/rod/s, the gain of transmission at the RB→AII synapse is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dunn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dunn and Rieke, 2008</xref>), and AIIs hyperpolarize; this hyperpolarization spreads to the terminals of type 6 CBs, which increases rectification while relieving activity-dependent synaptic depression at type 6→ON α GC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grimes et al., 2014a</xref>). The hyperpolarization of the AII in background light has been attributed to synaptic depression at the RB→AII synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grimes et al., 2014a</xref>), but this hyperpolarization likely also depends on direct synaptic inhibition from the NOS-1 AC. The combined influence of these synaptic mechanisms would allow the RB pathway to remain functional at backgrounds as high as 250 R*/rod/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ke et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Thus, inhibitory input from the NOS-1 AC might represent a significant modulatory mechanism within the RB pathway and could be responsible for maintaining high-fidelity signaling through a range of background luminance at which differentiating signal from noise is a particular concern. More generally, because the type 6 CB provides input to the NOS-1 AC and is coupled electrically to the AII network that is inhibited by the NOS-1 AC, we propose that a type 6 CB→NOS-1 AC→AII AC→type 6 CB feedback circuit could maintain the rectifying nature of transmission at type 6 CB synapses by preventing excessive presynaptic depolarization across a range of lighting conditions. Testing this prediction would require the inactivation or ablation of NOS-1 cells while recording at various stages of the RB pathway. A limitation of the nNOS-CreER retina is that Cre is expressed in several cell types, including the NOS-2 cell, which is the main source of NO release within the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jacoby et al., 2018</xref>). Improvements in the selective targeting of NOS-1 cells will be an important step in evaluating its function in retinal circuitry and behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We uncovered the dominant inhibitory input to the AII, the central neuron in the well-studied RB pathway of the mammalian retina. The NOS-1 AC is the spiking neuron responsible for generating the TTX-sensitive, GABAergic surround that modulates AII network function across a range of lighting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloomfield and Xin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xin and Bloomfield, 1999</xref>).

For filled cells, a whole-mount image of the dendritic tree was acquired using a 20X air objective (NA = 0.8); in some cases, multiple images were combined as a montage. A high-resolution z-stack of the ChAT bands (i.e. cholinergic starburst AC processes, labeled by the ChAT antibody) and the filled amacrine or ganglion cell was obtained to determine their relative depth in the IPL using a 40X oil objective (NA = 1.4). Analysis of nNOS, Lhx9, CRH and TH antibody labeling was performed either with the 40X oil objective or the 20X air objective. Cells were counted using ImageJ (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Supported by EY017836 to JHS, EY014454 and EY029323 to JBD, EY029820 to I-JK, P30-EY026878 to Yale University, a grant from the Knights Templar Eye Foundation to SJHP and an unrestricted grant from Research to Prevent Blindness to Yale University.

substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Connectomic analysis reveals an interneuron with an integral role in the retinal circuit for night vision&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Fred Rieke as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Greg D Field (Reviewer #2); Daniel Kerschensteiner (Reviewer #3).</p><p>As you will see from the individual reviews, all three of the reviewers were quite enthusiastic about the work and appreciated the breadth of approaches used to investigate this amacrine type and its role. We also had a discussion after submitting our reviews about the request for additional experiments, which is common across the reviews as you will see. We are all in agreement that, given the uncertainties of doing those experiments, you should view those as optional rather than mandatory – and specifically you should not wait to resubmit if doing extra experiments is impossible at this time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper uses an impressive array of techniques to identify an amacrine cell type involved in spatial processing in the retinal rod bipolar pathway. The cell is initially identified using electron microscopy to find conventional (non-ribbon) synapses onto AII amacrine cells and the processes of the presynaptic cells that make those synapses. Two complete cells are then reconstructed and based on their morphology a Cre line identified with a morphologically-similar set of cell labeled. The labeled cells (NOS-1 amacrine cells) have properties consistent with those expected from the em reconstructions. Nice direct experiments (optogenetics and cell elimination) confirm that the NOS-1 cells indeed provide inhibitory input to AII amacrines. The findings presented provided good support for the conclusions reached. I have several questions and suggestions about places the paper could be strengthened:</p><p>Subsection “Functional relevance”: Was it not possible to probe the NOS-1 cells at lower light levels? It would be quite interesting to see the contributions of rod and cone input to their responses given the proposed circuitry and functional role.</p><p>The assumption that all conventional synaptic input to the NOS-1 cell is inhibitory should be qualified given the presence of amacrine cells that release glutamate, and non-ribbon synapses made by bipolar cells.</p><p>Quantification. Several anatomical observations would be stronger with some quantification. This includes the proximity of the AC-AII synapses and the dendritic branching angle (subsection “Anatomical identification of inhibitory synaptic inputs to AIIs”).</p><p>Subsection “The NOS-1 AC is the predominant NOS-expressing AC in the ganglion cell layer and is distinct from CRH-expressing ACs”: how does the sustained ON response uniquely identify NOS-1 cells? Specifically, could there be another cell type with a sustained ON response that is mixed in? To establish this definitively it seems you would need to fill the recorded cells and see if they share similar morphology. Related, do the brightly labeled cells have NOS-1 morphologies?</p><p>Subsection “Propagation of the AII surround to downstream ganglion cells”: surrounds inherited from the AII might be expected to be similar across RGC types. This does not appear to be the case, as the surround in the OFF α looks somewhat stronger than the other two cells. It would be helpful to fit the dependence of the response on stimulus diameter to compare parameters of a difference of gaussian model and see if they are consistent.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>As the author's point out, the rod bipolar –&gt; AII amacrine cell circuit is one of the most studied circuits in the mammalian retina. It is also an immensely important circuit as it serves to reliably and efficiently process visual input under conditions when photons are scarce. Given all the work that has been performed previously on this circuit, the bar is rather high to make a substantive and transformative contribution to our understanding of it. This manuscript, in my view, sails over that bar. The study is an impressive combination of high-throughput anatomical reconstructions, clever utilization of transgenic mouse lines, and careful physiological measurements to identify a new and important element of the retina's primary circuit for night vision. In particular, the manuscript identifies the NOS-1 amacrine cell as the primary cell type that provides a receptive field surround (via GABAergic lateral inhibition) to AII amacrine cells. From a scientific perspective, I could not find significant issues with the logic or execution of the experiments described in this manuscript. It is one of the best papers I have reviewed in some time.</p><p>I do think the authors could make more of an effort to connect to a wider audience in the Abstract and Introduction. The paper is a straightforward read for a retinal neuroscientist, but I'm not sure a neuroscientist outside of that field will understand what is really interesting and important here. For example, the first two sentences of the Abstract build almost zero interest and give little insight to the core problem or why understanding this circuit is interesting. Pitching the paper as “understanding where the surround under scotopic conditions comes from” would at least pull in a broader community of vision scientists who would understand why that problem is important. Similarly, in the Introduction, the authors don't really cue the reader into the question they are tackling until the end of the 4th paragraph. I don't think a full exposition of the rod circuit is necessary before letting the reader know what question the paper is answering, and the current approach seems likely to put off casual readers. That said, leaving the manuscript “as is” would already put it in the top ~5% of manuscripts that I've read.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study, Park et al. identify nNOS1 amacrine cells as a component of the retinal circuit that processes low-light information. The authors first show that the surround inhibition of AII amacrine cells, which relay low-light signals from rod bipolar to cone bipolar and ganglion cells, relies on spiking amacrine cells. They then trace the inhibitory inputs to AII amacrine cells in a previously published serial blockface scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) volume and find that many inputs are provided by axonal processes that send output to AIIs but receive little or no input in the volume. However, 2 of the 63 traced processes are connected to cell bodies within the volume. Tracing of these cells reveals bistratified arbors (large ON, small OFF) in the inner plexiform layer. These arbors receive input from ON cone bipolar cells (mostly type 6) and rod bipolar cells and from other amacrine cells near the cell body and provide output in their periphery. Given morphological similarities, the authors hypothesize that the respective cells are nNOS1 amacrine cells. They target nNOS1 amacrine cells in nNOS-CreER mice and show (1) that they are spiking amacrine cells and (2) that in spite of their bistratified arbors excitatory inputs and spikes are elicited solely by ON stimuli, consistent with SBEM reconstructions. The authors confirm functional connectivity between nNOS1 and AII amacrine cells by optogenetics. Finally, they use viral expression of diphtheria toxin to ablate nNOS1 amacrine cells and show that this abolishes surround inhibition of AII amacrine cells.</p><p>Overall, this is an excellent study, impressive in its scope and technical ability. It combines electrophysiological recordings with SBEM reconstructions, optogenetic mapping, and a cell-type-specific perturbation to identify a new component of a well-studied retinal circuit with known behavioral functions. Experiments are performed to a high technical standard and results are presented clearly. However, the presentation of the anatomical data could be enriched, larger stimuli should be included when probing the surround inhibition of AII amacrine cells, and I encourage the authors to take advantage of their cell-type-specific perturbation to test the impact of nNOS1 amacrine cells on dim light signals of ganglion cells (i.e., the output from the retina to the brain).</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) Surround inhibition of AII amacrine cells in control conditions (Figure 2) is tested only with small stimuli. This is a mismatch to the stimuli used for ganglion cells, nNOS1 amacrine cells, and AII cells after the deletion of nNOS1 amacrine cells. The authors should include larger stimuli in their experiments in Figures 2A-D, to allow for better comparisons between datasets.</p><p>2) The authors show that the removal of nNOS1 amacrine cells by viral expression of diphtheria toxin reduces the surround inhibition of AII amacrine cells. To elucidate the significance of nNOS1 amacrine cells to the output signals of the retina, I encourage the authors to test the effects of nNOS1 removal on spike response of ON α, OFF α, and OFF δ cells. This would boost the significance of the study.</p><p>3) I suggest changing the order in which optogenetic and diphtheria toxin experiments are presented. It seems more natural to me to follow the anatomical discovery of connections between nNOS1 and AII amacrine cells with their functional confirmation (i.e., optogenetics) and then to move on to the perturbation that elucidates the functional significance of nNOS1 – AII amacrine cell connections.</p><p>4) For the synaptic constellations in Figures 4D and 4E, it would be great if the authors could include supplementary videos scrolling through successive planes.</p><p>5) I was slightly confused by the inclusion of ON SACs as a laminar marker in Figure 4C and suggest switching to the same gray ON and OFF SAC bands as in Figure 4A.</p><p>6) In a supplement for Figure 4, it would be great if the authors could show en face views of the arrays of the different bipolar cell types connected to each nNOS1 amacrine cells (including only bipolar cells with synapses onto the respective target).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56077.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] I have several questions and suggestions about places the paper could be strengthened:</p><p>Subsection “Functional relevance”: Was it not possible to probe the NOS-1 cells at lower light levels?

Therefore, we decided to work at a light level above absolute rod threshold but still within the range where rod bipolar cells are active.

The resulting distribution is illustrated in Figure 3C4. We note that 50% of the AC–&gt;AII synapses are within 2.26 µm of a RB–&gt;AII synapse, indicating that the inhibitory AC input is positioned to modulate the AII response to excitatory input from the RB (subsection “Anatomical identification of inhibitory synaptic inputs to AIIs”). Also, we deleted any mention of branching angle from the revised text because we do not have enough observations to make any quantitative assessment of the significance of the observation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “The NOS-1 AC is the predominant NOS-expressing AC in the ganglion cell layer and is distinct from CRH-expressing ACs”: how does the sustained ON response uniquely identify NOS-1 cells?

For this purpose, we think the difference-of-Gaussians model to be too poorly constrained (fitting diameter-response curves with four parameters: peak and space constant of center and surround) to be useful. Furthermore, the recorded IPSCs reflect all inhibitory input to the OFF α and δ cell types, not just the AII input, and therefore diversity across ganglion cells is expected: we would not expect identical tuning curves unless the synaptic inputs to the cells were identical, which they are not. We commented on this point (subsection “Propagation of the AII surround to downstream ganglion cells”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>I do think the authors could make more of an effort to connect to a wider audience in the Abstract and Introduction.

The total effect of ablating all NOS+ cells could have effects beyond the elimination of the NOS-1 –&gt; AII synapse. For this reason, we think a full evaluation of the role of NOS-1 cells in retinal function (and behavior) will require more selective genetic targeting of the NOS-1 cell.
