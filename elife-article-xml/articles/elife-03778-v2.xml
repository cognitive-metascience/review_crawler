Overexpression of NEDD4L can also stimulate HIV-1 release but in this case the Gag protein lacks a PPXY motif, suggesting that NEDD4L may function through an adaptor protein. Here, we demonstrate that the cellular protein Angiomotin (AMOT) can bind both NEDD4L and HIV-1 Gag. HIV-1 release and infectivity are stimulated by AMOT overexpression and inhibited by AMOT depletion, whereas AMOT mutants that cannot bind NEDD4L cannot function in virus release. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that in the absence of AMOT assembling Gag molecules fail to form a fully spherical enveloped particle. Our experiments indicate that AMOT and other motin family members function together with NEDD4L to help complete immature virion assembly prior to ESCRT-mediated virus budding.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03778.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03778.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03778.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To multiply and spread infections, viruses must enter and exit cells. Once inside a cell, many viruses conscript the cell's machinery to produce new viral particles and release them into the surroundings. Some viruses—like HIV-1—exit the cell in a way that leads to them being wrapped (or ‘enveloped’) in membrane from the host cell.</p><p>A virus protein called Gag is required for the release of HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses. In some cases, Gag proteins bind directly to members of the NEDD4 protein family to enable the viruses to be released. However, the Gag protein from HIV-1 does not appear to be able to interact directly with NEDD4 proteins, so it was not clear how Gag works in this case.</p><p>Mercenne et al. studied how HIV-1 is released from human cells grown in the laboratory. The experiments show that members of a human protein family called the Angiomotins bind to both Gag and NEDD4L (a member of the NEDD4 family) and are required for the efficient release of viruses. Using a technique called electron microscopy, Mercenne et al. observed that when Angiomotins are present, Gag proteins assemble in spheres at the cell membrane and viruses are able to exit the cell. However, when Angiomotins are depleted or absent, incomplete spheres of Gag proteins accumulate on the inner membrane surface and viruses are not released.</p><p>These findings show that Angiomotins act as a link between Gag and NEDD4L to promote the release of HIV-1 from human cells. The next step will be to learn precisely how this works. There are indications that the Angiomotins may also be involved in the release of other enveloped viruses, so the findings may be useful for the development of treatments for a variety of viral infections.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03778.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03778.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>HIV Gag protein</kwd><kwd>NEDD4L</kwd><kwd>motin protein family</kwd><kwd>ESCRT pathway</kwd><kwd>virus-host interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI051174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sundquist</surname><given-names>Wesley I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM082545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sundquist</surname><given-names>Wesley I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arii</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Angiomotin (AMOT) is a cellular host factor that links HIV-1 to the ubiquitin E3 ligase, NEDD4L, and promotes virion assembly and envelopment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As obligate parasites, viruses must harness host cellular pathways to complete many different steps in viral replication. For example, a large number of enveloped viruses, including HIV-1, usurp the cellular ESCRT (<underline>E</underline>ndosomal <underline>S</underline>orting <underline>C</underline>omplexes <underline>R</underline>equired for <underline>T</underline>ransport) pathway to bud from cells (for recent reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meng and Lever, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Votteler and Sundquist, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weissenhorn et al., 2013</xref>). Viral structural proteins typically use one or more short peptide motifs, termed ‘late assembly domains’, to bind and recruit early-acting ESCRT factors or ESCRT-associated E3 ubiquitin ligases to sites of viral assembly and budding. The three best characterized viral late assembly domains are: (1) the ‘PTAP’ motif (Pro-Thr/Ser-Ala-Pro), which binds the UEV domain of the TSG101 subunit of the ESCRT-I complex, (2) the ‘YPX<sub>n</sub>L’ motif (Tyr-Pro-X<sub>n</sub>-Leu, where X can vary in identity and sequence length), which binds the V domain of the ESCRT factor ALIX, and (3) the ‘PPXY’ motif (Pro-Pro-X-Tyr), which binds the WW domains of NEDD4 family E3 ubiquitin ligases. All three of these viral late assembly domains mimic cellular protein–protein interactions that facilitate ESCRT-dependent vesiculation processes such as multi-vesicular body (MVB) biogenesis and ectosome formation.</p><p>In addition to the three well-characterized late assembly domains described above, there are indications that enveloped viruses can also connect to the ESCRT pathway via alternative interactions that are not yet well-understood. For example, efficient release of the model paramyxovirus, PIV5, requires a non-canonical ‘FPIV’ late assembly domain motif, ubiquitylation of the matrix (M) protein, and host Angiomotin-like protein 1 (AMOTL1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmitt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pei et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison et al., 2012</xref>). There is no evidence that AMOTL1 can bind the FPIV late assembly domain, however, and any relationships between ubiquitin, AMOTL1 and the FPIV late assembly domain activity are not yet understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pei et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Owing to its medical importance, HIV-1 has become a leading model for understanding ESCRT pathway recruitment and viral budding. The C-terminal p6 region of the viral Gag structural protein contains canonical PTAP and YPX<sub>n</sub>L motifs that serve as the major functional late assembly domains in most cell types. Nevertheless, the release of ‘crippled’ HIV-1 Gag constructs that lack both of these late domains can still be stimulated by overexpression of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase, NEDD4L (also known as NEDD4-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Usami et al., 2008</xref>). Humans express nine different NEDD4 protein family members (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ingham et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernassola et al., 2008</xref>), but NEDD4L stimulates virus budding more potently than any other NEDD4 family member, implying that HIV-1 Gag preferentially engages this E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Usami et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have defined many of the requirements for NEDD4L-stimulated HIV-1 release. NEDD4L has many different isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dunn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Itani et al., 2005</xref>), but isoform 2 (also called NEDD4-2s, and here termed NEDD4L) potently stimulates the budding of crippled HIV-1 constructs, and uniquely rescues the Gag processing defects that accompany defective budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Usami et al., 2008</xref>). This NEDD4L isoform contains only the final 31 residues of the N-terminal C2 membrane binding domain, a central linker region that contains four WW domains, and a C-terminal HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase domain that forms Lys-63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim and Huibregtse, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weiss et al., 2010</xref>). Stimulation of HIV-1 budding requires NEDD4L E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, indicating that Lys-63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains perform an essential function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Usami et al., 2008</xref>). The functional target(s) of Lys-63 poly-ubiquitylation has not been established definitively, but HIV-1 Gag itself is the leading candidate because functional virus budding correlates with Lys-63-linked poly-ubiquitylation of Gag, and because NEDD4L truncation constructs that include the HECT domain can be functionally rescued by fusion to the HIV-1 Gag-targeting cyclophilin A domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weiss et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sette et al., 2013</xref>). HIV-1 Gag lacks identifiable PPXY motifs, however, and there is no evidence that Gag can bind NEDD4L directly.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03778.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>AMOT p130 is a NEDD4L binding partner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustrations of the domain structures and motifs in NEDD4L, AMOT p130 and p80, AMOTL1, AMOTL2 and HIV-1 Gag.

We undertook the present study with the goal of identifying co-factors that might help link NEDD4L to HIV-1 Gag and stimulate virus budding. We identified Angiomotin (AMOT) as a protein that binds both NEDD4L and HIV-1 Gag, and functions in HIV-1 assembly and release. AMOT is required to complete virion assembly and envelopment, and is therefore a new host factor that acts in a previously uncharacterized step of HIV-1 morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NEDD4L binds Angiomotin</title><p>Affinity purification/mass spectrometry experiments were performed to identify candidate NEDD4L binding partners. A number of cellular proteins co-purified with OSF (One-STrEP-FLAG)-tagged NEDD4L, as visualized by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2). Prominent co-purifying proteins were excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and identified by mass spectrometry. The p130 isoform of human Angiomotin was unambiguously identified as a protein that co-purified with OSF-NEDD4L in three independent repetitions of this experiment, (lane 2, labeled AMOT p130, peptide coverage data are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Smaller AMOT p130 fragments were also identified, as was the related AMOT family protein, Angiomotin-like protein 1 (AMOTL1, data not shown).</p><p>Cells express two AMOT isoforms, a longer p130 isoform, and a shorter C-terminal p80 isoform that is expressed from an alternatively spliced message (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moreau et al., 2005</xref>). AMOT p130 binds NEDD4 protein family members via interactions between the four central NEDD4 WW domains and three PPXY motifs located within the N-terminal extension that is unique to the AMOT p130 isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). In good agreement with this report and with our affinity purification/mass spectrometry results, we found that AMOT p130 co-immunoprecipitated with exogenously expressed OSF-NEDD4L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, panel 1, lane 2). In contrast, AMOT p130 did not co-immunoprecipitate with a mutant OSF-NEDD4L protein that contained inactivating Trp to Ala substitutions in the key PPXY-binding ‘W39’ residues from each of the four WW domains (denoted OSF-NEDD4L<sub>ΔWW</sub>, panel 1, compare lanes 2 and 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Otte et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>A previous study has demonstrated that NEDD4 proteins can ubiquitylate and reduce AMOT p130 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), and we also observed that OSF-NEDD4L overexpression modestly reduced AMOT p130 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, panel 3, compare lanes 1 and 2). We therefore tested whether AMOT p130 also co-precipitated with OSF-NEDD4L proteins that carried inactivating Cys942Ala point mutations in the active site cysteine of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase domain (OSF-NEDD4L<sub>C942A</sub>). This mutation increased OSF-NEDD4L levels in the lysate and immunoprecipitate (panels 2 and 4 compare lanes 4 and 5 to lanes 2 and 3) and restored normal AMOT protein levels (panel 3, compare lanes 4, 5 and 1 to lane 2). Once again, AMOT p130 (and breakdown products) co-immunoprecipitated with OSF-NEDD4L<sub>C942A</sub> (panel 1, lane 4), but not with a protein that also contained inactivating WW domain mutations (OSF-NEDD4L<sub>ΔWW/C942A</sub> panel 1, lane 5). AMOT p130 co-precipitation levels were higher with OSF-NEDD4L<sub>C942A</sub> than with wild type OSF-NEDD4L, presumably owing to the higher cellular levels of both OSF-NEDD4L and AMOT p130 (compare lanes 2 and 4).</p><p>Three additional observations confirmed that the NEDD4L WW domains and AMOT p130 PPXY motifs are critical for the NEDD4L-AMOT p130 interaction. Firstly, mutating the three N-terminal AMOT p130 PPXY motifs strongly inhibited co-immunoprecipitation of HA-AMOT p130 with OSF-NEDD4L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, panel 1, compare lanes 2 and 3).

Thirdly, we observed that exogenously expressed, epitope-tagged NEDD4L and AMOT p130 co-localized well in HeLa-M cells, and this co-localization required both the AMOT PPXY and NEDD4L WW motifs (data not shown), in good agreement with previous reports that motins co-localize with other NEDD4 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Skouloudaki and Walz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).

Importantly, the detrimental effects of AMOT p130 depletion were almost completely rescued by re-expression of wild type AMOT p130 (compare lanes 1, 4 and 5) but not by the mutant AMOT p130<sub>ΔPPXY</sub> protein (lane 6). These experiments demonstrate that AMOT p130 is required for efficient release of wild type HIV-1 from 293T cells and mutations that abolish NEDD4L binding block the ability of AMOT p130 to function in virus release.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03778.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>AMOT p130 is required for efficient release of wild type HIV-1.</title><p>Left panels are western blots showing 293T cellular levels of endogenous ALIX (panel 1, anti-ALIX), TSG101 (panel 2, anti-TSG101), AMOT (panel 3, anti-AMOT), GAPDH (panel 4, anti-GAPDH, loading control) and levels of HIV-1 Gag proteins (panel 5, anti-MA and anti-CA).

We speculate that this effect again reflects dominant inhibition of endogenous AMOT p130. Regardless, our data indicate that AMOT p130 also stimulates virus release and infectivity from T cells, which are natural targets of HIV-1 infection. Consistent with this conclusion, a global shRNA screen for host cofactors revealed that Jurkat T cells transduced with an shRNA that targeted AMOT were protected against HIV cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yeung et al., 2009</xref>).

Culture supernatants were removed from the virus producing cells and the adherent cells were fixed while still attached to the culture dish in order to maximize the numbers of cell-associated virions. Fixed cells were harvested, embedded in resin, thin sectioned, stained, and visualized by TEM. Cell-associated virions observed in these experiments were scored as being either: (1) mature (discernable conical or condensed cores), (2) immature (discernable immature Gag shells), or (3) budding (contiguous cellular and viral membranes).</p><p>HIV-1 virions associated with wild type cells were usually mature (76 ± 5%, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), but immature and budding virions were also observed (9 ± 3% and 15 ± 5%, respectively). As expected, TSG101 depletion induced a strong virus budding defect, with the majority of detected virions arrested at the budding stage (67 ± 7%, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> and quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). In addition, the ratio of mature (10 ± 6%) to immature (23 ± 2%) virions (1:2.3) was much lower than in the control case (1:0.1), consistent with previous reports that TSG101 is also required for efficient Gag processing and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Göttlinger et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garrus et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin-Serrano et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>AMOT depletion also inhibited virus release, as reflected in a large increase in the percentage of virions detected at the budding stage (72 ± 6%, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> and quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). In this case, however, the virions that were released exhibited a normal ratio of mature:immature virions (25 ± 5% vs 3 ± 2%; 1:0.1). Importantly, the budding defect seen in cells lacking endogenous AMOT was almost completely rescued by re-expression of the siRNA-resistant AMOT p130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), so that the majority of virions were now mature (70 ± 5% vs 76 ± 5% in the control), and budding virion levels were nearly normal (26 ± 9% vs 15 ± 5% in the control). Thus, AMOT depletion blocks virus release at the assembly/budding stage, but does not inhibit Gag processing or virion maturation.</p><p>It was also striking that AMOT depletion caused virion assembly/budding to arrest at an earlier stage than TSG101 depletion. This difference can be seen in the EM images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>, where most of the virions in TSG101-depleted cells exhibit the characteristic ‘lollipop’ morphology associated with a late assembly/membrane fission defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), whereas most of the virions budding from AMOT-depleted cells exhibit a ‘half-moon’ morphology in which the nascent viral membrane and Gag shell are incomplete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This observation was quantified by imaging 500 budding HIV-1 virions from: (1) wild type cells (control), (2) cells depleted of TSG101, and (3) cells depleted of AMOT. The arc formed by the Gag shell was measured manually for each budding virion, and the 500 measurements for each condition were then binned in 15° intervals and displayed graphically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>).</p><p>The Gag arc distribution of control virions budding from wild type cells exhibited two similarly sized peaks; one in which the Gag shells covered an arc of ∼155<bold>°</bold>, and another in which the Gag shells covered an arc of ∼320<bold>°</bold>. These measurements indicate that virion assembly intermediates (or possibly dead-end products) appreciably accumulate at two different stages, suggesting that either stage can be rate limiting. In cells lacking TSG101, budding-arrested virions were much more prevalent and they typically arrested at very late stages of assembly, with the maximal population exhibiting a Gag shell arc of ∼320°. In cells lacking AMOT, arrested virions were again prevalent but they arrested at a much earlier stage, with the maximal population exhibiting a Gag shell arc of ∼165°. The dramatic increases in numbers of budding virions induced by depletion of TSG101 or AMOT can explain how the assembly phenotypes could distribute as single peaks in these cases, whereas virions budding from wild type cells (which were much rarer) distributed into two peaks. Our experiments reveal that HIV budding arrests at an earlier stage in the absence of AMOT than in the absence of TSG101, implying that AMOT acts at an earlier stage of virion morphogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have identified Angiomotin (AMOT) as a host protein required for efficient HIV-1 release. In the absence of AMOT, most virions arrested at a ‘half-moon’ stage in which a hemisphere of assembled Gag molecules distended the membrane, but did not form a spherical particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The AMOT depletion phenotype was distinct from the defect induced by the absence of ESCRT factors, where virus budding arrested at a ‘lollipop’ stage in which nearly complete immature virions remained tethered to the host cell via thin membrane stalks. Thus, cellular factors facilitate (at least) two distinct steps in virion morphogenesis, with AMOT required to complete assembly/envelopment and the ESCRT machinery required for membrane fission. HIV-1 virions budding from control cells accumulated at both stages, suggesting that both steps can be kinetic bottlenecks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref> and reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ku et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The Gag lattice organizes the virion and undoubtedly helps to drive membrane envelopment because pure recombinant Gag proteins can form spherical particles in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>). In cells, however, Gag appears to require additional activities to bend the membrane, extrude the particle, and sever the bud neck. The well-studied process of endocytic vesicle formation provides precedence for these additional requirements because clathrin alone can form spherical assemblies but nevertheless requires assistance from BAR domain-containing proteins to help bend membranes, and assistance from actin and dynamin to release the vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weinberg and Drubin, 2012</xref>). It is intriguing that AMOT p130 also contains a candidate BAR-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heller et al., 2010</xref>) and can associate with F-actin (Ernkvist et al., 2006, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2013</xref>). The AMOT BAR-like domain can remodel membranes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heller et al., 2010</xref>), although it is not yet clear whether it functions as a classical or an inverse BAR domain. This distinction is mechanistically significant because classical BAR domains stabilize positive membrane curvature whereas inverse BAR domains stabilize negative curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mim and Unger, 2012</xref>), both of which are generated during enveloped virus assembly. In principle, the BAR domain could mediate AMOT p130 recruitment at the half-moon stage, once the nascent viral membrane has reached the proper degree of curvature. The BAR domain could also help drive the additional membrane curvature required to proceed to the lollipop stage. Similarly, F-actin recruitment and polymerization could help ‘push’ the virion toward the lollipop stage, although several recent studies argue strongly against an essential role for F-actin in HIV-1 assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bharat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rahman et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments indicate that another important AMOT p130 function is to recruit NEDD4L to sites of virus budding. In support of this idea, we have shown that: (1) the two proteins bind one another directly through interactions between the NEDD4L WW domains and PPXY elements present in the unique N-terminal region of the AMOT p130 isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1, 2</xref> and references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moleirinho et al., 2014</xref>), (2) AMOT p130 can recruit NEDD4L to cellular membranes, and this activity requires the NEDD4L WW-AMOT p130 PPXY interactions ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heller et al., 2010</xref>] and our data not shown), (3) NEDD4L cannot stimulate release of ‘crippled’ HIV-1 constructs in the absence of AMOT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), (4) NEDD4L mutants that cannot bind AMOT are also impaired in their ability to stimulate virus budding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), (5) AMOT p80 and AMOT p130 PPXY mutants that cannot bind NEDD4L do not support virus budding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5 fig6">Figures 3–6</xref>) and (6) recombinant AMOT p130 and HIV-1 Gag proteins can bind one another directly, albeit weakly in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and could bind more robustly in cells owing to avidity and membrane topology effects.</p><p>Previous studies indicate that other retroviruses also employ distinct host factors to promote membrane envelopment and fission. The clearest example is the D-type Betaretrovirus Mason-Pfizer Monkey Virus (M-PMV), which forms spherical particles in the cytoplasm and then obtains its outer membrane and exits the cell by crossing the plasma membrane. M-PMV Gag contains two distinct late assembly domains that function non-redundantly: a PPPY motif that binds NEDD4 (and perhaps other NEDD4 family members), and a PSAP motif that binds TSG101/ESCRT-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gottwein et al., 2003</xref>). PPPY and PSAP mutations induce strikingly different phenotypes: mutation of the PPPY motif causes virions to stack up against the plasma membrane where they fail to initiate membrane envelopment whereas virions lacking the PSAP motif acquire an envelope, but accumulate at the lollipop stage or are released as chains of membrane-tethered particles. These observations imply that Gag PPPY-NEDD4 complexes are required for early stages of membrane bending and envelopment, whereas Gag PSAP-ESCRT-I complexes recruit the ESCRT machinery to mediate membrane fission. Like other family members, NEDD4 binds AMOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moleirinho et al., 2014</xref>), and we therefore speculate that M-PMV may also recruit AMOT to facilitate membrane bending and particle envelopment. This would imply that viruses can recruit NEDD4-motin complexes by binding either member of the complex. The deltaretrovirus HTLV-I is another case where a PPXY motif appears to be required for an early step in particle envelopment and a PTAP motif may function at a later membrane fission step ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Blanc et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blot et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heidecker et al., 2004</xref>], but also see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2004</xref>]). Distinct roles for PPXY and PTAP motifs have not been delineated in other well-studied viruses that use both motifs, such as the gammaretrovirus Murine Leukemia Virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yuan et al., 2000</xref>) or the filovirus Ebola Virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Timmins et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Although many details of HIV-1 assembly and budding remain to be elucidated, our data are consistent with a stepwise pathway in which: (1) AMOT p130 is recruited at the half-moon stage of HIV-1 assembly, perhaps by binding cooperatively to Gag and to appropriately curved membranes, (2) AMOT p130 promotes further membrane curvature and recruits NEDD4L via PPXY-WW domain interactions, (3) NEDD4L builds Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains on the viral Gag protein (and/or other nearby substrates), (4) the juxtaposition of Gag late assembly domains and Lys-63-linked Ub chains creates high affinity binding sites for the early-acting ESCRT factors, TSG101 and ALIX, and (5) these factors then recruit the downstream ESCRT-III and VPS4 components required to effect membrane scission. This model is attractive because: (1) our work shows that AMOT functions upstream of the ESCRT pathway, (2) AMOT appears to function as a NEDD4L adaptor (see above), (3) ubiquitin transfer is required for efficient HIV-1 release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martin-Serrano, 2007</xref>), (4) NEDD4L builds Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains and can use HIV-1 Gag as a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weiss et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sette et al., 2013</xref>), and (5) both TSG101/ESCRT-I and ALIX have ubiquitin binding activities. The ALIX activity is specific for Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dowlatshahi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keren-Kaplan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pashkova et al., 2013</xref>), and ESCRT-I complexes also have multiple ubiquitin binding sites, although linkage specificity has not been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stefani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agromayor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCullough et al., 2013</xref>). Cooperative binding to the late domains and ubiquitin could explain how ALIX and TSG101/ESCRT-I can be efficiently recruited, despite making intrinsically weak interactions with the p6<sup>Gag</sup> late assembly domains. The proposed sequence of events could also provide a ‘timing’ mechanism for recruiting (or activating) these early-acting ESCRT proteins to function at a late stage of virion assembly, although the precise timing of early-acting ESCRT recruitment remains to be clarified because published reports differ on this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jouvenet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ku et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>All enveloped viruses must bend and remodel membranes as they bud, and AMOT requirements may therefore be quite general. Indeed, AMOTL1 has been shown to bind the M protein of PIV5 and to be required for the efficient, ubiquitin-dependent release of this virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pei et al., 2010</xref>). Motin family members therefore contribute to the assembly of at least two highly diverged enveloped viruses; the paramyxovirus PIV5 and the lentivirus HIV-1. This suggests that AMOT proteins, like the ESCRT machinery, may provide general activities required for the assembly and release of a variety of different enveloped viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids, siRNA constructs and antibodies</title><p>Expression constructs, siRNA sequences, and antibodies are described in detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

The degree of assembly was assessed by rendering a (hypothetical) spherical particle and measuring the arc angle of the nascent Gag layer. To image 500 virions budding from wild type cells, it was necessary to screen about eight-times as many thin slices of wild type control cells (∼2500 cells) vs TSG101- or AMOT-depleted cells (275 and 300, respesctively).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Chad Nelson and the University of Utah Mass Spectrometry Core facility for mass spectrometry analyses, Chris Rodesch and the University of Utah Cell Imaging Core facility for assistance with fluorescence microscopy, Nancy Chandler in the University of Utah EM Core facility for expert thin sectioning, S Joshua Romney (Invitrogen/Life Technologies) for the loan of a Neon transfection system, and members of our laboratory for critical reading and feedback.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>It was shown in the manuscript that AMOT proteins can simultaneously interact with NEDD4l E3 ligase and HIV-Gag protein and thereby facilitate budding of newly formed HIV virions. The hypothesis is that Nedd4L could be indirectly recruited to Gag via these AMOT proteins. This is an attractive hypothesis because it would explain earlier findings that “crippled” HIV-1 Gag proteins lacking PTAP and YPXL late domains can be induced to function for budding by overexpression of Nedd4L, despite the lack of PPxY motifs in Gag, or any other obvious way to recruit Nedd4L to Gag protein. Functional budding assays demonstrate that AMOT and Nedd4L cooperate to stimulate budding of the crippled HIV-1 Gag, and that AMOT depletion reduces budding of wt HIV-1. Budding could be restored through re-expression of AMOT, AMOTL1, or AMOTL2 from plasmids. An extensive EM analysis of budding HIV-1 particles upon AMOT depletion was performed. AMOT depletion leads to a block in particle formation that is earlier (half-moon stage) than the one caused by Tsg101 depletion (lollipop stage).</p><p>The quality of the data presented here is high and the reviewers were enthusiastic about the overall importance of the presented data. However, the reviewers agreed that the following issues need to be addressed before the manuscript can be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>More information on the physiological significance AMOT-Gag interactions should be provided. For example, AMOT does not exist in many cell types and most of the studies required a Gag missing the late domains. Maybe AMOT only plays a role in Gag budding missing the late domains – but never plays a role in normal physiological assembly. What is the importance of AMOT for virus budding in different cell types, and what is the status of HIV budding in HeLa cells that are naturally deficient for AMOT. Could AMOT be acting on something else which, in turn, facilitates assembly? Does AMOT play a role normally in assembly of HIV-1, or only when they have late domains missing? Is Amot functioning at the sites of assembly? What is the relative timing of AMOT and ESCRTs. What is the evidence that AMOT is a pre-requisite for recruitment of ESCRTs rather than being a parallel process? When AMOT is depleted in the HEK293 cells and the half-moon shapes are formed, is ESCRT recruited to these half-moon shapes?</p><p>The interaction of NEDD4 and AMOT has been already shown previously, where NEDD4 ubiquitination of AMOT leads to its degradation via UPS. Authors as well demonstrate in one figure that overexpression of NEDD4 leads to decrease in total level of AMOT. However, in contradiction to this, they used NEDD4 overexpression in all experiments. One would expect that presence of AMOT negatively affects HIV release, by blocking access of NEDD4 and that overexpression of NEDD4 hence neutralizes overexpression of AMOT, by targeting it for the UPS degradation. How is than degradation of AMOT regulation during the HIV budding? Does presence of Gag neutralizes NEDD4 mediated degradation of AMOT? Could authors test this in their assays, and correlate the levels of AMOT in setting where NEDD4 is not overexpressed, and HIV budding is followed? In such setting both wt and dPTAP Gag should be tested, and compared.</p><p>Does increased concentration of HIVGag in the binding assays can outcompete NEDD4 binding? Further, the domain/motif in AMOT that binds to HIVGag should be identified, and this mutant should be tested in all budding/infection assays.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1) Does HIVGag negatively influences NEDD4 mediated ubiqutination of AMOT? Could authors test this in cells or in vitro. In case is so, does that support the fact that AMOT is stabilized upon HIV infection and only than is not degraded but facilitates ubiquitination of Gag?</p><p>2) AMOT contains BAR domain, however authors do not have an attempt to test the requirement of BAR domain in proposed process, despite the fact that BAR domains are known to be able to remodel/recognize membrane curvature. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows clearly that overexpression of AMOT leads to formation of large aggregate-like structures that are rather artefacts of overexpression than functional co-localization of AMOT with NEDD4. Authors should look closely on localization of endogenous AMOT in cells, and demonstrate its co-localization with HIV-Gag. Picture of Hiv-Gag localization should be provided in both wt and AMOT deficient cells as well.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> should contain pictures of wt and rescued cells as well, and not only TSG101 and AMOT depleted cells.</p><p>4) It is not clear how does presence of AMOT affect the assembly of ESCRT machinery via influencing NEDD4. Considering that AMOT deficient cells are not even able to form the buds one can speculate that AMOT might be important for the actin cytoskeleton regulation and membrane curvature around the bud. Could authors provide TIRF images, showing recruitment of AMOT to HIV buds, and subsequent recruitment of ESCRT components, as they propose in the Ddiscussion. Currently there is no evidence that AMOT acts upstream of ESCRT beside the fact that AMOT binds NEDD4. Does ESCRT get recruited at all in case of AMOT deficient cells? Does AMOT precede recruitment of ESCRT when budding events are followed by TIRF?</p><p>5) If AMOT is required for NEDD4 recruitment and presumably subsequent ubiquitination, could authors also provide western blots showing levels of HIVGag ubiquitination in case of AMOT depletion or overproduction, in setting where only endogenous NEDD4 is present?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, right panel: more representative blot should be provided, since this one is not convincing at all. MA protein is not detected at all in viral particles, and the differences in CA level are almost not visible, going against the whole proposed mechanism that AMOT is able to surpass the lack of PTAP in crippled HIVGag.</p><p>7) Would be beneficial for the reader to have domain/motif comparison of all AMOTs (including AMOTL1 and AMOTL2) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, or somewhere else in the figures. Based on which characteristic are those proteins redundant in terms of HIVGag budding.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1) The binding experiments for the Nedd4L-AMOT interaction are carried out using a variety of constructs to localize binding determinants. Less so for the experiments characterizing the new interaction between Gag and AMOT. Have the authors tested whether AMOT p80 binds to Gag? If so, it would be useful to mention it, for example, on the third paragraph of the subsection “AMOT p130 is required for NEDD4L stimulation of HIV-1 budding”, in the Results section, referring to Figure 5–figure supplement 2: “Hence, Nedd4L stimulation… requires the presence of an AMOT p130 protein that can bind NEDD4L…”. The authors seem to attribute the lack of Nedd4L stimulation solely to lack of binding between p80 and NEDD4L. This is a case where it would be helpful to know if p80 binds to HIV-1 Gag. If not, it would mean that there are multiple defects in p80 that prevent it from functioning for the stimulation of Gag budding.</p><p>2) The sentence in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “AMOT p130 is required for NEDD4L stimulation of HIV-1 budding”, in the Results section, referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: “However, this stimulation was completely abrogated when endogenous AMOT proteins were depleted”. This is a key experiment in the paper. It is clear that full stimulation in these experiments requires both AMOT (endogenously expressed) and Nedd4L (from plasmid), and I believe that is the key point being made here. However, the statement that stimulation was completely abrogated when AMOTs were depleted may be a bit misleading. It implies that in the absence of AMOT, Nedd4L expression has no effect. But it does (compare lanes 2 and 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Please rephrase. This result is, perhaps, to be expected given that AMOTL1 and AMOTL2 are still present in these cells.</p><p>3) The sentence in the third paragraph of the subsection “AMOT p130 is required for NEDD4L stimulation 242 of HIV-1 budding”, in the Results section, referring to Figure 5–figure supplement 1: “the degree of rescue correlated positively with AMOT p130 re-expression levels…”. Certainly this appears to be true when looking at the infectivity assays in Figure 5–figure supplement 1, but such definitive language is not supported as well by the Gag budding experiment shown in the western blot of that figure.</p><p>4) The authors may want to point out that the partial rescue by AMOTL1 and AMOTL2 seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> could be related to differences in expression levels of the 3 AMOT proteins in the cells, which would be consistent with the dose dependence effect observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>It would help in the text to indicate which cells were used when (e.g., for the EM the cell type is not mentioned in the text nor the figure legend. It would help to have more information on the constructs used. The text says that HIV-1 was expressed using R9 wildtype. From looking back at a previous article that is referenced (Chung, 2008), it appears to be a pro-viral plasmid. However, that article does not have the R9 listed in its supplemental table of plasmids and references back to a paper from the year before (Fisher, 2007) that does not have the R9 listed. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figure 4 and 5</xref>, there are panels called “virus”. Would it be better to call these “supernatant”? There are virions in both the cells and the supernatent. Why is there such a dramatic effect on infectivity when the effect on viral protein in the supernatant is not as pronounced?</p><p>It is claimed in the first paragraph of the subsection headed “AMOT binds directly to NEDD4L and to HIV-1 Gag2 in the Results section that NEDD4L binds AMOTp130 with at least 1:1 stoichiometry. How was this conclusion reached from the gel?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03778.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors asked for clarification about the revision requirements prior to resubmission.]</p><p>We have first listed your final set of requirements and our responses to them. In addition, we have also addressed many of the comments made in the original reviews, and we have also described those cases.</p><p><italic>Test the role of AMOT directly in physiologically relevant cells. If experiments with the T-cells are difficult, use macrophages instead</italic>.</p><p>As the reviewers pointed out, our original manuscript did not test the role of AMOT in cells that are physiologically for HIV-1 infection. To address this shortcoming, we have now tested how altering AMOT p130 levels affects the release of infectious HIV-1 particles from Jurkat T cells. These experiments were performed by comparing the effects of overexpressing either wild type AMOT p130 or an inactive AMOT p130 mutant with point mutations in the three NEDD4-binding “PPXY” motifs (AMOT p130<sub>ΔPPXY</sub>). As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, we find that overexpression of wild type AMOT p130 strongly stimulates HIV release and infectivity in a dose-dependent fashion, with maximal stimulations of 16-fold (virion release) and 7-fold (viral infectivity) vs. a transfected vector control. In contrast, overexpression of AMOT p130<sub>ΔPPXY</sub> reproducibly reduced HIV-1 release and infectivity, presumably by dominantly inhibiting the functions of endogenous AMOT p130 proteins. We have confirmed that the levels of HIV-1 protein expression are comparable in all cases (not shown). AMOT expression levels in Jurkat T cells are beneath our detection limits, but we feel confident in concluding that AMOT stimulates HIV-1 release in this setting because the experiment is well controlled by the use of an inactive point mutant AMOT p130 construct, because the effects are dose dependent, and because we repeated the experiment three times with similar results.</p><p>In the process of investigating how best to perform this experiment, we also noticed that one of published the “global” siRNA screens for HIV cofactors was performed in Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yeung et al., 2009</xref>). Gratifyingly, the data from that screen also indicate that AMOT is important for HIV-1 replication in Jurkat T cells because an shRNA that targeted AMOT protected Jurkat cells against the cytotoxicity that occurs upon HIV infection (although the functional role of AMOT was not pursued further). Thus, there are now two independent lines of evidence that AMOT p130 is important for HIV-1 replication in Jurkat T cells (and we have, of course, now referenced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yeung et al, 2009</xref>).</p><p><italic>Explain why Tsg101 knockdown is so much more effective than AMOT in HIV infectivity</italic>.</p><p>This is also a good point. We hypothesized that the strong, but incomplete effects that we were seeing might reflect incomplete silencing of endogenous AMOT p130. We therefore repeated the experiment with a new, freshly repurified batch of siRNA. Importantly, this new AMOT p130 siRNA depleted both AMOT p130 and p80 even more efficiently than our previous batch of siRNA (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel 3, lane 4). As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, this siRNA treatment reduces viral titers by approximately 8-fold, and the inhibition of virion release is approaching the inhibition that we see for our best siRNA against TSG101 (right panels, compare lanes 3 and 4). We therefore conclude that most (or all) of the residual virus release and infectivity that we saw in previous experiments was due to incomplete silencing of AMOT p130 (and/or the residual presence of AMOT L1 and L2). These data indicate that AMOT p130 is (nearly) as important as TSG101 for HIV-1 release. Finally, we note that: 1) In addition to reducing viral budding, TSG101 depletion also reduces HIV-1 infectivity by inhibiting Gag processing and viral maturation, whereas AMOT depletion only appears to inhibit by blocking budding (see the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and the discussion below), and 2) the level of infectivity seen upon depletion of either AMOT p130 or TSG101 is significantly greater than the infectivity reduction seen upon depletion of the third known HIV budding factor, ALIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Please note that we have not gone back and repeated all of our siRNA rescue experiments with the new batch of siRNA because this would have required repeating a very large number of experiments and because the new experiment did not change our original conclusions.</p><p><italic>Test the effect of AMOT expression with HIV-1 R-9 in Hela cells</italic>.</p><p>This experiment, i.e., examining the release of wild type HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> from HeLa cells (expressed from the R9 proviral expression vector), was already shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> of the original paper (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As we have discussed, the misunderstanding arose from an error that we made in mislabeling the HIV-1 construct in the figure caption (for which we apologize) and also from an apparent misunderstanding of the nomenclature that we used within the figure (and elsewhere). Viruses and proteins labeled “HIV-1” and “Gag” without any subscripts refer to the wild type virus and Gag protein, respectively. Viruses and Gag proteins that lack late domains are labeled with the subscripts “ΔPTAP, ΔYP”. We apologize for the confusion, and note that AMOT expression strongly stimulates release of wild type HIV-1 in HeLa cells.</p><p><italic>More information on the physiological significance AMOT-Gag interactions should be provided</italic>. <italic>For example, AMOT does not exist in many cell types.</italic></p><p>Firstly, we note that AMOT is expressed in white blood cells and lymphoid tissues—the normal host cells for HIV-1 infection—and we have provided this information and relevant references in the manuscript. AMOT is not expressed in HeLa cells (but AMOTL2 is), and we show that exogenous expression of AMOT stimulates virus release from HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). AMOT is expressed in Jurkat T cells (and this point is now made explicitly and referenced in the text, but AMOT nevertheless appears to be limiting because exogenous AMOT expression also stimulates HIV release from Jurkat T cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>shows clearly that overexpression of AMOT leads to formation of large aggregate-like structures that are rather artefacts of overexpression than functional co-localization of AMOT with NEDD4</italic>.</p><p>We agree (and had pointed that out ourselves), but the reviewer’s point is well taken and we have therefore removed this figure from the manuscript and simply mentioned the co-localization as “data not shown”. We think there is no doubt that AMOT p130 and NEDD4L bind one another in cells, and do so through interactions between the AMOT p130 PPXY motifs and the NEDD4L WW domains. We have shown this in several ways in our paper, including by co-IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We have also referenced other relevant papers showing that motins bind NEDD4 family members.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref> <italic>should contain pictures of wt and rescued cells as well, and not only TSG101 and AMOT depleted cells</italic>.</p><p>We, and others, have previously published EM images of thin-sectioned cells that show budding of wild type HIV-1 particles. Wild type virions bud efficiently, however, and it is therefore difficult to obtain images from single thin sections that contain numerous examples of budding wild type virions. To help address this limitation, we have turned to scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The advantage of SEM is that we can look at the entire surface of a cell and therefore capture many more budding events in a single image. We have now included such images for virions budding from control cells and from cells depleted of TSG101 and AMOT (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These images make it clear that there is an enormous difference between the efficiency of virus budding from wild type cells vs. cells that lack either TSG101 or AMOT.</p><p><italic>Would be beneficial for the reader to have domain/motif comparison of all AMOTs (including AMOTL1 and AMOTL2) in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>, or somewhere else in the figures.

Less so for the experiments characterizing the new interaction between Gag and AMOT. Have the authors tested whether AMOT p80 binds to Gag? If so, it would be useful to mention it, for example, on the third paragraph of the subection “AMOT p130 is required for NEDD4L stimulation of HIV-1 budding”, in the Results section, referring to Figure 5–figure supplement 2: “Hence, Nedd4L stimulation… requires the presence of an AMOT p130 protein that can bind NEDD4L…”. The authors seem to attribute the lack of Nedd4L stimulation solely to lack of binding between p80 and NEDD4L. This is a case where it would be helpful to know if p80 binds to HIV-1 Gag. If not, it would mean that there are multiple defects in p80 that prevent it from functioning for the stimulation of Gag budding</italic>.</p><p>We have not tested AMOT p80 binding to Gag because the p80 isoform does not express well and we have therefore been unable to make pure recombinant AMOT p80. The reviewer is therefore correct that there may be multiple reasons that the p80 isoform does not support virus release. We believe, however, that we have shown that the lack of NEDD4L binding is sufficient to explain the lack of function of AMOT p80. The paragraph that the reviewer refers to also describes an experiment in which we show that an AMOT p130 protein with substitution mutations in the three PPXY motifs also fails to support HIV budding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, AMOT p130<sub>ΔPPXY</sub>, right panels, compare lanes 6 and 5) and we therefore feel justified in concluding that NEDD4L stimulation requires the presence of an AMOT p130 protein that can bind NEDD4L.</p><p><italic>The sentence in the fourth paragraph of the subection “AMOT p130 is required for NEDD4L stimulation of HIV-1 budding”, in the Results section, referring to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>: “However, this stimulation was completely abrogated when endogenous AMOT proteins were depleted”. This is a key experiment in the paper. It is clear that full stimulation in these experiments requires both AMOT (endogenously expressed) and Nedd4L (from plasmid), and I believe that is the key point being made here. However, the statement that stimulation was completely abrogated when AMOTs were depleted may be a bit misleading. It implies that in the absence of AMOT, Nedd4L expression has no effect. But it does (compare lanes 2 and 4 of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>). Please rephrase. This result is, perhaps, to be expected given that AMOTL1 and AMOTL2 are still present in these cells</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer makes a good point.

The text says that HIV-1 was expressed using R9 wildtype. From looking back at a previous article that is referenced (Chung, 2008), it appears to be a pro-viral plasmid. However, that article does not have the R9 listed in its supplemental table of plasmids and references back to a paper from the year before (Fisher, 2007) that does not have the R9 listed</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that R9 is a wild type proviral HIV-1 construct. In the previous version of the manuscript, there were two references for the relevant sentence of the experimental methods. One (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Swingler et al., 1997</xref>) referred to the first report of the R9 proviral plasmid, and the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2008</xref>) referred to our previous report of the NEDD4L plasmids used in this study. We have now separated the two references within the sentence to remove any confusion.</p><p><italic>For</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5"><italic>Figure 4 and 5</italic></xref><italic>, there are panels called “virus”. Would it be better to call these “supernatant”? There are virions in both the cells and the supernatent</italic>.</p><p>We understand the point, but prefer to use the term “virus” to remain consistent with other papers in the field.</p><p><italic>Why is there such a dramatic effect on infectivity when the effect on viral protein in the supernatant is not as pronounced?</italic></p><p>This is a good question. We (and others) generally observe a correlation between virion release and infectivity measurements, but the correlation is not perfect. This is why we believe it is important to measure both release and infectivity. One cause of these discrepancies is that budding defects can also induce defects in viral maturation and in virion contents. This is well characterized in the case of TSG101 depletion, where defective Gag processing and viral maturation contribute to loss of infectivity, even when virions are released. This effect is evident in the control experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. Another effect that we have documented for TSG101 is that the released virions have reduced levels of reverse transcriptase. We believe that this is because even when virus budding does occur it is slow, and the processed RT proteins “float away” during the prolonged budding step. We envision that a similar effect probably occurs when AMOT depletion slows virus release, though we have not tested this directly. The important point is that aberrant kinetics of virion release appears to reduce infectivity, whereas any virions that eventually escape the cell will contribute to the signal in the release assay. Thus, treatments that disrupt (or restore) wild type virus budding kinetics can have differential effects on virion release and infectivity.</p><p><italic>It is claimed in the first paragraph of the subsection headed “AMOT binds directly to NEDD4L and to HIV-1 Gag2, in the Results section, that NEDD4L binds AMOTp130 with at least 1:1 stoichiometry.
