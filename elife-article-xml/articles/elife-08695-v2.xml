In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> the signaling protein Exchange Factor for ARF-6 (EFA-6) is a potent intrinsic inhibitor of axon regrowth. Here we show that axon injury triggers rapid EFA-6-dependent inhibition of axonal microtubule (MT) dynamics, concomitant with relocalization of EFA-6. EFA-6 relocalization and axon regrowth inhibition require a conserved 18-aa motif in its otherwise intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain. The EFA-6 N-terminus binds the MT-associated proteins TAC-1/Transforming-Acidic-Coiled-Coil, and ZYG-8/Doublecortin-Like-Kinase, both of which are required for regenerative growth cone formation, and which act downstream of EFA-6. After injury TAC-1 and EFA-6 transiently relocalize to sites marked by the MT minus end binding protein PTRN-1/Patronin. We propose that EFA-6 acts as a bifunctional injury-responsive regulator of axonal MT dynamics, acting at the cell cortex in the steady state and at MT minus ends after injury.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08695.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08695.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08695.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the nervous system, cells called neurons carry information around the body. These cells have long thin projections called axons that allow the information to pass very quickly along the cell to junctions with other neurons. Neurons in adult mammals are limited in their ability to regenerate, so any damage to axons, for example, due to a stroke or a brain injury, tends to be permanent. Therefore, an important goal in neuroscience research is to discover the genes and proteins that are involved in regenerating axons as this may make it possible to develop new therapies.</p><p>An internal scaffold called the cytoskeleton supports the three-dimensional shape of the axons. Changes in the cytoskeleton are required to allow neurons to regenerate axons after injury, and drugs that stabilize filaments called microtubules in the cytoskeleton can promote these changes. Chen et al. used a technique called laser microsurgery to sever individual axons in a roundworm known as <italic>C. elegans</italic> and then observed whether these axons could regenerate. The experiments reveal that a protein called EFA-6 blocks the regeneration of neurons by preventing rearrangements in the cytoskeleton.</p><p>EFA-6 is normally found at the membrane that surrounds the neuron. However, Chen et al. show that when the axon is damaged, this protein rapidly moves to areas near the ends of microtubule filaments. EFA-6 interacts with two other proteins that are associated with microtubules and are required for axons to be able to regenerate. Chen et al.'s findings demonstrate that several proteins that regulate microtubule filaments play a key role in regenerating axons. All three of these proteins are found in humans and other animals so they have the potential to be targeted by drug therapies in future. The next challenge is to understand the details of how EFA-6 activity is affected by axon injury, and how this alters the cytoskeleton.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08695.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08695.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>axon regeneration</kwd><kwd>Patronin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R56 NS057317, R01 NS057317</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Yishi</given-names></name><name><surname>Chisholm</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Lizhen</given-names></name><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Yishi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NWO/ALW Vidi</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>864.09.008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koorman</surname><given-names>Thijs</given-names></name><name><surname>Boxem</surname><given-names>Mike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS093588</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Yishi</given-names></name><name><surname>Chisholm</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Neuroplasticity of Aging Training Grant NIH T32 AG000216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Lizhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UCSD Cellular and Molecular Genetics Training Grant NIH T32 GM007240</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chuang</surname><given-names>Marian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Both the nature of the extracellular environment and the intrinsic growth competence of the neuron contribute to the extent of axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Case and Tessier-Lavigne, 2005</xref>). The mammalian central nervous system (CNS) expresses a variety of environmental regeneration inhibitory factors, including myelin-associated proteins, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and glial scar tissue that functions as a physical barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schwab, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Silver and Miller, 2004</xref>). However genetic removal of these inhibitory factors results in only limited improvement in regeneration of severed axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2010</xref>). Recent studies have strongly supported the importance of cell-intrinsic determinants in axon regeneration. Loss of function in cell-intrinsic growth inhibitors such as Phosphatase and Tensin homolog, PTEN, and Suppressor Of Cytokine Signaling-3, SOCS3, can dramatically improve axon regrowth even in the inhibitory CNS environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). Genetic and pharmacological manipulation of cell autonomous signaling pathways can dramatically improve regrowth of severed axons in various injury paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hellal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sengottuvel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ruschel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>During developmental axon outgrowth and in regenerative regrowth of mature neurons, the formation and extension of growth cones involve extensive remodeling of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bradke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chisholm, 2013</xref>). Cellular compartments undergoing rapid morphological changes, such as axonal growth cones, are enriched in dynamic MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suter et al., 2004</xref>), while mature axons or dendrites contain predominantly stabilized MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baas et al., 1993</xref>). When an axon is injured, MTs are locally disassembled or severed, potentially creating free plus ends for new MT polymerization. Subsequently, the number of growing MTs increases, followed by more persistent MT growth correlated with formation of regenerative growth cone and axon extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erez and Spira, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghosh-Roy et al., 2012</xref>). Complete removal of an axon also leads to dramatic upregulation of MT dynamics in the soma and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stone et al., 2010</xref>). MT disorganization contributes to dystrophic end bulb formation after injury in CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">ErtÃ¼rk et al., 2007</xref>). Moderate stabilization of MT dynamics by Taxol or other MT stabilizers can promote axon regrowth in vitro and in the mammalian CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Usher et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hellal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sengottuvel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ruschel et al., 2015</xref>); the effects of Taxol in vivo have been partly replicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Popovich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ruschel et al., 2015</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Thus, there is a critical need to define the endogenous regulators of MTs after injury.</p><p>In a large-scale screen for genes affecting adult axon regeneration in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, we identified <underline>E</underline>xchange <underline>F</underline>actor for <underline>A</underline>RF-6 (EFA-6) as an intrinsic inhibitor of axon regrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). The EFA-6/EFA6 protein family is conserved from yeast to mammals, and is defined by its Sec7 domain, which confers guanine exchange factor (GEF) activity for Arf6 GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Franco et al., 1999</xref>). Unexpectedly, the regrowth-inhibitory function of EFA-6 is independent of its GEF activity, and instead is mediated by its N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). The EFA-6 N-terminal domain inhibits MT growth at the cell cortex of <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos via a conserved motif of 18 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Rourke et al., 2010</xref>). Nonetheless, the mechanism by which EFA-6 regulates MT dynamics is unknown.</p><p>Here we reveal that axon injury triggers rapid and transient relocalization of EFA-6, concomitant with an initial downregulation of axonal MT dynamics. The N-terminal 18-aa motif is required for injury-induced relocalization and for inhibition of axonal MT growth. We show that the EFA-6 N-terminal domain interacts with MT associated proteins TAC-1, a member of the transforming acidic coiled-coil (TACC) family, and ZYG-8, an ortholog of doublecortin-like kinase (DCLK). TAC-1 and ZYG-8 are required for initiation of axon regeneration, and their overexpression can promote regrowth. We further show that injury triggers relocalization of EFA-6 and TAC-1 to sites overlapping with the MT minus end binding protein Patronin/PTRN-1. We propose that EFA-6 is a bifunctional injury-responsive regulator of MT dynamics, acting at the cell cortex in the steady state and at MT minus ends after axon injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Axon injury triggers redistribution of EFA-6</title><p>In the one-cell stage embryo EFA-6 localizes to the plasma membrane via its C-terminal PH (pleckstrin homology) domain, and this plasma membrane localization of EFA-6 is necessary for it to inhibit cortical MT growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Rourke et al., 2010</xref>). To determine the subcellular location of EFA-6 in neurons, we expressed a series of GFP-tagged EFA-6 fusion proteins. Full-length EFA-6 tagged with GFP at the N- or C-termini, expressed at a range of concentrations, localized to the plasma membrane of the soma and processes of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>); deletion of the PH domain (FLÎPH) resulted in cytosolic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, upper panel).

Within seconds of laser axotomy of the PLM axon, GFP::EFA-6FL redistributed from a generally even plasma membrane localization to more discrete puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). This relocalization was also observed when GFP was tagged to the C terminus or in the middle of EFA-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), and did not require the PH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Full-length EFA-6 and the N terminal domain (N150) appear to relocalize to the same puncta in response to injury, as shown by co-expressing EFA-6FL::GFP and EFA-6N150::mKate2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). mKate2::EFA-6N150Î18 (which does not relocalize, see below) did not co-localize with EFA-6FL::GFP after injury, suggesting EFA-6 puncta are not due to non-specific aggregation of proteins after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>).

We therefore tested if the capacity of EFA-6 protein fragments to relocalize correlated with their effects on PLM development and regrowth. We found that overexpression of the EFA-6 N terminal fragments that displayed injury-induced relocalization (N150, N100, N70) all caused axons of PLM neurons to undershoot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

In contrast, overexpression of smaller fragments (N24, N42 or N[43â70 aa]) of the EFA-6 N-terminus that did not relocalize in response to axotomy did not significantly inhibit PLM outgrowth or regrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of EFA-6FLÎN150, but not of EFA-6FL, caused PLM overshooting, suggesting the C-terminal region of EFA-6 may inhibit the activity of the N-terminus. Overexpression of EFA-6FL strongly inhibits axonal MT dynamics, as assessed using the EBP-GFP assay for growing MT plus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Using live imaging and quantitative kymograph analysis of EBP-2::GFP comets, we found that only those EFA-6 fragments displaying injury-induced relocalization also inhibited steady-state axonal MT dynamics when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).

Moreover, mutating 2 or more residues within the 18 aa motif to alanines significantly reduced the activity of the N-terminus in multiple assays (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting the sequence of the 18 aa motif is critical for the N-terminus to function. The 18 aa motif was essential for injury-triggered relocalization of EFA-6FL and EFA-6N150 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>), as well as for their inhibitory effects in axon regrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Likewise, ZYG-8 and EFA-6N150 could be co-immunoprecipitated when coexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These studies suggest that TAC-1 and ZYG-8 specifically interact with the EFA-6 N-terminus. We further tested binding of EFA-6 to TAC-1 and ZYG-8 in cells co-transfected with EFA-6N150, TAC-1 and ZYG-8ÎKD. After immunoprecipitation of EFA-6N150 we could detect both TAC-1 and ZYG-8, and the interactions between EFA-6 and TAC-1 (or ZYG-8) were not affected by the presence of ZYG-8 (or TAC-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This result suggests that EFA-6, TAC-1, and ZYG-8 might exist in the same ternary complex.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08695.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>EFA-6 interacts with the MT-associated proteins (MAPs) TAC-1 and ZYG-8.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Summary of two-hybrid analyses.

Here we dissected how EFA-6 regulates MT dynamics in the axonal response to injury, yielding the following insights: (1) injury triggers a rapid relocalization of EFA-6 from the cell membrane to subcellular structures overlapping with the MT minus end binding protein PTRN-1/Patronin; (2) injury also triggers a rapid local downregulation of axonal MT dynamics, a process that requires EFA-6 and which occurs simultaneously with EFA-6 relocalization; (3) a conserved motif in the otherwise unstructured EFA-6 N-terminus is essential for its relocalization and for its effects on axonal MT dynamics; (4) the EFA-6 N-terminus directly interacts with two highly conserved MAPs, TAC-1/TACC and ZYG-8/DCLK, both of which are required for normal regrowth and for the later phase of upregulated axonal MT dynamics. Our studies reveal that axonal injury triggers an intricate sequence of alterations in axonal MT dynamics. Precise control of the axonal MT response by positive and negative regulators of MT dynamics appears critical for the conversion of the mature axon into a regrowing growth cone.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>EFA-6 functions in the steady state and injured axon</title><p>EFA-6 induces catastrophe or pausing of growth at MT plus ends at the cortex of embryonic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Rourke et al., 2010</xref>), and our analysis is consistent with this model in steady-state (uninjured) axons. In mature neurons EFA-6 localizes to the cell membrane via its PH domain. <italic>efa-6((0))</italic> mutant axons display elevated numbers of growing MTs in the steady state, and display impenetrant developmental overgrowth, indicating that in the absence of injury EFA-6 restrains axonal MT dynamics and mildly inhibits axon outgrowth. These steady-state roles of EFA-6 are mediated by the N-terminus, as they are fully rescued by expression of the N-terminal 150 aa. Overexpression of either full length EFA-6 or the N-terminus causes axons to undershoot, whereas overexpression of EFA-6ÎN causes axons to overshoot. The opposing effects of overexpression of the N-terminus and the C-terminus suggest that in the steady state the EFA-6 N-terminus might be inhibited by the remainder of the protein.</p><p>After axon injury, EFA-6 displays a dramatic and specific transient relocalization to punctate structures associated with MT minus ends. Interestingly, this relocalization does not require membrane association, as EFA-6 fragments lacking the PH domain, or containing only the N-terminal 1â70 aa, were not membrane-localized, yet became relocalized to axonal puncta after injury. As relocalized full-length EFA-6 appears to remain membrane associated, it is possible that after injury EFA-6 localizes to the cytoskeleton via its N terminus while remaining membrane associated via its PH domain. Speculatively, injury signals may increase EFA-6 N-terminus activity by releasing it from inhibition by the EFA-6 C-terminus.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The EFA-6 N-terminus is an intrinsically disordered region</title><p>The N-termini of EFA6 family members display low sequence complexity and minimal primary sequence similarity, with the exception of the 18 aa motif found in invertebrate family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Rourke et al., 2010</xref>). The N-termini of <italic>C. elegans, Drosophila</italic> and mammalian EFA6 proteins all have a high probability of intrinsic disorder. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and disordered protein regions are increasingly recognized as having important biological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oldfield and Dunker, 2014</xref>). Well-studied examples of IDPs in the nervous system include the MT-binding proteins Tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schweers et al., 1994</xref>) and stathmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Honnappa et al., 2006</xref>). Intrinsic disorder does not imply a lack of structure, but rather allows these regions to function as binding surfaces with multiple interacting partners; IDPs are often hubs in proteinâprotein interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cumberworth et al., 2013</xref>). In the EFA-6 N-terminus the 18 aa motif is predicted to have relative structural order, and might act as a molecular recognition feature as in other IDPs. The 18 aa motif is critical for EFA-6 relocalization and for the EFA-6 N-terminus to interact with ZYG-8 and TAC-1. Moreover, as mutation of two or more residues within the 18 aa motif impairs its activity, both the exact sequence of the 18 aa motif and the surrounding extended intrinsically disordered domain appear to be critical for the ability of the EFA-6 N-terminus to regulate MT dynamics. In some assays, the requirement for the 18 aa motif in EFA-6 function was not all-or-none, suggesting it may facilitate the function of the surrounding interacting domain. Moreover, neither ZYG-8 nor TAC-1 may directly bind the 18 aa motif; the motif may be important for correct folding of the larger N-terminal interacting domain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The EFA-6 N-terminus binds MAPs ZYG-8/DCLK and TAC-1/TACC</title><p>Our analysis suggests the EFA-6 N-terminus regulates MT dynamics indirectly via the MAPs ZYG-8 and TAC-1. Identification of TAC-1 and ZYG-8 as EFA-6 interactors was unexpected, as in embryonic cells TAC-1 is predominantly centrosomal or cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Le Bot et al., 2003</xref>), and ZYG-8 localizes along MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellanger et al., 2007</xref>), whereas EFA-6 is cortically localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Rourke et al., 2010</xref>). TAC-1 and ZYG-8 interact physically, but localize independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellanger et al., 2007</xref>). However EFA-6, TAC-1, and ZYG-8 are all present in axons, suggesting these proteins may interact directly in differentiated cells. TAC-1 and EFA-6 partly colocalize after injury, consistent with their interaction being regulated by injury. Although ZYG-8 localization appeared unaffected by injury, it is predicted to associate along the length of MTs, and so could also interact with EFA-6 after injury. Notably, loss of function of TAC-1 or ZYG-8 did not detectably affect developmental axon outgrowth, but strongly blocked axon regeneration, indicating regenerative regrowth is highly dependent on these MAPs.</p><p>Neither TACCs nor ZYG-8/DCLK exclusively associate with MT plus ends. TACC proteins can act both at plus and minus ends of centrosomal MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peset and Vernos, 2008</xref>). Localization of human TACC3 to minus ends is regulated by Aurora A dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barros et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LeRoy et al., 2007</xref>). Conversely, Doublecortin (DCX) decorates the length of the MT lattice and stabilizes it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moores et al., 2006</xref>). DCX can also track MT plus ends, and acts as a nucleation factor, stabilizing polymerization intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moores et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bechstedt and Brouhard, 2012</xref>). Like DCX, DCLK is thought to be able to interact with MTs along their length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgess and Reiner, 2000</xref>). Our results suggest that after axon injury, TAC-1, EFA-6, and possibly ZYG-8 may interact with one another at specific subregions of MTs at or adjacent to minus ends. As EFA-6 has opposite effects to TAC-1 and ZYG-8, EFA-6 may transiently inhibit the activity of TAC-1 or ZYG-8, resulting in the rapid disruption of axonal MT growth. Following this initial phase, EFA-6 returns to its steady state, relieving the inhibition of TAC-1 and ZYG-8, which are then required for the later upregulation of axonal MT dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>EFA-6 and TAC-1 relocalize to sites of MT minus ends</title><p>CAMSAPs/Patronins directly bind MT minus ends and protect them from depolymerization by Kinesin-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tournebize et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goodwin and Vale, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hendershott and Vale, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). The minus end protection activity of CAMSAP family proteins is important for their function in maintaining noncentrosomal MTs.

Strikingly, EFA-6 and TAC-1 relocalize close to or at these sites after injury, suggesting MT minus ends may be an important site of regulation. As PTRN-1 itself is not required for EFA-6 or TAC-1 relocalization, other proteins may be involved in their targeting. Indeed, the near-normal development and behavior of <italic>ptrn-1</italic> null mutants suggests additional factors can stabilize MT minus ends in noncentrosomal arrays. Like TAC-1 and ZYG-8, PTRN-1 is required for axon regrowth. EFA-6 or its interactors might modulate the function of PTRN-1 in axon regrowth.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>EFA-6 and injury-triggered MT dynamics</title><p>MT dynamic instability, first studied as a function of tubulin concentration in vitro, is influenced by a wide array of positive and negative regulators in vivo.

We did not detect significant down-regulation of MT growth in response to injury in the absence of EFA-6, using two independent alleles. Although a small decrease in MT dynamics was observed in <italic>efa-6</italic> mutants, this was not statistically significant, and calculations of statistical power suggest that changes of &gt;15% should be detectable in experiments of the sample size used here. Nevertheless there may be EFA-6-dependent and EFA-6-independent effects on MT dynamics immediately after injury.

Recent in vivo imaging of mammalian axons found an acute increase in axonal MT dynamics after laser axotomy, followed by a sustained increase over several days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kleele et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the exact sequence of MT dynamics changes after injury may vary between cell types and organisms. An important future goal will be to address the role of EFA6 family members in mammalian axon regeneration, and whether manipulation of this MT regulatory pathway can enhance regeneration in therapeutic settings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> genetics</title><p>We maintained <italic>C. elegans</italic> following standard methods.

For puncta number (or peak #) analysis, we counted any peak with intensity greater than the mean +1 SD as a punctum.

The ROI was then duplicated to cover a small region in the axon with no GFP::PTRN-1 puncta, and average intensity of mKate2 (EFA-6N150) within this ROI was measured as F(out). F(in)/F(out) was then calculated as [F(in) â background intensity]/[F(out) â background intensity]. Before injury, EFA-6N::mKate2 is evenly distributed in the axon, and mKate2 intensity inside and outside of the GFP::PTRN-1 puncta is similar in level, so the F(in)/F(out) ratio is close to 1. 2 min post injury, EFA-6N is relocalized to PTRN-1 puncta, so mKate2 intensity within the PTRN-1 puncta is much higher than outside the puncta, resulting in a significantly higher F(in)/F(out) ratio.</p><p>For FRAP we set circular regions of interest (ROIs) for acquisition and photobleaching, using 2% laser power for acquisition and 100% laser power (488 nm, Zeiss LSM710) for photobleaching.

From 15 F<sub>1</sub> progeny we found one animal heterozygous for <italic>efa-6(ju1200)</italic>, which deletes 500 bp of exon 1, intron 1, and exon 2, and has a 26 bp insertion. mRNAs produced in <italic>efa-6(ju1200)</italic> encode polypeptides with a premature stop codon after amino acid 15, eliminating the 18 aa motif and the rest of EFA-6.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Locomotion analysis</title><p>We measured locomotion velocity using WormTracker 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7a">Brown et al., 2013</xref>) NGM plates were seeded with OP50 bacteria 3 hr before experiments. Individual young adult worms were picked gently from the culture plate to a fresh tracking plate. 1 min later, the plate was placed on the worm tracker platform and locomotion recorded for 1 min at 10 frames per second for each animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We used Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) for all statistical analysis. A two-tailed Student's <italic>t-</italic>test was used for comparisons of two groups. For multiple comparisons we used one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post test. To compare variables such as growth cone percentage we used the Fisher exact test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Jin and Chisholm labs for discussion and advice.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor) and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>An important and compelling topic in the field of neuroscience and regenerative medicine is the molecular and cellular mechanisms that inhibit axons from regrowth following traumatic injury. This is a massive and detailed manuscript that makes a significant contribution to our understanding of neuronal cell biology following axon injury. Chen et al. examine this topic in the model <italic>C. elegans</italic> using a combination of genetics, cell biology, and biochemistry. In a previous publication, the authors, through a genetic screen, identified a role for the Arf GEF EFA-6 in inhibiting the regrowth of <italic>C. elegans</italic> axons following injury by laser axotomy. EFA-6 had previously been shown by the Bowerman lab to inhibit microtubule growth at the cortex of <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos through a novel domain in the N-terminus of the protein; however, neither the paper from the Bowerman lab nor from the previous authors had addressed the underlying molecular mechanism. This current manuscript proposes such a molecular mechanism.</p><p>The authors present several lines of evidence that axonal injury triggers the rapid subcellular localization of EFA-6 to microtubule (MT) minus ends. They show that EFA-6 inhibits the number of growing MT plus ends along axons under basal conditions, and that injury can further depress the number of growing MT plus ends via a process that requires, in part, EFA-6. They show that the N-terminal motif described initially in the Bowerman paper binds directly to two conserved MT-associated proteins: TAC-1 (TACC) and ZYG-8 (DCLK). They find that TAC-1 and ZYG-8 are both required for axon regrowth following injury, as well as for the overgrowth phenotype observed when <italic>efa-6</italic> is knocked out. In addition, they show that ZYG-8 is required for EFA-6 to regulate the number of growing MT plus ends. They also show that injury promotes the colocalization of TAC-1 with EFA-6 to MT minus ends in response to injury, although it appears that the two proteins do not regulate each other's subcellular localization. The authors do not show that the subcellular localization of either EFA-6 or TAC-1 to MT minus ends is required for axon regrowth; however, they do show that the Patronin homolog PTRN-1, which normally stabilizes MT minus ends, is required for regrowth, so a role for EFA-6 and/or TAC-1 at the MT minus ends certainly remains a possibility. Taken together, the authors' data suggest that injury triggers acute MT plus end catastrophe through the inhibition of ZYG-8 by EFA-6, followed by a slower MT plus end rescue and regeneration that is dependent on both ZYG-8 and TAC-1, and that these MT dynamics are required for proper axonal regrowth.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written and interesting, and it clearly moves beyond the previous publications on EFA-6 to get at molecular and cell biological mechanism. A published version of this manuscript would be of high interest to those in the fields on axon regeneration and MT dynamics in neurons. That said, the manuscript does require a few alterations before publication. We outline substantive comments below.</p><p>1) A key negative result is the lack of significant change in EBP tracks after axon injury in <italic>efa-6</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Given the importance of this negative result to the model, the power of the experiment should be discussed. Ideally it would be nice to see some independent confirmation, perhaps with another allele.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>, part A has a cartoon illustrating quantification of co-localization. However, there is no formal description defining what exactly is being measured by F<sup>in</sup> and F<sup>out</sup>, or how the F<sup>in</sup>/<sup>out</sup> ratio is calculated. The Results section refers to the Methods, but the Methods section does not really describe the details. The authors should specify the details of how this ratio is calculated.</p><p>3) The authors perform a really nice touch neuron-specific knockout experiment for TAC-1 using a single-copy, MOSCI-based, floxed, wild-type TAC-1 transgene (called <italic>juSi162</italic>) and a transgene that expresses Cre recombinase solely in the touch neurons. They have a PCR strategy for verifying that the recombination occurs as described (found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). However, the specifics of the PCR assay and the primers are not described in the paper. It's unclear if the worms from panel E also contain the <italic>tac-1(ok3305)</italic> deletion mutation. Presumably they do, and that the middle black primer falls within the deletion such that no PCR products are from the endogenous gene? The authors should state this and describe the experiment in more detail.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is difficult for the reader to navigate back and forth from the main figure and the supplement. More importantly, there are interesting and important results in the supplement that really should be in the main Figure (i.e., that injury does not alter ZYG-8 subcellular localization, and that TAC-1 and EFA-6 subcellular localization are not dependent on one another). The authors should move the panels A, B, and E from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref> into the main body of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.

Presumably this experiment was done with the <italic>ts</italic> allele? What happens in the deletion allele examined with the Cre recombinase approach? This later genotype is more likely to be a null. This experiment could address whether or not TAC-1 is required for the EFA-6-mediated changes in MT dynamics (similar to what is observed for ZYG-8). Also, for the graph in panel B, why don't the authors show the data for the <italic>efa-6(lf)</italic>; <italic>zyg-8(lf)</italic> and <italic>efa-6(lf)</italic>; <italic>tac-1(lf)</italic> double mutants?</p><p>6) The authors identified ZYG-8 and TAC-1 as EFA-6 binding partners through a yeast two-hybrid screen. They then confirmed the interaction using GST-pull downs of proteins expressed in HEK293 cells. If this were a study being conducted in mammalian brain, one might suggest that they verify whether such protein complexes can be isolated between endogenous proteins from intact brain. However, that would be an unreasonable request given that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system comprises such a small percentage of the total biomass of the animal and there is no way to dissect out large quantities of worm neurons for such biochemical studies. Such an experimental requirement should not be requested of these authors, and the significance of their in vivo genetic findings far outweigh the absence of data supporting proteinâprotein interactions of the endogenous proteins.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08695.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Overall, the manuscript is well written and interesting, and it clearly moves beyond the previous publications on EFA-6 to get at molecular and cell biological mechanism.
