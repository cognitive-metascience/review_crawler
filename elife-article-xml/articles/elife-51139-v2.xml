In response to elevated temperatures, HSF-1 binds well-conserved motifs, termed heat shock elements (HSEs), and drives the transcription of genes important for mitigating the proteotoxic effects of heat stress. For example, HSF-1 promotes the expression of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) that act as chaperones to prevent HS-induced misfolding and aggregation of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vihervaara et al., 2018</xref>). More recently, HSF-1 has been identified as having non-canonical roles in transcriptional programs distinct from the HSR, such as during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2016</xref>) and carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mendillo et al., 2012</xref>), underscoring the importance of this ancient transcription factor.</p><p>Due to the central role HSF-1 has in launching the HSR, much work has been done to determine direct HSF-1 targets by identifying associated genes under different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonsalves et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guertin and Lis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mahat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mendillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Solís et al., 2016</xref>). However, most of these studies have focused on HSF-1 binding sites that do not overlap with repetitive sequences such as transposons, potentially leaving a large gap in our understanding of the types of genes that are part of the HSR. Indeed, in previous work, we serendipitously discovered that HSF-1 promotes the expression of a full-length autonomous transposable element (TE) known as a Helitron during heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schreiner et al., 2019</xref>). Helitrons are a type of DNA transposon that are unique due to their replication and subsequent transposition occurring via a rolling-circle ‘copy-and-paste’ mechanism, which includes replication in place that results in a circular double-stranded DNA intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grabundzija et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kapitonov and Jurka, 2007</xref>). While Helitrons were initially discovered in plants and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kapitonov and Jurka, 2001</xref>), they have since been identified in a diverse range of species, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kojima, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thomas and Pritham, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Transposable elements (TEs) are well-known agents of evolution that have the ability to rearrange genomes by moving DNA sequences from one region to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feschotte and Pritham, 2007</xref>). By providing regulatory sequences to regions within or near genes, these rearrangements can affect gene expression in <italic>cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bourque et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuong et al., 2017</xref>). As a result, new genes can rapidly be incorporated into existing regulatory networks in a single event, bypassing a potentially lengthy process requiring multiple events to occur in both <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sundaram and Wang, 2018</xref>). In the human genome, TEs have been proposed to supply a substantial number of functional transcription factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jiang and Upton, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jordan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sundaram et al., 2014</xref>), underscoring their potential for shaping transcriptional programs. In a particularly striking example, endogenous retrovirus (ERV) TEs were found to harbor binding sites for core transcription factors in the mammalian interferon response and, in some cases, provide interferon-inducible enhancers for nearby genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chuong et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, systematic analyses of a set of primate-specific TEs revealed widespread enhancer roles in human embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuentes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pontis et al., 2019</xref>); a similar functional study of mouse TEs identified a small fraction that seem to act as enhancers in early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Todd et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>As TEs have a propensity to mobilize upon cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuong et al., 2017</xref>), this plasticity provides a potential means to increase genomic diversity and facilitate adaptation to harsh environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McClintock, 1984</xref>). For example, in fission yeast, various stress conditions increase the mobilization of the Ty3/gypsy family retrotransposon <italic>Tf1</italic>, and new insertions affect the expression of adjacent genes that promote stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Esnault et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the <italic>copia</italic>-type retrotransposon <italic>ONSEN</italic> becomes transcriptionally active during thermal stress and bestows heat-shock-responsiveness to genes near new insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavrak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, TEs play diverse and widespread roles in shaping stress responses at the transcriptional level.</p><p>Our finding that a Helitron TE includes HSEs bound by HSF-1 during heat shock (HS) prompted us to map previously published HSF-1 binding data to repetitive regions in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome. In doing so, we aimed to determine the extent of HSEs associated with Helitron elements and to obtain a more complete picture of HSF-1-mediated gene induction during heat shock in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We found that over half of the HSEs in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome reside within Helitrons. Consistent with the Helitron-embedded HSEs being functional, many acquire HSF-1 and display increased RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy after HS and are located near up-regulated genes. Unlike evolutionarily conserved and canonical HSR target genes (controlled by <underline>H</underline>elitron-<underline>in</underline>dependent HSEs or Hin-HSEs), we found that <underline>H</underline>elitron-<underline>ac</underline>quired HSEs (Hac-HSEs) control expression of specific G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and collagen genes, revealing numerous previously unidentified HSF-1 targets in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Moreover, we detected Hac-HSEs in all <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genomes analyzed. Interestingly, we found that different genes appear to be recruited into the HSR by species-specific Helitron insertions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> versus <italic>C. briggsae</italic>. Furthermore, we found variability in Helitron position and, therefore, HS inducibility of individual genes, even among wild isolates of <italic>C. elegans.</italic> These findings suggest that recent mobility of Helitrons has altered the HSF-1-driven transcriptional response within the <italic>C. elegans</italic> population. Our studies reveal that Helitrons have incorporated new genes into the HSR in numerous <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species and provide a striking example of the ability of transposable elements to act as agents of evolution by rewiring transcriptional responses and increasing variation within and among populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HSF-1 binds HSEs located within Helitrons</title><p>Our previous work showed that full-length copies of the DNA transposon <italic>Helitron1_CE</italic> contain HSF-1 binding motifs (termed heat shock elements, or HSEs) and are bound by HSF-1 during heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schreiner et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, mRNA encoding the <italic>Helitron1_CE</italic>-embedded Rep-Helicase transposase was shown to be up-regulated during heat shock in an HSF-1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schreiner et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that some HSEs within Helitrons are functional and serve to promote expression of mRNAs. We therefore asked whether other types of Helitrons in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome associate with HSF-1 and contain HSEs. There are relatively few full-length copies of Helitrons in the genome and even fewer autonomous versions that are predicted to encode for a transposase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hubley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kapitonov and Jurka, 2001</xref>). Instead, the majority of the regions identified as Helitrons in the genome are non-autonomous and fragments of full-length versions, representing insertion events that have subsequently decayed throughout evolution. To determine if other types of Helitrons (both full-length and partial copies) associate with HSF-1 under non-heat shock (NHS) and heat shock (HS) conditions, publicly available HSF-1 ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2016</xref>) were mapped to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome allowing for mapping to, but preventing pileup at, repetitive regions (see Materials and methods for details). After calling peaks and determining their summits, these regions were compared to annotated Helitrons in a genome-wide manner (UCSC Genome Browser RepeatMasker track, assembly ce11) to identify HSF-1-bound Helitrons. Similar to our observation with <italic>Helitron1_CE</italic>, four other types of Helitrons display HSF-1 binding in NHS conditions and increased binding during HS conditions: <italic>HelitronY4_CE</italic>, <italic>HelitronY1_CE</italic>, <italic>HelitronY1A_CE</italic>, and <italic>Helitron2_CE</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Helitrons contribute a significant number of HSEs to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Number of Helitrons that overlap with 101 bp regions centered around HSF-1 peak summits (ChIP-seq data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al.

Many, but not all, individual Helitrons contain HSEs, ranging from 2% of the <italic>Helitron2_CE</italic> class to 44% of the <italic>HelitronY1_CE</italic> class, yielding a total of 953 HSE-containing Helitrons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). While most HSE-containing Helitrons harbor between one and ten HSEs, eight copies of <italic>HelitronY4_CE</italic> possess more than 100 HSEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), highlighting the potential of Helitrons to provide significant numbers of HSEs to the genome. Indeed, more than 10,000 total HSEs are found within these five Helitron classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether Helitrons are significantly enriched for HSEs relative to the rest of the genome, the proportion of the genome annotated as Helitron was compared to the proportion of genomic HSEs found within Helitrons. As annotated Helitron positions often overlap with one another, summing these HSE numbers would inflate the actual number of Helitron-residing HSEs. After condensing any Helitrons with overlapping positions into single regions, 1.7% of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome (1.68/100.27 Mb) was determined to be Helitron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which is consistent with the original estimate of 2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kapitonov and Jurka, 2001</xref>). Strikingly, we found that 61.4% (11,527/18,766) of genomic HSEs reside within Helitrons, while only 38.6% are found outside of Helitrons, resulting in a significant enrichment (p&lt;1.0e-15, binomial test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These findings show that Helitrons provide the majority of HSEs to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome and, hereafter, we refer to these as Helitron-acquired HSEs (Hac-HSEs). The remaining HSEs are referred to as Helitron-independent HSEs (Hin-HSEs).</p><p>The observation that almost two-thirds of genome-wide HSEs reside within 1.7% of genomic space suggested that Hac-HSEs exist within high-density clusters. Indeed, while Hin-HSEs are evenly distributed within 1 kb bins along the length of chromosome II (chrII), high numbers of Hac-HSEs are clustered at distinct loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>); this pattern is consistent across all six <italic>C. elegans</italic> chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In summary, we find that Helitrons are enriched for HSEs that are often clustered (p&lt;1.0e-15, Fisher’s exact test), and high HSE densities seem to be restricted to remnants of prior Helitron insertions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>HSF-1 bound Helitron HSEs are enriched near genes up-regulated during heat shock</title><p>We next asked whether Hac-HSEs provide nearby genes with the ability to be induced upon heat shock.

From the list of up-regulated genes, 119 were found within 2.5 kb of sequence downstream of an HSF-1-bound HSE.

First, we compared a representative Hac-HSE gene, <italic>col-88</italic>, to a canonical heat-shock induced gene, <italic>hsp-70</italic>, which lacks a Helitron in its promoter region. Consistent with the overall trend of a high abundance of HSEs in Helitrons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>), the <italic>HelitronY1_CE</italic> element upstream of <italic>col-88</italic> contains 10 HSEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), whereas <italic>hsp-70</italic> only has two HSEs in its promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We also observed that, despite the prevalence of HSEs proximal to <italic>col-88</italic>, HSF-1 occupancy before and after heat shock is lower than that observed for <italic>hsp-70</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). To determine if these differences were consistently observed between Hac-HSE and Hin-HSE HSR genes, we compared their numbers of proximal HSEs and expression levels before and after heat shock (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary files 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>). Reflecting the differences observed for <italic>col-88</italic> and <italic>hsp-70</italic>, we found that Hac-HSE genes in general have significantly more HSEs within 2.5 kb upstream of their transcriptional start sites compared to Hin-HSE genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). While the overall fold-induction of Hac-HSE and Hin-HSE genes in response to HS is similar, mRNA expression levels are generally lower for Hac-HSE versus Hin-HSE genes during NHS and HS conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Consistent with this observation, Hac-HSE genes exhibit less Pol II coverage relative to Hin-HSE genes both before and during HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary files 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>). To determine whether this lower overall level of expression of Hac-HSE genes might be due to repressive chromatin environments, we used publicly available data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ho et al., 2014</xref>) to measure histone modifications associated with transcriptional repression (H3K27me3 and H3K9me3) and activation (H3K4me3 and H3K36me3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahringer and Gasser, 2018</xref>). Indeed, Hac-HSE genes have significantly higher levels of the repressive and lower levels of the active histone marks when compared to Hin-HSE genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary files 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>). This signature of histone modifications at Helitron sequences may be due to small-RNA-mediated genome-surveillance mechanisms that transcriptionally repress repeat sequences in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shirayama et al., 2012</xref>). These differences between Hac-HSEs and Hin-HSEs in terms of number of proximal HSEs, expression levels during both NHS and HS conditions, and presence in repressive chromatin environments, support the notion that Helitron-associated genes represent a distinct class of HSR genes from the classical Helitron-independent HSR genes.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that canonical HSF-1 protein-coding gene targets have roles in mediating the effects of heat stress, as well as promoting longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with these studies, Hin-HSE genes show an enrichment of gene ontology (GO) terms related to canonical HSR targets, such as response to topologically incorrect protein, response to heat, and determination of adult lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). In contrast, Hac-HSE genes are associated with distinct GO enrichment terms, namely collagen trimer, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, and sensory perception of smell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), possibly reflecting more recent integration into this stress response. Enrichment for the GO term ‘DNA duplex unwinding’ derives from the five full-length autonomous Helitrons identified as Hac-HSE genes and reflects the helicase function of Helitron transposases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Differing enrichment of GO terms further demonstrates that Hac- and Hin-HSE genes comprise two distinct classes of HSR genes. While Hac- and Hin-HSE genes have distinct GO enrichment terms, several genes in both categories have been previously implicated in stress response pathways based on RNAi and mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary files 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>).</p><p>We also asked if Hac- and Hin-HSE genes might show different signatures of selection by computing Tajima’s D, which is used to determine genetic variation within a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tajima, 1989</xref>).

If Helitron elements have propagated since this divergence, distinct genes may have been integrated into the HSR by species-specific Helitron insertions in these two species. To analyze potential differences in HSR genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, we first identified orthologs for HSR genes between the two species using ParaSite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Howe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howe et al., 2016</xref>) (genomes ce11 and cb4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). When we compared HSR genes that have upstream Hac-HSEs with their orthologs in the other species, there was only one ortholog pair up-regulated in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> that also has upstream Hac-HSEs in both species (designated as ‘shared’) and this one gene appears to encode for a full-length Helitron transposase (see below). In contrast, the remaining orthologous pairs have Hac-HSEs in one species but not the other (designated as ‘unique’) (<italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>n</italic> = 38; <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, <italic>n</italic> = 26) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, many of the genes in the unique categories of Hac-HSE-containing up-regulated orthologs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> seem to be newly responsive to HS via promoter-associated Hac-HSEs. Indeed, of the 38 unique Hac-HSE-containing <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs, only three are also up-regulated during heat shock in <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, and one of these has upstream Hin-HSEs. Likewise, of the 26 unique <italic>C. briggsae</italic> orthologs, eight are also up-regulated during heat shock in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and five of these have Hin-HSEs. This contrasts from up-regulated orthologs with Hin-HSEs, where 27 up-regulated genes shared between species also have Hin-HSEs in both species. In agreement with many of these shared Hin-HSE HSR orthologs being conserved HSF-1 targets, over half (15/27, or 56%) of these genes are bound by HSF-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Thus, differences in Hac-HSEs between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> orthologs appear to result in species-specific gene expression upon heat shock, while Hin-HSEs drive a more conserved HSR among orthologs between the two species.</p><p>To illustrate how Hac-HSEs are associated with differences in heat shock responsiveness of otherwise orthologous genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, we present individual cases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–I</xref>. As an example of a unique Hac-HSE gene in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>col-52</italic> has 86 <italic>HelitronY4_CE-</italic>provided HSEs in its upstream promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and is up-regulated during heat shock in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> this same gene lacks Hac-HSEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and is non-responsive to HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>C. briggsae</italic> gene <italic>CBG00919</italic> has 12 Hac-HSEs provided by <italic>Helitron7_CB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) and is up-regulated during heat shock in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), while the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog <italic>C01G6.3</italic> lacks Hac-HSEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) and is not up-regulated during heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Interestingly, the single shared up-regulated ortholog with Hac-HSEs in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> seems to encode for a full-length Helitron transposase. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the Rep-Helicase-encoding gene <italic>F33H12.6</italic> resides within an annotated full-length copy of <italic>Helitron1_CE</italic>, has 14 Hac-HSEs in its promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), and is up-regulated during heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Likewise, the <italic>C. briggsae</italic> Rep-Helicase ortholog <italic>CBG26851</italic> (determined using BLASTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) has 85 upstream Hac-HSEs provided by <italic>Helitron7_CB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) and is up-regulated during heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Currently, it is unclear if this one shared Hac-HSE example derived from vertical inheritance of an HSE-containing Helitron or arose from transposition of a Helitron after the divergence of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic>. Overall, these observations are consistent with Helitrons mobilizing since the divergence of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and independently incorporating genes into the HSR.</p><p>If the independent mobilization of Helitrons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> has led to distinct species-specific genes being incorporated into the HSR, then the types of Hac-HSE-containing genes up-regulated during heat shock might be expected to differ between species. To test this, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis of the ‘unique’ Hac-HSE up-regulated orthologs described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. Consistent with the GO analysis depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, we found that unique up-regulated Hac-HSE-containing orthologs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are enriched for GO terms associated with collagens and GPCR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). In contrast, unique up-regulated Hac-HSE orthologs in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> are associated with carbohydrate metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Although many HS-induced Hin-HSE orthologs were not shared between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, the GO term associated with phosphorylation is enriched in the unique Hin-HSE genes from both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). As expected, shared Hin-HSE orthologs are enriched for terms associated with canonical HSR targets, such as response to topologically incorrect protein, response to heat, and the determination of adult lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Overall, these results provide further evidence that the independent mobilization of Helitrons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> has resulted in the incorporation of unique genes into the HSR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>HSEs provided by Helitrons diversify the heat shock response in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>We next asked if re-wiring of the HSR by Helitrons might have occurred in <italic>C. elegans</italic> at the population level. Wild isolates of <italic>C. elegans</italic> were screened for the absence of Helitrons relative to the N2 reference strain by using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data available from CeNDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2017</xref>) in conjunction with the structural variant caller Delly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rausch et al., 2012</xref>). From this, HSE-containing Helitrons present in the promoters of three different N2 genes were confirmed to be absent upstream of the same genes in the wild isolates QX1211 and MY16. In the N2 strain, <italic>HelitronY4_CE</italic> sequence provides 96 Hac-HSEs to <italic>nhr-247</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), <italic>HelitronY1A_CE</italic> provides 30 Hac-HSEs to <italic>str-96</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and <italic>Helitron2_CE</italic> provides 9 Hac-HSEs to <italic>fbxa-102</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

The Hac-HSEs are the only HSEs within the putative promoter regions of these N2 HSR genes, arguing that their ability to be up-regulated during heat shock is largely dependent upon the presence of Helitrons. As Helitrons are thought to be replicated in place before transposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kapitonov and Jurka, 2001</xref>), loci lacking Helitrons in wild isolates likely represent the ancestral pre-transposition state. These results suggest that Helitrons have recently mobilized to new regions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and are actively diversifying the HSR within the species.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Hac-HSEs diversify the HSR in <italic>C. elegans.</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome browser screenshot depicting the region surrounding the Hac-HSE HSR gene <italic>nhr-247</italic> showing normalized ChIP-seq signal for HSF-1 and Pol II under NHS and HS conditions (ChIP-seq data obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>HelitronY4_CE</italic> sequence containing 96 Hac-HSEs is located upstream of <italic>nhr-247</italic> in the wild-type reference strain N2, but is absent in the wild isolate QX1211.

Remarkably, we find that almost two-thirds of <italic>C. elegans</italic> HSEs reside within Helitrons. Consistent with Helitron-embedded HSEs being functional, many are bound by HSF-1 and display increased levels of Pol II after HS in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and are enriched near HS-responsive genes in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic>. Comparison of Helitron positions between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae,</italic> as well as between wild isolates of <italic>C. elegans,</italic> showed variability in Helitron position, suggesting that Helitrons have mobilized recently and may still be active. Our work demonstrates that Helitrons have significantly shaped the HSR in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by supplying HSF-1 binding sites to dozens of genes and, hence, rewiring their responsiveness to HS.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Helitron transposons have rewired the <italic>C. elegans</italic> heat shock response</title><p>Helitrons comprise ~2% of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kapitonov and Jurka, 2001</xref>). Of these, there are six full-length autonomous (predicted to encode a transposase and likely replication competent) Helitrons and ~5000 non-autonomous elements that lack protein-coding potential; many of these non-autonomous elements are fragments of full-length autonomous versions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hubley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kapitonov and Jurka, 2001</xref>). We have found that approximately 19% of the annotated Helitrons contain at least one HSE motif and that almost two-thirds of all <italic>C. elegans</italic> HSEs reside within Helitrons, many of which exist in high-density clusters. These Helitron-acquired HSEs (Hac-HSEs) are capable of recruiting HSF-1 and promoting the expression of proximal genes in response to HS. Thus, while transposase-encoding Helitrons may have initially benefitted from HSEs in their promoter as a way to mobilize upon cellular stress, the widespread Helitron-mediated insertion of HSEs within the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome now provides heat-shock inducibility to downstream genes. In comparison to Helitron-independent (Hin-HSEs) HSR genes, Hac-HSE associated genes tend to exhibit similar fold changes in HS induction but relatively lower levels in mRNA expression and Pol II occupancy under non-heat-shock conditions. This difference may be attributed to transposon silencing mechanisms, including the formation of repressive chromatin at and around Helitrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007</xref>). Consistent with chromatin-based silencing of Helitrons affecting the expression of nearby genes, HSR genes proximal to Helitrons display higher levels of repressive histone marks during non-HS conditions compared to those more distant. It is possible that the high number of HSEs provided by Helitrons helps overcome this repressive landscape by presenting multiple opportunities for HSF-1 binding and transcriptional induction of nearby genes. The potential for Helitrons to trigger silencing of adjacent genes but also enable them to respond to HS further supports a role for these TEs in rewiring gene expression patterns in <italic>C. elegans.</italic></p><p>Mobilization of TEs is inherently mutagenic and the consequence can be deleterious, beneficial, or selectively neutral depending on the insertion position and the sequence provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sundaram and Wang, 2018</xref>). While it remains to be determined whether Hac-HSEs provide a fitness advantage to the organism by promoting gene expression during HS, several lines of evidence suggest this is possible. Some Hac-HSE genes are associated with phenotypes indicative of roles in stress, show signatures of selection, and share specific GO terms. Importantly, we observe no overlap in the GO term enrichments for Hac-HSE HSR genes versus all Helitron-associated genes. This argues against sequence-biased mechanisms of Helitron insertion as a predominant explanation for the specific GO categories associated with HS-induced Hac-HSE genes. Specifically, genes encoding collagens and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are enriched in the Hac-HSE class. Both collagens and GPCRs are among the largest gene families in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnstone, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thomas and Robertson, 2008</xref>), potentially providing a rich environment for Helitron-mediated functional divergence to occur. Consistent with roles in the HSR, collagen genes have been previously reported to be up-regulated during heat stress in chicken cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sun et al., 2015</xref>) and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2018</xref>), as well as in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunquell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schreiner et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that increasing collagen output is a conserved component of the HSR. Likewise, GPCRs are transmembrane receptors with roles in neuronal signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thomas and Robertson, 2008</xref>), including the induction of canonical HSF-1 targets in non-neuronal tissues and, hence, thermotolerance in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maman et al., 2013</xref>). An alternative explanation for the enrichment of collagen and GPCR genes associated with Hac-HSEs is that Helitron promoter insertions are better tolerated for these gene families. Further studies will be needed to determine whether recruitment of these specific collagen and GPCR genes into the HSR is neutral, deleterious, or enhances the ability of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to withstand or recover from heat stress.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Helitrons have shaped the heat shock response in multiple <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species</title><p>Roughly half of all up-regulated HSF-1 targets observed in this study have Hac-HSEs, demonstrating that Helitrons have had a significant role in shaping the <italic>C. elegans</italic> HSR. Beyond <italic>C. elegans,</italic> we observed a significant association of HSEs with Helitrons in all examined <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species, suggesting that this is a long-standing phenomenon. In contrast, over a broad range of bilateria species for which Helitrons have been identified, we detected no increased correlation between HSEs and Helitrons and no high-density clusters of HSEs. The presence of Hac-HSEs across <italic>Caenorhabditids</italic> led us to ask if Helitrons might be associated with differences in heat-shock-responsive genes within and between species. Similar to <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we found a number of Hac-HSEs upstream of HSR genes in <italic>C. briggsae</italic>. However, with the exception of what appears to be an incompletely annotated autonomous Helitron in <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, none of these HSR genes had upstream Hac-HSEs present in both species. Indeed, we find that in most cases, these orthologs are uniquely heat-shock responsive in the species with upstream Hac-HSEs and lack heat-shock responsiveness in the species without upstream Hac-HSEs. This difference in gene sets that respond to HS is consistent with previous studies that concluded that substantial Developmental System Drift contributes to the divergence in genetic networks associated with the phenotypically very similar <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Verster et al., 2014</xref>). In some cases, the evolution of distinct functions for seemingly orthologous genes may be driven by changes in the regulation of their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Halfon, 2017</xref>). Indeed, it appears that with a single Helitron insertion, new genes have been incorporated into the HSR in a species-specific way. Remarkably, we find this rewiring occurs even between diverse <italic>C. elegans</italic> wild isolates, underscoring the role that TEs may play in providing variation in stress responses within different populations of a species. Intriguingly, it was recently reported that two different isolates of <italic>C. briggsae</italic> (AF16 and HK104) exhibit substantial gene expression differences in response to thermal stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mark et al., 2019</xref>).

In this study, we increase the number of identified HSF-1 HS-targets from 60 to 119 by considering HSF-1 binding that overlaps with HSE-containing repetitive elements that are normally excluded. Given their prevalence in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome, Helitron-provided HSEs have the potential to shape gene expression programs beyond the HSR, such as during other environmental challenges as well as development.</p><p>Stress responses, by their nature, allow organisms to adapt to new environments. As a result, it may be evolutionarily advantageous to rapidly rewire genes into stress response pathways. Although we speculate that the HSR was initially co-opted as a selfish way to promote mobilization of parasitic Helitrons upon cellular stress, Hac-HSEs may also provide more genetic variation and opportunities for positive and negative selective pressures to alter the host response to heat shock. By leveraging HSEs found in Helitrons that litter their genomes, <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species might be able to harness a single TE-mediated evolutionary innovation rather than needing to evolve HSEs by multiple single-nucleotide changes. We predict that this rewiring of the genes controlled by the otherwise highly conserved heat shock response between and among different <italic>Caenorhaditis</italic> species has the potential to impact <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> fitness and adaptation to novel stress conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>N2</td><td/><td/><td>wild-type strain</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>QX1211</td><td/><td/><td>Wild isolate</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>MY16</td><td/><td/><td>Wild isolate</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>C. briggsae</italic>)</td><td>AF16</td><td/><td/><td>wild-type strain</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold Kit</td><td>Illumina</td><td>Illumina: <break/>20020598</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, <break/>algorithm</td><td>FigTree v1.4.4</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/">http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Bowtie2 v2.3.3.1</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref></td><td/><td>Sequence alignment</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MEME v5.0.3</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey and Elkan, 1994</xref></td><td/><td>Motif finder</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Tomtom v5.0.2</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupta et al., 2007</xref></td><td/><td>Motif comparison</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Cistrome</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2011</xref></td><td/><td>Generation of heat maps</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>DESeq2 v1.18.1</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Love et al., 2014</xref></td><td/><td>Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Delly v0.8.1</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rausch et al., 2012</xref></td><td/><td>Genome comparisons</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>bcftools v1.9</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Narasimhan et al., 2016</xref></td><td/><td>Genome comparisons</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> strains and culture</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> were cultured using standard conditions at 20°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wood, 1988</xref>) unless otherwise noted.

biology. Most specifically, understanding how several genes can be recruited to be under the control of a transcription factor so they become co-regulated in response to a particular stimulus remains challenging. Here, the authors show that some transposable elements may carry specific transcription factor binding sites with them while they spread across the genome, allowing at the same time for the recruitment of new genes in heat shock response in nematodes. This is a very elegant study with profound insight on the potential adaptive roles of transposable elements and on major evolutionary changes that can occur quickly in transcriptional networks.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Rewiring of the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> heat shock response by helitron transposable elements&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Garrigues and colleagues examine the relationship between the insertion of a transposable element and the heat shock transcriptional network in nematodes. They find that Helitron elements contain Heat Shock Elements that are bound by Heat Shock Factor-1. The authors argue convincingly that genes could be recruited to the heat shock response by insertions of the TE in their vicinity. The reviewers agree that the work is of considerable interest and that it can potentially make an important contribution to the field of genome biology.</p><p>Please see the consolidated list of major concerns below. One important point is whether these insertions and the recruitment of new genes under the regulation of HSF-1 could be adaptive or consistent with neutral evolution and potential insertion site biases. Trying to elucidate this aspect would significantly strengthen the manuscript. In addition to the points below, the Introduction appears to be rather short and could be extended in order to put the work in a wider and more general context, for instance the evolution of transcriptional responses, how new genes are recruited to gene expression modules and how TEs could play a role in accelerating the evolution of these networks. This would put the findings in a more generally accessible context and thus pave the way to further work addressing these issues, outside of the specific model studied here.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Additional experiments are not mandatory but the authors may have access to existing data that may answer this query. Although HSF-1 regulates several key biological functions including, lifespan (Hsu et al., 2003), proteotoxicity (Cohen et al., 2006), development (Barna et al., BMC Dev Biol 2012), and other stresses, the authors have exclusively tested responses to elevated temperatures. Do helitrons also involved in other HSF-1 functions? How Hin-HSEs and Hac-HSEs linked with these other functions? This can be easily tested by exposing N2 and QX1211 worms to the relevant experimental conditions and compare the stress resistance and lifespans of animals of the two strains.</p><p>2) A more comprehensive analysis of potential sites within the TEs could be helpful. Other transcription factors such as DAF-16/FOXO are also needed for stress resistance and longevity. Do helitrons also carry DFA-16 recognition sites? This issue is particularly important as the two transcription factors show overlapping functions and both are regulated by the insulin/IGF signaling cascade.</p><p>3) Surprisingly, the authors found that the Hac-HSEs regulate very different gene sets in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and in <italic>C. Briggsae</italic> (Figure 4C). This raises the question of what is the significance of the roles played by helitrons in regulating the HSR? Can the authors please comment on that point? Also, it would be good to have some statistical test for whether the overlaps are different between the two species. I understand the argument that Hin-HSE have more conserved functions but it does not seem highly enriched in these data. Likewise, what is the GO term enrichment (Figure 4J) for all Hac or Hin-HSEs vs. the unique ones.</p><p>4) This is also another suggestion of experiments which are not mandatory. However, as mentioned above, such data may readily be available.</p><p>Are genes that are regulated by Hac-HSE involved in stress resistance and lifespan? This can be addressed by a directed RNAi screen and functional assays. I would suggest to test at least 15 genes to get a sufficient insight.</p><p>This should be also tested in other <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species.</p><p>5) Figure 2H provides a possible explanation to the observation that there is a lower presence of RNA Polymerase II in Hac-HSEs regulated genes (Figure 2G). Performing similar analyses using additional repression and activation epigenetic modifications would further establish this possibility.</p><p>6) The authors should not use the word &quot;domestication&quot; to describe how Helitrons could be co-opted or acquired for other functions in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome. This word has specific meanings in the evolutionary genetics literature (e.g. a series of robust, controlled, evolutionary changes towards an often human-associated association) that are not supported here. The authors have beautiful data that do not need to use this loaded term.</p><p>7) I think that the Discussion is a bit long and parts of it are redundant with or can be included in the Introduction (if necessary). Please tighten both a bit.</p><p>8) The authors do a good job of explaining and defending their results in the Discussion and do not good too far in interpretations. One claim that could be softened (slightly) is that selection could be acting on the Hac-HSEs within the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> lineage. I agree that it could be, but it could also be drift. The differences in abundance across and within <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species suggests that it could be selected because different phylogenetic lineages have similar abundances (with unique complements of genes, probably) but it does not have to be selected in all cases. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the authors can look for signatures of selection in and around Hac-HSEs vs. Hin-HSEs (Tajima's D or the like) to look for support. Similar analyses can be done with C. briggsae using the ~40 wild isolates with sequence available. These data will support their claims of selection over drift.</p><p>9) While I concur that this conclusion is true at face value, in that helitron insertions modify gene expression patterns when the animals are exposed to heat shock, it is less convincing to me that this has actually led biologically important changes in heat shock response in an adaptive way to benefit the fitness of the organisms. I certainly agree with the idea that helitron insertions (aka mutations) are likely to confer effects that manifest under heat shock; given what is known about the distribution of mutational effects in most organisms, nearly all such mutations will be deleterious or selectively neutral. The polymorphism observed among wild isolates could reflect helitron insertions that ended up being non-deleterious, or weakly deleterious but only under rare conditions of heat shock, thus allowing them to persist and not yet have been weeded out of the population by purifying selection. The fact that comparisons across species show unique effects reinforces the idea that lineage-specific rounds of helitron activity provides a mutational pressure that creates such novel elements with corresponding influence on neighboring genes, but that they usually are evolutionarily short-lived and may not confer any fitness benefit. The above &quot;criticism&quot; aside, the authors are generally quite cautious in not ascribing explicitly a fitness benefit to the helitron-mediated effects on flanking gene expression under heat shock, which I appreciate. Nonetheless, some of the language that the heat shock response is &quot;rewired&quot; leaves implicit the suggestion that this is an adaptive rewiring, which need not be the case. I think it would be valuable to make this point more explicit and more clearly articulate the mutational pressure of helitrons with respect to the potential distribution of fitness effects, with those persisting cases likely being neutral, weakly or conditionally-deleterious, or possibly beneficial; distinguishing among these possibilities would require additional study.</p><p>10) It could also be interesting to relate (briefly) the polymorphism among wild isolates to the potential genetic basis to GxE interactions in phenotypes and transcriptome patterns. The enrichment of helitron insertions with specific GO categories is interesting, but could simply reflect sequence-biased mechanisms of insertion. For example, if GPCRs are enriched in certain sequence motifs that are conducive to helitron insertion, then the association of helitron with GPCR could simply be a by-product of the insertional bias. Alternatively, it could be that selection against helitron insertion is weaker for the large multigene family of GPCRs, and so it takes longer for them to be weeded out of the population to allow the helitron-GPCR association to reflect such less negative effects. These kinds of explanations for the GO enrichment analysis would be helpful so as not to mislead readers into thinking that the enrichment must reflect some adaptive story of selective retention in e.g. GPCRS.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51139.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Please see the consolidated list of major concerns below. One important point is whether these insertions and the recruitment of new genes under the regulation of HSF-1 could be adaptive or consistent with neutral evolution and potential insertion site biases. Trying to elucidate this aspect would significantly strengthen the manuscript. In addition to the points below, the Introduction appears to be rather short and could be extended in order to put the work in a wider and more general context, for instance the evolution of transcriptional responses, how new genes are recruited to gene expression modules and how TEs could play a role in accelerating the evolution of these networks. This would put the findings in a more generally accessible context and thus pave the way to further work addressing these issues, outside of the specific model studied here.</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed below, we performed new analyses to investigate whether Helitron insertions and the recruitment of new genes under the regulation of HSF-1 could be adaptive or consistent with neutral evolution and potential insertion site biases. While we prefer to remain conservative in our conclusions, we do observe signatures of selection for some Hac-HSE genes, based on Tajima’s D analyses, and the GO term enrichment for Hac-HSE genes is different from that of all Helitron-associated genes, suggesting that insertion bias cannot fully explain the types of genes under the control of Hac-HSEs. Nonetheless we have revised the Discussion to consider alternative possibilities to selection. As suggested, we have also extended the Introduction to include a more thorough background and context for the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Additional experiments are not mandatory but the authors may have access to existing data that may answer this query.</p><p>Although HSF-1 regulates several key biological functions including, lifespan (Hsu et al., 2003), proteotoxicity (Cohen et al., 2006), development (Barna et al., BMC Dev Biol 2012), and other stresses, the authors have exclusively tested responses to elevated temperatures. Do helitrons also involved in other HSF-1 functions? How Hin-HSEs and Hac-HSEs linked with these other functions? This can be easily tested by exposing N2 and QX1211 worms to the relevant experimental conditions and compare the stress resistance and lifespans of animals of the two strains.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we analyzed available datasets for phenotypes associated with knockdown or mutation of Hac-HSE genes. That analysis, which is further described in our response to point 4 below, reveals that some Hac-HSE genes have roles in several stress resistance pathways and lifespan, suggesting that they may be important HSF-1 targets. This phenotype information has been added a new column for the Hac-HSE genes in Supplementary file 3.</p><p>We restricted our studies to the response of Hac- and Hin-HSE genes to elevated temperature because this is the only condition with available genome-wide HSF-1 binding data (Li et al., 2016). While there is good phenotypic evidence that HSF-1 regulates multiple pathways, the direct transcriptional targets of HSF-1 in these various pathways are yet to be defined at the genome scale through ChIP-seq assays. Additionally, the studies cited above do not include RNA-seq (or microarray) data that could point to specific genes being regulated by the various conditions in an <italic>hsf-1</italic> dependent manner. Hsu et al., 2003, and Cohen et al., 2006, conclude that DAF-16 and HSF-1 are both required for the regulation of aging, including aging-related proteotoxic phenotypes, but only 4 transcriptional targets are identified in Hsu and none in Cohen. See point 2 below for our analysis of possible co-regulation of Hac- and Hin-HSE genes by HSF-1 and DAF-16 in heat shock. The Barna et al., 2012, paper reports an unusual role for HSF-1 in repressing <italic>daf-7</italic> expression to promote dauer formation but does not provide direct evidence that HSF-1 binds to a predicted HSE in this gene. The expression of <italic>daf-7</italic> does not significantly change in our heat shock conditions (see Supplementary file 2).</p><p>The question of whether Helitron-provided HSEs contribute to other pathways regulated by HSF-1 is of great interest to us but will require the generation of new HSF-1 ChIP-seq and gene expression datasets under different conditions, which is beyond the scope of this study. The suggestion to expose N2 and QX1211 worms to other experimental conditions and compare lifespans and stress resistance would not allow us to make conclusions about the role of the <italic>nhr-247</italic> and <italic>str-96</italic> genes that have Hac-HSEs in N2 but not QX1211 because these strains are highly diverged from one another, and there are many other polymorphisms between these worms that could contribute to phenotypic differences (Andersen et al., 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A more comprehensive analysis of potential sites within the TEs could be helpful. Other transcription factors such as DAF-16/FOXO are also needed for stress resistance and longevity. Do helitrons also carry DFA-16 recognition sites? This issue is particularly important as the two transcription factors show overlapping functions and both are regulated by the insulin/IGF signaling cascade.</p></disp-quote><p>To perform a more comprehensive analysis of potential Transcription Factor (TF) sites within Helitrons, we used 129 published <italic>C. elegans</italic> TF binding motifs (Narasimhan et al., 2015) as well as 2 DAF-16 Binding Elements (DBEs) from other sources (Weirauch et al., 2014; Matys et al., 2006) to scan the entire genome for their presence, and then asked whether any had enrichment in Helitrons. While a few other TF motifs were enriched in Helitrons, the most enriched motif in this analysis was for HSF-1 (HSEs), further justifying our focus on HSEs in this study. This analysis also determined that DAF-16 DBEs were significantly depleted from Helitrons. These results have been added as a new supplementary table (Supplementary file 1), and our original supplementary tables have been re-numbered accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Surprisingly, the authors found that the Hac-HSEs regulate very different gene sets in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and in <italic>C. Briggsae</italic> (Figure 4C). This raises the question of what is the significance of the roles played by helitrons in regulating the HSR? Can the authors please comment on that point? Also, it would be good to have some statistical test for whether the overlaps are different between the two species. I understand the argument that Hin-HSE have more conserved functions but it does not seem highly enriched in these data. Likewise, what is the GO term enrichment (Figure 4J) for all Hac or Hin-HSEs vs. the unique ones.</p></disp-quote><p>Initially, we were also surprised by this result but think it is consistent with previous studies that concluded that substantial Developmental System Drift (DSD) explains the divergence in genetic networks associated with the phenotypically very similar <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> (Verster et al., 2014). Since the evolution of distinct functions for seemingly orthologous genes may be driven by changes in the regulation of their expression (Halfon, 2017), we are intrigued by the possibility that Helitrons might contribute to some differences in the genetic networks triggered by HS in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae.</italic> These points and references are now included in the Discussion.</p><p>As requested, we have added the results of hypergeometric tests to determine the significance of overlap to Figure 4. There is significant enrichment of <italic>C. elegans</italic> Hin-HSE genes with <italic>C. briggsae</italic> orthologs up-regulated after HS (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003) but not for Hac-HSE genes (<italic>p</italic> = 0.12). Furthermore, if we consider just high confidence Hin- and Hac-HSE genes bound by HSF-1 based on ChIP data for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, 15/45 Hin-HSE genes are also up-regulated by HS in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> whereas only 1/27 Hac-HSE is also upregulated. Using Fisher’s exact test, these numbers are significantly different (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003) with <italic>C. elegans</italic> Hin-HSE genes enriched for overlap with <italic>C. briggsae</italic> genes, and Hac-HSE genes depleted for overlap in each species.</p><p>The GO term enrichments for all Hac- or Hin-HSE genes, shared and unique, are shown in Figure 4J. The exception is the single shared Hac-HSE gene, which seems to be a full-length autonomous Helitron.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) This is also another suggestion of experiments which are not mandatory. However, as mentioned above, such data may readily be available.</p><p>Are genes that are regulated by Hac-HSE involved in stress resistance and lifespan? This can be addressed by a directed RNAi screen and functional assays. I would suggest to test at least 15 genes to get a sufficient insight.</p><p>This should be also tested in other Caenorhabditis species.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, phenotypic data is available for many of the Hac- and Hin-HSE genes. Aggregate data from WormBase (Version WS273) assigns 19/60 Hac-HSE genes with RNAi or genetic mutation phenotypes, some of which are consistent with roles in stress resistance and lifespan (for example, dauer variant, protein aggregation variant, toxin hypersensitive, osmotic stress response variant). For comparison, 31/60 Hin-HSE genes have been associated with RNAi or genetic mutation phenotypes, some of which are consistent with roles in stress resistance and lifespan (for example, dauer variant, protein aggregation variant, toxic chemical response variant, lifespan variant). This phenotype information has been added as new columns for the Hac- and Hin-HSE genes in Supplementary files 3 and 4.</p><p>While we would like to perform the suggested RNAi screen to directly test for roles of Hac-HSE genes in heat shock (and possibly in other stress conditions, as well as lifespan control), there are several technical issues that limit the usefulness of RNAi in such a screen. First, many of these genes are neuronal and this tissue is notoriously resistant to RNAi. Second, many of these genes (as well as some of the Hin-HSE genes) are nearly undetectable under NHS conditions, meaning there is little to no template for RNA Dependent Polymerases to amplify the primary RNAi response into the secondary response until HS occurs and the genes are induced; this amplification is important for robust RNAi, and it is unknown if this step functions during HS. Third, several other nematode species do not have the mechanisms found in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that allow for dsRNA uptake by feeding RNAi and spreading throughout the organism, which are important for robust RNAi responses (Nuez and Felix, 2012). While some of these issues may be overcome with specialized strains and RNAi methods, working out these conditions is beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 2H provides a possible explanation to the observation that there is a lower presence of RNA Polymerase II in Hac-HSEs regulated genes (Figure 2G). Performing similar analyses using additional repression and activation epigenetic modifications would further establish this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>Using publicly available ChIP-seq data for the “active” histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 and the “silent” histone mark H3K9me3, we compared these marks at Hac-HSE versus Hin-HSE genes. Consistent with our original observation of generally less Pol II and more repressive H3K27me3 at Hac-HSE genes, we find less of the active and more of the repressive marks at Hac-HSE genes compared to Hin-HSE genes and these results are presented as a new supplementary figure, Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors should not use the word &quot;domestication&quot; to describe how Helitrons could be co-opted or acquired for other functions in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome. This word has specific meanings in the evolutionary genetics literature (e.g. a series of robust, controlled, evolutionary changes towards an often human-associated association) that are not supported here. The authors have beautiful data that do not need to use this loaded term.</p></disp-quote><p>The word “domestication” has been removed throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) I think that the Discussion is a bit long and parts of it are redundant with or can be included in the Introduction (if necessary). Please tighten both a bit.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Discussion and Introduction as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors do a good job of explaining and defending their results in the Discussion and do not good too far in interpretations. One claim that could be softened (slightly) is that selection could be acting on the Hac-HSEs within the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> lineage. I agree that it could be, but it could also be drift. The differences in abundance across and within <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species suggests that it could be selected because different phylogenetic lineages have similar abundances (with unique complements of genes, probably) but it does not have to be selected in all cases. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the authors can look for signatures of selection in and around Hac-HSEs vs. Hin-HSEs (Tajima's D or the like) to look for support. Similar analyses can be done with C. briggsae using the ~40 wild isolates with sequence available. These data will support their claims of selection over drift.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the Discussion to further avoid the impression we are claiming selection and offer alternative possibilities, as suggested.</p><p>As advised, we have performed Tajima’s D calculations for Hac-HSE and Hin-HSE genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae,</italic> using available wild isolate sequence data. We calculated Tajima’s D over HSF-1 peak summits that overlap either Hac- or Hin-HSEs upstream of our defined Hac- and Hin-HSE genes and provide these scores in new columns in Supplementary files 3 and 4. From this, seven Hac-HSE genes (<italic>col-162, str-30, ZK1053.1, ZK1053.2, srt-28, R02C2.6, oac-55</italic>) and three Hin-HSE genes (<italic>F57A8.1, Y38H6C.8, bath-36</italic>) have scores in the bottom 5% of genome-wide Tajima’s D scores (calculated over 10-kb sliding windows in 100-bp steps), which could be interpreted as signatures of selection although we believe future work will be needed to make those conclusions.</p><p>We also determined the lowest Tajima’s D scores found in “promoter” regions 2.5 kb upstream of all Hac- and Hin-HSE genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, as we do not have HSF-1 ChIP data for <italic>C. briggsae</italic> to center the analyses. For <italic>C. elegans</italic>, this results in 12 Hac-HSE genes and 22 Hin-HSE genes with scores in the bottom 5%. For <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, this results in two Hac-HSE genes and 30 Hin-HSE genes with scores in the bottom 5%. These scores have been added as new columns in what is now Supplementary file 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) While I concur that this conclusion is true at face value, in that helitron insertions modify gene expression patterns when the animals are exposed to heat shock, it is less convincing to me that this has actually led biologically important changes in heat shock response in an adaptive way to benefit the fitness of the organisms.

While this seems to argue against sequence biased mechanisms of insertion as a predominant explanation for the specific GO categories associated with HS-induced Hac-HSE genes, we have revised the Discussion to consider this possibility.</p></body></sub-article></article>
