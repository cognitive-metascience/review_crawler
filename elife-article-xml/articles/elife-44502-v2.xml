presynaptic active zone. Although post-translational modification of cellular proteins with ubiquitin is a key molecular mechanism governing protein degradation and function, mGlu7 ubiquitination and its functional consequences have not been elucidated yet. Here, we report that Nedd4 ubiquitin E3 ligase and β-arrestins regulate ubiquitination of mGlu7 in heterologous cells and rat neurons. Upon agonist stimulation, β-arrestins recruit Nedd4 to mGlu7 and facilitate Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination of mGlu7. Nedd4 and β-arrestins regulate constitutive and agonist-induced endocytosis of mGlu7 and are required for mGlu7-dependent MAPK signaling in neurons. In addition, Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination results in the degradation of mGlu7 by both the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the lysosomal degradation pathway. These findings provide a model in which Nedd4 and β-arrestin act together as a complex to regulate mGlu7 surface expression and function at presynaptic terminals.</p></abstract><kwd-group

class C G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that regulates glutamate neurotransmitter release at presynaptic terminals via inhibitory heterotrimeric G-protein signaling cascades. mGlu7 is only activated under conditions of sustained synaptic activity due to its low affinity for glutamate, thereby acting as an auto-inhibitory receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Niswender and Conn, 2010</xref>). Like many GPCRs, the function and desensitization of mGlu7 are tightly regulated by mechanisms of receptor endocytosis from the plasma membrane. In particular, agonist-induced mGlu7 endocytosis underlies a presynaptic form of long-term depression (LTD) and regulates a metaplastic switch at the mossy fiber-CA3 stratum lucidum interneuron (MF-SLIN) synapses. At naive MF-SLIN synapses, high frequency stimulation (HFS) or agonist L-AP4 treatment triggers presynaptic LTD by mGlu7 activation. Following L-AP4-induced internalization of mGlu7, the same HFS produces presynaptic LTP, which requires the activation of the adenylate cyclase-cAMP-PKA pathway and subsequent action of RIM1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pelkey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pelkey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Suh et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>A number of cellular processes related to GPCR trafficking, signaling, stability, and agonist sensitivity are regulated by ubiquitination, a post-translational modification (PTM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso and Friedman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dores and Trejo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marchese et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sarker et al., 2011</xref>). Ubiquitination of target substrates is achieved by the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to lysine residues of substrates through a three-enzyme cascade catalyzed by E1 (ubiquitin activating), E2 (ubiquitin conjugating), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase) enzymes. Whereas misfolded GPCRs during de novo synthesis in the ER are poly-ubiquitinated and degraded via an ER-associated degradation pathway, certain GPCRs in the plasma membrane are ubiquitinated at a steady state by specific E3 ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dores and Trejo, 2012</xref>). The E3 ubiquitin ligase catalyzes the transfer of the ubiquitin moiety from E2 enzymes to the target substrates and plays a key role in determining the substrate specificity of ubiquitination. Among the several hundred E3 ubiquitin ligases in mammals, Nedd4 (Neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated 4) (also known as Nedd4-1) E3 ligase, which belongs to the HECT (Homologous to E6-associated protein Carboxyl Terminus) domain-containing family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rotin and Kumar, 2009</xref>), has been well characterized in its regulation of the turnover and trafficking of ion channels and GPCRs present in neurons such as voltage-gated sodium channels, calcium channels, GluA1 AMPA receptor, GluN2D-containing NMDA receptor, Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger 1, and β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boase and Kumar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gautam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rougier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schwarz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shenoy and Lefkowitz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shenoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simonin and Fuster, 2010</xref>).</p><p>β-arrestin 1 (also known as arrestin 2) and β-arrestin 2 (also known as arrestin 3) are cytosolic adaptor proteins involved in the regulation of GPCR desensitization, trafficking, and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeWire et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luttrell and Gesty-Palmer, 2010</xref>). β2AR is one of the best-characterized GPCRs with regard to functional consequences of GPCR-β-arrestin interaction. Following agonist stimulation, β-arrestins are rapidly recruited to phosphorylated activated β2AR at the plasma membrane. β-arrestins typically terminate the interaction of receptors with G-proteins, however recent studies indicate that β-arrestins trigger the ubiquitination of receptors and give rise to distinct signaling pathways independently of G-proteins. Upon agonist stimulation of β2AR, β-arrestins act as adaptors to initiate recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligases such as Nedd4 or Mdm2 as well as the clathrin-AP2 adaptor complex, thereby promoting endocytosis of β-arrestin-bound receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jean-Charles et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shenoy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shenoy et al., 2008</xref>). Once internalized to early endosomes, receptors can either be recycled back to the plasma membrane or designated to degradation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marchese et al., 2008</xref>). Agonist-stimulated GPCRs associated with β-arrestins can generate two stages of signaling. While class A receptors (e.g. β2AR) exhibit a transient interaction with β-arrestins, undergo recycling pathways, and induce weak extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, class B receptors such as Angiotensin II type 1a receptor (AT<sub>1a</sub>R) and vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) display more robust interaction with β-arrestins that gives rise to the receptor-G protein-β-arrestin super-complex in the endosomes, induce robust and sustained ERK activity, and are targeted for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ranjan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shenoy and Lefkowitz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>). However, the roles of β-arrestins in regulating trafficking and function of class C GPCRs remain poorly understood.</p><p>In the present study, we find that mGlu7, a class C GPCR is ubiquitinated by Nedd4 E3 ligase in heterologous cells and cultured neurons. We show that Nedd4 and β-arrestins are constitutively associated with mGlu7 and recruited to mGlu7 by agonist stimulation, revealing the essential roles of β-arrestin as an adaptor that recruits Nedd4 to mediate ubiquitination and endocytosis of mGlu7. In addition, we demonstrate that β-arrestin 2 and Nedd4 regulate mGlu7-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and Nedd4 is required for agonist-induced receptor degradation via both the proteasomal and the lysosomal pathways. These findings reveal the roles of the Nedd4-β-arrestin complex in regulating ubiquitination and surface stability of mGlu7, and each of their functional effects at presynaptic terminals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>mGlu7 is ubiquitinated by agonist stimulus or Nedd4 E3 ligase in heterologous cells and neurons</title><p>To explore if ubiquitination determines mGlu7 trafficking and function, we first tested if mGlu7 could be modified by ubiquitination in heterologous cells.

We were able to observe an approximately 2-fold increase in mGlu7 ubiquitination within 10 min of agonist stimulation, which was sustained up to 60 min. Total mGlu7 level was reduced after 30 min most likely due to receptor degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Next, we examined the endogenous ubiquitination of mGlu7 in cultured cortical neurons following Group III mGlu receptors agonist L-AP4 (400 μM) treatment for 5 min. The ubiquitinated mGlu7 was pulled down using an anti-ubiquitin antibody (clone FK2) and blotted with mGlu7 antibody. We found that L-AP4 treatment increases endogenous mGlu7 ubiquitination in neurons by approximately 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Conversely, we detected ubiquitinated bands of endogenous mGlu7 after immunoprecipitation with anti-mGlu7 antibody in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To distinguish whether surface-expressed or intracellular mGlu7 undergoes ubiquitin modification, we devised a two-round purification strategy after cell surface biotinylation and separated the surface versus internal ubiquitinated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Specifically, cultured cortical neurons were labeled by membrane-impermeable biotin and then incubated with L-AP4 for 5 min. Cell lysates were then pulled down with Streptavidin-agarose beads. The supernatant was considered to be the intracellular fraction, and the surface fraction was obtained from bead-bound proteins. The ubiquitinated proteins were subsequently isolated from the surface or intracellular fraction using FK2 antibodies, respectively. We found that surface-expressed mGlu7 undergoes agonist-induced ubiquitination, whereas intracellular mGlu7 does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This result suggests that mGlu7 ubiquitination occurs in combination with an agonist-induced endocytosis process.</p><p>As E3 Ub ligase largely determines the substrate specificity of ubiquitination, we searched for the E3 ligases responsible for mGlu7 ubiquitination. We tested a Nedd4 E3 ligase because Nedd4 has been implicated in regulating the turnover and trafficking of many ion channels and GPCRs in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rougier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schwarz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shenoy and Lefkowitz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shenoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simonin and Fuster, 2010</xref>). When Nedd4 wild type (WT) was co-expressed in HEK 293 T cells, we observed a robust ubiquitination of mGlu7, whereas Nedd4 C867S, a catalytically inactive form of Nedd4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blot et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kamynina et al., 2001</xref>), did not alter the ubiquitination level of mGlu7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To confirm the essential role of Nedd4 in agonist-induced mGlu7 ubiquitination, we knocked down the endogenous expression of Nedd4 using lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in cultured cortical neurons. Nedd4 shRNA was highly effective in knocking down endogenous Nedd4 expression 7 days after infection. Notably, agonist L-AP4-induced mGlu7 ubiquitination was markedly reduced by Nedd4 knockdown (Nedd4 KD), indicating that Nedd4 is required for agonist-induced mGlu7 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To examine the interaction of Nedd4 with its substrate mGlu7, endogenous mGlu7 from cultured cortical neurons was immunoprecipitated and blotted with anti-Nedd4 antibody. We observed constitutive interaction between endogenous Nedd4 and mGlu7, and their interaction was markedly enhanced after treatment of L-AP4 for 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that Nedd4 is recruited to mGlu7 upon agonist-stimulation and plays a role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for mGlu7 ubiquitination.</p><p>It is well known that among seven lysine residues of the ubiquitin protein, the formation of K48- or K63-linked polyubiquitin chain typically directs protein substrates to the proteasomal degradation or endocytic trafficking, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso and Friedman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dores and Trejo, 2012</xref>). To identify which types of ubiquitin linkages are preferentially attached to mGlu7, HA-ubiquitin K48 (ubiquitin with only a K48 residue, other lysines mutated to arginines) or HA-K63 (ubiquitin with only a K63 residue, other lysines mutated to arginines) expression plasmids were co-transfected with mGlu7. Although K63 ubiquitin was more efficiently conjugated to mGlu7 than K48 ubiquitin, there was no significant difference between K48- or K63-linked mGlu7 ubiquitination when their mGlu7 ubiquitination levels were normalized by the total expression levels of ubiquitin K48 or K63, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This result implicates that ubiquitination of mGlu7 may regulate receptor endocytosis as well as degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>mGlu7 is ubiquitinated on the lysine residues of the C-terminus and intracellular loop 2</title><p>We hypothesized that ubiquitin-conjugation of mGlu7 occurs in the eight lysine residues in the C-terminal tail (CT) of mGlu7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To determine which lysine residues are responsible for ubiquitin-conjugation of mGlu7, we generated sequential deletion mutants (mGlu7 Δ893, Δ879, Δ860, and Δ857) by introducing a stop codon at the position of designated amino acid numbers, and examined ubiquitination of these mutants. Unexpectedly, the level of ubiquitination was not reduced in any deletion mutants including mGlu7 Δ857, which does not possess any lysine residues in its CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We recognized four additional lysine residues present in the intracellular loop (iL) 2 and 3 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and thus generated iL mutants such that all four lysine residues in iLs were individually replaced with arginine residues (mGlu7 iL 4K4R) by site-directed mutagenesis. Consistent with the data using deletion mutants, the mGlu7 CT 8K8R mutant, in which all eight lysine residues in mGlu7 CT were mutated to arginines, was as efficiently ubiquitinated as mGlu7 WT after treatment of L-Glu for 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, the efficiency of ubiquitination of mGlu7 iL 4K4R was also similar to that of mGlu7 WT or CT 8K8R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that the lysines on iLs are not the only ubiquitination sites.

It has also been reported that β-arrestins are involved in the desensitization, endocytosis, and intracellular signaling of Group I mGlu receptors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suh et al., 2018</xref>). Thus we investigated the roles of β-arrestins in the function and trafficking of Group III mGlu receptor mGlu7. GFP-tagged β-arrestin 1 or 2 was co-transfected with FLAG-tagged mGlu7 or β2AR in HEK cells, and receptors were immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody. As evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, β-arrestin 1 robustly binds to mGlu7 as well as β2AR, whereas the binding affinity of β-arrestin 2 to mGlu7 appears to be lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We hypothesized that agonist-stimulated recruitment of Nedd4 to mGlu7 requires β-arrestins that play as adaptors to link mGlu7 and Nedd4. Accordingly, we characterized the time course of binding among β-arrestins, Nedd4, and mGlu7.

We observed that β-arrestins and Nedd4 bind constitutively to mGlu7 before stimulation with agonist L-Glu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Of particular interest, agonist stimulation rapidly increased binding of β-arrestin 1 to mGlu7 within 5 min by approximately 1.8 fold relative to basal binding levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). This interaction was sustained for 15 min and decreased to basal levels after 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>).

We have found that three proteins are present in the same complex and that their binding affinity is increased by agonist treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). However, binding affinity of Nedd4 or β-arrestin 1 to different mGlu7 ubiquitination site mutants was not altered in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Next, to confirm the role of β-arrestins in the recruitment of Nedd4 to mGlu7, we knocked down β-arrestin 1 or 2 by co-transfection with β-arrestin 1 or 2 shRNA in HEK 293 T cells, respectively. We found that either β-arrestin 1 (β-arr1 KD) or 2 knockdown (β-arr2 KD) abolished an increase in agonist-induced binding of Nedd4 to mGlu7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,J</xref>), To examine the requirement for β-arrestin 1 and 2 in Nedd4 recruitment to mGlu7 in neurons, we generated lentiviruses harboring β-arrestin 1 or 2 shRNA under H1 promoter. When β-arrestin 1 or 2 was knocked down in primary cortical neurons, agonist-induced Nedd4 recruitment to mGlu7 was not impaired. However, when both β-arrestin 1 and 2 were simultaneously knocked down, we observed a significant reduction of agonist-induced Nedd4 recruitment to mGlu7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K,L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Endogenously expressed levels of β-arrestins are high in the brain, but relatively low in HEK 293 T cells because only mGlu7 and Nedd4 were exogenously overexpressed in HEK 293 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attramadal et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barlic et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that β-arrestin 1 and 2 may compensate for the function of each other in neurons due to their high expression but not in heterologous cells due to their stoichiometrically low expression. Taken together, these results indicate that agonist-induced recruitment of Nedd4 to mGlu7 is mediated by β-arrestins.</p><p>Our results indicate that β-arrestins and Nedd4 form a complex with mGlu7 in the basal state, and upon agonist stimulation β-arrestins are further recruited to mGlu7, which promotes Nedd4 binding to mGlu7. Therefore we tested whether β-arrestins affect mGlu7 ubiquitination by recruiting Nedd4 in cultured cortical neurons. We found that agonist-induced mGlu7 ubiquitination levels were significantly reduced by either β-arrestin 1 or 2 KD, and further decreased by double KD of β-arrestin 1 and 2 compared with the control non-related target knockdown (Ctl KD) in cultured cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M,N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).

To determine if ubiquitin modification regulates endocytosis of endogenous mGlu7, we utilized MLN7243, a cell-permeable small-molecule inhibitor of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UAE, also known as E1 enzyme). When we treated cultured cortical neurons with MLN7243, we found surface expression of endogenous mGlu7 is increased while mGlu7 ubiquitination is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). To specifically evaluate the role of Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination on mGlu7 in receptor trafficking, we co-transfected myc-mGlu7 and Nedd4 WT or C867S in cultured hippocampal neurons. We first labeled surface-expressed receptors with anti-myc antibody and allowed endocytosis at 37°C for 15 min in the absence or presence of agonist L-AP4. Remaining receptors on the cell surface were visualized with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated secondary antibodies before permeabilization (red), and internalized receptors were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies after permeabilization (green).

After agonist-induced activation of GPCRs triggers the coupling of heterotrimeric G proteins and subsequent second messenger signaling, recruitment of β-arrestins to GPCRs plays a classical role in receptor desensitization. Recent studies have revealed that β-arrestins modulate multifaceted functions in endocytosis, signaling, and ubiquitination of GPCRs by scaffolding the clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery, MAPKs, or E3 ubiquitin ligases such as Nedd4, MDM2, and AIP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jean-Charles et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ranjan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shenoy and Lefkowitz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith and Rajagopal, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Srivastava et al., 2015</xref>). In the present study, we have elucidated several key molecular features regulating mGlu7 ubiquitination by forming a complex with β-arrestins and Nedd4 E3 ligase in an activity-dependent manner. We found that mGlu7 undergoes constitutive and agonist-induced ubiquitination in the lysine residues of both iL2 and CT, which is primarily mediated by Nedd4 E3 ligase. Upon agonist stimulation, β-arrestins are able to recruit Nedd4 to mGlu7 and facilitate ubiquitination of mGlu7. Nedd4 and β-arrestins regulate constitutive and agonist-induced endocytosis of mGlu7, and are required for MAPK signaling of mGlu7 in neurons. Finally, Nedd4-mediated mGlu7 ubiquitination regulates receptor stability through both the lysosomal and the proteasomal degradation pathways.</p><p>The E3 ubiquitin ligase is a key determinant of substrate specificity by catalyzing the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 enzymes to target proteins. Little is known about E3 ligases about their role in regulating the ubiquitination of mGlu receptors. Siah-1A (seven in absentia homolog-1A) is the first identified E3 ubiquitin ligase for Group 1 mGlu receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moriyoshi et al., 2004</xref>). Siah-1A directly binds to Group 1 mGlu receptors and mediates receptor ubiquitination, resulting in receptor degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Siah-1A also regulates agonist-induced endocytosis of mGlu5 by displacing calmodulin binding, and promotes the lysosomal degradation of mGlu5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gulia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishikawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ko et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, we have identified Nedd4 as a primary E3 ligase for ubiquitination of mGlu7, a presynaptically expressed Group III mGlu receptor. Although mGlu7 does not possess the PPxY motif, a canonical Nedd4 binding motif, Nedd4 directly binds to the iL2 and CT domains of mGlu7 by the HECT domain of Nedd4. In addition to modulating mGlu7-mediated ERK signaling, Nedd4 regulates mGlu7 trafficking by inducing ubiquitination, resulting in endocytosis and degradation of surface-expressed mGlu7 into proteasomes and lysosomes. We observed a marked induction of mGlu7 ubiquitination when exogenous ubiquitin was co-expressed with mGlu7 in HEK 293 T cells. In contrast, endogenous mGlu7 ubiquitination induced by agonist stimulation was less prominent in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>). This result likely occurs because only the surface-expressed fraction of mGlu7 can be ubiquitinated directly from agonist stimulation. We have observed that agonist stimulation increases ubiquitination of the surface-expressed mGlu7 to some degree but not ubiquitination of the intracellular mGlu7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We were not able to observe more prominent endogenous mGlu7 ubiquitination with longer agonist incubations for up to 2 hr or by other neuronal stimulation such as bicuculline or KCl (data not shown). Of note, we observed some remaining levels of mGlu7 ubiquitination despite the loss of Nedd4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>. This result suggests that other E3 ligases than Nedd4 may play a role in mGlu7 ubiquitination in neurons.</p><p>We identified two binding sites, iL2 and CT in mGlu7 that interact with β-arrestins and Nedd4. Recently, a crystal structure of rhodopsin-arrestin complex revealed that a conserved serine/threonine-rich domain, Px(x)PxxP/E/D (P, phospho-serine or phospho-threonine; X, any amino acid) across the major GPCR subfamilies serves as a common phosphorylation code for arrestin recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). A serine/threonine rich domain on mGlu7 CT (<sub>868-</sub>TAATMSSRLS<sub>-877</sub>) is compatible with this phosphorylation code for arrestin binding, and is therefore a candidate β-arrestin-interacting domain. In addition, the iL2 domain of GPCRs has been shown to contribute to association with β-arrestin by providing a partial core contact site for both Gα and β-arrestin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Latorraca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ranjan et al., 2017</xref>). It was shown that the iL2 domain of mGlu receptors including mGlu8 determines G-protein coupling selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Francesconi and Duvoisin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomeza et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Havlickova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pin et al., 1994</xref>). Furthermore, in addition to the CT domain, the iL2 domain of mGlu1 is a site for GRK2 binding and GRK2-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhami et al., 2005</xref>). Accordingly, additional binding of β-arrestin-Nedd4 complex to mGlu7 iL2 may sterically hinder G-protein binding and provide a platform for a receptor core for fully-engaged binding of β-arrestin to mGlu7. Although we observed β-arrestins and Nedd4 bind constitutively to mGlu7, binding affinity of Nedd4 or β-arrestin 1 to mGlu7 is not affected by ubiquitination site mutations in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This result suggests that mGlu7 ubiquitination per se is not a prerequisite for the complex formation.</p><p>It has been expected that β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 are functionally redundant due to the high degree of sequence and structural similarity, however recent studies have suggested their partially distinct functional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Srivastava et al., 2015</xref>). For example, the desensitization, ubiquitination, and endocytosis of β2AR is primarily mediated by β-arrestin 2, not by β-arrestin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jean-Charles et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shenoy and Lefkowitz, 2011</xref>). AT<sub>1a</sub>R-mediated ERK signaling is eliminated by β-arrestin 2 KD in HEK 293 cells, while β-arrestin 1 KD augments ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Srivastava et al., 2015</xref>). Several studies have reported the controversial effects of β-arrestins in the endocytosis of Group I mGlu receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iacovelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suh et al., 2018</xref>). Constitutive endocytosis of mGlu1 was β-arrestin 1-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dale et al., 2001</xref>) or β-arrestin 1-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pula et al., 2004</xref>) in the heterologous cell populations. Agonist-induced mGlu1 endocytosis was β-arrestin 1- and 2-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mundell et al., 2001</xref>), or β-arrestin 1-dependent only under co-expression with GRKs in heterologous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dale et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, β-arrestin 1 does not seem to directly participate in agonist-induced mGlu1 endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iacovelli et al., 2003</xref>). Our current study showed that β-arrestin 1 and 2 exhibit functional redundancy for mGlu7, while β-arrestin 2 seems to have a lower binding affinity to mGlu7 than β-arrestin 1. Both β-arrestin 1 and 2 interact constitutively with mGlu7 and are recruited to mGlu7 by agonist stimulation. Although both β-arrestin 1 and 2 KD were required to diminish agonist-induced Nedd4 recruitment to mGlu7 in neurons, agonist-induced mGlu7 ubiquitination was reduced by either the loss of β-arrestin 1 or 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–N</xref>). It is unclear why the requirement for β-arrestins is different between Nedd4 recruitment to mGlu7 and agonist-induced mGlu7 ubiquitination. However, we postulate that β-arrestins may recruit isoform-specific ubiquitin E3 ligases other than Nedd4 in neurons.</p><p>Both β-arrestin 1 and 2 are required for constitutive endocytosis of mGlu7 in cultured hippocampal neurons. In addition, our study has demonstrated that β-arrestin 2 rather than β-arrestin 1 is involved in mGlu7-mediated ERK and JNK signaling in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In particular, Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination may be involved in ERK signaling rather than JNK signaling. In contrast, Iacovelli et al. has reported the opposite effect of β-arrestin 1 versus β-arrestin 2 on mGlu7-mediated signaling in HEK 293 cells. They showed that β-arrestin 1 increases or decreases agonist-induced ERK or JNK signaling, respectively, while β-arrestin 2 exerts the opposite effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iacovelli et al., 2014</xref>). This discrepancy may be caused by the difference in the expression system of primary neurons versus heterologous cells.</p><p>Ubiquitin modification is involved in the endocytosis, recycling, and degradation of transmembrane proteins. Upon ubiquitination, ligand-stimulated receptors on the plasma membrane are primarily degraded by the lysosome, whereas most of the ubiquitinated proteins in the cytoplasm are degraded by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foot et al., 2017</xref>). Our present study showed that ligand-induced surface mGlu7 degradation is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as well as the lysosomal degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It may be possible that ubiquitinated mGlu7 can be directly translocated to the proteasome or ubiquitinated β-arrestin-Nedd4 can guide mGlu7 as a complex to the proteasome for degradation. Similar to our results, it has been reported that proteasomal activity is required for ligand-induced degradation of the interleukin-2 receptor, platelet-derived growth factor β receptor, Met tyrosine kinase receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, growth hormone receptor, tropomyosin-regulated kinase A (TrkA) receptor, and AMPA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geetha and Wooten, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jeffers et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kesarwala et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin and Man, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mori et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Kerkhof et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu and Malek, 2001</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, β-arrestins and Nedd4 play pivotal roles in regulating mGlu7 ubiquitination, endocytosis, signaling, and stability in heterologous cells and neurons. These findings will offer novel mechanistic insights for developing selective drugs with therapeutic potentials for mGlu7-related neuropsychiatric disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pRK5-myc-mGlu7 WT</td><td>Dr. Katherine W.

Alexa Fluor 488 or 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell and primary neuron cultures</title><p>HEK 293 T cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 1% L-glutamine (Invitrogen). Primary hippocampal or cortical neurons were prepared from E18 Sprague-Dawley rats (Orient Bio, Seongnam, Korea) following the guidelines of the Seoul National University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol No. SNU-161222-2-2). Briefly, hippocampi or cortices from rat embryos were isolated and incubated in chopping solution [Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (Invitrogen), 10 mM HEPES (Sigma Aldrich), 0.11 mg/mL Deoxyribonuclease I (Sigma Aldrich), penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma Aldrich)] with 0.05% trypsin (Sigma Aldrich) for 12 min at 37°C. Hippocampi or cortices were washed three times with a cold chopping solution, and triturated 10–15 times with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. The dissociated neurons were plated on poly-D-lysine-coated dishes in serum-free Neurobasal media (Invitrogen) with B-27 supplement and L-glutamine, and maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Fresh medium was added every 2–3 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and surface biotinylation assay</title><p>HEK 293 T cells or cultured neurons were washed three times with ice-cold 1 X PBS and solubilized in TN lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)] with protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche) and 20 mM N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM, Sigma Aldrich). The insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatants were mixed with 6 X Laemmli sample buffer, boiled at 95°C for 5 min or incubated at 37°C for 20 min and subsequently at 80°C for 3 min. The samples were resolved with SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat skim milk in 1 X TBST (0.1% Tween 20) for 1 hr at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Following several washings, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The immunoreactive bands were detected with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For immunoprecipitation experiments, the lysates were pre-cleared with Sepharose 4B beads for 1 hr at 4°C. The pre-cleared supernatants were incubated with protein A- or G-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma Aldrich or Amersham) and with primary antibodies for 2–4 hr at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were then washed four times with lysis buffer and subjected to western blot analysis.</p><p>For the surface biotinylation assay, HEK 293 T cells or neurons were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) in 1 X PBS with 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> for 20 min at 4°C with gentle agitation. Remaining biotin was quenched by 50 mM glycine in 1 X PBS with 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The biotinylated samples were lysed and supernatant was then incubated with 20 µl of Neutravidin or Streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) for 2 hr at 4°C. After washing the beads four times with lysis buffer, the bound proteins were analyzed by western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Receptor internalization assay</title><p>The receptor internalization assay was performed as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, transfected neurons were incubated with 2 μg/ml anti-c-myc antibody for 10 min at room temperature to label surface-expressed receptors. The neurons were returned to the conditioned media containing 400 μM L-AP4 or vehicle at 37°C for 15 min to allow for the internalization of receptor-antibody complex. The neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose in 1 X PBS for 20 min and blocked with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) for 1 hr. Surface receptors were incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG. The neurons were then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min and blocked with 10% NGS for 1 hr. The internalized receptors were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG. The neurons were washed and mounted with ProLong Antifade Kit (Invitrogen). Z-stacked maximum projection images were obtained using a confocal laser microscope (Nikon A1). The amount of internalization was quantified using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The acquired images were separated into red (surface population remaining after internalization) and green (internalized population) channels. A region of interest (ROI) per single neuron was selected along with neurites in red channel, and the same ROI was copied to the green channel. The soma regions were excluded from ROI due to the saturation of signal intensity. The threshold was set to remove background and saturated signals from both channels. The integrated intensities (signal intensity summed over all pixels in the ROI) from each channel were obtained from the selected ROIs. The internalization rate was quantified as a ratio of green channel signal to total signals (red + green channel signals). The relative internalization rate was calculated as a ratio compared to the Ctl internalization rate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Virus production</title><p>For lentivirus production, FHUGW lentiviral vector was utilized.

For overexpression of Nedd4 WT, Nedd4 C867S, mGlu7 WT, or mGlu7 mutants in neurons, each cDNA was cloned under ubiquitin promoter after removal of EGFP in the FHUGW lentiviral vector. To produce lentiviral particles, HEK 293 T cells were co-transfected with lentiviral vector, Δ 8.9, and VSVG using X-tremeGENE (Roche). The medium was replaced by Neurobasal medium supplemented with 1% L-glutamine and Insulin-Transferrin-Sodium selenite (Sigma Aldrich).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Nathalie Sans (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examines the roles Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase and β-arrestins in regulating mGlu7 metabotropic receptor ubiquitination, trafficking and signaling. Using cell biological and biochemical approaches in heterologous cells and neurons, the authors demonstrate that modulating or interfering with the expression of Nedd4 or β-arrestins alters the internalization of mGlu7 and the agonist-induced MAPK signaling in neurons. The main findings provides a model in which Nedd4 and β-arrestin act together as a complex to regulate mGlu7 surface expression and in turn, modulate presynaptic function where mGlu7 is localized. The experiments have been mostly well executed, and the manuscript is written clearly. All three reviewers have acknowledged the importance of the overall findings. However, they have also pointed out some shortcomings with the present dataset in fully supporting the conclusions. For instance, many of the experiments exploring the properties of mGlu7, Nedd4 and β-arrestin interactions have been performed only in HEK293 cells. How mGlu7 in its native environment in neurons might behave remains to be further clarified, including the formation of the complex of mGlu7, Nedd4 and β-arrestin. Moreover, a conclusive demonstration that the effects of manipulating the expression of Nedd4 or β-arrestins on mGlu7 trafficking and signaling is mediated by mGlu7 ubiquitination is lacking. Altogether, the following major points require careful consideration.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The design of biotinylation experiments shown in Figure 1D needs reconsideration. The logic of stimulating the neurons prior to surface biotinylation does not make sense. It should be done the other way around, so that all surface receptors are biotinylated prior to stimulation.</p><p>2) The precise roles for Nedd4 and β-arrestins on mGlu7 turnover, including (a) the requirement for β-arrestin-1 and -2 in Nedd4 recruitment to mGlu7 and (b) the extent involvement of proteosomal and lysosomal degradation pathways for mGlu7, should be established in neurons.</p><p>3) The requirement for the direct interaction between mGlu7, β-arrestin and Nedd4 in neurons should be established directly by taking advantage of the mGlu7 C-terminal tail and the intracellular loop ubiquitination site mutants.</p><p>4) Do the different mutated mGlu7 constructs have different surface expression levels? What about their stability?</p><p>5) Please clarify the basis by which Nedd4 was selected and tested. Are there additional E3 ubiquitin ligases that can regulate mGlu7, and could the authors explain Figure 1F data that show some remaining level of mGlu7 ubiquitinylation despite the loss of Nedd4.</p><p>6) In Figure 1C or 1D, in addition to ubiquitin that is used for IP, mGlu7 IP should also be tested, and a negative control for Western blot should be included. Also, to show that Nedd4 and β-arrestin act together as a complex to regulate mGlu7, the authors need to show that the three proteins are present in the same complex.</p><p>7) The images of surface receptor expression in neurons are not convincing at all. The authors need better quality images for quantification. Why does one not see the typical punctate staining for surface expression of receptors on those images? The details of image analysis need to be included in the method section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Nedd4 E3 ligase and β-arrestins regulate ubiquitination, trafficking, and stability of the mGlu7 receptor&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>While the manuscript has been improved, some new experiments in neurons appear to show differences from HEK cells. Moreover, there are a number of remaining issues needing consideration, one of which (point 3) requires an additional experiment, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Figure 1D. Please show quantification.</p><p>2) Binding affinity of Nedd4 or β-arrestin 1 to different mGlu7 ubiquitination site is not altered in neurons. This suggests that ubiquitination of mGlu7 is not a prerequisite for the complex formation, and this point needs to be discussed.</p><p>3) Figure 3K-N. Panels K,L: The new experiment examining the effects of knocking-down β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 on Nedd4 and mGlu7 interaction in neurons is lacking controls. Because in HEK293 cells, either β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 knock-down alone without the agonist tends to promote the binding between Nedd4 and mGlu7, it is crucial to include controls without the agonist in β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, and β-arrestin 1/2 knock-down conditions as a reference. As it stands (without these controls) the data do not support the requirement for β-arrestins in the agonist-dependent binding of mGlu7 and Nedd4 (also in the Discussion section). Similarly, for Figure 3M and 3N, it is necessary to include non-stimulated controls to assess the levels of mGluR7 ubiquitination under basal conditions when β-arrestin1/2 are knocked-down.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44502.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examines the roles Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase and β-arrestins in regulating mGlu7 metabotropic receptor ubiquitination, trafficking and signaling.

This is because surface-expressed receptors can be internalized during the stimulation of neurons by the previous method. We have now performed the experiments as per the reviewer’s comment and found a similar yet more prominent result that the surface-expressed mGlu7 is ubiquitinated. We have replaced the previous Figure 1D with the new result in the revised manuscript. We appreciate the reviewer’s constructive suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The precise roles for Nedd4 and β-arrestins on mGlu7 turnover, including (a) the requirement for β-arrestin-1 and -2 in Nedd4 recruitment to mGlu7 and (b) the extent involvement of proteosomal and lysosomal degradation pathways for mGlu7, should be established in neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>To examine the requirement for β-arrestin 1 and 2 in Nedd4 recruitment to mGlu7 in neurons, we generated lentiviruses harboring β-arrestin 1 or 2 shRNA under H1 promoter. When β-arrestin 1 or 2 was knocked down in primary cortical neurons, agonist-induced Nedd4 recruitment to mGlu7 was not impaired. However, when both β-arrestin 1 and 2 were simultaneously knocked down, we observed a significant reduction of agonist-induced Nedd4 recruitment to mGlu7 (revised Figure 3K and 3L). This new finding is somewhat inconsistent with the result observed in heterologous cells in the original manuscript. We previously observed that either β-arrestin 1 or 2 knockdown (KD) efficiently reduced agonist-induced Nedd4 recruitment to mGlu7 in heterologous cells (Figure 3I and 3J in the revised manuscript). However, in neurons, we have now found that only the double KD of β-arrestin 1 and 2 abolishes agonist-induced Nedd4 binding to mGlu7 (revised Figure 3K and 3L). Endogenously expressed levels of β-arrestins are high in the brain, but relatively low in HEK 293T cells because only mGlu7 and Nedd4 were exogenously overexpressed in HEK 293T cells (Attramadal et al., 1992; Barlic et al., 1999). Therefore, we hypothesize that β-arrestin 1 and 2 may compensate for the function of each other in neurons due to their high expression but not in heterologous cells due to their stoichiometrically low expression.</p><p>Although both β-arrestin 1 and 2 KD were required to diminish agonist-induced Nedd4 recruitment to mGlu7 in neurons, agonist-induced mGlu7 ubiquitination was reduced by either the loss of β-arrestin 1 or 2 (Figure 3K–3N in the revised manuscript). It is unclear why the requirement for β-arrestins is different between Nedd4 recruitment to mGlu7 and agonist-induced mGlu7 ubiquitination. However, we postulate that β-arrestins may recruit isoform-specific ubiquitin E3 ligases other than Nedd4 in neurons.</p><p>We have included new data in Figures 3K and 3L, and the corresponding discussions in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>In addition, to determine the involvement of Nedd4 in mGlu7 stability in neurons, Nedd4 WT or Nedd4 C867S was expressed on cultured cortical neurons via lentivirus. We have now found that Nedd4 WT significantly reduces mGlu7 expression in neurons, whereas Nedd4 C867S does not. In addition, Nedd4 WT-mediated mGlu7 degradation is blocked by MG132 or leupeptin (revised Figure 7E and 7F). Thus, Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination is required for mGlu7 degradation, which is accomplished through the proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways in neurons.</p><p>We have included these new data in Figure 7E and 7F in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The requirement for the direct interaction between mGlu7, β-arrestin and Nedd4 in neurons should be established directly by taking advantage of the mGlu7 C-terminal tail and the intracellular loop ubiquitination site mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Figure 1G of the original manuscript, we provided evidence that endogenous mGlu7 and Nedd4 interact together in cortical neurons, and their binding is increased by agonist treatment. To investigate if endogenous mGlu7, Nedd4, and β-arrestin 1 are present at the same complex, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assay using anti-β-arrestin 1 antibody in cortical neurons. We have found that three proteins are present in the same complex and that their binding affinity is increased by agonist treatment (revised Figure 3G and 3H).</p><p>In addition, to test direct interactions among mGlu7 ubiquitination site mutants, Nedd4, and β-arrestin 1, we expressed mGlu7 WT, iL 4K4R, Ct 8K8R, or 12K12R on cultured cortical neurons via lentivirus-mediated transduction and performed co-immunoprecipitation assay using anti-myc antibody. Although we observed the three proteins in the same complex, we found that binding affinity of Nedd4 or β-arrestin 1 to different mGlu7 ubiquitination site mutants was not affected by the Lys to Arg mutations in mGlu7 (revised Figure 3—figure supplement 2). A similar result was previously observed in beta2-AR, in which the ability of the 0-Kβ2AR (lysine-less mutant) to interact with β-arrestin was not altered by the Lys to Arg mutations in beta2-AR (Figure 8A in Shenoy et al., 2001). Therefore, on the same grounds, we argue that the interaction among mGlu7, Nedd4, and β-arrestins appears to be unaffected by the mGlu7 mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Do the different mutated mGlu7 constructs have different surface expression levels? What about their stability?</p></disp-quote><p>We examined total and surface expression levels of mGlu7 WT, iL 4K4R, Ct 8K8R, 12K12R, Δ857, and Δ857/iL K688/689R mutants by surface biotinylation assay in cortical neurons following lentivirus-mediated transduction. We have observed that the relative surface expression (surface to total ratio) is increased in mGlu7 iL 4K4R, Δ857, and Δ857/iL K688/689R mutants. On the contrary, 8K8R or 12K12R mutant with mutations in mGlu7 cytoplasmic tail did not show an increase in relative surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The surface expression of different mGlu7 mutants can be complicated and unpredictable because of the following three reasons. First, because we were not able to specify any Lys residues essential for ubiquitination among the twelve Lys residues in mGlu7, post-translational modifications (PTMs) other than ubiquitination such as SUMOylation, acetylation, and neddylation can occur in the same Lys residues. Since different PTMs can affect surface expression of mGlu7 in opposite ways, it is difficult to evaluate surface expression of mGlu7 by ubiquitin modification solely with mGlu7 lysine mutants. For example, mGlu7 K889 residue can be SUMOylated and the deSUMOylated mGlu7 K889R mutant is robustly internalized (Choi et al., 2016). Second, the extensive point mutations in the cytoplasmic tail can alter the protein folding and conformation of mGlu7 and subsequently affect protein-protein interactions. Several interacting proteins and kinase/phosphatase that bind to the cytoplasmic tail of mGlu7 can regulate mGlu7 trafficking in the opposite ways (Suh et al., 2018). As the binding of interacting proteins and kinase/phosphatase can be altered in mGlu7 tail mutants, it is difficult to evaluate the effects of trafficking solely by ubiquitin modification. Third, different mutation constructs may possess different expression efficiency and protein kinetics. These may cause difficulties in evaluating surface expression and stability by a single timepoint experiment.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Surface expression levels of mGlu7 ubiquitination site mutants by cell surface biotinylation assay. mGlu7 WT, iL 4K4R, Ct 8K8R, 12K12R, Δ857, or Δ857/iL K688/689R mutants were expressed in cultured cortical neurons for 7 days via lentivirus-mediated transduction.</title><p>At DIV14, after cell surface biotinylation with membrane impermeable Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin, surface proteins were isolated by Streptavidin-agarose beads.

Rather, we would like to present two alternative approaches to assess the effects of ubiquitination on surface expression of mGlu7. First, we utilized Nedd4 WT and Nedd4 C867S, an E3 ubiquitin ligase mutant, to predict the effect of Nedd4-mediated ubiquitin modification on surface expression of mGlu7 as shown in Figure 5A and 5B in the revised manuscript. Next, to determine if ubiquitin modification regulates endocytosis of endogenous mGlu7, we have now utilized MLN7243, a cell-permeable small-molecule inhibitor of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UAE, also known as E1 enzyme). When we treated cultured cortical neurons with MLN7243, we found that surface expression of endogenous mGlu7 is increased while mGlu7 ubiquitination is reduced (revised Figure 5–figure supplement 1). Thus, we suggest that Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination induces mGlu7 internalization from the surface plasma membrane of neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please clarify the basis by which Nedd4 was selected and tested. Are there additional E3 ubiquitin ligases that can regulate mGlu7, and could the authors explain Figure 1F data that show some remaining level of mGlu7 ubiquitinylation despite the loss of Nedd4.</p></disp-quote><p>At the beginning of our study, we observed that K63-linked ubiquitination is involved in mGlu7 ubiquitination. Hence, we searched for E3 ligase candidates that mediate K63-linked ubiquitination and are known to be expressed in neuronal synapses. Nedd4 and Mdm2 E3 ligases were the best candidates to meet these conditions. We tested these ligases and found that Nedd4 but not Mdm2 is involved in mGlu7 ubiquitination.</p><p>We absolutely agree with the possibility that other E3 ligases for mGlu7 ubiquitination may be present. Nedd4-2, a close relative of Nedd4, may be a good candidate. We have a plan to screen a number of E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in subsequent work.</p><p>We have included the reviewer’s comment in Discussion section of the revised manuscript as follows: “Of note, we observed some remaining levels of mGlu7 ubiquitination despite the loss of Nedd4 in Figure 1F. This result suggests that other E3 ligases than Nedd4 may play a role in mGlu7 ubiquitination in neurons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 1C or 1D, in addition to ubiquitin that is used for IP, mGlu7 IP should also be tested, and a negative control for Western blot should be included. Also, to show that Nedd4 and β-arrestin act together as a complex to regulate mGlu7, the authors need to show that the three proteins are present in the same complex.</p></disp-quote><p>Conversely, we have now examined the ubiquitination of mGlu7 following mGlu7 IP. GFP IP was used as a negative control. We have detected ubiquitinated bands of endogenous mGlu7 and included this result in revised Figure 1–figure supplement 1. In addition, we have added a result that shows that endogenous mGlu7, Nedd4, and β-arrestin 1 are present in the same complex in cortical neurons (revised Figure 3G and 3H). This was done via co-IP assay using rabbit anti-β-arrestin 1 antibody, or rabbit anti-GFP antibody as a negative control.</p><p>We have included these data in Figure 1–figure supplement 1, and Figure 3G and 3H in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The images of surface receptor expression in neurons are not convincing at all. The authors need better quality images for quantification. Why does one not see the typical punctate staining for surface expression of receptors on those images? The details of image analysis need to be included in the method section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now replaced some old images in Figure 5 with new ones (Figure 5A, Figure 5E vec, and Figure 5E β-arr1) in the revised manuscript. The image quality deteriorated while converting the figure to DOC file. We have now improved resolution of images and presented better quality images in the revised Figure 5. We are sorry for this inconvenience. In addition, because of the lack of good mGlu7 antibodies that can recognize the extracellular N-terminus of mGlu7 and label surface-expressed endogenous mGlu7, we utilized anti-myc epitope antibody following the overexpression of extracellular myc epitope-tagged mGlu7 in neurons. For this reason, a typical punctate staining pattern may be not observed. We believe that this is the limit of our antibody uptake receptor internalization assay.</p><p>The amount of internalization was quantified using MetaMorph software as per manufacturer’s instructions. Z-stacked maximum projection images were obtained, and the images were separated into red (surface population remaining after internalization) and green (internalized population) channels. A region of interest (ROI) per single neuron was selected along with neurites in red channel, and the same ROI was copied to the green channel. The soma regions were excluded from ROI due to the saturation of signal intensity. The threshold was set to remove background and saturated signals from both channels. The integrated intensities (signal intensity summed over all pixels in the ROI) from each channel were obtained from the selected ROIs. The internalization rate was quantified as a ratio of green channel signal to total signals (red + green channel signals). The relative internalization rate was calculated as a ratio compared to the WT internalization rate. We have included these details of image analysis in the Materials and methods section in the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Figure 1D.

This suggests that ubiquitination of mGlu7 is not a prerequisite for the complex formation, and this point needs to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the following sentences in Discussion section in the revised manuscript: “Although we observed β-arrestins and Nedd4 bind constitutively to mGlu7, binding affinity of Nedd4 or β-arrestin 1 to mGlu7 is not affected by ubiquitination site mutations in neurons (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). This result suggests that mGlu7 ubiquitination per se is not a prerequisite for the complex formation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3K-N. Panels K,L: The new experiment examining the effects of knocking-down β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 on Nedd4 and mGlu7 interaction in neurons is lacking controls. Because in HEK293 cells, either β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 knock-down alone without the agonist tends to promote the binding between Nedd4 and mGlu7, it is crucial to include controls without the agonist in β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, and β-arrestin 1/2 knock-down conditions as a reference. As it stands (without these controls) the data do not support the requirement for β-arrestins in the agonist-dependent binding of mGlu7 and Nedd4 (also in the Discussion section). Similarly, for Figure 3M and 3N, it is necessary to include non-stimulated controls to assess the levels of mGluR7 ubiquitination under basal conditions when β-arrestin1/2 are knocked-down.</p></disp-quote><p>In our HEK 293T cell experiments, we were NOT able to observe that binding affinity of Nedd4 to mGlu7 is constitutively increased by either β-arrestin 1 knockdown (KD) or β-arrestin 2 KD in the absence of agonist stimulation. There was no significant difference between their bindings without the agonist. To clarify this point, we have replaced Figure 3J with a graph showing the statistical difference of each lane (revised Figure 3J).</p><p>To show basal (constitutive) interactions between Nedd4 and mGlu7 in the absence of agonist stimulation in neurons, we have performed co-immunoprecipitation assay including samples without the agonist in non-related target control KD and β-arrestin 1/2 KD conditions in neurons. We observed that in the absence of agonist stimulation, the interaction between Nedd4 and mGlu7 is not significantly affected by β-arrestin 1/2 KD, whereas in the presence of the agonist, their binding is increased in control KD but not by β-arrestin 1/2 KD (revised Figure 3—figure supplement 3). In addition, for Figure 3M and 3N, we have performed experiments including basal conditions in both control KD and β-arrestin1/2 KD. We have found that ubiquitination levels of mGlu7 are not different between control KD and β-arrestin1/2 KD in non-stimulated conditions, whereas mGlu7 ubiquitination is increased in control KD with the agonist but not by β-arrestin 1/2 KD (revise Figure 3—figure supplement 4).</p></body></sub-article></article>
