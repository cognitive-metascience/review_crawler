navigation. In this network, the periodic firing fields of grid cells act as a metric element for position. The location of the grid firing fields depends on interactions between self-motion information, geometrical properties of the environment and nonmetric contextual cues. Here, we test whether visual information, including nonmetric contextual cues, also regulates the firing rate of MEC neurons. Removal of visual landmarks caused a profound impairment in grid cell periodicity. Moreover, the speed code of MEC neurons changed in darkness and the activity of border cells became less confined to environmental boundaries. Half of the MEC neurons changed their firing rate in darkness. Manipulations of nonmetric visual cues that left the boundaries of a 1D environment in place caused rate changes in grid cells. These findings reveal context specificity in the rate code of MEC neurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16937.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16937.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>grid cell</kwd><kwd>medial entorhinal cortex</kwd><kwd>navigation</kwd><kwd>path integration</kwd><kwd>speed cells</kwd><kwd>border cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AL 1730/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB-1134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The firing rate of MEC neurons conveys information about visual landmarks.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Grid cells of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) fire at several locations organized as a grid of equilateral triangles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>). The repetitive nature of the firing fields suggests that grid cells are an important metric element of a neuronal system involved in spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McNaughton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>). To keep track of the animal’s position during locomotion, grid cells appear to rely on self-motion cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, computational models suggest that grid cells integrate heading direction and traveled distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuhs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McNaughton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burak and Fiete, 2009</xref>). The directional component likely depends on inputs from head-direction cells found in several subcortical and cortical areas, including the MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taube et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Valerio and Taube, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winter et al., 2015</xref>). Traveled distance, on the other hand, could be estimated from the firing rate of speed cells located in the MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kropff et al., 2015</xref>). As expected from an internal speedometer, the increase of the firing rate of speed cells as a function of running velocity is preserved across different environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kropff et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Without corrections based on external inputs, intrinsic noise in neuronal networks causes an accumulation of error in the internal estimation of position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burak and Fiete, 2009</xref>). A mechanism is therefore needed to prevent the position estimate from rapidly deviating from the actual location of the animal. External landmarks, including the borders of the enclosure, serve this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Knierim et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Skaggs et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evans et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hardcastle et al., 2015</xref>). The influence of landmarks on grid cell activity is illustrated by cue control experiments in which the rotation of a single polarizing visual landmark causes an equivalent reorientation of the grid pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>), and by the reduced spatial selectivity of grid cells in darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, compression of a familiar rectangular environment along one axis can lead to a contraction of the grid pattern in the same axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>) and grid orientation aligns to the environment borders with a small but constant offset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krupic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stensola et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, there is also evidence that the color and odor of an enclosure can affect the positioning of the grid fields but not the grid orientation or the firing rate of the neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marozzi et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, visual landmarks within an environment prevent error accumulation in grid cell networks and anchor the grid fields to the environment.</p><p>Whether visual landmarks influence the activity of MEC neurons beyond anchoring the firing fields of grid cells is not known. On one hand, the role of visual information could be limited to ensuring long-term stability of the MEC spatial representations. In this scenario, the firing rate of MEC neurons would be context-invariant and remain unchanged by manipulations of visual landmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fyhn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kropff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marozzi et al., 2015</xref>). Alternatively, visual information could have a broader impact on the MEC network. For example, the firing rate and speed code of MEC neurons could be affected by visual inputs. In addition, nonmetric contextual information, which is independent from the shape and orientation of an enclosure, could be encoded in the firing activity of MEC neurons. We set out to test these two alternative views by recording the activity of MEC neurons in mice running in environments where access to visual landmarks was manipulated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We first performed recordings from the MEC in mice exploring an elevated circular arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, data available from the Dryad Digital Repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.c261c">http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.c261c</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pérez-Escobar et al., 2016</xref>). The only potential sources of visible light were 4 identical LED panels located around the arena. Recording sessions included a sequence of 60 2-min trials, alternating between light and dark trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). On most recording sessions, 2 different light panels were used (l1 and l2) with a 90° or 180° angle between them. Dark trials following l1 and l2 trials were referred to as d1 and d2 trials, respectively. Histological examination showed that most recording sites were in the MEC (75.51%, 37 out of 49) or at the transition between the MEC and the parasubiculum (12.24%, 6 out of 49) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Another 12.24% (6 out of 49) of the recording sites were in the parasubiculum. Of the tetrode tracks in the MEC, 86.49% had reached layer II by the last recording session. A total of 880 neurons were recorded in 8 mice (89 recording sessions).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16937.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Recording protocol and cue control of MEC spatial representations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the recording apparatus.

Surprisingly, the periodic firing was not visible in most rate maps of dark trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Trials were divided into 12 10-s blocks. The block firing maps were correlated to the complete l1 maps to obtain a measure of map similarity relative to l1 trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). During d1 trials, map similarity was initially high and decreased during the first 30 s (paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, <italic>n</italic> = 132, b1-b2: p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>, b2-b3: p=0.00053). Block 3 was not different from block 4 (p=0.17). This indicates that the stable periodic pattern was only present during the first 30 s in darkness. Similar conclusions were reached when using the spike distance metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hardcastle et al., 2015</xref>) to quantify the accumulation of error in grid cell spikes during d1 trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, when the l1 LED panel was turned back on, map similarity during the first 10 s was lower than during the subsequent l1 block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, p&lt;10<sup>−15</sup>). Thus, the reinstatement of the grid pattern by visual stimuli occurred over the course of several seconds.</p><p>Pairs of grid cells with a similar spacing exhibit very stable firing associations; cells that fire together in one environment also fire together in a different environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fyhn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore tested if the firing associations between grid cells were maintained even when the grid patterns were not stable. The instantaneous firing rate of grid cells was calculated (time window: 100 ms, gaussian smoothing kernel s.d: 100 ms) and the correlation coefficients between instantaneous firing rate vectors served as a measure of firing rate association. As expected, firing rate associations for pairs of grid cells were stable from l1 to l2 trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, Pearson correlation of firing rate associations in l1 and l2 trials, <italic>n</italic> = 186 grid cell pairs, <italic>r</italic> = 0.968, p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>).

In these maps, each spike in turn served as a reference spike and the position of the animal in the 10 s following a reference spike was shifted so that the position of the animal at the time of the reference spike was (0,0). Spike-triggered maps of grid cells during light trials often showed a central field surrounded by 6 fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

There were 3 lighting conditions (l1, l2 and d). In l1, a single row of 48 LEDs on one wall was turned on. In l2, 4 rows of 12 LEDs located on the opposite wall were turned on. In d, all LEDs were turned off. The condition was changed randomly every 5th run. Thus, the only difference between l1 and l2 conditions was the LED pattern that was turned on and the geometry of the apparatus remained unchanged.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16937.013</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Nonmetric contextual visual cues affect firing rates of MEC neurons in a 1D environment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the linear track and side walls.

We recorded 138 grid cells, 28 border cells and 133 irregular spatially selective cells on the track. Linear firing rate maps were calculated for the 3 lighting conditions, plotting the maps with different running direction separately. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> shows examples of spatially selective neurons with clear firing rate changes between the 3 conditions (l1, l2 and d).</p><p>A quantitative analysis of the linear firing rate maps was performed, including only grid cells, border cells and irregular spatially selective cells. Spatial information scores were not significantly different between l1 and l2 conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, <italic>n</italic> = 299 neurons, <italic>v</italic> = 21632, p=0.60), but were lower in darkness (l1 vs d, <italic>v</italic> = 34469, p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>). For most neurons, the location of the firing fields appeared to be preserved across the 3 conditions. Indeed, the median correlation coefficient between linear rate maps of l1 and l2 was 0.92 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). The correlation coefficients were slightly lower between l1 and d (median: 0.81, paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, l1-l2 vs l1-d r values: <italic>v</italic> = 31909, p=10<sup>−10</sup>). Thus, there was no major reorganization of the firing fields between conditions.</p><p>To identify neurons with significant firing rate changes between conditions, a shuffling procedure in which the identity of the conditions was reassigned randomly 500 times was used to obtain chance levels for rate differences. The difference observed at each bin of the linear rate maps was compared to those of the surrogate distribution. Neurons with more than 5 bins in which the observed difference had a probability below 0.01 were considered significant. Approximately half of all recorded neurons showed significant changes between l1 and l2 conditions (245 out of 479, 51.1%). The proportion of neurons with significant rate changes was the same across all functionally defined cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, λ<sup>2</sup> = 9.259, <italic>df</italic> = 5, p=0.10). When considering only neurons recorded from MEC tetrodes, 35.3% (24 out of 68) of the neurons showed significant differences between l1 and l2 conditions. The percentage of neurons with significant rate changes between l1 and d conditions was 70.8% (339 out of 479) when considering all recorded neurons and 50% (34 out of 68) when limiting the analysis to neurons recorded from MEC tetrodes. These results demonstrate that the firing rate of MEC neurons along the linear track conveys information about distinct nonmetric contextual cues.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study aimed at establishing the contribution of visual landmarks to the firing of spatially selective neurons in the MEC. The principal results indicate that visual information 1) prevents a rapid destabilization of the grid cell firing pattern, 2) changes the speed code of MEC neurons, and 3) modulates the firing rate of neurons of all principal MEC cell types.</p><p>We found that during dark trials the periodic pattern of grid cells rapidly became unstable. This instability was greater than previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, our analysis indicates that instability in the grid pattern was detectable within the first few seconds in darkness. Several factors could contribute to this grid instability. First, the circular arena had no wall in the current experiment. This eliminates a potential source of uncontrolled olfactory or tactile cues that the animal can use to anchor its spatial representation in darkness. Second, two polarizing LED panels were used during the recording sessions and repeatedly caused reorientations of the MEC spatial representations. The spatial relationships between the grid pattern and uncontrolled external cues were therefore not stable over time. This might have reduced the contribution of uncontrolled external cues to the anchoring of MEC spatial representations during dark trials. Third, it has also been suggested that border cells reset cumulative error in the grid cell network when an animal encounters a boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hardcastle et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the altered spatial representation by border cells in darkness might have contributed to grid cell instability. Our findings indicate that in environments deprived of salient landmarks, error in the estimation of position by grid cells accumulates faster than previously thought.</p><p>A population of MEC neurons encodes the running speed of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kropff et al., 2015</xref>). It is thought that this speed code in the MEC remains unchanged across different contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kropff et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings, instead, point to an important contribution of visual cues, and perhaps optic flow, to the speed code, as most speed-modulated neurons had a lower firing rate in darkness. Speed-modulated neurons included high firing rate interneurons but also a significant proportion of grid cells and other spatially selective neurons. GABAergic neurons expressing parvalbumin were more likely to have high speed scores compared to other MEC neurons. The analysis of functional connections onto these GABAergic neurons indicated that cells pre-synaptic to speed cells decreased their firing rate during dark trials, providing a simple explanation for the reduction in firing rate of GABAergic speed cells. As speed-modulated neurons have been observed in several brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McNaughton et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saleem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bender et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuhrmann et al., 2015</xref>), it will be important to establish which pathways are required for the speed modulation of MEC neurons and whether these afferent speed signals are also modulated by visual landmarks.</p><p>We found that a significant proportion of MEC neurons changed their firing rate when visual landmarks were eliminated. This demonstrates that the level of activity in the MEC network during navigation is not constant but varies depending on the visual cues present in an environment. Although cells of all functionally defined cell types responded to light, border cells appear especially sensitive to manipulation of visual inputs. An important cortical afferent carrying visual information to the MEC originates in the postrhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burwell and Amaral, 1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">1998b</xref>) and has a depolarizing effect on principal neurons of the MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koganezawa et al., 2015</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that this projection is more active when visual landmarks are present. This could explain why the firing rate of MEC neurons was generally lower in darkness.</p><p>We found that approximately half of the recorded grid cells changed their firing rate during 1D navigation depending on nonmetric contextual cues. This demonstrates that the rate code of grid cells in 1D environments is context specific. It has recently been proposed that grid cells in rats trained to perform a conditional discrimination task can encode object information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keene et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings complement this study by showing that changes in firing rate caused by contextual information do not strictly depend on the behavioral demands of the task. Indeed, on the linear track the mice did not have to change their behavior following contextual changes. Inclusion of contextual information in the rate code of grid cells might take place continuously during 1D navigation. The rate change of MEC neurons associated with distinct contexts on the linear track is in agreement with Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity changes observed in MEC Reelin<sup>+</sup> cells following exploration of different enclosures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kitamura et al., 2015</xref>). The results of the current study reveal the functional cell types of the context-specific neurons.</p><p>The mechanisms behind the rate changes of grid cells during 1D navigation or memory tasks are still not clear. One hypothesis is that the location of the grid fields remains stable but that visual inputs onto grid cells alter their in-field firing rates. Such rate changes within stable fields have already been observed in hippocampal place cells during 2D navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leutgeb et al., 2005</xref>) or during different memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lipton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferbinteanu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ainge et al., 2012</xref>). An alternative hypothesis is that the rate changes reflect a shift in the location of the grid firing fields caused by the nonmetric contextual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marozzi et al., 2015</xref>). If one considers 1D firing maps on the track as slices through the 2D map of the neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoon et al., 2016</xref>), the 1D maps of grid cells in two contexts on the linear track could be considered as slices with different phases or orientations. It is also possible that the contextual cues affect the periodicity of the underlying 2D grid lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krupic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stensola et al., 2015</xref>). Both hypotheses remain plausible at this time, but the high correlations between the linear firing rate maps in the two contexts indicate that the change of field location was minimal. Regardless of the precise mechanisms, the outcome is that the rate code of grid cells along 1D paths is context dependent. Since navigation in the real world is often confined to preexisting paths, the firing rate of grid cells in these conditions provides information not only about the position of the animal but also about the visual cues encountered along the path.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>All experiments were carried out in 3–6 month-old male wild type C57BL/6 mice and were approved by the Governmental Supervisory Panel on Animal Experiments of Baden-Württemberg in Karlsruhe (35–9185.81/G-50/14).

The cage floor was covered with 2 cm of saw dust and 1–2 facial tissues were placed in the cage. Mice were implanted with 4 movable tetrodes in each hemisphere. The tetrodes were constructed from 4 12 µm-diameter tungsten wires (California Fine Wire Company, Grover Beach, California) and held in a microdrive assembly that allowed them to be moved individually. Before implantation, tetrodes were gold plated to reduce their impedance to 300–500 kΩ.</p><p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1–3%) and placed into a stereotaxic apparatus. The skull was exposed and four anchor screws were inserted into the skull. Two screws located above the cerebellum served as ground and reference signals.

Action potentials were detected off-line from the bandpass-filtered signal (800–5000 Hz). Waveform parameters were obtained from a principal component analysis and clusters of spikes were automatically generated using Klustakwik. Spike clusters were refined manually with a graphical interface program. Cluster separation quality was assessed from the spike-time autocorrelation and isolation distance. A refractory period ratio was calculated from the spike-time autocorrelation (from 0 to 25 ms, bin size: 0.5 ms). The mean number of spikes from 0 to 1.5 ms was divided by the maximum number of spikes in any bin between 5 and 25 ms. Clusters with a refractory period ratio larger than 0.125 were not kept.

The square box was filled with water up to 3 cm to prevent the animal from getting off the circular arena. The recording environment was surrounded by opaque black curtains. On every side of the box, a LED panel provided a polarizing cue to the animal (90° angle between the lights). The light panels consisted of black aluminum sheets (46 cm × 33 cm) with two horizontal LED strips (45 cm long, 25 cm apart from each other; color temperature: 3000 K, Ribbon Slim Top, Ledxon Group, powered by 6 1.2 V batteries). These light panels were the only potential source of visible light in the recording environment. An audio speaker located directly above the arena emitted a white noise, overshadowing uncontrolled auditory cues.</p><p>After initial training, the mouse was transported from the holding room to the recording room in an opaque circular container (15 cm diameter) and underwent a disorientation procedure in which the container was spun 5 times in clockwise and 5 times in counterclockwise direction (approximately 1 rotation/s). The mouse was connected to the recording system outside of the curtains, and it was carried within the holding box into the enclosure and placed on the arena. After closing the curtains around the apparatus, the recording started and the experimenter left the room for the duration of the recording session. The mouse had no prior experience of the recording room before the first recording session.</p><p>The light panels were controlled by a microcontroller (Arduino Uno) via a 4 channel relay module. For each recording session, two of the four light panels were chosen randomly and only these two lights were used during the recording session (referred to as l1 and l2). The location of l1 and l2 varied randomly across days in the same animal. A session started with a baseline of 10 min with l1 turned on, followed by 2 min in darkness and a series of 60 2-min trials, alternating between light and dark trials. Only one light was switched on during a given light trial, and the order of presentation of the two lights was random. At the end of the light-dark trial sequence, an additional baseline of 10 min with l2 turned on was performed. The experimenter entered the recording room, the mouse was removed from the recording environment and the tetrodes were lowered by approximately 25–50 µm.

For each field, the proportion of the pixels along the periphery that were also part of the field was calculated. CM was defined as the maximum proportion obtained over all possible fields.

Significance level was obtained with the same shuffling procedure as for information and grid scores. Border cells were defined as cells with a significant border score during both baselines or during one baseline and l2 trials.</p><p>As most border cells in a circular environment cover only a section of the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Solstad et al., 2008</xref>), we also calculated a polarity score for each map. For each pixel of the map, a vector was created. Its direction was that of the pixel relative to the center of the map and its length was set to the firing rate in that pixel. The map polarity score was defined as the length of the resulting vector after summing individual vectors and normalizing the length by the sum of the firing rate of all pixels in the map.</p><p>Irregular spatially selective cells were neurons that were not classified as grid or border cells and that had a significant spatial information score during both baselines or during one baseline and l2 trials.</p><p>Head-direction cells were identified by constructing a histogram with the firing rate of a neuron as a function of head direction (10° per bin). The mean vector length of the histogram was used as a measure of head-direction selectivity. A null distribution of mean vector length was obtained by shifting the head-direction data by at least 20 s before recalculating the mean vector length. This shuffling procedure was repeated 100 times for each neuron and the 95th percentile of the surrogate distribution served as significance level. Head direction cells had a significant vector length and a peak firing rate above 5 Hz during both baselines or during one baseline and l2 trials.</p><p>To identify speed-modulated cells, the instantaneous firing rate of the neurons was calculated. The number of spikes in 1 ms time windows was counted and a convolution between this spike count array and a Gaussian kernel (s.d = 100 ms) was performed. The resulting vector was integrated over 100 ms time windows. Periods during which the mice ran slower than 3 cm/s were removed from the analysis. Running speed was estimated every 20 ms. A speed score was defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the instantaneous firing rate and the running speed of the animal. Chance levels were obtained with a shuffling procedure (<italic>n</italic> = 100) in which the speed vector was shifted by at least 20 s before calculating speed scores. To be considered a speed-modulated cell, the neuron had to have a speed score above the 95th percentile of the surrogate distribution during both baselines or during one baseline and l2 trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Stability of firing rate maps</title><p>To assess the stability of the spatial firing patterns during dark trials, we divided d1 trials into 12 blocks of 10 s. Maps were constructed for the 12 blocks, concatenating homologous blocks across trials of a given condition. The stability of the map in each block was obtained by calculating the correlation coefficient between the block-specific firing map and the map containing all 120-s l1 trials. As controls, the l1 trials were also divided into 12 blocks and the maps observed during each block were compared to the maps containing all 120-s l1 trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Spike distance metric</title><p>Error accumulation in the spikes of grid cells was estimated by the spike distance metric (SDM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hardcastle et al., 2015</xref>). For each cell, a firing rate map was constructed using the first 60 s of l1 trials. A firing field was defined as an area of at least 20 cm<sup>2</sup> in which each bin had a firing rate above the 75th percentile of the rate distribution of all bins in the map. The center of mass of each firing field was calculated. The radius of a firing field was equal to the radius of a circle with an area equal to that of the firing field. For each spike, the distance of the animal location at the time of the spike to the closest firing field center of mass was calculated. SDM was this distance divided by the mean radius of all detected fields in the firing rate map. SDM was calculated for spikes fired in the last 60 s of l1 trials and the entire d1 trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Distance coding by grid cells</title><p>Spike-triggered firing rate maps were constructed by taking each spike of a neuron as a reference spike and considering only data of the next 10 s. The position data within each time window were shifted so that the reference spike was aligned to position (0,0). The space surrounding the reference spikes was divided into 2 × 2 cm bins and both the occupancy maps and the resulting spike-triggered firing rate maps were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (s.d = 2 cm). To obtain a distance tuning curve, the bins of the spike-triggered firing rate map were used to calculate the mean firing rate as a function of distance from the reference spikes. The distance was normalized by dividing it by the spacing of the grid cell measured during the first baseline of the recording session. A distance score was defined as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> indicates the firing rate of a neuron at a given normalized distance. Chance levels for distance scores were obtained by shifting the spike trains by at least 20 s relative to the position data before recalculating the scores. Only grid cells with a spacing shorter than 50 cm were used in the distance analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Detection of putative excitatory connections based on spike-time crosscorrelations</title><p>Putative excitatory connections were detected as narrow peaks in the spike-time crosscorrelations of simultaneously recorded neurons (from −50 to 50 ms, bin size = 0.5 ms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Csicsvari et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marshall et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maurer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mizuseki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Latuske et al., 2015</xref>). The crosscorrelations of all pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons were constructed. Crosscorrelations containing fewer than 300 spikes were excluded from the analysis. The bins from −10 to 0 ms and from 10 to 50 ms served to calculate baseline mean and s.d. A peak at short latency in a crosscorrelation was defined as at least one bin between 0.5 and 4 ms that was above 6 s.d. from the baseline mean. A pair of cells was not considered if the baseline was not stable, i.e. if a bin between −10 and 0 ms or between 10 and 50 ms exceeded 75% of the short latency peak.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Linear track experiment</title><p>A second cohort of mice were trained to run on a linear track. The linear track (80 × 5.4 cm) was made of wood and painted gray. The walls along the long axis of the maze were 1 cm high, except for the last 6.5 cm at the two extremities where the walls were 3 cm high. The walls of the short axis of the track were 16 cm high. A food well and an infrared beam were located 2 and 5 cm away from both ends of the track, respectively. Breaking the beam triggered the release of a food pellet at the opposite end of the track. Two gray walls (80 cm long × 28 cm high) were located 25 cm away from the long edges of the linear track. A single row of 48 LEDs (80 cm long) was attached to one of the side wall. On the opposite wall, 4 rows of 12 LEDs (20 cm long) were attached, aligned to one end of the track. The LEDs were the only potential source of visible light in the recording environment when the mouse ran on the linear track.</p><p>After initial training (see above), the mice were trained on the linear track 3 times a day for 10 min. During the first 2 days, food pellets were placed randomly on the track during training. The pellets were progressively moved away from the center of the maze over the next 2 days. Thereafter, pellets were only delivered upon infrared beam breaks. The recording cable was connected to the mouse during the subsequent training sessions (15 min) and training continued until the mouse performed approximately 40–55 runs within 15 min.</p><p>Recording sessions with the linear track started with 20 min of exploration in a 70 × 70 cm open field with normal light illumination, followed by 20 min in a rest box (25 × 25 cm). The recording session continued with 3 20-min trials on the linear track separated by 20-min trials in the rest box. There were 3 lighting conditions (l1, l2 and d) on the linear track. The order of presentation was random and the condition changed every 5th run on the track. In l1, the single row of LEDs was turned on. There was no other visible light source in the room. In l2, the 4 rows of LEDs were turned on instead of the single LED row. In d, all LEDs were turned off. Only recording sessions with at least 20 blocks of 5 runs on the track were considered for analysis.</p><p>Identification of spatially selective neurons in mice trained on the linear track was performed using the data from the square open field. The 95th percentiles of the surrogate distributions served as significance levels for each spatial score.

The reviewers found much merit with the study but also had a large number of specific concerns that can be addressed with additional analyses and explanation.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The analysis of grid cells in the dark period could be expanded. Does the grid map remain rigid in the dark period, but drift in its orientation and phase? A previous paper looked at grid cell error accumulation as a function of distance from the boundaries of the environment, and also assessed whether grid fields were drifting by looking at error spikes, i.e. spikes that occurred outside of pre-defined firing fields (Hardcastle et al., 2015). Can the authors perform a similar analysis in their dark period data and report the rate at which error accumulates in their conditions?</italic> </p><p>We have now used the spike distance metric (SDM) developed by Hardcastle and coworkers to estimate the rate of error accumulation in the firing activity of grid cells during dark trials. SDM increases rapidly at the beginning of dark trials. These results are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We have expanded the section on the firing of grid cells in darkness. An analysis of the firing rate associations between pairs of grid cells (correlation of instantaneous firing rate vectors) during light and dark trials was added. The firing associations were highly correlated between l1 and d1 trials (r = 0.926). This indicates that the firing associations of grid cells are largely conserved despite the loss in spatial stability in darkness. This result is now part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>The analysis of spike-triggered firing rate maps demonstrates that the modulation of firing by traveled distance in grid cells is impaired but above chance levels in darkness over periods shorter than 10 s. This suggests that the phase drift during a 10 s time window is sufficient to affect distance coding. We have now added a figure in the manuscript showing that the head-direction preference of head direction cells is strongly reduced during dark trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the grid pattern might still be present but drifts rapidly in phase and orientation in darkness.</p><p><italic>2) How much this result is influenced by the regular alternation of the cue location? Is it possible that this reduces the stability of the grid network by regularly introducing large error signals?</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting question. The instability in darkness was much larger than that observed in Hafting et al. (2005, Nature) or than that in a previous experiment from our group (Allen et al., 2015, Journal of Neuroscience). Many factors are possibly involved. For example, the circular arena in the current experiment had no wall. This likely removed a potential source of polarizing cues from the environment. In addition, using two light cues located at 90 or 180 degrees to each other can have at least 2 effects. As pointed out by the reviewer, it might generate large error signals when the light is switched back on after a dark trial and this might affect how the animal anchors its internal representation to the external world. A second consequence of having 2 lights is that uncontrolled cues left on the arena by the animal do not have a stable position within the internal representation of the animal. It is possible that these local cues normally contribute to the spatial stability of the grid network in darkness and that using two different lights reduces their contribution.</p><p>The laboratory of Tom Wills and Francesca Cacucci presented a poster at the iNav 2016 meeting in Austria in which they reported that grid cells periodicity in mice was disrupted in darkness. Their recording protocol did not involve any cue rotation. This suggests that the reduction of grid periodicity in darkness is not only due to the use of 2 alternating lights.</p><p><italic>3) Different parts of the MEC differ in terms of their anatomical inputs from visual regions. Did the influence of visual cues vary with tetrode depth, or grid scale?</italic> </p><p>We have tested this by calculating the correlation between grid spacing and the magnitude of the firing rate change between light and dark trials. The correlation was not significant (n = 132 grid cells, r = 0.073, p = 0.407).</p><p>It should be noted that the tetrodes were targeted to the most dorsal part of the MEC. It remains possible that the effect of visual landmarks on the firing of grid cells varies with tetrode depth but that recordings from more ventral regions are required to observe the effect.</p><p>We did not include the correlation analysis in the manuscript because of this potential caveat. If the reviewers think that this result should be added to the manuscript, we will do so upon request.</p><p><italic>4) Please show histology for all mice. Do the results differ at all if only recording sites within the MEC are kept?</italic> </p><p>We have added source data files that contain the histological results of 12 mice. The brain of one mouse trained on the circular arena could not be recovered at the end of the experiment. All brain sections containing tetrode tracks are shown. In addition, we added two tables indicating the tetrode locations in each mouse.</p><p>As the four tetrodes implanted in each hemisphere were often very close to each other, we prefer not to assign the recorded signals to specific tetrode tips. Only tetrodes implanted in a hemisphere in which all tetrode tips were in the MEC were labeled as “MEC tetrodes”.</p><p>We now report that the differences in grid score, information score, speed score, borderness (DM), map polarity, head-direction vector length, and firing rate between l1 and d1 trials are still observed when considering only neurons recorded on MEC tetrodes.</p><p><italic>5) Including grid cells with grid score &gt; 0.5 during l1 and l2 trials will artificially inflate the decrease in grid score during dark trials. The authors should exclude these cells unless they also passed threshold during both baseline periods.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that using the data from l1 trials artificially inflated the decrease in grid score during d1 trials. This has been corrected.</p><p>While developing the original manuscript, we initially used only the two baseline periods to identify grid cells. However, in some recording sessions the coverage of the circular arena was incomplete during the 10-min baseline periods and prevented grid cells from reaching the detection threshold. We therefore looked for alternative strategies to classify neurons that displayed clear grid periodicity in their l1 and l2 maps as grid cells.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, grid cells are defined as neurons with a significant grid score during either the two baseline periods or during one baseline period and l2 trials. Because we only use the data from l1 and d1 trials to assess the effect of visual landmarks, our detection procedure should not affect the magnitude of the differences observed.</p><p>If the reviewers think that using only both baseline periods would be more appropriate, we could modify the procedure. This would not affect the conclusions of the manuscript but would significantly reduce the number of neurons classified as grid cells and clear grid cells would be falsely classified as irregular spatially selective cells.</p><p><italic>6) The thresholds used to identify grid cells appear to be fairly conservative. Regardless, the authors should perform a shuffling analysis showing the expected null distribution of grid, information, CM, DM, and polarity scores in their dataset to justify their choice of thresholds for all classes.</italic> </p><p>We have performed a shuffling procedure to obtain null distributions for all our spatial measures during the baselines and trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The 95<sup>th</sup> percentiles are used to identify the different cell classes.</p><p>To be member of a functional cell class, a neuron had to reach the thresholds for the class during either the two baseline periods or during one baseline period and l2 trials.</p><p>Below are the new definitions of the different cell classes.</p><p>Grid cell: grid score &gt; 95<sup>th</sup> percentile</p><p>Border cell: border score &gt; 95<sup>th</sup> percentile</p><p>Irregular spatially selective cell: information score &gt; 95<sup>th</sup> percentile (not classified as a grid or border cell)</p><p>Head-direction cell: head-direction vector length &gt; 95<sup>th</sup> percentile, head-direction tuning curve peak &gt; 5 Hz.</p><p>Speed cell: speed score &gt; 95<sup>th</sup> percentile.</p><p><italic>7) What were the criteria for deciding the tetrodes were in MEC to start recording?</italic> </p><p>The work of Fyhn et al. (2008, Hippocampus) shows that the power of theta oscillations increases significantly when a tetrode reaches the MEC. In our experiment, the tetrodes were lowered over a few days while the unfiltered electrophysiological signals were monitored on an oscilloscope. Recording started when large theta oscillations were observed on most tetrodes. Typically, the spikes of neurons were also strongly modulated by theta oscillations.</p><p>This information was added to the Methods section.</p><p><italic>8) How were the lights controlled during experiments?</italic> </p><p>An open-source microcontroller (Arduino Uno) controlled the lights via a 4-channel relay module. The identity of l1 and l2 and the order of presentation were determined with the random function of the Arduino software. The initialization of the random sequence was different for each session.</p><p>This information was added to the Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>9) How were food rewards delivered during experiments?</italic> </p><p>The food rewards (AIN-76A Rodent 378 tablets 5 mg, TestDiet) were delivered with pellet dispensers (CT-ENV-203-5, MedAssociates) located on the roof of the recording enclosure. Food delivery was triggered by an Arduino Uno with inter-delivery intervals ranging from 20 to 40 s.</p><p>This information is now reported in the Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>10) When identifying putative excitatory connections, were all pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons used, across both hemispheres, or just those on the same tetrode?</italic> </p><p>All possible pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons were considered, but putative connections were only detected between neurons recorded on the same tetrode. Below are the numbers of pairs considered.</p><p>Total number of pairs considered: 10880</p><p>Within tetrode pairs: 3292</p><p>Between tetrode pairs: 7588</p><p>Within hemisphere pairs: 7328</p><p>Between hemisphere pairs: 3552</p><p>Total number of connected pairs: 61</p><p>Within tetrode connected pairs: 61</p><p>Between tetrode connected pairs: 0</p><p>Within hemisphere connected pairs: 61</p><p>Between hemisphere connected pairs: 0</p><p><italic>11) In the statistical analysis neurons are treated as being independent from one another. This is unlikely to be justified for neurons recorded from the same animal. When comparing light versus dark a more correct approach would be to use linear mixed effect models with animal identity and session included as random effects. The raw data do look pretty convincing but this would help remove any nagging doubts.</italic> </p><p>We have considered using linear mixed effect models to account for the dependence of some data points in our experiment. For example, we built a model to predict grid scores based on the factors condition (l1 vs d1), animal and session. The factors animal and session were included as random effects, while condition was treated as a fixed effect. The factor condition was significant (p &lt; 10<sup>-16</sup>). However, the variance in the residuals of l1 and d1 trials was significantly different (Levene's test for homogeneity of variance: df = 1, F = 113.11, p &lt; 10<sup>-16</sup>). Therefore, the model did not fulfill the assumption of homoscedasticity which is required for linear models. For this reason, we would prefer not using linear mixed effect models in the manuscript.</p><p>To address the reviewers' concern regarding the dependence of the data points, we confirmed that the main conclusions of the manuscript remained unchanged when using a single data point per mouse. For example, when using the median grid score per mouse as a statistical unit, we observed a significant difference between l1 and d1 trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, n = 6 mice, p = 0.031). There was only one occasion where the p value did not reach significance level (comparison of map polarity in light and dark trials for border cells, p = 0.11).</p><p>If the reviewers think that it would be more appropriate to use linear mixed effect models, we will include them upon request. As they have much more statistical power than using mice as statistical units, we do not expect changes in the conclusions.</p><p><italic>On a somewhat related note, it wasn't clear whether data recorded from the same animal in multiple sessions might be from the same neuron(s). Could this be the case? How is this avoided?</italic> </p><p>It is possible that on some occasions the data from successive days contain the same neuron twice. We tried to minimize this possibility by lowering our tetrodes by approximately 25-50 μm between recording sessions.</p><p>The statistical analysis performed using mice as statistical units should ensure these duplicates do not affect the conclusions drawn in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>12) Do the firing rate changes between light and dark trials differ for putative interneurons compared to principal cells? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, cells 1 and 2 have high firing rates suggesting they might be interneurons, but it’s not clear if interneurons are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>.</italic> </p><p>All neurons were included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. We have included an example of a high firing rate neuron in the figure and modified the figure legend to make this clear.</p><p>The proportion of neurons with significant rate changes between l1 and d1 trials was similar in the two populations (putative interneurons: 0.617, putative principal cells: 0.549). This finding is now reported in the Results section.</p><p><italic>13) Was head direction firing affected by visual landmarks? The MEC contains many neurons with activity modulated by head direction. Head direction was measured, but I could not find effects of visual modulation on head direction firing reported in the main text, although firing rate changes of head direction cells are in a couple of the figures.</italic> </p><p>Head direction selectivity of neurons was severely reduced in darkness. A new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) now presents this finding.</p><p><italic>14) What fraction of speed cells was modulated by head direction?</italic> </p><p>We now report the number of speed-modulated cells in the different functional cell classes.</p><p>Grid cells: 67 out of 139</p><p>Irregular spatially selective cells: 54 out of 226</p><p>Border cells: 11 out of 63</p><p>Head-direction cells: 30 out of 85</p><p>30 out of 304 speed-modulated cells were modulated by head direction.</p><p><italic>What information do the cross-correlations reveal about post-synaptic targets of speed cells?</italic> </p><p>Putative excitatory connections detected from the crosscorrelations usually involve a low firing rate pre-synaptic cell and a high firing post-synaptic interneuron. If we take into consideration connected pairs in which the pre-synaptic neuron was a speed cell, the mean firing rate of the post-synaptic neurons was 19.80 Hz (n = 17). Out of the 17 post-synaptic neurons to speed-modulated cells, 12 were speed-modulated cells, 13 had a mean firing rate above 10 Hz and 3 were grid cells.</p><p>We decided not to include this information in the manuscript because it is based on a relatively small sample (n = 17).</p><p><italic>Do any post-synaptic neurons show reductions in firing rate as one would expect if speed cells are inhibitory?</italic> </p><p>Inhibition cannot be unequivocally identified from the crosscorrelations because its effect is likely to last several milliseconds. This makes it very difficult to disentangle synaptic inhibition from the effect of network oscillations. For example, consider the crosscorrelation between two theta-modulated cells, where the preferred theta phase of cell A comes 30 degrees after cell B. The crosscorrelation between cell A and cell B will have fewer spikes after time 0, even if there is no synaptic inhibition of cell B by cell A.</p><p>For this reason, we did not attempt to quantify inhibition from the crosscorrelations.</p><p>In the manuscript, several speed-modulated cells are spatially selective neurons with relatively low firing rate (i.e., grid cells and irregular spatially selective cells). Moreover, in the analysis of putative excitatory connections, some speed-modulated cells were found to be pre-synaptic neurons. This indicates that speed-modulated cells can also be excitatory cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
