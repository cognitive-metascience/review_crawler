Unfortunately, many people are living in an environment where their circadian system is challenged by inappropriate meal- or work-times. Here we scheduled food access to the sleep time and examined the impact on learning and memory in mice. Under these conditions, we demonstrate that the molecular clock in the master pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), is unaltered while the molecular clock in the hippocampus is synchronized by the timing of food availability. This chronic circadian misalignment causes reduced hippocampal long term potentiation and total CREB expression. Importantly this mis-timed feeding resulted in dramatic deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Our findings suggest that the timing of meals have far-reaching effects on hippocampal physiology and learned behaviour.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09460.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09460.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09460.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many processes within the body follow an approximately 24-hour cycle. In addition to patterns of sleep and wakefulness, such circadian rhythms help to regulate body temperature, blood pressure and hormone levels. They also affect when we feel hungry, when our muscles work most efficiently, and when we are mentally at our sharpest.</p><p>A region of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) generates and maintains circadian rhythms, and thus acts as the body’s master clock. Daily exposure to light keeps the SCN synchronized with the 24-hour day/night cycle. However, most organs, from the heart to the pancreas, also possess their own clocks, which help to regulate organ-specific processes. These secondary clocks normally operate in synchrony with the SCN.</p><p>Exposure to light has long been known to influence circadian rhythms. However, more recent evidence suggests that the timing of meals may also affect circadian clocks, particularly those within the digestive system. Loh et al. therefore decided to investigate whether eating outside normal waking hours would also affect other key physiological processes, specifically the cognitive processes of learning and memory.</p><p>Mice normally consume most of their food after sunset. Loh et al. showed that rodents that were instead fed during the day performed less well on cognitive tests than other mice who received the same food at night. The daytime-fed mice showed changes in a region of the brain called the hippocampus, which supports learning and memory. In particular, daytime feeding changed the timing of the secondary circadian clock within the hippocampus, although it had no effect on the master clock in the SCN. Loh et al. therefore suggest that the misalignment of these circadian clocks impairs cognition.</p><p>Further experiments are needed to determine whether a similar relationship exists between the timing of meals and cognitive performance in humans. If so, these findings will have implications for the many individuals whose mealtimes, for work or social reasons, are out of synchrony with their body clocks.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09460.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09460.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>learning and memory</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>CREB</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRSA training grant 2T32GM065823</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jami</surname><given-names>Shekib A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MARC training grant 2T34GM008563</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flores</surname><given-names>Richard E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>O'Keefe Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colwell</surname><given-names>Christopher S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000071</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30HD004612</award-id> <principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loh</surname><given-names>Dawn H</given-names></name><name><surname>Ghiani</surname><given-names>Cristina A</given-names></name><name><surname>Colwell</surname><given-names>Christopher S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000071</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54HD087101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loh</surname><given-names>Dawn H</given-names></name><name><surname>Ghiani</surname><given-names>Cristina A</given-names></name><name><surname>Colwell</surname><given-names>Christopher S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The time at which mice consume food can dramatically affect hippocampal-dependent biochemistry, physiology, and learned behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The circadian system is a finely tuned network of central and peripheral oscillators headed by a master pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which governs daily rhythms in physiology and behaviour, including cognition. This network regulates cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holloway and Wansley, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaudhury and Colwell, 2002</xref>), and the neural circuits involved in learning and memory also exhibit circadian rhythms in gene expression and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eckel-Mahan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fropf et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lamont et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lyons, 2006</xref>).

Environmental perturbations also have the capacity to disrupt synchrony and misalign this clock network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fekete et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Devan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ruby et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karatsoreos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fonken et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LeGates et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandez et al., 2014</xref>) and are problematic as many people in our modern society extend their work and recreation into the night hours.</p><p>There has been mounting evidence that the timing of when we eat is critical for our metabolic health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bass, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mattson et al., 2014</xref>). At this point, timing of food intake is well-established to have a major impact on the phase of the molecular oscillations in peripheral organs such as the liver and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Damiola, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stokkan, 2001</xref>). Mis-timed meals during the sleep phase accelerates weight gain compared with animals fed during their wake phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arble et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bray et al., 2013</xref>), whereas wake-phase feeding has a protective effect against the cardiac and metabolic dysfunction caused by high fat diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hatori et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gill et al., 2015</xref>). Similar disruptive effects are seen in humans, where misaligned mealtimes produce cardiac and metabolic deficits, leading to a pre-diabetic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Scheer et al., 2009</xref>). We thus became interested in the possibility that these ill consequences of eating at inappropriate phases of the daily cycle may also be maladaptive for cognitive function. In this study, we sought to determine the effects of chronic but stable misalignment of the circadian network by scheduling access to food at an inappropriate phase of the daily cycle. We demonstrate that this simple manipulation has far-reaching consequences for learning and memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Misaligned feeding alters diurnal rhythms of activity and sleep</title><p>Mice were allotted a 6 hr window in which food was made available either during the middle of their active (aligned) or inactive (misaligned) phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Mice adapted to the feeding protocol within 6 days (p = 0.9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and there were no significant differences in body weight between the two groups at the time of testing (p = 0.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Daytime activity was increased in mice subjected to misaligned feeding (p &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), and the strength of daily rhythms of activity was reduced by misaligned feeding (p = 0.003; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly, the temporal pattern of sleep was altered by misaligned feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Immobility-defined video monitoring of sleep behaviour of misaligned mice showed decreased time spent asleep during the day (p &lt; 0.001) and a corresponding increase in sleep during the night (p &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Misaligned mice no longer exhibit a day vs night difference in sleep, sleeping equally during the day and night (p = 0.5). Crucially, the total time spent asleep over a 24 hr day was not reduced by misaligned feeding (p = 0.2). The change in temporal pattern of sleep quantity is also reflected in sleep fragmentation, where misaligned mice exhibit a greater number of sleep bouts (p &lt; 0.05) with a corresponding decrease in average sleep bout duration (p &lt; 0.001) during the day compared to aligned mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This increased day-time sleep fragmentation is compensated by fewer (p &lt; 0.05) and longer (p &lt; 0.001) night sleep bouts in the misaligned animals, resulting in no significant change in the total number (p = 0.9) and average duration (p = 0.6) of sleep bouts over a 24 hr period.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09460.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cartoon schematic of experimental design.</title><p>Standard mouse cages were modified to restrict access to the food chamber.

Due to these schedules, we eat around the clock with well-established literature of metabolic consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mattson et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we sought to determine if temporally restricted feeding schedules in mice could impact cognition. We found that time-restricted feeding led to dramatic impairments in learned behaviours such as hippocampal-dependent contextual fear conditioning and novel object recognition. Not all behavioural tests were similarly affected, as amygdala-dependent cued-fear conditioning was not altered by the misalignment. This implies that some learned behaviours are more vulnerable to the impact of misaligned feeding. Crucially, the total amount of sleep was not altered by the scheduled feeding and the mice did not lose weight as might be expected if their caloric intake was restricted. Hence, by simply adjusting the time of food access, we demonstrated that we can alter the cognitive performance of mice. We do not know yet if this equally applies to humans but shift work has been associated with decreased performance on cognitive tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wright et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marquie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The importance of sleep for memory is well-documented, where both the amount of sleep and the quality of sleep have been found to be critical for memory consolidation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</xref>). The misaligned feeding treatment did not result in an overall decrease in amount of sleep, but instead had a severe impact on the temporal pattern, suggesting that this treatment acts via disruption of the circadian timing of sleep. While sleep quality as assessed by polysomnography was not measured in this study, we were able to examine the degree of sleep fragmentation as determined by the number and duration of individual sleep bouts. Misaligned feeding again has a greater impact on the temporal pattern of sleep fragmentation, where the misaligned mice appear to “catch up” on consolidated sleep during what should be their active phase.</p><p>Mechanistically, we used the clock-driven rhythms in bioluminescence to demonstrate that the altered feeding time not only shifted the peripheral clocks in the liver, but also altered the circadian clock in the hippocampus. This finding is consistent with earlier literature suggesting the phasing of the molecular clock in the corticolimbic system and hippocampus are strongly influenced by the time of food availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amir, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ángeles-Castellanos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wakamatsu et al., 2001</xref>). We have thus created a situation in which the molecular clocks within the nervous system are running at different phases, <italic>i.e.</italic> internal desynchronisation of the circadian system. A consequence of this misalignment is altered synaptic plasticity within the hippocampal circuit (Schaffer Collaterals/CA1) as revealed by the reduction in LTP. This is the first demonstration that the time of eating can impact the physiological underpinning of learned behaviour. Importantly, our manipulation of feeding caused a significant decline in CREB in the hippocampus, which has been demonstrated to be critical for memory allocation in mice (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). The levels of tCREB were reduced at all phases that we sampled (ZT 2, 8, 14 and 20), and although we did not carry out cognitive tests at each of these phases, this finding indicates that memory would be impaired throughout the daily cycle. The reduction in tCREB provides a biochemical explanation for our finding, as well as providing a guidepost for future analysis of the effects of the misaligned feeding in the hippocampus. Therefore, this work raises the possibility that the timing of when we eat alters the physiological and biochemical events underlying learning and memory.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experimental protocols used in this study were approved by the UCLA Animal Research Committee (Protocol 1998–183).

Period was determined using the sine-wave fit function in Lumicycle Analysis (Actimetrics).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Western immunoblotting</title><p>Hippocampi were rapidly dissected and homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P40, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM AEBSF, 10 ug/ml Aprotinin, 10 ug/ml Leupeptin, 10 ug/ml Pepstatin, and 1 mM sodium fluoride). Total protein concentration in cleared extracts was estimated using Pierce’s BCA (bicinchoninic acid) Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Western blots were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghiani and Gallo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghiani et al., 2010</xref>). Each extract was analysed for relative protein levels of phosphoCREB by using an antibody directed against the phosphorylated form at Ser133 (rabbit polyclonal, Millipore) and then for tCREB (rabbit polyclonal, Millipore). Equal protein loading was verified by Ponceau S solution (Sigma) reversible staining of the blots and each extract was also analysed for relative protein levels of β-actin (Sigma). Relative intensities of the protein bands were quantified by scanning densitometry using the NIH Image Software (Image J, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>), and each value background-corrected. Data are shown as arbitrary units and are the average ± SEM of 4–5 animals/group. We confirmed by two way ANOVA comparisons that levels of β-actin do not vary with time of day in either group (p = 0.9) and is no different between aligned and misaligned mice (p = 0.9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Mice were perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were dissected out, post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4°C overnight, cryoprotected in 15% sucrose. Immunolabelling of frozen sections (30 μm) was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghiani et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, sections were blocked in carrier solution (1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100) containing 20% normal goat serum for 1 hr and incubated for 48h at 4°C with primary antibodies against tCREB (1:500 rabbit polyclonal, Millipore) diluted in carrier solution containing 5% normal goat serum. Sections were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and mounted with Vectashield medium with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunostained sections were visualized using a Zeiss Axio Imager 2 with an AxioCam MRm. Images were acquired through Axiovision (Zeiss, Thornwood NY), using a 5X objective in order to visualize the entire hippocampus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Hippocampal slice preparation and electrophysiology</title><p>Hippocampal slice preparation and electrophysiological recordings were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlisle et al., 2008</xref>). Briefly, slices (400 µm) were maintained in oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> / 5% CO<sub>2</sub>), warmed (30°C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 124 mM NaCl, 4.4 M KCl, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.0 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.0 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 10 mM glucose, and allowed to recover for at least 2 hr prior to the start of an experiment. A bipolar, nichrome wire stimulating electrode was placed in stratum radiatum of the hippocampal CA1 region to activate Schaffer collateral–commissural fibre synapses and an extracellular glass microelectrode filled with ACSF (resistance = 5–10 MΩ) was used to record evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs). Extracellular recordings were done under interface conditions. The intensity of presynaptic fibre stimulation was adjusted to evoke fEPSPs with amplitude approximately 50% of the maximal fEPSP amplitude that could be elicited in each slice. fEPSPs were then elicited at 0.02 Hz throughout the experiment. LTP was induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS, 2 trains of 100 Hz stimulation, 1 sec duration, inter-train interval = 10 sec). The average slope of fEPSPs normalized to baseline measured between 55 and 60 min post-HFS was used for statistical comparisons (two tailed <italic>t</italic> tests). The paired pulse stimulation pulses were delivered with interpulse intervals of 25, 50, 100 and 200 ms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Fear conditioning (FC)</title><p>Contextual fear conditioning was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaudhury and Colwell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loh et al., 2010</xref>) with minor modifications. In brief, aligned and misaligned mice were tested and trained either in the day (ZT 2) or the night (ZT 14). Mice were trained and tested only once to avoid effects of prior manipulation. Results reported for daytime and night-time tests are from distinct cohorts of animals. Mice were habituated to the testing room for 30 min under the relevant lighting conditions (dim red light, 2 lux, at night). The animals were individually introduced to the novel environment (shock chamber) and allowed to familiarize to context for 3 min, after which the mice were trained to associate the context with a fearful unconditioned stimulus (US): foot-shock (0.2 mA). The training protocol consisted of 2 US with an inter-trial interval of 64 sec. At the end of the last US, mice were left in the chamber for a further 64 sec, after which they were returned to their home cages. 24 hr later, mice were placed individually into the same conditioning chamber for 6 min. Video recordings of the acquisition and recall tests were done with CCTV (Gadspot) cameras with supplemental infrared lighting during both times of day. Freezing behaviour was scored as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaudhury and Colwell, 2002</xref>). Cued fear conditioning was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Using the same stimulus protocol as contextual FC, 30 sec of white noise (80 dB; conditioned stimulus, CS) preceded the presentation of US1 and US2. 24 hr later, mice were placed individually into a novel testing chamber. Following 2 min of baseline, the cued tone was presented for 2 min; mice were left in the chamber for a further 2 min. Freezing behaviour was scored as previously described.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Novel object recognition (NOR)</title><p>Habituation to the testing arena, object familiarization, and testing for NOR over 5 consecutive days were performed in the active phase at ZT 21 (<italic>n</italic> = 8 per feeding condition) for night-time tests under dim red light (2 lux), with day tests at ZT 9 (<italic>n</italic> = 8 per feeding condition). Mice were habituated to the testing arena (60 × 48 × 30 cm) in 10 min trials on 2 consecutive days. During familiarization trials, two identical objects were placed equidistant from each other and the walls of the arena, and mice were allowed to explore the arena for 10 min on 2 consecutive days. Mice that failed to travel 20 m or interact with objects for more than 20 sec in the second familiarization trial were eliminated from further analysis. On the day of testing for NOR, one familiar object was replaced with a novel object with a different shape and made of a different material (plastic or glass). The testing trial was 5 min in duration. Arenas and objects were wiped between animals with 10% Windex and dried using paper towels. Video feeds of each arena from an overhead CCTV camera supplemented with infrared lighting were fed to the ANY-maze software. The arena and object maps were defined in ANY-maze, and allowed for automated tracking of the animal’s area, with the ability to distinguish between the head and tail. Entry of the animal’s head to the defined object’s area was scored for time interacting with the object. An experimenter watched the recorded videos and overlaid tracking in real-time to verify that tracking of the animal’s area and head/tail orientation was consistent and that scoring of object interaction was accurate. Performance on the NOR test is indicated by a discrimination index calculated of time spent with the novel object (T<sub>novel</sub>) divided by the sum of time spent with both objects (T<sub>novel</sub>+T<sub>familiar</sub>). One animal from the misaligned group (out of 8) tested during the day failed to sufficiently explore both objects (&lt; 10 sec during the second familiarization trial) and was eliminated from further analysis. For all novel object recognition experiments, mice were trained and tested only once to avoid effects of prior manipulation. Results reported for daytime and night-time tests are from distinct cohorts of animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analysis was performed using Sigma Stat (ver. 12). Effects of misaligned feeding on activity, sleep, PER2-driven bioluminescence, and LTP were determined using unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests in comparison to the aligned group. In cases of unequal variance, the Mann-Whitney rank sum test was applied. To determine the effects and interaction of time of day and scheduled feeding condition on protein expression, and hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, we applied two factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. The Holm-Sidak <italic>post hoc</italic> test was used to distinguish differences due to misaligned feeding. Differences with p &lt; 0.05 were deemed significant in all analyses.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Joseph S. Takahashi, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. One of the three reviewers, Daniel Storm, has also agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Loh et al. presents a carefully conducted and important series of experiments uncovering the consequences of mistimed feeding on the hippocampal circadian clockwork and learning and memory. The main findings indicate that feeding during the inactive phase of the circadian cycle leads to ~14 h phase alteration in hippocampal clock gene rhythms whereas SCN phase is unaltered. These changes were associated with deficits in hippocampal LTP, total hippocampal CREB expression, and hippocampal-dependent learning and memory.</p><p>This is an excellent paper and is consistent with a number of other studies that have established that memory consolidation depends on the circadian rhythm. This is very interesting because it extends our understanding of circadian rhythm and memory by showing that the timing of heating affects hippocampus-dependent neuroplasticity. The experiments are well done and the major conclusions are justified by the data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) I understand why the authors chose a comparison of mice fed during the day to mice with food restricted to the dark phase. This not only controls for time of food presentation but also more accurately mimics the human condition. However, under laboratory conditions, mice eat throughout the day with food consumption peaking during their active phase. The possibility might be considered that restricting feeding to the active phase enhances LTP, learning and memory, etc. above that normally seen in mice either by surveying the literature or adding a group of ad lib fed animals as a point of comparison.</p><p>2) Because hippocampal rhythms are 14.1 h out of phase between night- and day-fed animals, testing animals on the fear and novel object tasks 12 hours apart might not be the ideal timing to control for the possibility that day-fed animals are being examined at an inappropriate time for learning potential. The CREB data suggest this is not the case, but the point might be considered in the manuscript.</p><p>3) Although the total amount of sleep measured by inactivity is the same across day- and night-fed mice, as the authors acknowledge, the pattern is quite different. The possibility should be considered that the pattern/quality of sleep might contribute to the deficits observed, particularly as EEG data are unavailable and it's unknown whether sleep quality was markedly impacted. Given the importance of sleep for memory consolidation, this point is of particular importance.</p><p>4) Although the title is creative, it is incongruent with the results as mice eating at midnight would be eating at their ideal time of day. The title should be revised to be informative and consistent with the contents of the paper.</p><p>5) In the subsection “Animals”, the specific C57BL/6 substrain is not specified, nor is the supplier. This is important because the two most common substrains, C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N, differ in behavioral tests, and the C57BL/6N strain carries a number of known mutations compared to the C57BL/6J strain (Kumar et al. 2013 Science 342:1508). In previous publications from the Colwell lab, the C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River, which would make the correct mouse strain nomenclature, C57BL/6NCrl.</p><p>6) In the subsection “Activity monitoring”, “power&quot; should not be estimated using a Chi-square periodogram because this method operates in the time domain, therefore, it cannot independently assess power at different frequencies. The appropriate method is to use a Fourier analysis method to assess power in the circadian range.</p><p>7) In the subsection “Fear conditioning (FC)”, for context-dependent fear conditioning experiments, the methods indicate that the mice were introduced to the novel environment for 15 minutes before the US. This is an unusually long time and is not conventional in this assay. In the cited references from the authors' labs (Chaudhury and Colwell, 2001; Loh et al., 2010), the methods in these papers specify a 3-minute time in the novel environment, which is the typical time used by the vast majority of studies, and has been shown long ago to be the optimal time interval.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09460.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) I understand why the authors chose a comparison of mice fed during the day to mice with food restricted to the dark phase.

We show this data now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Because hippocampal rhythms are 14.1 h out of phase between night- and day-fed animals, testing animals on the fear and novel object tasks 12 hours apart might not be the ideal timing to control for the possibility that day-fed animals are being examined at an inappropriate time for learning potential.

Although we did not carry out learning tests at all phases, the tCREB data indicate that memory would be impaired throughout the daily cycle. We now make this point in our Discussion as recommended:</p><p>“Importantly, our manipulation of feeding caused a significant decline in CREB in the hippocampus, which has been demonstrated to be critical for memory allocation in mice (e.g. Sano et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2009). The levels of tCREB were reduced at all phases that we sampled (ZT 2, 8, 14, and 20), and although we did not carry out cognitive tests at each of these phases, this finding indicates that memory would be impaired throughout the daily cycle.”</p><p><italic>3) Although the total amount of sleep measured by inactivity is the same across day- and night-fed mice, as the authors acknowledge, the pattern is quite different. The possibility should be considered that the pattern/quality of sleep might contribute to the deficits observed, particularly as EEG data are unavailable and it's unknown whether sleep quality was markedly impacted. Given the importance of sleep for memory consolidation, this point is of particular importance.</italic> </p><p>Although we did not perform EEG recordings, and are unable to definitively report on sleep quality, we were able to distinguish the number and duration of individual immobility-defined sleep bout. We have added a supplementary figure to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to show that the number and duration of sleep bouts in the day, as a measure of sleep fragmentation, are affected by misaligned feeding. Intriguingly, this measurement of sleep fragmentation is not significantly different between aligned and misaligned mice when considered over the 24 hr day and night, and the number of sleep bouts of long durations (&gt;30 minutes) is equivalent between the two treatment groups. This suggests that the misaligned mice may experience sleep compensation, and have shifted “consolidated” sleep to the nighttime. A paragraph has been added to the Discussion to address this:</p><p>“The importance of sleep for memory is well-documented, where both the amount of sleep and the quality of sleep have been found to be critical for memory consolidation. The misaligned feeding treatment did not result in an overall decrease in amount of sleep, but instead had a severe impact on the temporal pattern, suggesting that this treatment acts via disruption of the circadian timing of sleep. While sleep quality as assessed by polysomnography was not assessed in this study, we were able to examine the degree of sleep fragmentation as determined by the number and duration of individual sleep bouts. Misaligned feeding again has a greater impact on the temporal pattern of sleep fragmentation, where the misaligned mice appear to ‘catch up’ on consolidated sleep during what should be their active phase.”</p><p><italic>4) Although the title is creative, it is incongruent with the results as mice eating at midnight would be eating at their ideal time of day. The title should be revised to be informative and consistent with the contents of the paper.</italic> </p><p>We have changed the title of the manuscript to more accurately reflect the relative time of food intake: “Misaligned feeding impairs memories”.</p><p><italic>5) In the subsection “Animals”, the specific C57BL/6 substrain is not specified, nor is the supplier. This is important because the two most common substrains, C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N, differ in behavioral tests, and the C57BL/6N strain carries a number of known mutations compared to the C57BL/6J strain (Kumar et al. 2013 Science 342:1508).

The PER2::LUC knock-in transgenic mice were backcrossed to the C5Bl/6J strain. Both strains of mice exhibited the same alterations in activity and sleep rhythms due to the scheduled food access.</p><p><italic>6) In the subsection “Activity monitoring”, &quot;power&quot; should not be estimated using a Chi-square periodogram because this method operates in the time domain, therefore, it cannot independently assess power at different frequencies.
