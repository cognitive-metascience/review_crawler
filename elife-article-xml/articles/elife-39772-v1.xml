A defining event of sex is fusion of the plasma membranes of two haploid gametes to generate a new diploid cell, yet we still know little about the molecular mechanism of gamete fusion. The single-pass transmembrane protein HAP2/GCS1 is essential for gamete fusion in organisms across eukaryotic kingdoms, and was likely the ancient sexual fusogen used by primitive eukaryotes before the eukaryotic radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wong and Johnson, 2010</xref>). HAP2 is also important as a target of vaccines that block the obligate sexual life cycles of parasites including <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, and hence block transmission of malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angrisano et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Recent work on HAP2 from the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, the flowering plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and the ciliate <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> shows that HAP2 is, in common with fusogens used by certain enveloped viruses to enter host cells, a class II fusion glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fédry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pinello et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Valansi et al., 2017</xref>). Class II fusogens are characterized by their mainly β-sheet-containing-domains I, II, and III (referred to here as D1, D2, and D3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harrison, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kielian and Rey, 2006</xref>). A stem region connects these globular domains to two transmembrane domains in flaviviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) or a single-pass transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain in eukaryotes. Although sequence homology is not detectable among class II fusogens from different virus families or with HAP2, similar three-dimensional structures and functions suggest that they diverged from a common ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fédry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pinello et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Valansi et al., 2017</xref>). As with viral class II proteins, HAP2 functions uni-directionally. Thus, in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, HAP2 is expressed and required for fusion only in <italic>minus</italic> mating type gametes, and not in <italic>plus</italic> mating type gametes.</p><p>In the classic model of viral class II fusogen function, glycoproteins are tightly packed in a regular icosahedral lattice overlying the viral lipid bilayer in which their transmembrane domains are embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harrison, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kielian and Rey, 2006</xref>). After the virus adheres to host cell receptors and is internalized, the low pH of the endosome triggers reconfiguration of the fusogen from its pre-fusion state into an activated, monomeric state. In this state, a hydrophobic ‘fusion loop’ is exposed at the apical tip of D2, which is the most distal domain from the viral membrane. The tip of the exposed fusion loop then anchors to the target endosomal membrane, creating a protein bridge between the viral and host-cell membranes. This in turn initiates a concerted series of steps leading to trimerization. In a first step, monomers associate in parallel along a trimer axis lined by D1 and D2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liao et al., 2010</xref>). Then, in a change of D1-D3 orientation, D3 folds back onto D1 and the lower part of D2 and a portion of the stem zippers along the upper part of D2. In the final steps of conformational change, which are yet to be resolved structurally, the remainder of the stem containing hydrophobic elements packs against the trimer and the target membrane, and drags the transmembrane domain anchored to the viral membrane into intimate contact with the fusion loops moored in the target endosomal membrane. Close approach of the viral and host lipid bilayers and their ensuing distortions during the final stages of stem zippering and hydrophobic element approach are thought to destabilize the membranes enough to fuse into a pore that connects the viral contents with the cytoplasm of the host cell. All trimeric class II structures are commonly termed ‘post-fusion’; however, since some of them may represent intermediates that are on the pathway to fusion, we use the term ‘fusion state’ structures here.</p><p>Comparisons of pre-fusion and fusion-state structures of viral class II fusion proteins show not only a fold-back of D3 onto D1 and some features of stem zippering, but also a change in D1-D2 orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harrison, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kielian and Rey, 2006</xref>). However, following trimerization, little is known about changes in the orientation of fusion loop-bearing D2 in the pathway towards the final fusion conformation. D2 domains in trimers from some viral class II fusogens pack tightly against their neighbors at the 3-fold axis, while others splay widely or to intermediate extents from the 3-fold axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harrison, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luca et al., 2013</xref>). Closely packed fusion loops could provide a larger, unified fusion surface at the tip of the trimer necessary for strong anchoring in the target lipid bilayer. Because only a small number of the residues in the fusion loop of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> HAP2 were previously resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fédry et al., 2017</xref>), we lack important information about the location and structural relationships of putative fusion loop residues and the degree of HAP2 D2 splaying in the trimer.</p><p>Here, we report a 2.6 Å trimeric, fusion-state crystal structure of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> HAP2 in which the fusion loops are completely resolved. To our surprise, and unlike viral fusogens, hydrophobic fusion loop residues in HAP2 are exposed on three separate helices in each monomer - - α1, η1, and α2 - - positioned to interact with the target cell (<italic>plus</italic> gamete) membrane. Mutational analyses show that the α1 and α2 helices, which are parallel to one another, have a much more critical function in fusion than the η1 helix, which is tangential to and more distant from the central axis. These results, the large amount of splaying of the fusion loop of each protomer from the trimer central axis, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) results showing flexibility within D2 suggest that the crystallized form of HAP2 is an intermediate in the structural transition pathway for membrane fusion. We propose that during the final stages of fusion, the apically localized fusion loops of HAP2 tilt towards the trimer core to form a more compact fusion surface.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall HAP2 trimer conformation</title><p><italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> HAP2 glycoprotein (ectodomain residues 23 – 582) with a C-terminal His tag was secreted from <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, purified by Ni-affinity chromatography and gel filtration, and crystallized. The structure was refined to 2.6 Å with R<sub>work</sub> and R<sub>free</sub> of 23.2% and 28.1%, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Three monomers in the asymmetric unit form a trimer and pack against one another through D1 and D2 at the 3-fold axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In further similarity to other class II fusion-state structures, a U-turn between D1 and D3 enables D3 to pack against the outer faces of D1 and D2. D2 narrows at a waist that divides two subdomains we term D2.1 and D2.2. The subdomains contain separate β-sheets and α-helices. D3 packs against D2.1, which locates midway along the 3-fold axis in trimers. D2.2 at the ‘apical’, narrower end of trimers bears three fusion helices, α1, η1, and α2, in fusion loops 1 and 2 between β-strands c and d. Following D3, a stem segment binds in a groove in D2 of a neighboring monomer. Although the stem is formed in part by five ordered residues of the C-terminal His tag, this region of HAP2 is poorly conserved in sequence and the stem extends in the expected direction towards the fusion loops. In full-length HAP2, the stem includes 48 additional residues including a hydrophobic region and is followed by the transmembrane domain.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39772.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overall structure of HAP2.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Ribbon diagrams of current (<bold>A</bold>) and previous (<bold>B</bold>) trimer structures.

In contrast, D2.2 orientation differs, as seen by comparing the separation of β-strands b and d from the 3-fold axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Compared to the 3.3 Å structure, the 2.6 Å structure shows differences in sidechain orientation, peptide backbone orientation, hydrogen bonds, and sequence-to-structure register (Materials and methods). Either as a consequence of omission of protease treatment here, differences in the crystal lattice, or higher resolution, we can visualize 50 more residues per monomer. Importantly, we can completely trace the fusion loops, which form three helices with apically-pointing hydrophobic residues in each monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Of nine total fusion helices, only one was resolved in the previous structure, and it differed in orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), accounting for the markedly different appearance of the two structures in the apical portion of D2.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Additionally, other loops are resolved better in our structure, including at the base of trimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Long loops are prominent in HAP2, differ in position among HAP2 from different species, and contrast with the shorter loops found in viral fusion proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Monomer and trimer dynamics</title><p>To obtain complementary structural information, we measured HDX for HAP2 in both its monomeric and trimeric forms. Purified, monomeric HAP2 fortuitously trimerized into a fusion state during crystallization. To obtain a trimeric, fusion-state form for HDX, we incubated monomeric HAP2 with dodecylmaltoside detergent to bind to its fusion loops and simulate membrane engagement. Multi-angle light scattering showed that monomeric HAP2 contains 6% glycan, and that the glycoprotein mass of the main peak after detergent treatment was 2.99-fold greater than the monomer, in excellent agreement with trimer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>HDX measures exchange of protein backbone NH hydrogens with deuterium in deuterated water (D<sub>2</sub>O). The main factors that slow exchange are burial from solvent and hydrogen bonding, primarily to backbone NH groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 1993</xref>). Because exchange measures solvent exposure and lack of backbone hydrogen bonds, it approximates flexibility. HDX kinetics were measured over time periods from 10 s to 4 hr. After quenching and pepsin digestion, deuterium incorporation was measured in individual peptides by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and 5</xref>). Trimer HDX at 1 min is displayed on the ribbon cartoon of one monomer with nearby regions of other monomers shown as transparent surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). As discussed later in results, the most dynamic regions of D1, D2.2, and D3 surprisingly lie more on their faces directed toward, rather than away from, the 3-fold axis. The apical portion of D2.2 containing its fusion loops was among the most rapidly exchanging regions in HAP2. The small β-sheets in D2.1 and D2.2 surprisingly exchanged more slowly than the larger β-sheets in D1 and D3. The waist between D2.1 and D2.2 is thin and contained more rapidly exchanging regions. Comparison between monomer and trimer HDX revealed no overall effect of trimerization; instead, differences were limited to specific regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39772.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>HDX.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) One monomer of the trimer is shown viewed from inside (<bold>A</bold>) and outside (<bold>B</bold>) the 3-fold axis (cyan arrow) with HDX at 1 min. color-coded on the ribbon diagram.

The slowest exchanging regions in HAP2 are found in D2.1 near its junction with D2.2, where D2.1 has a substantial hydrophobic core underlying the right-angle junction between the slow-exchanging α4-helix and aef β-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

The fusion loops in HAP are unusually long at 39 residues and have three helices. Each helix, α1 in loop 1, and η1 and α2 in loop 2, displays a set of two to three hydrophobic residues that project apically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–H</xref>). Loop 1 extends from Cys167 to Arg185 and contains the α1-helix with Trp173 and Phe177 in an apical orientation. Loop 2 lies between Arg185 and the beginning of β-strand d. It contains the η1-helix with Phe192 and Trp193 that orient apcally, and the α2-helix with Leu197 and Leu200 that orient apically and Ile201 that orients outward. The three helices in each monomer have orientations similar to three sides of a box (lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> mark helix axes of the right-most monomer), with axes of α1 and α2 pointing toward the 3-fold axis while the η1-helix axis forms the outer side, more distal from the 3-fold axis. The division between fusion loops is defined by a basally projecting loop with Arg185 at its tip. The Arg185 sidechain guanido group docks through six hydrogen bonds to its carbonyl cage formed by backbone and sidechain carbonyl oxygens in the core of subdomain D2.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C,G</xref>).</p><p>The architecture of the 3-helix fusion surface in each HAP2 monomer is well supported by a hydrophobic core that underlies and knits together the α1, η1, and α2-helices and a robust network of hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Notable hydrogen bonds include those made by the Ser168 and Asp191 sidechains with backbone NH groups of the α1 and η1 helices, respectively, that stabilize these helices by capping their N-termini. Additionally, Thr-176 caps the η1 helix and also hydrogen bonds to the α1-helix to link these helices.</p><p>HAP2 ectodomain monomers appear to utilize their fusion loops to bind phospholipid vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fédry et al., 2017</xref>) and detergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) as shown by induction of trimerization. Thus, in the trimeric HAP2 state, the hydrophobic residues on the fusion helices in each monomer should also be able to interact with the lipid bilayer of the <italic>plus</italic> gamete. In the crystal structure, however, D2.2 splays away from the 3-fold axis so that the 3-helix fusion surfaces of monomers are separated from one another by solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and D</xref>). Because of the large hydrophilic surface exposed on the faces of each monomer surrounding the 3-fold axis, deformation of lipids to fit into this large cavity, or the presence of water in the cavity, would limit the depth to which HAP2 trimers could insert in the hydrophobic core of the membrane bilayer during membrane fusion. These apparent barriers raise the possibility that our crystal structure represents an early fusion state of HAP2 that precedes a more mature state in which reorientation could allow the fusion loops in each monomer to approach and close up at the 3-fold axis to form a common fusion surface.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Flexibility in D2 in HAP2</title><p>Comparisons among HAP2 and viral fusion state crystal structures and among monomers in these structures reveal motions that affect how closely fusion loops approach one another at the 3-fold axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).

In contrast, the HAP2 monomers in magenta and green and the <italic>Tick-borne encephaliti</italic>s monomers in cyan and magenta differ from one another in circumferential position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>).

Of the fusion loop segment from residue 167 to 204, only fragments from residue 182 to 194 (monomer A) or from residue 184 to 190 or 191 (monomers B and C) were built in the previous structure. Moreover, the entirety of these segments differs from that in our structure. The segment from Arg185 to Cys190 in the 2.6 Å structure is contracted in the 3.3 Å structure to form an α-helix (α+ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). The difference in conformation and the contraction might result from protease cleavage of the loops flanking this segment in the previous structure. Whatever the cause, fusion loop residues Phe192 and Trp193, present in only monomer A in the 3.3 Å structure, differ in position by 6 and 9 Å, respectively, from our structure. Although the conformation of the fusion loop fragments in the previous structure differs from that in ours, these fragments are held in roughly the same position by binding of Arg185 to its carbonyl cage and disulfide linkage of Cys190 to Cys167 (Arg185 and Cys 190 are included in the shortest of the fragments previously traced, from residues 184 to 190). Interestingly, between the two structures, the Cα atom of Cys190 differs more in position (4.2 Å) than the central carbon of Arg185’s guanido group (1.1 Å) or its Cα atom (2.4 Å), showing that this segment of the loop is anchored in position more by Arg185 than by Cys190. Thus, positioning of the Arg185 sidechain in the carbonyl cage of the D2.2 subdomain is robust to substantial movements in the loop it subtends.</p><p>HDX provided further evidence for differential mobility within the two fusion loops. Peptide 173–188 containing Arg185 and a portion of fusion loop 1 with the α1-helix was in rapid exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Moreover, the backbone amide hydrogens in this fusion loop 1 peptide exchanged more rapidly in trimeric than monomeric HAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These results are consistent with the paucity of backbone hydrogen bonds in the non-helical portion of this segment and its exposure to solvent in the trimeric structure. In contrast to fusion loop 1, fusion -loop 2 peptides 192–198 and 193–200 containing the η1 and α2-helices exchanged with only moderate kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>), and exchange was decreased in the trimer compared to the monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The kinetics of exchange in each overlapping peptide showed two distinct groups of residues, with one group of residues exchanging from 0 to 10 min, and another group not exchanging from 10 to 300 min and thus highly stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D-E</xref>). Therefore, at least a portion of the loop two sequence W<sup>193</sup>SDPLDIL<sup>200</sup>, which contains three of five loop two residues implicated in fusion, has a stable structure in both the monomer and trimer. The increase in loop one and decrease in loop two dynamics suggest that both regions alter in structure or exposure upon trimer formation.</p><p>Surprisingly, secondary structures in HAP2 domains D1, D2.2, and D3 that are closer to the 3-fold axis, and more buried between protomers of the trimeric structure, tend to exchange more rapidly than regions that are exposed on the trimer perimeter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). In D1, the A0B0I0H0G0 β-sheet faces the trimer axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and exchanges more rapidly than the J0C0D0E0F0 β-sheet that is exposed to solvent on the perimeter of the trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In D3, the edge of the β-sandwich faces the trimer axis. Axis-proximal β-strands B, C, D, and E exchange more rapidly than axis-distal β-strands A and G. In D2.2, the exposed b and d β-strands were in slow exchange. Furthermore, the c β-strand and adjacent loops, which are close to the 3-fold axis, exchanged more rapidly. Similarly, the axis-proximal α3-helix was in moderately fast exchange. These HDX results show that in most domains, regions in trimer interfaces are in more rapid exchange. Rapid exchange, which largely correlates with flexibility, may be a specialization that permits reshaping during monomer to trimer transition, and alterations in D2.1 and D2.2 orientation in fusion-state structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Hydrophobic residues in the axis-proximal α1- and α2-helices are more important in fusion than in the axis-distal η1 helix</title><p>Our finding that the long fusion loop of HAP2 displayed three distinct helices, each projecting sets of hydrophobic residues that could interact with the lipid bilayer of the target membrane, was unexpected.

Only a few pairs were found in the wt- x wt+ cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), owing to the rapid fusion and formation of quadri-ciliated zygotes exhibited by the <italic>hap2 minus</italic> gametes expressing wild-type HAP2-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref> first panel).

Fusion with <italic>fh2</italic> gametes was significantly reduced and less than half of wild-type at all time points. These results demonstrate that the apically exposed, hydrophobic residues in each of the helices in the HAP2 fusion loops are indeed important in cell fusion during <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> fertilization. Furthermore, W173 and F177 in the α1-helix mutated in <italic>fh1</italic> and L197, L200, and I201 in the α2-helix mutated in <italic>fh3</italic> were essential for fusion, while F192 and W193 in the more distal η1-helix mutated in <italic>fh2</italic> were only moderately, albeit significantly, required for fusion.</p><p>Thus, the mutational results showed that residues in the α1 and α2-helices, which are proximal to the trimer 3-fold axis, have an essential role in fusion, while residues in the η1-helix, which are distal from the trimer 3-fold axis, are only marginally important in fusion. Below, we interpret our structural and functional results, and structures of viral fusogens such as those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, in support of a model in which the fusion loops in each HAP2 monomer approach the 3-fold axis in the fusion state interrogated in vivo by mutation. In this model, the HAP2 crystal structure represents an intermediate state in fusion. Pivoting or iris-like movements in D2.1 and/or D2.2 during the fusion reaction result in a unitary fusion surface with essential, axis-proximal α1- and α2-helices at the center of a membrane interaction surface, and less-necessary, axis-distal η1 helices at the periphery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have characterized the crystal structure of HAP2 from <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> in a trimeric fusion state at 2.6 Å, the dynamics of its polypeptide backbone in both monomeric and trimeric states, and the functional importance in gamete fusion of residues in its fusion loop. We were fortunate that our structure allowed us to completely trace the unusually long fusion loop in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> HAP2, revealing that the hydrophobic residues in its 2 loops are apically exposed on 3 helices.</p><p>Our structure also revealed other long loops in HAP2, which altogether make its sequence from D1 to D3 (560 residues in total) longer than in previously crystallized class II fusogens from viruses (391 to 431 residues) or a <italic>C. elegans</italic> somatic cell fusogen (509 residues) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pérez-Vargas et al., 2014</xref>). HAP2 also has substantially more N-glycosylation sites, and longer putatively O-glycosylated Ser, Thr, and Pro-rich sequences, than viral class II glycoproteins. It is possible that these long loops and glycans stabilize HAP2, or the fusing membrane bilayers, by decreasing the volume accessible to alternative disordered protein or membrane states. They may therefore have functional significance. An alternative explanation is that the requirement for class II viral fusogens to pack tightly against one another and other proteins in an icosahedral lattice on viral surfaces may select against long loops and bulky glycans, whereas HAP2 should lack similar evolutionary constraints.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>HAP2 dynamics and flexibility within D2</title><p>HDX provided insights into the backbone dynamics of HAP2 and differences between its monomeric and trimeric states. Slower exchange at multiple domain-domain interfaces in the trimeric state compared to the monomeric state was consistent with less exposure or structural rearrangements upon trimer formation. Regions of slower exchange in trimers included interfaces buried on D3, and buried on D1 and D2.1, where D3 packs against D1 and D2.1 in trimers, and thus provided evidence for a conformational transition from a more linear arrangement of these domains in monomers that was altered to the arrangement with the hairpin bend between D1 and D3 in trimers. Conversely, slower exchange in the monomeric state in a loop in D3 that is exposed in the trimeric state suggested that this loop could contact D1 in a more linear arrangement of domains in the monomer. Large HDX differences were also found in fusion loops 1 and 2 between the trimeric and monomeric forms, showing that these loops are capable of structural alterations or differ in exposure in these states. Importantly, in both the monomeric and trimeric states of HAP2, its fusion loops were highly to moderately dynamic. The loop that separates the two fusion loops, with Arg185 at its tip, was especially dynamic.</p><p>Comparisons between HAP2 structures show that D2.2 can tilt at its junction with D2.1, and that the fusion loops can rock at Arg185. The D2.1—D2.2 junction is thin, with only four polypeptide connections, none of which contain canonical secondary structure. Comparison between the two structures shows considerable displacement of the loop with Arg185 at its tip and conformational change within the portion of this loop resolved in the previous HAP2 structure, despite little displacement of the Arg185 guanido group relative to its carbonyl cage. Carbonyl cages support rocking motion of the PSI domain relative to the hybrid domain in integrins and allosteric motion in selectins at the lectin-EGF domain interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Springer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xia and Springer, 2014</xref>). In HAP2, HDX showed that the loop with Arg185 at its tip was in rapid exchange, while the carbonyl cage exchanged slowly. Slow exchange of the cage is consistent with its construction from secondary structure elements that have many other contacts and hydrogen bonds in the structure, while the long loop with Arg185 at its tip has few significant contacts or hydrogen bonds except to itself. Interestingly, PFAM 10699 forms much of the carbonyl cage and provides three of the four residues that hydrogen bond to Arg185 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Therefore, one of the drivers for conservation of this segment appears to be the carbonyl cage.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A model for merger of the fusion loops in each HAP2 monomer to form a large, unified fusion surface </title><p>We now discuss evidence that suggests that our HAP2 crystal structure is an intermediate state, and that in the state interrogated by mutagenesis, the fusion loops merge at the 3-fold trimer axis to form a large, unified fusion surface. According to current models for viral class II fusion protein conformational change, trimers pass through early and late fusion state structures on the pathway to membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harrison, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klein et al., 2013</xref>). Pivoting at the D1—D2.1 interface is well described in the literature, both between fusion state structures, and between pre-fusion and fusion state structures. The case for a continuum in D2 or D2.2 orientation is especially well made by the <italic>Dengue 1</italic>, <italic>Tick-borne encephalitis</italic>, and <italic>St. Louis encephalitis</italic> flaviviral fusogens. Their fusion-state structures show essentially identical conformations in D1 and D3; in contrast, D2 orientation varies markedly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Thus, <italic>Dengue 1</italic> fusion loops are in symmetric, intimate van der Waals contact at the 3-fold axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nayak et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>Tick-borne encephaliti</italic>s fusion loops are in asymmetric, less intimate contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bressanelli et al., 2004</xref>), and <italic>St. Louis encephalitis</italic> fusion loops are distal from the 3-fold axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luca et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, these fusogens are 36, 42, and 49% identical in sequence to one another, and have identical fusion loop residues. Because these flaviviral fusogens are closely related in sequence and function, it is reasonable to hypothesize that each passes through a continuum of conformations similar to that exhibited by the entire set of structures. We think of these flavivirus fusogens as homologues of the same protein in different species, just as we think of HAP2 as the same protein in different species; indeed, these flaviviral fusogens are much more closely related to one another than HAP2 fusogens from different species, which show only 12% to 35% sequence identity for the representatives in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>) and vary greatly in their fusion loops. Thus, flaviviral fusion state crystal structures appear to represent different frames in a movie that plays similarly for all flavivirus fusogens, and by extension, for other structurally and functionally homologous class II fusion proteins such as HAP2.</p><p>Our in vivo analysis of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> HAP2 mutants showed that the hydrophobic residues in the fusion loops are important during the fusion reaction, consistent with a role in interaction with the membrane of the <italic>plus</italic> gamete. Moreover, the three topographically distinct sets of fusogenic residues in each HAP2 monomer provided a unique opportunity to test their relative importance both within the pre-fusion state of HAP2 on resting gametes and during the fusion process per se. None of the mutations in the fusion loop helices had any detectable effect on expression or localization of HAP2 in resting gametes, indicating that these residues have little if any function before the fusion reaction begins. On the other hand, mutation of residues in the α1 and α2-helices decreased fusion efficiency by 50 to 100-fold, while mutations in the η1-helix decreased fusion efficiency by only 2-fold. Previous mutation of the η1-helix yielded identical results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fédry et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, mutation of identical residues, Phe and Trp, in the α1 and η1-helices yielded markedly different results, showing that differences in location, rather than character of the mutated residues, was responsible for the differences in phenotype.</p><p>Several models potentially could explain our overall findings. One model proposes that the current crystal structure mediates fusion, and that each monomeric D2.2 associates independently with the target membrane. Another model, proposed with a viral fusogen splayed more than here, is that splayed trimers could associate laterally to form rosettes, in which the outer faces of D2.2 associate to form trimer-trimer associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gibbons et al., 2004</xref>). A third model proposes that in the final fusion state, the inner, 3-fold axis proximal face of D2.2 converges on the 3-fold axis as seen in <italic>Dengue</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harrison, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nayak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klein et al., 2013</xref>). The fusion process is highly cooperative, and thus all models postulate that multiple trimers nearby one another are required for fusion.</p><p>We test these models with a concept from structural biology in which it has been found that the most important residues for protein interactions are predominantly near the center of interaction surfaces, that is in hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clackson and Wells, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bogan and Thorn, 1998</xref>). In the model in which monomers are sufficient, the fusion loops in each monomer are separated from one another by solvent, and function independently of one another. In monomers, the least important η1 helix lies in between the most important α1 and α2-helices; therefore, the hotspot model is not consistent with the monomers functioning separately in the state most mutationally important for fusion. In the model in which trimers associate laterally into rosettes, association occurs through the monomer face distal from the 3-fold axis that bears the η1 helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gibbons et al., 2004</xref>). This helix is the least important in fusion, and thus association through rosettes in the state interrogated by mutagenesis is not consistent with the hotspot concept. In the model in which the monomers close up at the 3-fold axis, the α1 and α2-helices on neighboring monomers would approach one another and be central in a fusion surface while the η1-helix would be on the periphery. A single, trimeric fusion surface is consistent with the hotspot model, since the α1 and α2-helices at the center of the membrane interaction surface are critically important for fusion, while the η1-helix on the outer periphery of the interface is only marginally important. Thus, in the most mutationally important state for fusion, the hotspot concept argues against the monomers being splayed apart and acting independently or associating into rosettes, and argues for merger of the monomers at the three-fold axis into a single fusion surface. The mutational results thus suggest that our crystal structure does not represent the final fusion state of HAP2 during the fusion reaction, but instead is one frame in a movie of a model of HAP2 conformational change during the gamete fusion process.</p><p>Our results do not argue against a role during a multi-step fusion process for interaction of splayed trimers or rosettes of splayed trimers with the target membrane. Instead, the results argue for approach of the α1 and α2-helices to the 3-fold axis in the state that is most critical for membrane fusion, which is likely to correspond to the transition state for membrane fusion. Transition states are by definition the highest energy states during reaction processes, and thus the states most in need of structural stabilization. Correspondingly, we propose that the transition state is the most sensitive state to mutation, and therefore that the fusion surfaces of each monomer move towards the 3-fold axis to form a single, large fusion surface in the final state for membrane fusion, which would also likely be the state in which the fusion loops are most deeply buried in the membrane.</p><p>Our structural and dynamics studies on HAP2 and analysis of flaviviral fusion state structures provide plausible pathways by which D2.2 in each monomer can approach the 3-fold axis to form a common fusion surface. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, the flaviviral fusion loops in each monomer move counterclockwise by 11 Å at Phe108 and, like a closing iris, come 8.5 Å closer to the 3-fold axis and into van der Waals contact. This movement is accomplished by tilting at the D1—D2.1 junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). The D2.2 framework in our HAP2 structure is at a similar distance from the 3-fold axis and has a similar D1—D2.1 tilt as the more distal flaviviral structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,F</xref>), resulting in the similar positions at 5 o’clock of the green monomer fusion loops in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>. Similar movement at the D1--D2.1 junction in HAP2 is plausible, which would bring the green monomer fusion loops in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> closer to the 3-fold axis and toward the 3 o’clock position as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. Note that in iris-like motion, W101 in flaviviral fusogens remains distal from the 3-fold axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>), as would the η1-helix in HAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). HAP2 and flaviviral fusogens also show tilting at the D2.1—D2.2 junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). Moreover, crystal structure comparisons show and HDX suggests that the HAP2 fusion loops can rock at the carbonyl cage. We expect that tilting at the D1—D2.1 junction resulting in iris-like motion of fusion loops, tilting at the D2.1—D2.2 junction, and rocking of fusion loops in the carbonyl cage may all contribute to the approach toward the 3-fold axis of the fusion loops in HAP2. The orientation with respect to the 3-fold axis of the three, hydrophobic residue-bearing helices within each monomer of HAP2 are likely to change little during movement toward the 3-fold axis, as seen in flavivirus fusogens. The α1-helix of one monomer would come into contact with the α2-helix of its neighbor, whereas the η1-helix would form the outer edge on the perimeter of the merged trimeric fusion surface.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39772.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>HAP2 fusion loops and comparison to iris-like movements of flavivirus fusion loops.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Current HAP2 structure.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Fusion surface structure, function, and dynamics of gamete fusogen HAP2&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrea Musacchio as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study extends recent work by the Rey lab on the membrane fusogen HAP2 that mediates gamete fusion and that resembles viral class II fusion proteins such as those found on viruses like <italic>dengue</italic> and <italic>West Nile</italic>. The new structure reported here reveals that the fusion loops are not organized as those of class II viral fusion glycoproteins and that they form three helices with apically-pointing hydrophobic residues. The authors mutated those residues and demonstrated that the hydrophobic residues in the axis-proximal α1- and α2-helices are more important for fusion activity than those in the axis-distal η1 helix. The apex of domain D2 (D2.2) has not the same orientation in the two crystal structures suggesting that D2.2 can tilt at its junction with D2.1, and that the fusions loop can rock at Arg185. Besides the structure, the authors also characterized HAP2 dynamics by HDX in both its monomeric and trimeric states revealing D2 flexibility.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers and the reviewing editor appreciated the quality of the work and concluded that it adds substantial information beyond that published by the Rey laboratory. There were no substantial concerns, and thus only minor revisions are required as detailed below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors consider that they have crystallized an intermediate. This may be correct. However, the &quot;hotspot&quot; argument is not convincing. The &quot;hotspot&quot; model applies to protein-protein interactions and probably not to protein membrane interaction.</p><p>Introduction, last paragraph: the authors have not characterized an intermediate on the &quot;fusion pathway&quot; (there is no membrane in the crystal) but rather an intermediate on the &quot;structural transition pathway&quot;.</p><p>Subsection “HAP2 dynamics and flexibility within D2”, last paragraph: about the four polypeptide segments forming the D2.1-D2.2 junction, the authors write that none of them contain secondary structure. This is not correct; in fact, none of them contain canonical secondary structure.</p><p>Figure 4B is not easy to read/decipher…</p><p>Figures 4C and 2C are redundant.</p><p>In Figure 7E, F and G, the meaning of p is not clear.

I was able to figure out the hydrogen deuterium exchange studies, but only by reading some other material, and I have no idea what Dali searches are and was too lazy to look this up. I suspect the authors could try to put themselves of the shoes of a virologist and do some nice editing so that we non-structural souls can follow the experiments more easily. Nice job in describing the structure and how it has both similarities and differences to previous studies, including other class II fusion proteins.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39772.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors consider that they have crystallized an intermediate.

The &quot;hotspot&quot; model applies to protein-protein interactions and probably not to protein membrane interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>While the hotspot model has only been demonstrated for protein-protein interactions, the reviewer proposes no reason why it should not be applicable to protein-membrane interactions. The physical chemistry of protein-protein interactions holds for both water-soluble proteins and membrane embedded proteins. Hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions drive protein-protein interactions for water-soluble proteins. Hydrophobic exposure to solvent is minimized. Membrane-embedded proteins interact by minimizing exposure of polar surface to the lipid environment. The importance of residues in the middle of protein-protein interfaces is seen in both types of interactions. Lipids have both hydrophobic and polar regions like proteins. Thus we believe that the hotspot model will also hold for protein-lipid interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction, last paragraph: the authors have not characterized an intermediate on the &quot;fusion pathway&quot; (there is no membrane in the crystal) but rather an intermediate on the &quot;structural transition pathway&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and have so revised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “HAP2 dynamics and flexibility within D2”, last paragraph: about the four polypeptide segments forming the D2.1-D2.2 junction, the authors write that none of them contain secondary structure.

Figure 2C is color-coded according to HDX and shows that Arg185 and its loop exchange much more rapidly than the carbonyl cage. Only Arg185 is labeled, making it easier for the reader to focus on the key idea of the carbonyl cage without interference from unneeded labeling. Figure 4C has a simpler color scheme making it much easier to see the hydrogen bonded O and N atoms and follow the story of Figure 4 in the same color scheme. And it labels the residues that hydrogen bond to Arg185 and shows that most that contribute to the cage are in in PFAM 10699, thereby providing a reasonable explanation for conservation of the “HAP2/GCS1 domain”. Actually, Figure 2C and 4C are each very small and are placed within their figures in space that will just be wasted white space if we remove one of them. So there is very little gain to removing one of them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 7E, F and G, the meaning of p is not clear. Particularly in Figure F: I would like to know with which samples p is associated</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the need for clarification. We provide a revised Figure 7. The experiments in these 3 parts of Figure 7 present results from bioassays showing that the fusion helices mutants fh1, fh2, and fh3 are competent in all of the steps leading up to membrane fusion, but, like the parental hap2 mutants, are blocked at bilayer merger. In the legend, we have now indicated the statistical tests which led to the p-values shown in the figure. Graphpad PRISM software was used to perform all statistical analyses for the assays in Figure 7 and is listed in our key resource table. For each assay, the following statistical analysis was performed: first, a non-parametric ANOVA (the Kruskal Wallis test) was applied to identify whether a significant difference existed among the multiple groups assayed for each variable (ciliary adhesion, gamete activation, and mating structure adhesion) tested. Second, if a statistically significant difference was observed among the sample groups for a particular variable, Dunn’s post test (a follow-up test to the Kruskal-Wallis) was then performed to identify the pairwise comparisons between sample groups that were significantly different from one another. The lack of clarity noted by Reviewer #1 in (F) likely arose because we reported the insignificant p-value for the Kruskal Wallis test (all 6 samples were indistinguishable in extent of gamete activation, and a Dunn’s post-test for pairwise comparisons was unnecessary). To reduce potential reader confusion, we have now decided to limit the number of p-values displayed in (E-G). We have removed the expected Kruskal-Wallis test’s insignificant p-value in (F) as well as the p-value in (E) documenting the expected reduced ciliary adhesion in the wt- x wt+. These expected results are now described in the legend. We retained the insignificant pairwise p-values in (G). We believe these simplifications now highlight the most important result from the assays, namely, that the fusion helix mutants (fh1-, fh2-, and fh3-) are indistinguishable from their parental hap2 mutants in ciliary adhesion, gamete activation, and mating structure adhesion. Thus, their inability to form zygotes is specifically a consequence of their inability to bring about bilayer merger.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My suggestions are to make the paper more accessible to a non-structural biologist! I was able to figure out the hydrogen deuterium exchange studies, but only by reading some other material, and I have no idea what Dali searches are and was too lazy to look this up. I suspect the authors could try to put themselves of the shoes of a virologist and do some nice editing so that we non-structural souls can follow the experiments more easily. Nice job in describing the structure and how it has both similarities and differences to previous studies, including other class II fusion proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We replaced “Dali searches” with “Search for structurally homologous domains” and added a reference.</p></body></sub-article></article>
