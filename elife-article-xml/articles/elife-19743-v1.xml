phase of spliceosome assembly, but the assembly steps leading to an exon definition complex (EDC) and how PTBP1 might modulate them are not clear. We found that PTBP1 binding in the flanking introns allowed normal U2AF and U1 snRNP binding to the target exon splice sites but blocked U2 snRNP assembly in HeLa nuclear extract. Characterizing a purified PTBP1-repressed complex, as well as an active early complex and the final EDC by SILAC-MS, we identified extensive PTBP1-modulated changes in exon RNP composition. The active early complex formed in the absence of PTBP1 proceeded to assemble an EDC with the eviction of hnRNP proteins, the late recruitment of SR proteins, and binding of the U2 snRNP. These results demonstrate that during early stages of splicing, exon RNP complexes are highly dynamic with many proteins failing to bind during PTBP1 arrest.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19743.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19743.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>RNA binding protein</kwd><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>ribonucleoprotein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM049662</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>Douglas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>Douglas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21CA170786</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>Shalini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM089778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wohlschlegel</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology, Thailand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Royal Thai Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wongpalee</surname><given-names>Somsakul Pop</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A protein regulator of alternative pre-mRNA splicing arrests spliceosome assembly at a previously unrecognized step that defines new intermediate stages in the formation of exon complexes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is a key regulatory process that determines the output of most genes of higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lee and Rio, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbosa-Morais et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>). Splicing choices are directed by proteins of multiple classes and structural families that bind to the nascent pre-mRNA to alter spliceosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lee and Rio, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>). One family of related regulators is the <underline>s</underline>erine-a<underline>r</underline>ginine-rich proteins (SR proteins), which usually bind within an exon to stimulate its splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Long and Caceres, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Busch and Hertel, 2012</xref>). Other proteins are more generally classed as the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP proteins) that belong to multiple structural families and bind to specific sites throughout the nascent pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Busch and Hertel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dreyfuss et al., 1993</xref>). Depending on the family and binding site location, hnRNP proteins can act to either repress or stimulate splicing of particular exons or splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>). The interactions of these pre-mRNA-bound regulatory proteins with the general splicing apparatus or spliceosome are largely unknown.</p><p>The pathway of spliceosome assembly has been determined for introns of yeast and for several unusually short mammalian introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Will and LÃ¼hrmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>). An early step in spliceosome assembly across a short intron is the formation of the prespliceosome or A complex that contains the U1 snRNP bound at the 5â splice site, the U2AF 35/65 heterodimer bound at the polypyrimidine tract and 3â splice site, and the U2 snRNP bound to the branch point. This A complex recruits the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP and other components of the full B complex spliceosome, before undergoing extensive rearrangements and compositional changes to form the catalytic spliceosome (called B<sup>act</sup>) with the intron splice sites assembled into the catalytic center of the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Will and LÃ¼hrmann, 2011</xref>). In contrast to this pathway of intron assembly, a typical transcript in animal cells has very long introns, and the initial recognition of splice sites and prespliceosome assembly occur on the short exons to form <underline>e</underline>xon <underline>d</underline>efinition <underline>c</underline>omplexes (EDCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berget, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">De Conti and Baralle, 2012</xref>). These EDCs then interact across a long intron to form the catalytic spliceosome. The EDC contains the U1 snRNP, the U2 Auxiliary Factor (U2AF), and the U2 snRNP bound to the 5â splice site, the 3â splice site, and the branch point, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berget, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">De Conti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Robberson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chiara and Reed, 1995</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hoffman and Grabowski, 1992</xref>). The EDC is sometimes called an A-like complex or an exon-defined A complex (EDA) because of its similar size and composition to an intronic prespliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berget, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sharma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schneider et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">House and Lynch, 2006</xref>). Like an intronic prespliceosome, the binding of the U2 snRNP to the branch point in the EDC is preceded by U1 snRNP and U2AF binding and requires ATPÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Will and LÃ¼hrmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berget, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">De Conti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Staknis and Reed, 1994</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Michaud and Reed, 1993</xref>). Early steps in assembly of the EDC are poorly characterized. For example, the roles and fates of the hnRNP and SR proteins, which bind before EDC completion, are unknown. Elucidating the sequence of events leading to this intricate ribonucleoprotein (RNP) is a prerequisite to understanding the mechanisms of splicing regulation.</p><p>One extensively studied splicing regulator is the polypyrimidine-tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1, also called PTB or hnRNP I). PTBP1 and its paralogs PTBP2 and PTBP3 control a variety of developmental splicing programs and have been particularly studied in neuronal, muscle, and testis development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Linares et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Keppetipola et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Spellman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zagore et al., 2015</xref>). PTBP1 contains four RRM-type RNA binding domains, each binding a triplet of C and U nucleotides, giving the full protein a high affinity for runs of mixed pyrimidines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Oberstrass et al., 2005</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auweter and Allain, 2008</xref>). Exons repressed by PTBP1 usually have multiple binding sites found in a variety of locations relative to the target exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Linares et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Xue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Llorian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amir-Ahmady et al., 2005</xref>). The mechanism of PTBP1-induced exon skipping seems to vary with the location of the binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Keppetipola et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Spellman and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wagner and Garcia-Blanco, 2001</xref>). A PTBP1-binding site within exon 6 of Fas pre-mRNA blocks the U1 snRNP-dependent recruitment of U2AF65 to the upstream 3â splice site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Izquierdo et al., 2005</xref>). In other exons, including exon 6B of Î²-tropomyosin pre-mRNA and exon 10 of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor Î³2 pre-mRNA, PTBP1 directly competes with U2AF65 for binding to the polypyrimidine tract of the 3â splice site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">SauliÃ¨re et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashiya and Grabowski, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Singh et al., 1995</xref>). Repression of the Src N1 exon requires two binding sites, one embedded in the polypyrimidine tract of the 3â splice site and one in the downstream intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amir-Ahmady et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan and Black, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan and Black, 1995</xref>). These sites each bind a least one PTBP1 monomer. The upstream site binds with high affinity and appears to block U2AF binding similar to what is seen with Î²-tropomyosin exon 6B, but is not sufficient for full splicing repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amir-Ahmady et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan and Black, 1995</xref>). The required downstream intronic site binds PTBP1 with lower affinity but is stimulated for binding by the upstream site, implying an interaction between the PTBP1 proteins bound at the two sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amir-Ahmady et al., 2005</xref>). An exon repressed by these two sites still recruits the U1 snRNP to its 5â splice site, but this U1 snRNP fails to interact with and splice to an EDC on exon 4 downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sharma et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, the downstream PTBP1 directly contacts stem-loop 4 of the U1 snRNA bound to the N1 exon, and this interaction is proposed to block the interaction with the exon 4 complex further downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sharma et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">2014</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the exons described above, many PTBP1-repressed exons have binding sites at relatively distal positions within each flanking intron that would not interfere with the target exon or its splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Linares et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Xue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Llorian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Spellman and Smith, 2006</xref>). In one model, the simultaneous binding to these sites is proposed to create an RNA loop that somehow excludes the exon from the splicing apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Oberstrass et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Spellman and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chou et al., 2000</xref>). Alternatively, PTBP1 was proposed to multimerize across the exon between the two binding sites to prevent exon complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Spellman and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wagner and Garcia-Blanco, 2001</xref>). However, this has not been tested by direct examination of exon RNP complexes and of how their assembly is altered by the splicing regulator.</p><p>In earlier work, we found that Src alternative exon N1 failed to properly interact with the active EDC assembled onto the constitutive exon 4 downstream, despite the presence of the U1 snRNP bound to the 5â splice site of the N1 exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sharma et al., 2008</xref>). In that study, we could not dissect changes in RNP complexes assembled on the N1 exon that were caused by PTBP1 because of the presence of exon 4 in <italic>cis</italic>. To examine individual exon complexes, we developed an in vitro <italic>trans</italic>-splicing assay for a model PTBP1-repressed exon that has distal flanking PTBP1-binding sites in both introns. We found that PTBP1 binding allows normal U2AF65 and U1 snRNP recruitment to this exon, but prevents U2 snRNP assembly and EDC formation. Using SILAC-MS, we identified extensive compositional differences between a PTBP1-repressed exon complex, an active early exon complex, and an EDC with bound U2 snRNP. PTBP1 acts to prevent the remodeling of an early exon RNP during exon definition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Distal PTBP1 binding upstream and downstream of an alternative exon represses both splice sites</title><p>In earlier work, we found that PTBP1-binding sites upstream and downstream of an otherwise efficiently spliced exon would repress its splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amir-Ahmady et al., 2005</xref>). Both PTBP1 sites were required for splicing repression, and both were active even when separated from the splice sites of the exon, indicating that PTBP1 did not simply block binding of spliceosomal components. Genome-wide binding analyses by <underline>c</underline>ross<underline>l</underline>inking <underline>i</underline>mmuno<underline>p</underline>recipitation (CLIP) identify many such PTBP1-dependent exons with distal flanking binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Xue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Llorian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Han et al., 2014</xref>). In one study, 95 exons were identified in mouse ES cells that were both derepressed upon PTBP1 depletion and bound PTBP1 in iCLIP analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Linares et al., 2015</xref>). Of these exons, 56 (59%) exhibited PTBP1 binding only in distal regions of the flanking introns, and most of these exhibited binding both upstream and downstream. No exons were seen to bind PTBP1 only in the exon itself or its 3â splice site.</p><p>To examine the splicing and RNP assembly of an exon with distal PTBP-binding sites, we modified the alternative exon N1 of Src, which has adjacent PTBP1-binding sites that repress its splicing in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan and Black, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">1995</xref>Â ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chou et al., 2000</xref>). We shifted the position of the PTBP1-binding site upstream of N1 away from the polypyrimidine tract of the 3â splice site to a position 25-nt upstream of the branch point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that should not hinder U2 snRNP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gozani et al., 1996</xref>). We replaced the polypyrimidine tract that contained this PTBP1 site with the 3â splice site of the Adenovirus Major Late first intron to allow efficient U2AF65 recruitment without competition with PTBP1. We previously showed that upstream PTBP1 could repress this splice site in an in vivo reporter transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amir-Ahmady et al., 2005</xref>). The 5â splice site at the downstream side of N1 was also modified to match the consensus splice site, which splices more efficiently than the native N1 site, and to remove potential cryptic sites nearby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chou et al., 2000</xref>). The sequence downstream from N1, which contains PTBP1-binding sites required for splicing repression, was left intact. The strong splice sites in the test exon allow for more efficient splicing in trans-splicing assays (see below), and we previously found that similar constructs containing these sites were indeed repressible by PTBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amir-Ahmady et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chou et al., 2000</xref>). PTBP1-mediated splicing repression of this test exon was confirmed in <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing assays using a two-exon substrate containing the N1 exon and the downstream constitutive Src exon 4, with either a wildtype or mutant PTBP1-binding site upstream. Mutation of the PTBP1-binding site enhanced splicing of the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> and see below).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19743.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distal PTBP1 binding flanking an alternative exon represses both splice sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the modified Src N1 exon RNA used in this study.

This assay allows measurement of splicing activity of both splice sites of the test exon. It may also provide a better model of splicing within a multi-exon vertebrate pre-mRNA, where long introns separate short exons that must undergo exon definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berget, 1995</xref>). We incubated the N1 exon transcripts containing either the wildtype or mutant upstream PTBP1-binding site in HeLa nuclear extract to pre-assemble exon RNPÂ complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). In parallel reactions, transcripts containing portions of the first or the second exon of the Adenovirus Major Late pre-mRNA (AML), including either the 5â splice site or the 3â splice site, were also pre-incubated in the extract. To enhance splicing of these Adeno transcripts relative to the splicing of N1 to itself, the Adeno RNAs (50 nM) were in 25-fold excess over the N1 exon RNA (2 nM). This is lower than the RNA concentration used for many <italic>trans</italic>-splicing reactions and lower than the approximate concentration of the U1 snRNP (200 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chiara and Reed, 1995</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Konarska and Sharp, 1987</xref>). It is still possible that the excess Adeno RNA also affects splicing by titrating RNA binding proteins, but this effect should be the same for reactions containing either wild-type and mutant N1 exons. After pre-incubation the two sets of reactions were mixed, and incubation continued under standard splicing conditions to allow <italic>trans</italic>-splicing between the N1 exon and either the Adeno 5â or 3â splice site. After RNA isolation, spliced products were analyzed by primer extension using primers annealed to the 3â exon of the products.</p><p>The N1 RNA lacking the upstream PTBP1-binding site was seen to splice to either of the Adeno splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> lane 1 at 90 nts. and 1C lane 1 at 246 nts). That these products resulted from splicing was confirmed by RNase H-mediated depletion of the U2 snRNP, which led to loss of these bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> cf. lane 1 to lane 2). The formation of the <italic>trans</italic>-spliced product between the N1 exon and the 5â AML exon was strongly inhibited by the upstream PTBP1 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> cf. lane 3 to 4).

The wildtype transcript bound by PTBP1 formed a typical heterogeneous complex accompanied by a small amount of a more slowly migrating complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> lane 1â4). In contrast, the mutant transcript that lacked the upstream PTBP1-binding site and was active for splicing formed much more of the larger exon complex. The mutant transcript initially formed the faster migrating complexes that were converted to the larger complex over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> lane 5â8). This larger complex was ATP-dependent and required intact U1 and U2 snRNPs, confirming its identity as an exon definition complex (EDC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> cf. lane 2 to lane 4 and 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). To further confirm that the lack of EDC formation on the wildtype transcript was due to PTBP1 binding, we immuno-depleted PTBP1 from the nuclear extract. Depletion of PTBP1 stimulated the assembly of the EDC on the wildtype exon, whereas mock-depleted extract remained inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> cf. lane 3 to 4). PTBP1 depletion or mock depletion did not affect formation of the EDC on the mutant substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> cf. lane 5 to 6).</p><p>These analyses defined exon complexes in three regulatory states. 1) A repressed complex that assembles early onto the wildtype RNA in the presence of PTBP1 and does not progress further. 2) An active early complex that assembles onto the mutant exon lacking upstream PTBP1, and then converted into 3) the exon definition complex. The gel system did not resolve differences between the repressed complex and the active early complex. The reactions were treated with heparin prior to gel separation to reduce aggregation and help material enter the gel. Heparin can strip U1 and other factors from the RNA and prevent resolution of complexes similar to the âE complexâ, previously defined for spliceosome assembly onto introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Reed, 1990</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Michaud and Reed, 1991</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Michaud and Reed, 1993</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sharma et al., 2005</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Das and Reed, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kent and MacMillan, 2002</xref>).

To examine the composition of the three N1 exon complexes, we tagged the mutant and wildtype RNAs with the MS2 stem-loop to allow their purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As described previously, the RNAs were pre-bound with the MS2 coat protein-maltose binding protein fusion (MS2-MBP), and then assembled into exon RNP complexes under standard splicing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sharma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jurica et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Das R, 2000</xref>). Reactions were incubated for 30 min to allow isolation of both the active early and EDC complexes. Complexes were resolved by ultracentrifugation in glycerol density gradients. As seen on native gels, the RNAs generated the two complexes as separable peaks on the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A larger percentage of the mutant RNA was converted to the EDC (and its aggregates at the bottom) compared to the wildtype RNA. Peak fractions for each complex were pooled and affinity purified on amylose resin. RNA from each complex was analyzed on urea-PAGE stained with SYBR Gold. As expected, the repressed and active early complexes contained only the U1 snRNA and the exon RNA substrate, and these were present in equimolar amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> lane 1, 2 and graph). This is in agreement with results showing that the U1 snRNP is bound to the repressed N1 exon, where it interacts with PTBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sharma et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, the purified EDC contained both the U1 and U2 snRNAs in a precise 1:1 stoichiometry relative to the N1 exon RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> lane 3 and graph). This is similar to the prespliceosomal A complex assembled onto an intron, but the splice sites flank an exon and thus the EDC has an inverted 5â-3â orientation compared to the A complex.

Previous studies of an exonic PTBP1-binding site found that the exon-bound PTBP1 prevented the U1 snRNP-dependent recruitment of U2AF65 to the upstream polypyrimidine tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Izquierdo et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, PTBP1 bound within the polypyrimidine tract of the 3â splice site itself is thought to directly block U2AF binding. To examine this in an exon with distal PTBP1 binding sites, we measured the levels of U2AF65 within the MS2 affinity-purified exon complexes by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These were normalized to CBP80, which binds in equimolar amounts to the 5â cap of each RNA. Compared to PTBP1, which is expected to bind at higher levels to the wildtype RNA than the mutant RNA missing one of the PTBP1 binding sites, U2AF65 bound to the RNAs in equal amounts regardless of PTBP1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> cf. lane 1 to 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 6). This U2AF65 binding was not affected by moderate changes in salt concentration during isolation (80 to 150âmM). Similar levels of U2AF65 bound to wildtype and mutant RNA were also seen in mass spec data of the repressed and active early complexes (see below).</p><p>To confirm that U2AF was binding correctly to the N1 exon 3â splice site and not a cryptic site, we used site specific labeling to assay U2AF65 crosslinking to the N1 3â splice site. The wildtype and mutant transcripts were specifically <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 5â of the A nucleotide within the 3â splice site AG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> red asterisk). The RNAs were assembled into exon complexes under standard splicing conditions and then UV-irradiated to crosslink proteins to RNA. Crosslinked products were digested with RNAse T1 and resolved on SDS-PAGE. For both the wildtype and mutant transcripts, the prominent crosslinked protein migrated slightly above 60âKDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> lane 1 and 2). Immuno-precipitation with anti-U2AF65 antibody confirmed that this major crosslinked product was of U2AF65 and that the protein crosslinked equally to the 3â splice site of the wildtype and mutant transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> cf. lane 5 to 6).</p><p>Previous studies found that the recruitment of U2AF to a 3â splice site was dependent on binding of the U1 snRNP to the 5â splice site downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Izquierdo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Misra et al., 2015</xref>).

U2AF65 and U2AF35 exhibited slightly higher levels in the active early exon complex, possibly due to the stabilization of their binding by other factors as this exon assembles further into a complex active for splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Of the proteins exhibiting large differences in binding between the two complexes, only three showed a greater than two-fold enrichment in the repressed complex. These were the expected PTBP1 and two proteins known to be PTBP1 corepressors in the repression of other exons, RAVER1 and MBNL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> right panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Joshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gromak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gooding et al., 2013</xref>). Another known PTBP1 interacting protein, MATRIN3, was inconsistently found in the exon complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coelho et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Many proteins exhibited the opposite pattern of binding from PTBP1, MBNL1, and RAVER1, with increased binding in the active early complex compared to the repressed complex. Large increases were seen in multiple hnRNP proteins including C, D, G (RBMX), K, R, Q (SYNCRIP) and U (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). HnRNP A1 and H, previously shown to bind the N1 exon and downstream, did not change substantially between the two complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rooke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Markovtsov et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chou et al., 1999</xref>). Interestingly, SR proteins were present at only low levels in the two early complexes as measured by <underline>n</underline>ormalized <underline>s</underline>pectral <underline>a</underline>bundance <underline>f</underline>actor (NSAF) and by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> right panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Although not abundant, SFRS3 and TRA2B (SFRS10) did increase in the active early complex. The presence of proteins in the repressed and active early complexes was confirmed by immunoblot and additional mass spec analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> right panel and see below).</p><p>Several ATP-dependent RNA helicases were present in the complexes. Some of these are known to function in later steps of spliceosome assembly. Of particular interest was DDX17 (p72), which increased 3-fold in the active complex along with a smaller increase in its paralog DDX5 (p68) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These proteins are known to be required for the splicing of several alternative exons, but the targets of their activity are not well defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dardenne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dardenne et al., 2014</xref>). They were previously identified in other exon complexes and co-purified with the U1 and U2 snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sharma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schneider et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kar et al., 2011</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Jurica and Moore, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hartmuth et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chu et al., 2015</xref>). Their recruitment into the active early exon complex prior to EDC formation may indicate a role in the remodeling we observed in this complex.</p><p>To further validate the compositional differences between the exon complexes and their PTBP1 dependence, we performed a second MS experiment. In this experiment, we assembled complexes only on the wildtype RNA in light HeLa nuclear extract that had been either immuno-depleted for PTBP1 or mock-depleted. This produced the active early complex and the EDC in the PTBP1-depleted extract and the repressed complex in the mock-depleted extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> lane 3 and 4). Prior to MS analysis, these three light complexes were spiked with a mixture of exon RNP complexes MS2-affinity purified from heavy extract containing both the wildtype and mutant RNAs. This mixture generated a heavy peptide peak for all the proteins of interest. Peak intensities for the three light complexes were then normalized to peak intensities of the heavy CBP20 and CBP80 to measure the relative abundance of each protein in each light complex.</p><p>Many proteins, including those described above, showed consistent changes between the two MS experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In the first experiment, the repressed and active early complexes contained the wildtype RNA and the PTBP1-binding-site mutant RNA, respectively. In the second experiment, the proteins were assembled onto the wildtype RNA plus or minus PTBP1. Thus, proteins seen changing in both experiments are responding to the differential binding of PTBP1. Proteins observed in only one mass spectrometry experiment were not considered further. These results indicate that despite their similar gel mobility, the PTBP1-repressed complex and the active early complex, which can progress to the EDC, are very different. The binding of PTBP1 in conjunction with MBNL1 and RAVER1 prevented the binding of many other proteins, interestingly including many hnRNP proteins. The binding of U2 snRNP to form the EDC is preceded by extensive remodeling of the exon RNP from the repressed to active state.</p><p>We next examined the compositional changes during the transition of the active early exon complex to the EDC. We mixed the heavy repressed complex and the light EDC from the first MS experiment in a 1:1 molar ratio and carried out the trypsin digestion and LC-MS-MS. The SILAC ratio of each protein (light over heavy) was calculated from peptide peak intensities again normalized to CBP80 and CBP20. The normalized SILAC ratios from this set (EDC over repressed) were divided by the normalized SILAC ratios from the previous set (active early over repressed). This generated abundance ratios for the proteins in the EDC relative to the active complex from which it forms. These data again indicated dramatic changes in composition in the transition between the two complexes.</p><p>Many proteins were depleted during formation of the EDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> left panel). PTBP1, RAVER1 and MBNL1, which were mostly lost between the repressed and active early complexes, declined even further in the EDC. Most hnRNP proteins, including hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2B1, declined with the formation of the EDC. Interestingly, proteins such as hnRNP C, K, U and Q that had substantially increased in the active complex relative to the repressed complex, were now dramatically reduced in the EDC. Conversely and as expected, the U2 snRNP proteins are recruited during this transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> left panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> lane 3). Perhaps the most striking change upon EDC formation was a massive recruitment of SR proteins including SRSF3, 6, 7, 11, 12, and SR-related proteins, TRA2B (SFRS10), RBM39 and LUC7L2. TRA2B and SFRS3 increased 4-fold in the EDC over the active complex, while LUC7L2 went up 8-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> left panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Again, the changes in hnRNP and SR proteins were verified by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> right panel), and we observed similar changes in the second MS experiment using PTBP1-depleted extract (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Together, the data indicate extensive remodeling of exon complexes both between the PTBP1-repressed and active early complexes and then in the transition from the active early exon complex to the EDC. Besides the binding of U2 during this latter transition, hnRNP proteins are removed and SR proteins are recruited.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>RAVER1 and MBNL1 are required for full repression of the N1 exon, while DDX5/17 and TRA2B activate splicing of the N1 exon</title><p>The early exon RNP complexes assembled in vitro are heterogeneous and not all proteins seen binding are expected to be key regulators of their assembly. To confirm the involvement of particular proteins in the splicing of the test exon in vivo, we performed RNAi knockdown experiments. These were performed on a HeLa cell line carrying an integrated splicing reporter that contained the same test exon flanked by Î²-globin exons and was induced with doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We focused on factors that changed in each of the complexes analyzed. MBNL1 and RAVER1 are bound only in conjunction with PTBP1 in the repressed complex. DDX5 and DDX17 bind in the active complex and are reduced as the EDC forms. TRA2B is increased in the active complex and highly enriched in the EDC. After RNAi knockdown and reporter induction, we isolated RNA from the cells and assayed exon inclusion by primer extension. Two siRNAs were tested for each protein and the efficiency of protein depletion was assessed by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In control siRNA-treated cells, the test exon exhibited ~40% inclusion in the reporter mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). As expected, depletion of PTBP1 stimulated splicing of the test exon to ~90%. Depletion of MBNL1 or RAVER1 alone increased exon inclusion to 50 or 55% respectively, confirming both proteins as negative regulators of the test exon. The more limited effect from depleting these factors compared to PTBP1 may indicate the presence of other redundant repressor proteins or that PTBP1 is more important to maintaining exon repression than these cofactors. Double depletion of RAVER1 and MBNL1 together did not further increase splicing indicating that the factors are likely not redundant with each other.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19743.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>RAVER1 and MBNL1 are required for full N1 exon repression, while DDX5/17 and TRA2B activate N1 exon splicing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the minigene splicing reporter.

Collectively, these data confirm that RAVER1 and MBNL1 act as corepressors of N1 splicing with PTBP1, and that DDX5/17 and TRA2B act as activators of the N1 exon. The presence of the DDX5/17 proteins in the active complex indicates that these proteins may act during the remodeling events of an early exon complex into an EDC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Splicing Repression by PTBP1</title><p>Common models for the action of splicing regulators involve competitive binding at the splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wagner and Garcia-Blanco, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Singh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">ValcÃ¡rcel et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Heiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zarnack et al., 2013</xref>). However, PTBP1-repressed exons often have binding sites in the flanking introns distal to the target exon that are not expected to interfere with the binding of spliceosomal factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Linares et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Xue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Llorian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Han et al., 2014</xref>).

In the presence of PTBP1 (below) the exon is sequestered in a repressed state that still allows U2AF and U1 snRNP assembly but not the association of many early factors including hnRNPs, RNA helicases, and early bound SR proteins.

We previously showed that the downstream PTBP1 makes physical contact with stem-loop 4 of the U1 snRNA bound at the 5â splice site upstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sharma et al., 2011</xref>). Although not proven, this PTBP1-U1 snRNP interaction may be sufficient to inactivate the 5â splice site by blocking an interaction between the repressed U1 and the U2 snRNP of the downstream exon complexÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>) . On the upstream side, it is possible that the bound PTBP1 allows normal U1-dependent U2AF assembly but blocks its further contact with the U2 snRNP. However, we find that the block in EDC assembly appears to be earlier than the final recruitment of the U2 snRNP.</p><p>We found dramatic differences in the early exon RNP complexes assembled in the presence or absence of PTBP1. The PTBP1-repressed complex contained several proteins whose binding was lost when PTBP1 was removed, either by binding site mutation or protein depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The most notable changes were of MBNL1 and RAVER1, two proteins that are known to act as corepressors with PTBP1 on other exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gromak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gooding et al., 2013</xref>). In RNAi depletion experiments, we find that RAVER1 and MBNL1 are both inhibitory for N1 splicing, although not as strongly as PTBP1. Work from the Smith and Curry labs has defined a precise interaction of a peptide in RAVER1 with RRM2 of PTBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Joshi et al., 2011</xref>). The protein MATRIN3 has the same peptide and appears to make a PTBP1 interaction similar to RAVER1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Joshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coelho et al., 2015</xref>). Although MATRIN3 is present in some of our complexes, its co-binding with PTBP1 was less clear than RAVER1 and MBNL1. The co-binding of RAVER1 and MBNL1 indicate that PTBP1 may nucleate the assembly of a larger inhibitory complex on the target exon. Early work by the Grabowski lab on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor Î³2 exon 10 also indicated that PTBP1 induced assembly of a larger inhibitory complex and prevented formation of an EDC-like complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashiya and Grabowski, 1997</xref>). The components of that complex could not be analyzed and the effect of PTBP1 binding could not be uncoupled from competition with U2AF since their binding sites overlapped.</p><p>Other proteins that may be enriched in the repressed complex include the hnRNP F and H proteins and the protein CELF1, although these proteins showed less consistent differences among the three analyzed complexes. HnRNP H was previously shown to bind a silencer element within the exon itself, as well as bind to a downstream cluster of positive and negative regulatory elements (called the DCS) where its binding was dependent on PTBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rooke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Markovtsov et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Min et al., 1995</xref>). The role of CELF proteins in N1 splicing has not been studied, but they are known to act either positively or negatively on the splicing of other exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ladd et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gromak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Charlet-B et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dembowski and Grabowski, 2009</xref>). It will be interesting to further examine the roles of all these proteins.</p><p>Instead of directly blocking the binding of U2AF, PTBP1 may prevent assembly of other factors needed for U2 snRNP recruitment. In converse to RAVER1 and MBNL1, we found numerous factors that were absent from the repressed complex, but were recruited to the exon RNA if PTBP1 regulation was removed. Some of these are presumably needed for EDC assembly but bind much earlier than the U2 snRNP. We observed increased binding of the SR and SR-related proteins SFRS3 and TRA2B in the active early over the repressed complex. These proteins increased dramatically again in the EDC along numerous other SR proteins that were only observed in the EDC. Of interest, we found the ATP-dependent RNA helicases DDX5 (p68), DDX17 (p72) and DHX15 (PRP43) enriched in the active early complex. DDX5 and DDX17 showed substantial declines upon formation of the EDC, suggesting they act prior to its assembly and may be needed for remodeling the active early exon complex (see below) and are blocked from action by PTBP1. We are also interested in the role of ATP in active early complex assembly upon removal of PTBP1 repression. Determining this will require a more purified system, as we find that in crude extracts ATP alters the RNP assembled on nearly any RNA (data not shown).</p><p>Other splicing regulators are known to alter other steps of EDC assembly. As described above, PTBP1 bound within Fas exon 6 interfered with U1 snRNP-dependent recruitment of U2AF during exon definition, earlier than the action of PTBP1 studied here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Izquierdo et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, House et al found that hnRNP L acted at a later step to prevent splicing of a CD45 exon through the hyper-stabilization of an assembled EDC containing the U1 and U2 snRNPs, and thus altering its transition to the full spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">House and Lynch, 2006</xref>). Here, we found that even though U2AF was recruited, a step between U2AF binding and U2 snRNP recruitment was blocked by PTBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). It will be very interesting to apply comparative proteomics to other exons in states such the hyper-stabilized and permissive EDCs. This may identify common factors targeted by regulation and further elucidate the process of exon definition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A pathway for exon definition complex assembly</title><p>Studies of spliceosome assembly have largely focused on the formation of the catalytic complex. Using short model introns from yeast or mammalian cells, these analyses have defined an intricate series of binding steps and conformational rearrangements leading to intron excision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Will and LÃ¼hrmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hegele et al., 2012</xref>). Relatively few studies have examined the exon complexes that are the necessary intermediate in the splicing of long metazoan transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sharma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schneider et al., 2010</xref>). As the primary RNA transcript is synthesized, factors such as the hnRNP group of proteins and the U1 snRNP are thought to rapidly assemble with it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dreyfuss et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Singh et al., 2015</xref>). Some of these early recruited factors are required for the binding of subsequent spliceosomal components, including the U2 snRNP. Although the active early exon complex is heterogeneous in mobility, we found that it is fully bound by the known early factors U2AF and the U1 snRNP, as well as enriched for the DDX5/17 and TRA2B components needed for splicing, and it is efficiently converted to an EDC. This conversion requires more than the simple assembly of the U2 snRNP at the branch point sequence. The transition from the active early complex to an EDC was accompanied by a large-scale rearrangement of the exon RNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It is likely that there are many as-yet-undescribed steps leading to the assembly of an exon definition complex.</p><p>When PTBP1-mediated repression was removed, many new proteins bound the exon to form the active early complex. Some of these early binding proteins may help recruit needed proteins, or they may force a particular sequence of assembly by hindering the binding of factors such as the U2 snRNP that need to bind later. Abundant hnRNP and other RNA-binding proteins assemble into this early exon complex but are then removed during the transition to the EDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), including hnRNPs C, Q, R and K, as well as the residual PTBP1, RAVER1 and MBNL1.</p><p>Another striking change between the active early complex and the EDC is a massive recruitment of SR proteins. SR proteins were found to associate with the pre-mRNA and to stabilize the binding of the U1 snRNP and U2AF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Staknis and Reed, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jamison et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wu and Maniatis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kohtz et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Krainer et al., 1990</xref>). It is possible that these previously described interactions occur during the transition we observe after initial U1 snRNP and U2AF binding. On the other hand, some SR proteins are present in the active early exon complex along with the U1 snRNP and U2AF. These early-bound SR proteins may serve to initially stabilize U1 and U2AF binding, before a more substantial recruitment of SR proteins during EDC assembly. During this later step, several SR and SR-like proteins are increased 3 to 4 fold, a similar enrichment to the U2 snRNP proteins, and may serve to bridge components bound at the 5â and 3â splice sites as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Long and Caceres, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Busch and Hertel, 2012</xref>). Understanding the roles of these SR and SR-like proteins needs further dissection. We are particularly interested in TRA2B, which increases three-fold in the active early complex and then an additional four-fold in the EDC, and whose depletion strongly inhibits exon inclusion in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>It seems likely that the loss of hnRNP proteins and gain of SR proteins during exon definition, are mediated by ATP-dependent RNA helicases, which are implicated in nearly all RNP assembly pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Singh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jarmoskaite and Russell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cordin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Linder and Jankowsky, 2011</xref>). The observed rearrangements during EDC formation require ATP, but the number of steps involving ATP hydrolysis is not clear. ATP is needed for U2 snRNP recruitment to the branch point through the action of UAP56 (SUB2) and the U2 snRNP subunit DDX46 (PRP5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jarmoskaite and Russell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cordin et al., 2012</xref>). DDX46 is strongly recruited into our isolated EDC, but detection of UAP56 in our complexes was inconsistent. Given the timing of their recruitment, their association with other exon complexes, and their implication in the splicing of multiple alternative exons including the exon examined here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), DDX5 (p68) and DDX17 (p72) are good candidates for driving new rearrangement steps during EDC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sharma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schneider et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dardenne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dardenne et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Camats et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Guil et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Liu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lin et al., 2005</xref>). DDX5 and DDX17 are extremely abundant in nuclear extracts and so far we have not achieved sufficient depletion of these proteins to test their roles in vitro. It will be very interesting to develop additional assays that can examine their function in more detail.</p><p>The remodeling of an exon complex is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The assembly of PTBP1 and several corepressors forms the repressed complex that contains the U1 snRNP and U2AF but excludes numerous other factors from the exon RNP. Removal of PTBP1 allows formation of an active early complex that contains new hnRNP proteins as well as the RNA helicases DDX5 and DDX17 and some early-bound SR proteins. This early exon RNP is efficiently converted to the EDC with the loss of hnRNP proteins, the gain of SR proteins and the binding of the U2 snRNP. This sequence of events raises many questions. How does PTBP1 block assembly of so many different proteins? Does the initial binding of certain hnRNP proteins such as hnRNP C in the active early complex allow for recruitment of factors needed for EDC formation, or are they inhibitory? What drives the loss of hnRNP proteins and the gain of SR proteins during EDC formation? Is this the role of DDX5 and DDX17? Can smaller steps be discerned within these major assembly transitions? Given that exon definition appears to be the major pathway for recognizing splice sites in vertebrates, and a target for the regulation of splicing choices, it will be important to gain further understanding of EDC structure and assembly.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid constructs and in vitro transcription</title><p>The plasmid pBS713 previously used by Sharma et al. containing the mouse Src N1 exon and flanking intron segments was modified using standard protocols to create pBS719WT containing a distal PTBP1-binding site upstream of the branch point and pBS719MUT containing a mutant upstream PTBP1-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sharma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amir-Ahmady et al., 2005</xref>).

interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Large-scale remodeling of a repressed exon RNP to an exon definition complex active for splicing&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Timothy W Nilsen (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. Juan ValcÃ¡rcel (Reviewer #2) has also agreed to reveal their identity.</p><p>As you will see all were generally quite positive about the work but all thought the paper would be strengthened by some experimental insight into the role(s) of DDX-17-5 in remodeling the inactive EDC into a splicing competent EDC. Please address this question as best as you can and also address minor comments as thoroughly as possible.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Here Black and colleagues continue their investigation of how PTB can interfere with splicing. They focus on the role of PTB in preventing the formation of splicing competent Exon Definition Complexes (EDCs). In brief, using an imaginative array of constructs, and a variety of approaches (including SILAC) they demonstrate that active EDC complexes are formed through an elaborate series of protein recruitments and displacements that are independent of recruitment of either U1 snRNP or U2AF. It appears that hnRNP proteins are first recruited to the U1-U2AF complex and these are then displaced and replaced by SR proteins. The latter step in turn allows the recruitment of U2 snRNA and the formation of a splicing competent EDC. PTB, not bound to any critical cis-acting element, in conjunction with Raver and muscleblind, appears to inhibit this cascade at a very early step preceding the recruitment of hnRNP proteins. The work is clearly presented and the data quite clear. Overall the studies are in principle suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>One of the more interesting aspects of the study is the requirement for DDX17-DDX5 for conversion of an inactive EDC to a splicing competent EDC. It would seem to be straightforward to show in knockdown cells what step these helicases perform. Such data would strengthen the paper (i.e. by immunoblot) and answer an obvious open question raised by the work.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Black and colleagues present a detailed biochemical dissection of factors assembled on a PTB-repressed exon, on the exon harboring mutations in one of the PTB binding sites, or on the wild type exon upon biochemical depletion of PTBP1. The results indicate that 1) PTBP1 binding prevents the association of numerous hnRNP proteins, but not U1 snRNP nor the U2AF heterodimer, 2) when PTB binding is compromised, several hnRNP proteins assemble to form an early complex that, upon ATP-dependent remodeling, gives rise to an exon definition complex containing U2 snRNP as well as SR proteins and TRA2B.</p><p>These are interesting results from carefully performed experiments that shed light on the complex remodeling of RNPs involved in regulation of an exon. They can spur discussion and further work in other systems and represent a reference point for studies on the molecular mechanisms of splicing regulation, as illustrated by the discovery of the sequential assembly of hnRNP and SR proteins during de-repression of an exon.</p><p>I have no major criticism but I would recommend the authors to discuss the following points in a revised text, as detailed in the next section.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This study by Black and colleagues describes a thorough analysis of the protein composition of a PTB-repressed complex, an early exon definition complex and a later exon definition complex. The trans-splicing system described is both elegant and robust and allows for an unprecedented identification of differences between these complexes. Strengths of this study are the quality of the data and the novelty and importance of characterizing such early complexes in spliceosome assembly. This is particularly timely given that we now have increasing detail regarding the later complexes in spliceosome assembly, but lack detail on earlier complexes where much of splicing regulation occurs. A short-coming of the study is that it is primarily descriptive, but the potential relevance of this data for other studies mitigates this concern â at least partially. It is true that the study raises more questions than it answers. The authors are well aware of this â they, in fact, list many of these questions at the end of the discussion. Answering any of these would increase the mechanistic insight of the study. Particular experiments that seem readily available given the system are:</p><p>1) The authors show that a few of the proteins identified in the mass spec studies impact the efficiency of splicing in cells. However, it is not shown that these proteins impact the stage of spliceosome assembly in which they were identified. The authors show that depletion of PTB is sufficient to alter early-to-EDC assembly. Does depletion of RAVER or MBNL do the same, or does depletion of DDX5/17 or Tra2 limit formation of the EDC?</p><p>2) Similarly, the author propose that widespread loss of hnRNPs and gain of SR proteins helps promote EDC formation, but this change in composition could be an effect not a cause of EDC formation. Experiments such as in point #1 with depletion of SR proteins would address this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19743.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[â¦]</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Here Black and colleagues continue their investigation of how PTB can interfere with splicing.

Using both commercial and a custom made antibody, we have depleted DDX5/17 from nuclear extracts. These proteins are extremely abundant and the residual 15% of the protein makes the results difficult to interpret. The depleted extract did show a small decrease in EDC formation that could be restored with purified protein. However, these very small effects are difficult to draw conclusions from and we feel that it does not really strengthen the story to report on them. We now comment more clearly on the need for this type of confirmation.</p><p>With the encouragement of the reviewer, we have now also tried preparing mini nuclear extracts from HeLa cells depleted for DDX5/17 using a transfected si-RNA. Knockdown efficiency was about 90%, but unfortunately caused widespread cell death. The nuclear extract prepared from these cultures was blocked for EDC formation when compared to mini nuclear extracts prepared from control si-RNA treated cells. However, EDC assembly could not be rescued by bacterial or human cell purified recombinant DDX5/17. Thus the failure to assemble the EDC could result from many indirect effects of DDX5/17 depletion. Similar toxicity was observed when knocking down TRA2B.</p><p><italic>[â¦]</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[â¦]</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors show that a few of the proteins identified in the mass spec studies impact the efficiency of splicing in cells.

We have made particular efforts to examine the function of DDX5/17 as described in the response to reviewer 1 above. Unfortunately, we will need to develop new methods to address these questions.</p><p><italic>2) Similarly, the author propose that widespread loss of hnRNPs and gain of SR proteins helps promote EDC formation, but this change in composition could be an effect not a cause of EDC formation.

As far as we are aware, immunodepletion of the complete set of SR proteins with antibodies such as Mab104 has not been successful. This leaves methods such as Magnesium precipitation for SR depletion, which is not very specific and difficult to control. We have a small amount of preliminary data showing that the addition of SR proteins (from ammonium sulfate precipitates) can enhance EDC formation in a splicing-deficient nuclear extract, but it is not yet possible to relate this to the Early-Active to EDC transition we see here.</p></body></sub-article></article>
