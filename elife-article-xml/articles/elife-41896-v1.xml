However, how the cerebellum anatomically and physiologically engages with the hippocampus to sustain such communication remains unknown. Using rabies virus as a retrograde transneuronal tracer in mice, we reveal that the dorsal hippocampus receives input from topographically restricted and disparate regions of the cerebellum. By simultaneously recording local field potential from both the dorsal hippocampus and anatomically connected cerebellar regions, we additionally suggest that the two structures interact, in a behaviorally dynamic manner, through subregion-specific synchronization of neuronal oscillations in the 6–12 Hz frequency range. Together, these results reveal a novel neural network macro-architecture through which we can understand how a brain region classically associated with motor control, the cerebellum, may influence hippocampal neuronal activity and related functions, such as spatial navigation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>anatomy</kwd><kwd>physiology</kwd><kwd>spatial navigation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20160334907</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rondi-Reig</surname><given-names>Laure</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE16-0019-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rondi-Reig</surname><given-names>Laure</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coulon</surname><given-names>Patrice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007586</institution-id><institution>Aix-Marseille Université</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coulon</surname><given-names>Patrice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005737</institution-id><institution>Université Pierre et Marie Curie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-BioPsy</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rondi-Reig</surname><given-names>Laure</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005737</institution-id><institution>Université Pierre et Marie Curie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-IDEX-0004-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rondi-Reig</surname><given-names>Laure</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Anatomical tracing and physiological recordings reveal neuronal pathways through which the cerebellum may influence hippocampal activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cerebellum is classically associated with motor control.

Furthermore, the cerebellum has recently been found to form functional networks with subcortical structures associated with higher order functions, such as the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kelly and Strick, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hoshi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bostan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bostan and Strick, 2018</xref> for review), ventral tegmental area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rogers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carta et al., 2019</xref>) and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rochefort et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Iglói et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yu and Krook-Magnuson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babayan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the hippocampus, spontaneous local field potential (LFP) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Iwata and Snider, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babb et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Snider and Maiti, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Krook-Magnuson et al., 2014</xref>) and place cell properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rochefort et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lefort et al., 2019</xref>) are profoundly modulated following cerebellar manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rondi-Reig et al., 2014</xref> for review). A recent study has also described, at the single cell and blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal level, sustained activation in the dorsal hippocampus during optogenetic enhancement of cerebellar nuclei output in head-fixed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Choe et al., 2018</xref>). These data point toward the existence of an anatomical projection from the cerebellum to the hippocampus. However, the direct or indirect nature of the connection between the two structures remains unclear. The suggestion of a direct connection between these two structures has been claimed by a recent tractography study in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arrigo et al., 2014</xref>) and the presence of short-latency evoked field potentials (2–4 ms) in cat and rat hippocampi after electrical stimulation of the cerebellar vermal and paravermal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Whiteside and Snider, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Harper and Heath, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Snider and Maiti, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heath et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Newman and Reza, 1979</xref>). However, secondary hippocampal field responses have also been described, at a latency of 12–15 ms following cerebellar stimulation, suggesting the existence of an indirect pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Whiteside and Snider, 1953</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, even if these studies provide compelling physiological evidence of cerebellar influences on the hippocampus, they do not provide direct evidence of neuroanatomical connectivity between the two regions. Given the known complex, modular functional and anatomical organization of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apps and Hawkes, 2009</xref>) this represents a major gap in our understanding of the network architecture linking the two structures. In addition, these studies provide no measure of dynamic physiological communication or associated synchronization between the two structures, which is thought to be essential for maintaining distributed network functions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fries, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, this study addresses two fundamental, unanswered questions: which regions of the cerebellum are anatomically connected to the hippocampus and what are the spatio-temporal dynamics of synchronized cerebello-hippocampal activity during behavior? To address these unresolved questions, we used rabies virus as a retrograde transneuronal tracer to determine the extent and topographic organization of cerebellar input to the hippocampus. Based upon the anatomical tracing results, we then studied the levels of synchronization between LFPs recorded simultaneously from the cerebellum and dorsal hippocampus in freely moving mice as a proxy for potential cross-structure interactions. We reveal that specific cerebellar modules are anatomically connected to the hippocampus and that these inter-connected regions dynamically synchronized their activity during behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To study the topographical organization of ascending, cerebello-hippocampal projections, we unilaterally injected rabies virus (RABV), together with fluorescent cholera toxin β-subunit (CTb), into the left hippocampus. The extent of the injection site, identified by the presence of fluorescent CTb, included both CA1 (stratum lacunosum-moleculare) and DG (molecular layer, granule cell layer and hilus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cerebellar projections to the hippocampus are precisely topographically organized</title><p>We characterized the presence of retrograde transneuronally RABV-infected neurons after survival times of 30, 48, 58 and 66 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Coulon et al., 2011</xref>). At 30 hr post-infection, staining was found predominantly in the medial septum diagonal band of Broca (MSDB), the lateral and medial entorhinal cortices, the perirhinal cortex and the supramammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus (SUM). Sparse staining was also found in a subset of mice, in the raphe nucleus and in other hypothalamic and thalamic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). All these structures correspond to first-order relays as CTb staining was also systematically associated with each of the sites containing rabies infected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Importantly, no RABV or CTb labeling was found in the cerebellum at this time-course ruling out the existence of a direct cerebello-hippocampal DG pathway in mice. Interestingly, among these putative first relays, the septum, the hypothalamus and the raphe nucleus receive direct projections from the deep cerebellar nuclei in cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Paul et al., 1973</xref>), rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Teune et al., 2000</xref>) and Macaca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haines et al., 1990</xref>).

Thus, to further assign the observed PC clusters to previously described cerebellar zones, we used a double immunohistochemical approach to stain for both RABV and aldolase C (zebrin II) in one animal (case S18) after 66 hr of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brochu et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sugihara and Shinoda, 2004</xref>).

In the vermis, lobule VIa RABV-labeled PCs were mostly located in the a+ band. The few RABV-labeled cells found in lobule VII were confined to the 2+ band.

In the paraflocculus, the assignment of the RABV-labeled cells to specific modules was not addressed given the complex morphology of this region.

The presence of RABV-labeled cells in the fastigial nucleus is consistent with the involvement of module A. Similarly, the D2 module is routed through the dentate nuclei in which we found robust RABV labeling.

As for the instantaneous LFP power, we next asked if theta coherence between the different cerebello-hippocampal LFP combinations was organized in a state-dependent manner. To address this question, we computed the distribution of instantaneous coherence within this bandwidth. In line with the analysis of LFP power distributions, we did not observe any multi-modality and all combinations followed gaussian distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Correlation analysis between instantaneous speed and instantaneous theta coherence failed to show significant relationships for any cerebello-hippocampal combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>; Crus I-HPC, mean Spearman rho = 0.06 ± 0.03, bootstrap confidence level = [−0.08 0.08]; lobule II/III-HPC, mean Spearman rho = - 0.02 ± 0.02, bootstrap confidence level = [- 0.08 0.08]; lobule VI-HPC, mean Spearman rho = 0.01 ± 0.03, bootstrap confidence level = [−0.09 0.08]). Significant differences across recording combinations were observed within the theta bandwidth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>; Crus I-HPC, median [25–75 interquartile range (IQR)] coherence = 0.471 [0.461–0.480]; lobule II/III-HPC, median [IQR] coherence = 0.467 [0.462–0.471]; lobule VI-HPC, median [IQR] coherence = 0.481 [0.471–0.486]; Kruskal-Wallis with FDR correction, Kruskal-Wallis statistic = 6.75, p=0.0342) and post-hoc analysis revealed that LFP oscillations were significantly more synchronized between hippocampus and lobule VI than with lobule II/III (corrected p = 0.0246). Within lobule VI, theta coherence was significantly correlated to the mediolateral position of the recording electrode, which was consistent with the mediolateral location of greatest RABV-labeled PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>; Spearman rho = 0.572, p=0.0225).</p><p>Next, to ascertain if local cerebellar spiking activity is coordinated or modulated by hippocampal theta oscillations we recorded single, photo-identified Purkinje cells from lobule VI of head-fixed L7-ChR2 mice (selectively expressing channelrhodopsin in Purkinje cells; n = 6) simultaneously with hippocampal LFP during periods of active movement. This allowed us to calculate the degree of phase-locking between the cerebellar spikes and hippocampal LFP, which circumvents volume conduction issues associated with LFP-LFP correlations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vinck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nolte et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sirota et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stam et al., 2007</xref>).

We next examined detailed power spectra and coherence dynamics at the level of individual sessions from first day of training (session 1), when animals exhibited an exploratory behavioral profile, and the last day of training (session 20), when animals performed efficient goal-directed behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This allowed us to investigate the spatial dynamics of both the cerebellar and hippocampal LFP profiles alongside coherence as mice traversed the linear track to reach the reward.</p><p>During session 1, mice approached the reward point with a sustained and low speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Di</xref>, top), which is in agreement with the exploratory behavioral profile illustrated by the distributed occupancy of their trajectories on the track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> bottom). The hippocampal spectrogram was dominated by sustained activity in the theta band across the whole track. In contrast, clear activity in this frequency band was not apparent in the cerebellar recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Di</xref>) and the LFP power profile was maintained at low levels across the track. This homogeneous pattern was consistent with the unimodal distributions of instantaneous hippocampal and cerebellar theta power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Similarly, the coherograms did not reveal clear coherence in any of the cerebello-hippocampal combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Dii</xref>). However, we found a significant interaction between the distance from reward and the theta coherence of different cerebello-hippocampal combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Diii</xref>; distance from reward point x combination two-way repeated measures ANOVA; combination effect, F<sub>2,13</sub> = 2.33, p = 0.1365; distance effect, F<sub>84,1092</sub> = 1.043, p = 0.3772; interaction effect, F<sub>168,1092</sub> = 1.332, p = 0.0053). Post-hoc, FDR corrected, multiple comparisons revealed that significantly higher theta coherence was present between hippocampus and Crus I compared to lobule II/III at certain positions on the track prior to the reward point location (Crus I-HPC vs lobule II/III-HPC, p &lt; 0.05 from −29 to −21 cm from reward; lobule VI-HPC vs lobule II/III-HPC, p &lt; 0.05 from −25 to −22 cm from reward). As for the homecage recordings, instantaneous theta coherence for all cerebello-hippocampal combinations also followed gaussian, unimodal distributions during session one in the linear track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><p>On the last day of training, during session 20, mice displayed goal-directed behavior on the track. This goal-directed profile was illustrated in the efficient running trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> bottom) and by the acceleration-plateau-deceleration speed profile observed along the track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ei</xref> top). As in session 1, the hippocampal spectrogram was dominated by sustained theta activity. On the other hand, cerebellar LFP power profiles were notably different from session one with the appearance of sustained activity in the theta and delta (2–4 Hz) frequency bands, particularly in lobule VI and lobule II/III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ei</xref> bottom). These differences were not related to transient bouts of theta activity as the instantaneous theta power probability distributions continued showing unimodal profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Coherogram analysis also revealed changes in session 20, which were mainly reflected in sustained Crus I-HPC theta coherence spanning multiple positions on the track as animals actively approached the reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Eii</xref>).

Lobule VI-HPC coherence was also higher than with lobule II/III at some positions on the track (−44 to −31 cm from reward) although it was not as sustained and prominent as Crus I-HPC coherence.

Projections from topographically restricted regions of cerebellar cortex discretely route through restricted parts of their associated nuclei en-route to the hippocampus through multiple, convergent pathways, involving one or two relays, from the DCN. Interestingly, the possible single-relay pathways we described points toward involvement of the medial septum and the supramammillary nucleus, two structures crucial for theta generation. Congruently, our physiological data suggest that these connected cerebellar regions may dynamically interact with the hippocampus during behavior, via theta (6–12 Hz) LFP coherence. Our findings thus offer an anatomical and physiological framework for cerebello-hippocampal interactions that could support cerebellar contributions to hippocampal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burguière et al., 2005</xref>), including spatial map maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rochefort et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rondi-Reig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lefort et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Whilst previous studies provide compelling physiological evidence of cerebellar influences on the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cooke and Snider, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Iwata and Snider, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babb et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Snider and Maiti, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Krook-Magnuson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Choe et al., 2018</xref>), they do not provide the spatial resolution afforded by neuroanatomical tracing. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, anatomical tracing studies have failed to report a mono-synaptic ascending cerebello-hippocampal projection. This is consistent with our rabies virus tracing study, in which incubation periods of 48–58 hr were required before cell labeling was seen in the cerebellar nuclei. Such a timescale is indicative of a multi-synaptic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kelly and Strick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ugolini, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jwair et al., 2017</xref>). Single relay pathways can be envisioned through the septum, the hypothalamus (potentially including the supramammillary nucleus (SUM)) and the raphe nucleus. Other pathways including two relays through either the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex and/or the perirhinal cortex are also possible. Interestingly, among the different regions labeled at 48 hr post-infection, several midbrain and pontine regions such as the PAG, the nucleus incertus and the LtDG are known to receive direct projections from the DCN and could therefore represent putative first-order relays between cerebellum and hippocampus.</p><p>Our anatomical results highlight three main inputs to the hippocampus emanating from the cerebellum. The first input we reveal originates from the vestibulo-cerebellum, specifically from the dorsal and ventral paraflocculus, which is likely routed via the vestibular and dentate nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Voogd and Barmack, 2006</xref>). This anatomical connection between the vestibulo-cerebellum and the hippocampus reinforces the already well-described influence of the vestibular system on hippocampal-dependent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stackman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goddard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the classically described vestibular pathway, our data reveal that the central cerebellum also provides inputs to the hippocampus from vermal lobule VI, routed through caudal fastigial nucleus, and from Crus I, routed through the dentate. Using a combination of RABV expression and zebrin II staining, we identified three specific cerebellar modules involved in these inputs: (1) the A module in lobule VI, (2) the hemispheric Crus I D2 module and (3) the Crus I paravermal C2 module. Of the latter two modules, C2 is likely less prominently anatomically connected with the hippocampus since the number of RABV+ cells in the nucleus interpositus posterior, its output nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apps and Hawkes, 2009</xref>), was minor compared with the other cerebellar nuclei. The convergence of inputs from disparate cerebellar zones (flocculo-nodular and central zones) and modules from vermal (A), paravermal (C2) and hemispheric (D2) regions in to the hippocampus suggest that its optimal function requires the integration of multiple aspects of sensory-motor processing carried out at these distinct cerebellar locations.</p><p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Voogd and Barmack (2006)</xref>, based upon evidence from a wide range of species, the oculomotor cerebellum can be most broadly described to include lobule V, VI and VII. Given the highly conserved structure-function relationships of the vermal cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sillitoe et al., 2005</xref>), it seem likely that the mouse A module could also be considered part of the oculomotor cerebellum. In rat, it receives climbing fibers from the caudal medial accessory olive, and sends mainly ascending projections through the caudal portion of fastigial nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apps, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apps and Hawkes, 2009</xref>). The oculomotor vermis receives multiple sensory inputs which include visual, proprioceptive, vibrissae, vestibular and auditory inputs conveyed by both climbing and mossy fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Voogd and Barmack, 2006</xref>). The D2 module receives its climbing fiber input from the dorsal cap of the principal olive and projects out of the cerebellum through the rostromedial dentate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Herrero et al., 2006</xref>). It receives mossy fiber inputs carrying somatosensory, motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mihailoff et al., 1981</xref>), and visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Edge et al., 2003</xref>) information; along with inputs from the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kelly and Strick, 2003</xref>). Climbing fiber inputs to this module relay information from the parvocellular red nucleus, which receives projections from premotor, motor, supplementary motor and posterior parietal areas. The majority of these cortical areas also receive projections from the D2 module after a thalamic relay in the ventro-lateral nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kelly and Strick, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Glickstein et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Complementary to these anatomical results, our electrophysiological findings reveal coherent activity between the hippocampus and those cerebellar lobules that are anatomically connected with it (lobule VI and Crus I). This synchronization was restricted to the 6–12 Hz frequency range in the awake, behaving animal and showed dynamic profiles that were lobule dependent. Oscillations can align neuronal activity within and across brain regions, suggesting a facilitation of cross-structure interactions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Singer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fries, 2005</xref>). Cerebellar circuits support oscillations across a range of frequencies (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">De Zeeuw et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cheron et al., 2016</xref>). Of particular relevance to the current study are reports of oscillations within the theta frequency (~4–12 Hz), which have been described in the cerebellar input layers at the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dugué et al., 2009</xref>) and granule cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hartmann and Bower, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">D'Angelo et al., 2001</xref>) level, and also in the cerebellar output nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Watson et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Neuronal coherence has been described across the cerebro-cerebellar system at a variety of low frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">O'Connor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Courtemanche and Lamarre, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Soteropoulos and Baker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rowland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Frederick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Watson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2016</xref>) and oscillations within the theta range are thought to support inter-region communication across a wide variety of brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Colgin, 2013</xref>). Our finding that cerebello-hippocampal coherence is limited to the 6–12 Hz bandwidth is in keeping with previous studies on cerebro-cerebellar communication in which neuronal synchronization has been observed between the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Watson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), primary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Soteropoulos and Baker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rowland et al., 2010</xref>), supplementary motor area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rowland et al., 2010</xref>) and sensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rowland et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, LFPs recorded in the hippocampus and cerebellar cortex are synchronized within the theta bandwidth during trace eye-blink conditioning in rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hoffmann and Berry, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wikgren et al., 2010</xref>). Human brain imaging studies have also described co-activation of blood oxygen level dependent signals in both cerebellar and hippocampal regions during navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Iglói et al., 2015</xref>) and spatio-temporal prediction tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Onuki et al., 2015</xref>), thus highlighting putative neuronal interactions between the two structures. Regarding studies in mice, a recent study has demonstrated the existence of statistically significant co-activation of the dorsal hippocampus and cerebellar lobules IV-V, lobule VI and Crus I after the acquisition of a sequence-based navigation task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babayan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the coherence described here is unlikely to have resulted from volume conduction: 1) Rather than using a common reference electrode, our recordings were bipolar, with each recording electrode being locally and independently referenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kajikawa and Schroeder, 2011</xref>). 2) If volume conduction of theta oscillations was emanating from a hippocampal source then it could be assumed that cerebellar regions in closer proximity to the hippocampus would show higher levels of coherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, we found that coherence values were not related to the relative distance between the hippocampus and cerebellar recording site. 3) By recording simultaneously from hippocampus and multiple cerebellar regions, we have been able to demonstrate that the observed coherence is non-homogenous among the different cerebellar lobules in contrast to what one would expect if theta was volume conducted from a common location. 4) We calculated the imaginary part of coherency, which is not influenced by volume conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nolte et al., 2004</xref>), in the linear track paradigm and found results that were remarkably similar to those obtained using standard coherence analysis. 5) We showed that Purkinje cell spikes in lobule VI of the cerebellum can phase lock to hippocampal theta oscillations.</p><p>Importantly, we have shown for the first time that theta rhythms in the hippocampus preferentially synchronize with those in discrete regions of the cerebellum and that the degree of this coupling changes depending upon the behavioral context. Lobule VI-HPC coherence was dominant during active movement in the home-cage and remained stable during learning of the real world linear track task. On the other hand, Crus I - HPC coherence was highly dynamic, showing a significant increase over learning of the real world linear track task and becoming dominant after the acquisition of a goal-directed behavior. Furthermore, we reveal that high Crus I-HPC coherence was sustained across the linear track when the animal performed goal-directed behavior but not during the early training, exploratoration phase. Such sustained coherence may be related to the ability of the cerebellum, and particular Crus I, to link internal and external sensory context with specific action toward the goal. In line with this hypothesis, a recent study has suggested that Purkinje cells in the Crus I region and neurons in its output, the dentate nucleus, exhibit firing rate modulation in anticipation of expected reward in a VR task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chabrol et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, they show that the activity of Purkinje cells in lateral Crus I was modulated by running and/or visual flow speed. This is consistent with our examples showing that Crus I-HPC coherence remained present when animals performed goal-modulated behavior in VR, although multiple streams of sensory input, such as vestibular, whisker and olfactory, become irrelevant and even confounding in the head-restricted virtual environment task.</p><p>We next consider our results within the well characterized, modular understanding of cerebellar function. Within lobule VI, the A module receives multi-modal sensory information, mainly arising from collicular and vestibular centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Voogd and Barmack, 2006</xref>). The superior colliculus plays a role in visual processing and generation of orienting behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basso and May, 2017</xref>), which might be relevant for the establishment and maintenance of the hippocampal spatial map, and thus may be required constantly during active movement, independent of the specific behavioral task. The persistent and similar levels of lobule VI-HPC coherence during active movement in the homecage and linear track task, in both real world and virtual reality environment tasks is in agreement with such a hypothesis.</p><p>In monkeys and humans, Crus I is anatomically and functionally associated with prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kelly and Strick, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Iglói et al., 2015</xref>). In mouse Crus I, the D2 module receives convergent sensory and motor information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Proville et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, this module has been found to contain internal models, a neural representation of one’s body and the external world based on memory of previous experiences, that are used for visuo-motor coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cerminara et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, the C2 module has been found to also participate in visuo-motor processing related to limb coordination during goal-directed reaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cerminara and Apps, 2011</xref>). Both modules might be particularly important during the acquisition of a goal-directed behavior such as our real-world linear track task in which animals needed to reach non-cued reward zones. Our finding that Crus I-HPC coherence increases during task learning fits with this hypothesis.</p><p>In summary, our results suggest the existence of anatomically discrete hippocampal-cerebellar network interactions with a prominent involvement of Crus I during goal-directed behavior. Both anatomical and electrophysiological data point toward involvement of the theta generating pathway in cerebellum-hippocampus interactions. The topographical dynamic weighting of these interactions may be tailored to the prevailing sensory context and behavioral demands.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Anatomical tracing studies were performed under protocol N°00895.01, in agreement with the Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche.

For cerebellar single unit recordings, the silicon elastomer was removed from the recording chamber allowing the exposed cerebellar cortex to be viewed under a microscope (Leica, USA). Quartz based electrodes or tetrodes (impedance 1 mOhm at 1 Khz; Thomas Recording, Germany) were inserted in to the cerebellar cortex using a custom manipulator mounted on a stereotaxic frame (Kopf, USA). An optical fiber (600 µm diameter, Prizmatix, Israel) was mounted on a separate stereotaxic manipulator and positioned inside the chamber just above the cerebellar cortical surface within close proximity to the recording electrode. A low impedance silver ball reference electrode was also positioned within the chamber and a skull screw served as ground. A hydraulic micromanipulator was used to lower the optetrodes through the cerebellar cortical layers (Narishige, Japan).</p><p>Once units were identified, blue light pulses were used to photo-identify putative Purkinje cells (50 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, ~460 nm, 100 ms delivered using a commercial LED driver, Prizmatix, Israel. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chaumont et al., 2013</xref>).

The behavioral assembly was located in a separate room from the experimenter and was surrounded on four sides by black curtains. Three salient visual cues were placed at fixed locations along the edge of the track (10 cm from the edge). Mice were trained to run in a sequential manner from one end of the track to the other in order to receive a reward, which consisted of an electrical stimulation of the MFB. The reward stimulation was delivered automatically when the mice reached a 5 cm wide goal-zone, which was located 10 cm from the end of the track. Timing of the reward signal was logged on the electrophysiological recordings via TTL signals. Sessions lasted 12 min and were repeated three times per day with an inter-session time of 5 min over 7 days. Between sessions, the track was cleaned with 20% ethanol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Linear track – virtual reality environment</title><p>A commercially available virtual-reality environment was used (Jet Ball, Phenosys, Germany), utilizing an air cushioned Styrofoam ball (200 mm), which served as a spherical treadmill for head restrained mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The floating ball assembly was positioned 20 cm from a series of six octagonally arranged TFT surround monitors (19 inch) such that the head restrained mice had an unobstructed view of the visual scene. Rotation of the Styrofoam ball was detected by an optical sensor (sampling frequency 5700 dots per inch at 1 kHz). The vertical axis signals were interpreted by the VR software as the forward and backward movement of the virtual position of the animal. Position within the VR was then translated to a voltage signal (zero to five volts, with five volts indicating the end of the track), and sent to the Digital Lynx SX (Neuralynx, USA) electrophysiology system via a DACQ interface (DACQ 6501, National Instruments, USA). The start of the VR display was logged on the electrophysiology recordings via a TTL signal. To provide a reward signal, when the mice reached a given location within the VR (10 cm from the end of the track) a TTL marker was sent to both the electrophysiological recording system (to provide a timestamp-marker of the event) and an electrical stimulus generator linked to the HS-18 headstage (in the same manner as for real world linear track experiments).</p><p>The virtual scene consisted of a 1 m long track with gray walls and included three salient visual cues. After 3 × 12 mins sessions of habituation to the head fixation on the floating-ball assembly, mice were trained to run on the linear track in 12 min sessions, three times per day with an inter-session interval of approximately 5 mins during 7 days.

Instantaneous speed (or virtual speed) was derived from video tracking data (or virtual X and Y coordinates recorded as voltage signals in Neuralynx Cheetah software) and downsampled to 10 Hz for consistency with spectrogram and coherogram data (see below). Only epochs of active movement, defined by a sustained speed above 3 cm/s for a minimum of 4 s, were selected for further analysis.</p><p>In the home-cage environment, there was one case in which video tracking was not available and the epochs of active movement were thus defined by an amplitude threshold in EMG signal and the presence of a high theta/delta ratio in the hippocampal recordings.</p><p>For linear track and virtual reality-based experiments, active movement periods (instantaneous speed &gt;3 cm/s) were analyzed from each 12 min session (three sessions per day) for overall calculations. Each session was then subdivided in to trials (runs), that is, each time the animal traversed the track from one reward site to the other, and measurements of speed, power and coherence were averaged by distance from reward location in 1 cm bins normalized by the occupancy (time spent in each bin).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>LFP data was z-scored, notch filtered (filter centered to 50 Hz to remove electrical line noise) and detrended (using local-linear regression with a moving window of 1 s in 0.5 s steps to remove the DC component) prior to subsequent analysis. Multi-taper Fourier analyses (Chronux toolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bokil et al., 2010</xref>]) were used to calculate power and coherence of the LFP data. We used a 1 s sliding window in 0.1 s step and four tapers for all analysis. Time points with large-amplitude, low frequency artifacts, identified by threshold crossings of the mean z-score power in 0.5–5 Hz band, were removed from further analysis. Similarly, peri-MFB electrical stimulation times (±0.5 s) in linear track and virtual environment conditions were also excluded from analysis.</p><p>For overall power spectra and coherence calculations, the means of the spectrograms and coherograms were respectively computed. Spectral power between 0.1 and 500 Hz was z-scored to homogenize values and reduce the impact of inter-animal and inter-region global variations. Frequency axes in both spectral power and coherence plots were presented in logarithmic scale to facilitate visualization across a large frequency band (1–300 Hz). Frequencies between 48–52 Hz were removed from coherence plots due to the presence of a spurious peak related to the notch filtering. Data duration of recordings made in the home-cage environment, varied across mice (range, 12 to 132 min). Therefore, to reduce the impact of data length on subsequent analyses and also to match with subsequent linear track experiments (duration of 12 min), for each mouse we concatenated the LFP in to 12 min blocks. When multiple 12 min blocks were available (number of data blocks ranged from 1 to 11), we calculated the average coherence across all blocks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Combined recordings of cerebellar units and hippocampal LFP</title><p>Cerebellar cell recordings were sorted using Spike2 software (CED, UK) where single units were verified with principal component analysis.

I find the topic timely and the results of broad interest but do have some concerns regarding the robustness of the effects and the limited presence of oscillatory activity in the theta frequency range in the cerebellum. The report is also primarily correlative in nature – although there are interesting novel insights (the topographic nature of cerebellar-hippocampal connectivity and the increase in coherence between specific cerebellar regions and the hippocampus with navigation/experience).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting study describing the interactions between cerebellum and hippocampus during a goal-directed behavior. To this end the authors first studied the topography of the cerebellum regions projecting to the hippocampus using rabies via a polysynaptic (disynaptic?) pathway. Then, they demonstrate a spectral coherence of the theta oscillations (an important neural mechanism that supports neural communication) between these regions during active movement in the home cage and during learning of a goal-directed behavior task in a linear track and in virtual reality conditions in mice; difference of coherence between the regions seem to match the density of connections, and changes of coherence intensity takes place during learning in freely moving mice but not in virtual reality. The overall results seem appealing for a broad readership interested in functional relationship between different structures, here the cerebellum and the hippocampus during behavior, although the cause of temporal variations in coherence remains elusive (caused by upstream gating of theta-modulated inputs? changes in cerebellar oscillation amplification?) and is not discussed. Cellular recordings in the cerebellum showing phase-locking to hippocampal theta oscillations to ascertain that LFP is reflecting intra-cerebellar activity (and not simply external entrainment) would have been helpful but this would require more than can be completed in a reasonable revision time. Anyway, this work could be much improved by the authors with new analysis and clarification of interpretation of their data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is a fascinating manuscript in which the authors provide anatomical and physiological evidence for cerebellar interactions with the hippocampus. Based on the data presented, it is clear that regions of the cerebellar vermis and hemisphere, as well as their associated deep nuclei are a source of multisynaptic drive to the hippocampus. The anatomical results provide the most compelling data so far on this issue. Overall, I find the results believable, but requiring additional documentation. For example, the injection sites in the hippocampus are not clearly illustrated. The neurons that mediate the transneuronal transport have not been identified. It is not clear whether the connection between the cerebellar nuclei and the hippocampus is mediated by one or two neurons. The neurons that mediate this connection do not appear to have been analysed. At least the authors have neither presented nor illustrated this critical information. Thus, we are left with clear evidence that multiple regions of the cerebellum influence the hippocampus, but the subcortical or cortical regions that mediate this influence are uncertain. I believe that the authors should analyse and illustrate this critical information prior to publication.</p><p>Major points [concatenated from all reviewers]:</p><p>1) [Related to Essential Point 1] The authors indicate that transient oscillatory activity was observed in the 6-12 Hz range in the cerebellum. To navigate, sensory-motor information must be integrated nearly continuously and how the cerebellum meaningful contributes to this calculation in the hippocampus is not clear to me given the transient nature of theta in the cerebellum.</p><p>2) [Related to Essential Point 1] In addition, more information should be presented regarding this feature [the transience] of cerebellar theta. For example, what is the frequency or duration of transient theta oscillations in the home cage versus various tasks? Are the transitions between theta frequency and other frequencies discrete (i.e. what are the dynamics of preceding and following activity in the theta frequency range?). It's also not always clear whether analyses are focusing on identified transient periods of theta or longer periods of theta. It's possible I missed this information but it should be clear in the main text.</p><p>3) [Related to Essential Point 1] The authors show only power spectra and coherence until 40 Hz and they focused on theta but there is clearly increased activity in beta frequencies which are not commented nor discussed (while task-related changes in beta frequencies have also been reported in the hippocampus). Recording were performed with sampling frequency of 1kHz (from Materials and methods) so the authors could also analyze higher frequencies up to 200 Hz. A large fraction of the gamma band is currently not really studied.</p><p>4) [Related to Essential Point 1] In Figure 4G-H, &quot;observed changes restricted to the theta band&quot;: around 30Hz there is definitely a peak, both in trial 1 and in trial 20 (even larger/higher in trial 20). A shift in 30Hz peak can also be seen on the z-score power of the HPC (Figure 4E and F). Notably, this peak seems absent from the homecage recordings (Figure 3D). In virtual reality, this peak at 30 Hz seems absent, except when selecting specific epochs comparable to the linear track trials (Figure 7C). There might be something to investigate here for the authors, please check the absence of significance in this frequency band.</p><p>5) [Related to Essential Point 1] The coherence analysis is classically difficult to interpret because of volume conduction. Indeed, the authors did not find a clear peak of theta in power spectrum in the cerebellum but only transient oscillations in traces. The authors make an argument on distance, but this may be misleading if the dipolar nature of the source is not taken into account. Imaginary part of coherency is robust against volume conduction and should be used to replicate the findings (see Nolte et al., 2004).</p><p>6) [Related to Essential Point 1] The comparison of freely moving and virtual-reality is tricky. The learning curves look very different in Figure 4B and Figure 6C. Please provide a comparison between learning curves between linear track and virtual reality conditions. This impact on the choice of the epochs with similar behavior performances to compare in Figure 7. How similar is this behavior? Is it simply running speed? The VR animals seem overtrained while the freely moving seem to be learning during the session; this may result in differences of hippocampal engagement, beyond differences of sensory context.</p><p>7) [Related to Essential Point 2] It is a bit hard to make sense of the time-lapse of the cerebellum; from the Figure 1—figure supplement 2, it seems that the cerebellar nuclei is infected 18 hours after the primary infections observed in the structures which project to the cerebellum, suggesting that the cerebellum is one synapse upstream these hippocampus-projecting regions. Is any of the structures labelled at 30h known to receive inputs from the cerebellar nuclei? Alternatively, is it conceivable that some infection took place in the cerebral cortex overlying the hippocampus? The size of the pipette used for the injection is not provided. A picture of the cortex over the infection site would be useful for the reader to judge of the risk of virus leaks to the cortex.</p><p>8) [Related to Essential Point 2] Regarding the anatomical study in subsection “A precise topography of the cerebellum regions projecting to the hippocampus”, second paragraph, the authors stated that the presence of labeling in the contralateral hippocampus at the earliest survival time is at 30h vs. 48h for only contralateral markings in cerebellar output nuclei DCN: that's more than the 12h required for an infection cycle, so they should start seeing cells as well in the ipsilateral cerebellar nuclei, no? The time lapse of the retroinfection isn't very clear: both hemispheres of the cerebellar cortex are infected at the same moment, while the DCNs are infected at different times (cf. Supplementary Figure 2)? The symmetry in the pattern of infection in the cerebellar cortex suggests connections going to the same area, but the timelapse of the infection installs some doubts. Please clarify.</p><p>9) [Related to Essential Point 2] I do not see some of the findings mentioned in the following text illustrated in Figure 1. &quot;Rather, RABV/CTb-labeled neurons were found in two well described subcortical pathways leading to the DG of the hippocampus (first cycle of infection). One labeled pathway included the diagonal band of Broca and the septum. The other labeled hippocampal input pathway included the lateral entorhinal and perirhinal cortices (Figure 1—figure supplement 3)(Mosko et al., 1973; Dolorfo and Amaral, 1998; Witter, 2007.… &quot;</p><p>10) [Related to Essential Point 2] While the tracing was performed by injections in the dentate gyrus, recordings were performed in another region, the CA1 area. Please clarify the motivation of these choices and discuss how this may impact the result.</p><p>11) [Related to Essential Point 2] Subsection “A precise topography of the cerebellum regions projecting to the hippocampus”, last paragraph: Several pieces of anatomical information are missing from the analysis.</p><p>a) What is the location of first order neurons in subcortical structures that are labeled by retrograde transport after hippocampal injections of RV?</p><p>b) What is the time course of the appearance of this first order labeling?</p><p>c) What is the time course of the appearance of neurons in fastigial, interpositus and dentate? Do they all appear at the same time in individual animals? Is the timing of their appearance fully consistent with all the neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei being second order neurons labeled by retrograde transneuronal transport? Or is it possible that some of the neurons are third order neurons? In other words, do neurons in the fastigial nucleus label 8 hours before neurons in the dentate? If so, then this would be consistent with fastigial neurons being second order and dentate neurons being third order.</p><p>12) [Related to Essential Point 2] Is the time course of the first labeled neurons in the deep nuclei fully consistent with their being second order neurons? Or is it possible that even the earliest labeled neurons are third order neurons that are labeled by transneuronal transport through two subcortical neurons?</p><p>13) [Related to Essential Point 2] What is the time course of labeled Purkinje cells in different regions of the cerebellar cortex? Do neurons in the vermis label ~8 hours prior to neurons in the hemisphere?</p><p>14) [Related to Essential Point 2] As the anatomical data currently stand, their analysis and/or presentation are incomplete. The following statement is neither clearly stated in the Results section nor clearly illustrated. &quot;Notably, all of these regions contained RABV+ cells at 48h p.i., and thus they cannot be excluded as potential routes towards the hippocampus.&quot;</p><p>15) [Related to Essential Point 2 and 3] Some additional methods are needed. It was not clear to me how recordings were consistently selected for inclusion in various analysis. For example, the last paragraph of the subsection “Cerebello-hippocampal physiological interactions in a familiar home-cage environment”, lists 23 values from 13 mice. How were these sessions selected? Which mice did these sessions come from (up to two sessions per mouse?) and why would session numbers used in analyses differ between mice? This is just one example but the comment applies to statistics throughout the paper.</p><p>16) [Related to Essential Point 3] The authors provided a measure of physiological interaction – namely theta oscillations between cerebellum and hippocampus. First they assessed the cerebello-hippocampal interactions with coherence in the home cage and then during the learning of a goal directed behavior in a linear track and in virtual reality conditions. In the third paragraph of the subsection “Cerebello-hippocampal interactions during the learning of a goal-directed behavior” and Figure 4E-F: The shift in mean theta power and peak frequency is reported significant in the text but not clear on the figure when no visible difference in the theta peak between trial 1 and 20 was observed. Also when looking at the numbers in this z-score power (subsection “Cerebello-hippocampal interactions during the learning of a goal-directed behavior”, third paragraph), the difference is barely visible and the SEM give overlapping numbers (1st trial between 1.59 and 1.69, 20th trial between 1.68 and 1.76 for example): the statistical test seems to be conflicting with these results. Please clarify.</p><p>17) [Related to Essential Point 3] Some of the effects appear to rely heavily on smaller numbers of mice, although the authors do have quantitative explanations for the variability they observe (i.e. the recording distance from the midline in Figure 3F). Even so, Figure 3F seems to be primarily driven by two mice and in Figure 5, I was unsure of how the authors interpreted the high degree of variability in mean coherence in the Crus I data set.</p><p>18) [Related to Essential Point 3] The authors recorded the activity in both left and right hippocampus in all mice and they noted no difference (subsection “Cerebello-hippocampal physiological interactions in a familiar home-cage environment”, fourth paragraph) in the analysis of cerebello-hippocampal coherence. However, in Figure 4 to Figure 7 the data from different animals are indifferentially reported from data from the same animal. Indeed, the significant effects, for example for Crus I in Figure 5 and Figure 7D may be only due to a few values, possibly coming from only one or two animals; moreover it seems that some of the statistics are not performed using repeated-measure procedures. Please provide a clear view on left/right recording from each animal and clarify the statistics (e.g. averaging values from single animals). Overall, the number of mice seems a bit small for the task-related coherence analysis to evaluate reproducibility of the results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41896.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The three reviewers all found aspects of the work to be of interest.

Therefore, our spectrogram and coherogram analyses have been adapted to use parameters that allow for better temporal resolution (1s window in 0.1s steps compared with the previous 10s with 1s step). With these parameters we were able to explore temporal and spatial dynamics at the level of single trials.</p><p>In the linear track condition we have a constrained behavior and the task can be divided into individual trials (each run from one end of the corridor to the next goal zone) inside a session (each 12 minute block). We have now analysed the spectrogram averaged by the distance to the reward in late training and we observed rather continuous theta band activity during the whole goal-directed behavior (see new Figure 4Ei). We also computed coherograms averaged by the distance to the reward. Our new analysis reveals sustained coherence between hippocampus and Crus I, but not Lob II/III or Lob VI, in the theta band (see new Figure 4Eii, Eiii, 4H). Interestingly, activity and synchronization in this frequency band is also absent when analyzing trial 1 (new Figure 4D, F, H).</p><p>These results (subsection “Cerebello-hippocampal interactions during the learning of a goal-directed behavior”) are in line with the general findings described in the previous version of the manuscript, i.e. the increase of coherence between the Crus I region and the hippocampus when the animal performs a goal directed behavior (Figure 4C), and offer further insights on the dynamics of this interaction during ongoing behavior.</p><p>In the homecage, the animal performed a mixture of different behavioral states that are difficult to separate or divide on a “trial by trial” basis. To analyze the nature of the theta activity in the home cage, we looked at the distribution of instantaneous theta power. We found a skewed but unimodal distribution arguing against the existence of two differentiated states (presence versus absence of theta activity) (new Figure 3D) (see also new Results subsection “Cerebello-hippocampal physiological interactions in a familiar home-cage environment”).</p><p>Altogether, these new analyses sustain the idea that the cerebellum may provide the hippocampus with integrated sensory-motor information within the contextual framework of the goal directed behavior (see new Discussion section, eighth paragraph), which should occur in a nearly continuous manner (as pointed out by the reviewer).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) [Related to Essential Point 1] In addition, more information should be presented regarding this feature [the transience] of cerebellar theta.

It's possible I missed this information but it should be clear in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in point 1, we now show evidence for a continuum in the cerebellar theta activity rather than transient activity. Briefly, across the all conditions, we analysed LFP power and coherence during epochs of active movement (speed above 3 cm/s). Furthermore, for the plots in Figure 4F-H we have averaged the spectra and coherence within the range of distances from the reward that showed significant differences across combinations in session 20 (-60 to -20 cm, see Figure 4Eiii).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) [Related to Essential Point 1] The authors show only power spectra and coherence until 40 Hz and they focused on theta but there is clearly increased activity in beta frequencies which are not commented nor discussed (while task-related changes in beta frequencies have also been reported in the hippocampus). Recording were performed with sampling frequency of 1kHz (from Materials and methods) so the authors could also analyze higher frequencies up to 200 Hz. A large fraction of the gamma band is currently not really studied.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now analysed a much larger frequency profile (2-300 Hz) for both our LFP power and coherence analyses. We have analysed the differences between cerebello-hippocampal combinations in the frequency bands theta (6-12 Hz), beta (13-29 Hz) and low-gamma (30-48 Hz) and then used a two-way repeated measures ANOVA for frequency band and combination factors.

A shift in 30Hz peak can also be seen on the z-score power of the HPC (Figure 4E and F). Notably, this peak seems absent from the homecage recordings (Figure 3D). In virtual reality, this peak at 30 Hz seems absent, except when selecting specific epochs comparable to the linear track trials (Figure 7C). There might be something to investigate here for the authors, please check the absence of significance in this frequency band.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in point 3 (above), we have analysed the whole frequency profile. The significant difference is restricted to the theta band (6-12 Hz, see statistics above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) [Related to Essential Point 1] The coherence analysis is classically difficult to interpret because of volume conduction. Indeed, the authors did not find a clear peak of theta in power spectrum in the cerebellum but only transient oscillations in traces. The authors make an argument on distance, but this may be misleading if the dipolar nature of the source is not taken into account. Imaginary part of coherency is robust against volume conduction and should be used to replicate the findings (see Nolte et al., 2004).</p></disp-quote><p>Whilst we accept that volume conduction is indeed an inherent caveat of coherence analysis, we have made many efforts in our approach to minimize its impact on our findings. Distance between recording sites is not our only control and we would like to list them below (see also Discussion section) as well as describing the two new analyses we have now performed.</p><p>1) Rather than using a common reference electrode, our recordings were bipolar, with each recording electrode being locally and independently referenced. This method has been described as being an effective method in reducing the general reference electrode issue (Kajikawa and Schroeder, 2011).</p><p>2) By recording simultaneously from hippocampus and multiple cerebellar regions we have been able to demonstrate that the observed coherence is non-homogenous among the different cerebellar lobules in contrast to what one would expect if theta was volume conducted from a common location.</p><p>In addition to these previous points and following reviewer’s comments and suggestions, we now have calculated the imaginary coherence and performed single cell recordings from the cerebellum.</p><p>3) The findings described in Figure 4 are replicated with high similarity when imaginary coherence is calculated (see new Figure 4—figure supplement 3), again suggesting that the described coherence is not generated by volume conduction.</p><p>4) Finally, we have conducted a new series of technically challenging experiments in which we have recorded single-unit activity in the cerebellar cortex alongside with LFP in the hippocampus (see new Figure 3—figure supplement 4) of head fixed L7-ChR2 mice. We took advantage of this mouse line to allow positive photo-identification of cerebellar Purkinje cells during recordings (determined by cell responses to blue light illumination; Cf Chaumont et al., 2013) (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Interestingly, we found that 16 of 22 cells (6 mice) recorded in cerebellar lobule VI showed a robust response during optical illumination. Of these 16 cells, almost one-third (31%) were found to be significantly phase-locked to hippocampal theta oscillations. This finding also argues against a volume conduction origin of the coherence described in this manuscript (see new Results section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) [Related to Essential Point 1] The comparison of freely moving and virtual-reality is tricky. The learning curves look very different in Figure 4B and Figure 6C. Please provide a comparison between learning curves between linear track and virtual reality conditions. This impact on the choice of the epochs with similar behavior performances to compare in Figure 7. How similar is this behavior? Is it simply running speed? The VR animals seem overtrained while the freely moving seem to be learning during the session; this may result in differences of hippocampal engagement, beyond differences of sensory context.</p></disp-quote><p>Following reviewer’s suggestion we performed an individual analysis of the behaviour of each mouse during the virtual reality training. Among the 6 trained mice, two improved their performances and four remained with stable performances. Therefore, we now have analysed these mice separately (see Figure 4—figure supplement 4). The different examples show different patterns of activity and coherence. Interestingly, as it was the case during the linear track training, coherent activity between Crus I and hippocampus appeared when mice learned the task.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) [Related to Essential Point 2] It is a bit hard to make sense of the time-lapse of the cerebellum; from the Figure 1—figure supplement 2, it seems that the cerebellar nuclei is infected 18 hours after the primary infections observed in the structures which project to the cerebellum, suggesting that the cerebellum is one synapse upstream these hippocampus-projecting regions. Is any of the structures labelled at 30h known to receive inputs from the cerebellar nuclei?</p></disp-quote><p>The fact that at 48h, labeled cells in the DCN are sparsely located and their processes weakly stained could suggest the beginning of a third order infection cycle and thus tends to suggest that the main infection of the DCN starts at 58 h post infection and involves two relays to reach the hippocampus (Figure 1—figure supplement 4).</p><p>However, at 30h post infection, staining is mainly found in the medial septum diagonal band of Broca (MSDB), the lateral and medial entorhinal cortices and the perirhinal cortex as well as the supramammillary nucleus (SUM) (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We now confirm that these structures correspond to first order as CTB staining was also systematically found in the same structures (see Figure 1—figure supplement 3).</p><p>Among these structures, the septum has been described to receive direct projection from the fastigial nucleus in cats (Paul et al., 1973). In addition, we also found, in two mice out of four, RABV staining in the hypothalamus (including SUM in three animals) and raphe nucleus at 30h as well as CTB staining (see below). As these regions receive direct projections from the DCN (Teune et al., 2000), the few cells observed in the DCN 48h post infection could be related to the hypothalamic (potentially including the supramammillary nuclei (SUM)), and/or raphe nucleus staining observed at 30h.</p><p>Altogether, these results suggest multiple convergent pathways from the DCN to the hippocampus. Single relay pathways could be envisioned through the septum, the hypothalamus (potentially including the supramammillary bodies (SUM)) and the raphe nucleus (see new Results and Discussion sections as well as new supplementary figures associated with Figure 1). Other pathways including 2 relays through either the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex and/or the perirhinal cortex are also possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, is it conceivable that some infection took place in the cerebral cortex overlying the hippocampus? The size of the pipette used for the injection is not provided. A picture of the cortex over the infection site would be useful for the reader to judge of the risk of virus leaks to the cortex.</p></disp-quote><p>The size of the pipette diameter is around 200 µm. We have now added this information in the Materials and methods section. Please note that in the majority of the cases, the cortex overlying the hippocampus has been severely damaged during the injection, which renders a possible leak very unlikely. Nevertheless, in the other cases, no virus leak was detected in the cortex overlying the hippocampus. We have now added a supplementary figure to illustrate the cortex over the infection site (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) [Related to Essential Point 2] Regarding the anatomical study in subsection “A precise topography of the cerebellum regions projecting to the hippocampus”, second paragraph, the authors stated that the presence of labeling in the contralateral hippocampus at the earliest survival time is at 30h vs. 48h for only contralateral markings in cerebellar output nuclei DCN: that's more than the 12h required for an infection cycle, so they should start seeing cells as well in the ipsilateral cerebellar nuclei, no? The time lapse of the retroinfection isn't very clear: both hemispheres of the cerebellar cortex are infected at the same moment, while the DCNs are infected at different times (cf. Supplementary Figure 2)? The symmetry in the pattern of infection in the cerebellar cortex suggests connections going to the same area, but the timelapse of the infection installs some doubts. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>The labeling at 48h in the DCN is too sparse to allow any quantitative comparison between ipsi and contra DCN (see Figure 1—figure supplement 3). At 58h, the labeling in the DCN is more abundant and stronger. At this time course, we did not find any difference between ipsi and contralateral staining in fastigial and dentate nuclei. The labeling in the interpositus remained weak in both sides (Figure 1—figure supplement 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) [Related to Essential Point 2] I do not see some of the findings mentioned in the following text illustrated in Figure 1. &quot;Rather, RABV/CTb-labeled neurons were found in two well described subcortical pathways leading to the DG of the hippocampus (first cycle of infection). One labeled pathway included the diagonal band of Broca and the septum. The other labeled hippocampal input pathway included the lateral entorhinal and perirhinal cortices (Figure 1—figure supplement 3)(Mosko et al., 1973; Dolorfo and Amaral, 1998; Witter, 2007.… &quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed as mentioned by the reviewer, the CTB labelling was not shown in the previous version of the manuscript. We have now added CTB labeling corresponding to the first order labelled neurons (new Figure 1—figure supplement 3). We also replaced the table (previous Figure 1—figure supplement 2) by the different supplementary figures mentioned above. We have therefore replaced the sentence by a better and more detailed description of the structures labelled at the different survival time (see subsection “Cerebellar projections to the hippocampus are precisely topographically organized”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) [Related to Essential Point 2] While the tracing was performed by injections in the dentate gyrus, recordings were performed in another region, the CA1 area. Please clarify the motivation of these choices and discuss how this may impact the result.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to inject into the dentate gyrus for two reasons: 1) to target the maximal number of potential afferent inputs of the hippocampus and 2) we wanted to minimize the risk of a leak in the regions overlying the hippocampus. It is important to note that the site of viral injection involves both the stratum lacunosum-moleculare and the molecular layer of dentate gyrus which correspond to the main axonal entrance to CA1 and DG. The LFP recording was centered on CA1 since we previously described the influence of cerebellar plasticity on CA1 neuronal activity (Rochefort et al., 2011). We now have added a paragraph in the Results section of the manuscript to add these precisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) [Related to Essential Point 2] Subsection “A precise topography of the cerebellum regions projecting to the hippocampus”, last paragraph: Several pieces of anatomical information are missing from the analysis.</p><p>a) What is the location of first order neurons in subcortical structures that are labeled by retrograde transport after hippocampal injections of RV?</p></disp-quote><p>We now present two supplementary figures describing all the regions containing first order neurons, 30h after hippocampal infection by rabies virus (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2) and confirmed by CTB (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 3). The main subcortical regions infected at 30h and thus projecting directly to the hippocampus are the Medial septum and diagonal band of Broca (MSDB), the lateral and medial entorhinal as well as the perirhinal cortices and the supramammillary bodies (see also answer to point 7 and 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) What is the time course of the appearance of this first order labeling?</p></disp-quote><p>In our manuscript, the time course used to label first order neurons is 30h. We did not test a shorter survival time since this time is classically used in rodents tracing studies (e.g. Coulon et al., 2011) and allows visualization of a maximal number of directly projecting structures towards the injection site with a good intensity of labeling as confirmed by CTB labeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) What is the time course of the appearance of neurons in fastigial, interpositus and dentate? Do they all appear at the same time in individual animals? Is the timing of their appearance fully consistent with all the neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei being second order neurons labeled by retrograde transneuronal transport? Or is it possible that some of the neurons are third order neurons? In other words, do neurons in the fastigial nucleus label 8 hours before neurons in the dentate? If so, then this would be consistent with fastigial neurons being second order and dentate neurons being third order.</p></disp-quote><p>The labeling at 48h in the DCN is too sparse to allow any quantitative comparison between ipsilateral and contralateral DCN (see Figure 1—figure supplement 3). At 58h, the labeling in the DCN is more abundant and stronger. At this time course, we did not find any difference between ipsi and contralateral staining in fastigial and dentate nuclei. The labeling in the interpositus remained weak in both sides (see Figure 1—source data 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) [Related to Essential Point 2] Is the time course of the first labeled neurons in the deep nuclei fully consistent with their being second order neurons? Or is it possible that even the earliest labeled neurons are third order neurons that are labeled by transneuronal transport through two subcortical neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>According to CTB staining, we consider that 30h post-infection stained cells represent first order neurons and that 48h post-infection stained cells form second order neurons. It is thus possible that the few labeled neurons observed in the DCN at 48h post hippocampal infection represent second order neurons (see a detailed answer to this point in point 7 and in the Results section of the manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) [Related to Essential Point 2] What is the time course of labeled purkinje cells in different regions of the cerebellar cortex? Do neurons in the vermis label ~8 hours prior to neurons in the hemisphere?</p></disp-quote><p>Labeled neurons were found in both the hemisphere and the vermis at 58h post infection (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) [Related to Essential Point 2] As the anatomical data currently stand, their analysis and/or presentation are incomplete. The following statement is neither clearly stated in the Results section nor clearly illustrated. &quot;Notably, all of these regions contained RABV+ cells at 48h p.i., and thus they cannot be excluded as potential routes towards the hippocampus.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript now contains a paragraph in the Results section presenting the different structures stained at 48h. The table (Figure 1—figure supplement 4) describing these regions is also updated. Interestingly, among the different regions labeled at 48h post infection, several midbrain and pontine regions such as the PAG, the Nucleus Incertus and the LtDG are known to receive direct projections from the DCN and could therefore represent putative relays between DCN and hippocampus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) [Related to Essential Point 2 and 3] Some additional methods are needed. It was not clear to me how recordings were consistently selected for inclusion in various analysis. For example, the last paragraph of the subsection “Cerebello-hippocampal physiological interactions in a familiar homecage environment”, lists 23 values from 13 mice. How were these sessions selected? Which mice did these sessions come from (up to two sessions per mouse?) and why would session numbers used in analyses differ between mice? This is just one example but the comment applies to statistics throughout the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologized if the data used for the different analysis were not clear enough in the previous version of the manuscript. The difference between values and animals referred here it was due to the use of HPCright – cerebellar coherence and HPCleft – cerebellar coherence values from the same animal when both hippocampal electrodes were on target (after histological verification). In order to clarify this and reduce the potential impact of this pooling on the statistics we have now calculated and used the mean between these two values so each animal is represented only once. A detailed explanation has been added in the Results section of the new version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) [Related to Essential Point 3] The authors provided a measure of physiological interaction – namely theta oscillations between cerebellum and hippocampus. First they assessed the cerebello-hippocampal interactions with coherence in the home cage and then during the learning of a goal directed behavior in a linear track and in virtual reality conditions. In the third paragraph of the subsection “Cerebello-hippocampal interactions during the learning of a goal-directed behavior” and Figure 4E-F: The shift in mean theta power and peak frequency is reported significant in the text but not clear on the figure when no visible difference in the theta peak between trial 1 and 20 was observed. Also when looking at the numbers in this z-score power (subsection “Cerebello-hippocampal interactions during the learning of a goal-directed behavior”, third paragraph), the difference is barely visible and the SEM give overlapping numbers (1st trial between 1.59 and 1.69, 20th trial between 1.68 and 1.76 for example): the statistical test seems to be conflicting with these results. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Following our extensive re-analysis, the figures referred to by the reviewer are no longer present in the manuscript. We have endeavoured to ensure that all new analysis descriptions, statistics and results are clear to the reader. Indeed, changes in power are now better visualised after the trial by trial analysis averaged by distance from reward (Figure 4D-G). We have added information relating to the new findings in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) [Related to Essential Point 3] Some of the effects appear to rely heavily on smaller numbers of mice, although the authors do have quantitative explanations for the variability they observe (i.e. the recording distance from the midline in Figure 3F). Even so, Figure 3F seems to be primarily driven by two mice and in Figure 5, I was unsure of how the authors interpreted the high degree of variability in mean coherence in the Crus I data set.</p></disp-quote><p>Following re-analysis, we have now averaged coherence values obtained between the cerebellum and left/right hippocampus. Figure 3F (now Figure 3J) shows a strong correlation between theta coherence and electrode positioning within lobule VI. This correlation remains robust after our updated analysis in which we averaged down our coherence values so each data point corresponds to one animal. In terms of Crus I coherence variations, we have also conducted extensive reanalysis of this data set and we find that 3/4 animals show similar patterns of Crus I coherence change in the linear track task (Figures 4H and 5). Variations in recording electrode position within Crus I may have also contributed to variations in coherence levels as for lobule VI, but we were unable to accurately reconstruct the electrode positions with high enough resolution to systematically check this as we did for lobule VI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) [Related to Essential Point 3] The authors recorded the activity in both left and right hippocampus in all mice and they noted no difference (subsection “Cerebello-hippocampal physiological interactions in a familiar home-cage environment”, fourth paragraph) in the analysis of cerebello-hippocampal coherence. However, in Figure 4 to Figure 7 the data from different animals are indifferentially reported from data from the same animal. Indeed, the significant effects, for example for Crus I in Figure 5 and Figure 7D may be only due to a few values, possibly coming from only one or two animals; moreover it seems that some of the statistics are not performed using repeated-measure procedures. Please provide a clear view on left/right recording from each animal and clarify the statistics (e.g. averaging values from single animals). Overall, the number of mice seems a bit small for the task-related coherence analysis to evaluate reproducibility of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer points out, we observed no significant difference in values of coherence obtained between cerebellum and left or right hippocampus. The detailed comparison of HPC left vs. HPC right for each condition can be found in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1. Therefore, we have now changed the main figures and the statistical analysis presented in the manuscript to a single value of coherence between hippocampus and cerebellar regions per animal reflecting the average between left and right measurements when both are available.</p><p>Regarding the repeated-measure procedures they have been used when the data allowed for it; however, if this comment refers to its employment when comparing differences across combinations in a single condition (Figure 3 and Figure 4), each recording has been considered independent as they were locally referenced.</p></body></sub-article></article>
