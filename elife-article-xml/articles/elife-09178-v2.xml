Its essentiality may favor the accumulation of cryptic genetic variation (CGV) that has no effect in the wild-type but that enhances or suppresses the effects of rare disruptions to gene function. Here, we adapted a classical modifier screen to interrogate the alleles segregating in natural populations of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>: we induced gene knockdowns and used quantitative genetic methodology to examine how segregating variants modify the penetrance of embryonic lethality. Each perturbation revealed CGV, indicating that wild-type genomes harbor myriad genetic modifiers that may have little effect individually but which in aggregate can dramatically influence penetrance. Phenotypes were mediated by many modifiers, indicating high polygenicity, but the alleles tend to act very specifically, indicating low pleiotropy. Our findings demonstrate the extent of conditional functionality in complex trait architecture.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09178.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09178.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09178.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Individuals of the same species have similar, but generally not identical, DNA sequences. This ‘genetic variation’ is due to random changes in the DNA—known as mutations—that occur among individuals. These mutations may be passed on to these individuals' offspring, who in turn pass them on to their descendants. Some of these mutations may have a positive or negative effect on the ability of the organisms to survive and reproduce, but others may have no effect at all.</p><p>The process by which an embryo forms (which is called embryogenesis) follows a precisely controlled series of events. Within the same species, there is genetic variation in the DNA that programs embryogenesis, but it is not clear what effect this variation has on how the embryo develops. Here, Paaby et al. adapted a genetics technique called a ‘modifier screen’ to study how genetic variation affects the development of a roundworm known as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>.</p><p>The experiments show that populations of worms harbor a lot of genetic variation that affects how they tolerate the loss of an important gene. One by one, Paaby et al. interrupted the activity of specific genes that embryos need in order to develop. How this affected the embryo, and whether or not it was able to survive, was due in large part to the naturally-occurring genetic variation in other genes in these worms.</p><p>Paaby et al.'s findings serve as a reminder that the effect of a mutation depends on other DNA sequences in the organism. In humans, for example, a gene that causes a genetic disease may produce severe symptoms in one patient but mild symptoms in another. Future experiments will reveal the details of how genetic variation affects embryogenesis, which may also provide new insights into how complex processes in animals evolve over time.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09178.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09178.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cryptic genetic variation</kwd><kwd>genetic background</kwd><kwd>modifier variation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM089972</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rockman</surname><given-names>Matthew V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Zegar Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gunsalus</surname><given-names>Kristin C</given-names></name><name><surname>Piano</surname><given-names>Fabio</given-names></name><name><surname>Rockman</surname><given-names>Matthew V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001312</institution-id><institution>Charles H.

The average human genome contains loss-of-function alleles for 100 or more genes, some of which cause known genetic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abecasis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacArthur et al., 2012</xref>); disease expression depends on exposure of the disease allele, such as by homozygosity, but also on variants elsewhere in the genome that act as penetrance modifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamilton and Yu, 2012</xref>). When looked for, such modifier variation is routinely observed; in model organisms, this phenomenon is recognized as genetic background effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chandler et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Genetic background effects are an example of cryptic genetic variation (CGV), the class of mutations that affect phenotype under rare conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibson and Dworkin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paaby and Rockman, 2014</xref>). Unlike mutations that are always silent with respect to phenotype, or mutations that always affect phenotype, CGV is invisible until a perturbation changes the molecular, cellular, or developmental processes that govern its phenotypic expression. In addition to genetic perturbations, CGV may be ‘released’ by environmental exposure, like the modern changes to diet that have been hypothesized to underlie the emergence of complex metabolic diseases in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gibson, 2009</xref>). The concept of CGV has been of longstanding interest to evolutionary theorists because it explains how populations might store alleles that enable adaptation when conditions change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dobzhansky, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Waddington, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGuigan et al., 2011</xref>), but its extent, architecture, and role in nature is largely unknown. Most of our empirical knowledge of CGV arises from studies that inhibited the heat shock chaperone protein HSP90 to reveal previously-silent mutational effects across many taxa, which probably represents a general mechanism that buffers genome-wide functional variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Queitsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yeyati et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jarosz and Lindquist, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Wagner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rohner et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we aimed to systematically uncover and characterize genome-wide variation affecting a major metazoan process. <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryogenesis is both complex and typically invariant, which may favor the accumulation of mutations that act in a conditionally-functional manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibson and Dworkin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paaby and Rockman, 2014</xref>).

Worms were grown in liquid culture in 96-well plates, and RNAi was delivered by feeding the parental generation <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> expressing dsRNA against the target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cipriani and Piano, 2011</xref>). Each combination of strain and targeted gene was replicated in at least eight wells, and within each well an average of 10 adult worms contributed hundreds of offspring that were screened as dead or alive.

We then modeled the probability that an embryo would fail to develop as a function of targeted gene, worm strain, strain-by-gene interaction, and several experimental variables (see ‘Materials and methods’).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09178.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental scheme and methods.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Under ordinary conditions, wild-type <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryos hatch into larvae.

We observed substantial variation among strains, with some strains exhibiting more embryonic lethality across all targeted genes than other strains, but also significant gene-specific among-strain variation, where particular combinations of gene and strain exhibited surprisingly high or low lethality (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These two classes of variation represent two general mechanisms of modifier action. Informational modifiers (such as suppressors of nonsense mutations in classical screens [e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hodgkin et al., 1989</xref>], and modifiers of germline RNAi sensitivity in this experiment) alter the effect of the initial perturbation in a non-gene-specific manner, while gene-specific modifiers reveal functional features of the targeted locus. By screening for modifiers of many different perturbations, we are able to quantitatively partition the effects of these mechanisms. Of the variation attributable to heritable modifier variation among worms, half is explained by non-gene-specific informational modifiers and half by gene-specific modifier effects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09178.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Variability in embryonic lethality.</title><p>Each cell represents the embryonic hatching success for a strain and targeted gene, averaged from at least eight replicate wells.

We observed dramatic variation in sensitivity. Most strains exhibited moderately reduced lethality penetrance relative to the RNAi-sensitive laboratory strain N2, but two strains, the germline RNAi-insensitive strain CB4856 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tijsterman et al., 2002</xref>) and the genetically divergent strain QX1211, showed consistently weak penetrance across the targeted genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). CB4856 harbors a <italic>ppw-1</italic> loss-of-function mutation that confers resistance to germline RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tijsterman et al., 2002</xref>), but sequencing shows that QX1211 and other strains with intermediate sensitivity do not. We found that a <italic>ppw-1</italic> mutation in the N2 background was more sensitive than CB4856, showing high lethality on <italic>mex-3</italic> and <italic>pos-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that some of the difference between N2 and CB4856 is <italic>ppw-1</italic>-independent. These results demonstrate that insensitivity to germline RNAi is genetically complex and that wild <italic>C. elegans</italic> populations harbor many alleles affecting germline RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elvin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pollard and Rockman, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Genetic modifiers of RNAi efficacy in our experiment may affect uptake of dsRNA, general RNAi machinery, or tissue-specific RNAi requirements. To distinguish among these, we targeted <italic>tubulin</italic> (<italic>tba-2</italic>), which is expressed ubiquitously. Among wild-type strains, all but four (KR314, JU396, CB4852 and ED3040) showed complete sensitivity to somatic RNAi, indicated by developmental arrest of P<sub>0</sub> animals on <italic>tba-2</italic>, which demonstrates that most wild-type strains take up dsRNA and are capable of RNAi. An <italic>rrf-1</italic> deletion mutant, which is sensitive to RNAi against genes expressed in the germline but resistant to RNAi in most somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yigit et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumsta and Hansen, 2012</xref>), grew to adulthood but laid dead embryos, suggesting that germline RNAi successfully silenced maternal <italic>tba-2</italic> required for embryonic development. The four somatically-resistant wild strains also exhibited embryonic lethality on <italic>tba-2</italic> and other germline-expressed genes, confirming that the modifier variability acts tissue-specifically.</p><p>Gene-specific modifiers explain as much of the total variation as the informational modifiers, as estimated by the strain-by-gene interaction term in our model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), and represent cryptic genetic variation in developmental processes. The modifiers could act via network bypasses, where loss of the targeted gene reveals variation among strains in developmental network structure (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang and Emmons, 2000</xref>). Gene-specific modifiers could also act on the extent of the knockdown at a gene-specific level, in a manner akin to intragenic suppressors, resulting in variable residual activity of the targeted gene. This latter class potentially includes gene-specific variation in RNAi sensitivity, perhaps due to heritable variation in transcriptional licensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shirayama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seth et al., 2013</xref>), and variation in wild-type expression level of the targeted gene, due to cis- or trans-acting regulatory variation.</p><p>Each of the 29 genes we targeted showed significant strain-by-gene interaction coefficients, indicating that genetic modifiers of embryonic gene perturbations are pervasive in natural populations. The coefficients, which are statistical estimates of the gene-specific cryptic phenotypes (see ‘Materials and methods’), exhibit low correlations between gene perturbations known to share function: 36 gene pairs have known physical or genetic interactions, but these did not show significantly elevated phenotypic correlations (χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.30, df = 1, p = 0.13). For example, despite high interaction within the <italic>par</italic> network, which underlies polarization of the zygote, the average pairwise <italic>par</italic> gene correlation was no higher than the average correlation across all genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Coefficients for <italic>par-3</italic> and <italic>par-6</italic> were correlated (correlation = 0.40, p = 0.003), but not for <italic>par-3</italic> and <italic>pkc-3</italic> (correlation = −0.17, p = 0.24) or <italic>par-6</italic> and <italic>pkc-3</italic> (correlation = 0.12, p = 0.41), even though their proteins together comprise the anterior polarity complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Munro et al., 2004</xref>). This indicates that the cryptic genetic modifiers have low developmental pleiotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paaby and Rockman, 2013</xref>). That is, variation at these loci must influence a very restricted suite of developmental events, since only specific perturbations uncover evidence of their phenotypic effects. For those associated with polarization of the zygote, this may be explained by the high degree of redundancy observed in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beatty et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fievet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Motegi and Seydoux, 2013</xref>), as redundancy allows shared function of some factors and specificity of others. Exceptions to the overall trend of low correlation between gene perturbations are discussed below, in the context of genome-wide associations. The low pleiotropy of cryptic alleles may be a result of purifying selection, which over evolutionary time should deplete populations of pleiotropic alleles as they may be more likely to be deleterious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stern, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Our quantitative-genetic approach is uniquely able to discern modifier effects that depend simultaneously on variants at many loci. In order to evaluate the polygenicity of the gene-specific variation we observed, and to ask whether cryptic alleles are rare or common in populations, we assessed whether genome-wide genetic similarity among strains explained patterns of phenotypic similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2008</xref>). Specifically, we estimated the genomic heritability of the strain-by-gene coefficients. This approach estimates the proportion of gene-specific modifier effects caused by alleles of intermediate frequency at many loci, as these are best captured in estimates of strain relatedness.</p><p>We found that for most of the perturbations, variation in lethality penetrance is due to common alleles at many contributing cryptic loci. Of the 29 genes we targeted, 12 exhibited gene-specific modifier variation with genomic heritability estimates greater than 0.80; for 19 genes, estimates were greater than 0.60 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). However, genotypic similarity failed to explain phenotypic similarity for perturbations of <italic>emb-30</italic>, <italic>mel-32</italic>, <italic>mex-3</italic>, <italic>mom-5</italic>, <italic>par-3</italic> and <italic>sur-6</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Because these genes exhibit nonzero variance in their associated strain-by-gene interaction coefficients, the strains necessarily harbor cryptic genetic differences affecting lethality under these perturbations. Thus, the genetic architecture of the cryptic variation associated with these genes is likely comprised of few loci, rarer alleles, or both.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09178.006</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Genome heritability estimates for CGV phenotypes associated with 29 targeted genes</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09178.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09178.006</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Targeted gene</th><th>Heritability estimate</th><th>p-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic>aph-1</italic></td><td>0.6747</td><td>0.16</td></tr><tr><td><italic>car-1</italic></td><td>0.9149</td><td>0.02</td></tr><tr><td><italic>cdc-37</italic></td><td>0.7308</td><td>0.11</td></tr><tr><td><italic>cdc-42</italic></td><td>0.3639</td><td>0.29</td></tr><tr><td><italic>emb-30</italic></td><td>0.0000</td><td>0.46</td></tr><tr><td><italic>fat-2</italic></td><td>0.3548</td><td>0.32</td></tr><tr><td><italic>lag-1</italic></td><td>0.9075</td><td>0.01</td></tr><tr><td><italic>lsy-22</italic></td><td>0.1270</td><td>0.43</td></tr><tr><td><italic>mel-26</italic></td><td>0.8245</td><td>0.05</td></tr><tr><td><italic>mel-28</italic></td><td>0.8410</td><td>0.04</td></tr><tr><td><italic>mel-32</italic></td><td>0.0000</td><td>0.47</td></tr><tr><td><italic>mex-3</italic></td><td>0.0000</td><td>0.76</td></tr><tr><td><italic>mom-2</italic></td><td>0.7485</td><td>0.09</td></tr><tr><td><italic>mom-5</italic></td><td>0.0000</td><td>0.46</td></tr><tr><td><italic>nmy-2</italic></td><td>0.4841</td><td>0.26</td></tr><tr><td><italic>par-1</italic></td><td>0.7871</td><td>0.08</td></tr><tr><td><italic>par-2</italic></td><td>0.9719</td><td>0.01</td></tr><tr><td><italic>par-3</italic></td><td>0.0000</td><td>0.77</td></tr><tr><td><italic>par-4</italic></td><td>0.9032</td><td>0.07</td></tr><tr><td><italic>par-5</italic></td><td>0.6640</td><td>0.15</td></tr><tr><td><italic>par-6</italic></td><td>0.9258</td><td>0.01</td></tr><tr><td><italic>pkc-3</italic></td><td>0.8136</td><td>0.06</td></tr><tr><td><italic>pos-1</italic></td><td>0.7307</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td><italic>rfc-3</italic></td><td>0.6958</td><td>0.13</td></tr><tr><td><italic>rpn-9</italic></td><td>0.8715</td><td>0.02</td></tr><tr><td><italic>rpn-10</italic></td><td>0.8397</td><td>0.05</td></tr><tr><td><italic>skn-1</italic></td><td>0.8599</td><td>0.03</td></tr><tr><td><italic>skr-2</italic></td><td>0.8961</td><td>0.02</td></tr><tr><td><italic>sur-6</italic></td><td>0.0000</td><td>0.47</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>To locate genome regions harboring gene-specific modifiers, we performed genome-wide association (GWA) mapping using the strain-by-gene interaction coefficients as phenotypes.

These associations were spread across 15 targeted-gene phenotypes. No SNPs lie within or near the locus of the targeted gene, with the exception of one SNP within the <italic>mel-28</italic> locus that associates with the <italic>mel-28</italic> phenotype. The <italic>mel-28</italic> phenotype is also associated with multiple other SNPs elsewhere in the genome. Thus, most of the CGV detectable by GWA is caused by extragenic modifiers.</p><p>Extragenic modifiers may work by affecting, in trans, the expression level of the targeted gene. Recent work shows that differences in severity of RNAi phenotype, for four <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains perturbed at electron transport chain genes, are associated with differences in expression level of the targeted gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vu et al., 2015</xref>). However, we find no evidence for the reported pattern of lower expression explaining more severe phenotypes. We examined published transcript abundances for our 29 target genes measured in 4-cell embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grishkevich et al., 2012</xref>) under standard conditions in five strains. Five of the genes exhibited significant variation in expression among the strains. In contrast, RNAi against 28 induced significant gene-specific variation in embryonic lethality among the five strains. Overall, both for genes with significant variation and for the whole set, lower expression of the target gene was usually correlated with less severe RNAi phenotypes (20 of 29 genes, p = 0.06), though the correlations are weak. Although undetectable differences in transcript level may nevertheless contribute to embryonic survival, these results suggest that much of the gene-specific modifier effect we observe depends on variation beyond the target gene.</p><p>Our GWA mapping identified few SNPs associated with more than one phenotype. For example, lethality phenotypes for 4 of the 7 targeted polarity genes (<italic>par-2</italic>, <italic>-4</italic>, <italic>-6</italic> and <italic>pkc-3</italic>) were associated with SNPs, but none were shared. The discrete nature of the genotype–phenotype associations further implies low developmental pleiotropy of the cryptic alleles; variants with effects under one perturbation have no detectable effects under another.</p><p>However, the rare instances of multiple associations for individual SNPs implicate a relationship between the targeted genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The co-association of SNPs in a haplotype block on chromosome IV with lethality phenotypes for <italic>rpn-9</italic> and <italic>rpn-10</italic> support a known relationship, as <italic>rpn-9</italic> and <italic>rpn-10</italic> both encode non-ATPase regulatory subunits of the proteasome and are predicted to interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhong and Sternberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2008</xref>).

Because the co-associations occur twice, with unlinked SNPs (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.26), they implicate the presence of at least two interacting cryptic alleles and provide independent lines of evidence for a relationship between <italic>pkc-3</italic> and <italic>rfc-3</italic>, genes with no reported interactions or shared functions.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have uncovered pervasive CGV that modifies the probability that an embryo will survive a gene perturbation.

Wells were photographed at the point at which viable embryos had hatched but not developed past early larval stages. We captured single images of each well using a DFC340 FX camera and a Z16 dissecting microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL), a Bio-precision motorized stage with adaptors for the 96-well plates and stage fittings (Ludl, Inc., Hawthorne, NY), and Surveyor software from Media Cybernetics, Inc.

DevStaR is an object recognition machine that classifies each object in the image as an adult, larva or embryo using a support vector machine and global shape recognition. Embryonic lethality estimates were derived from the proportion of embryos in each well relative to all progeny (embryos plus larvae). During the development of DevStaR, each of the approximately 30,000 images in this experiment were manually evaluated and assigned qualitative scores for the number of embryos and the number of larvae, and exact counts were determined for the adults in each well. These data provided independent phenotype estimates and demonstrate that DevStaR is accurate and reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">White et al., 2013</xref>), and we used the manually-collected adult count data in our analyses evaluating the number of adults in each well.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The counts of dead embryos and living larvae from each experimental well were bound together as a single response variable and modeled using a generalized linear model with a quasi-binomial error structure.

Genomic heritability estimates for each of the cryptic phenotypes represented by the strain-by-gene coefficients was determined from the genetic and residual error variance components estimated by restricted maximum likelihood, using the function <italic>emma.REMLE</italic>.

If the strain was identical at the 1454 SNPs assayed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rockman and Kruglyak (2009)</xref> to a strain genotyped by RAD-seq, we used the RAD-seq data of the matching strain. This allowed us to use genotype data of CB4854 for CB3197; JU310 for JU301; JU311 for JU319; JU367 for JU371, and MY10 for MY21. In each of these cases, multiple RAD-sequenced strains collapse into groups of strains that are also identical at the 1454 SNPs, suggesting that this procedure is reliable. Only in the case of JU366 do we encounter uncertainty. At the 1454 SNP markers, this strain is identical to JU360, JU363, and JU368 (and three others not RAD-sequenced). JU360 and JU368 have identical RAD-seq haplotypes, but JU363 is different at 224 sites (of which 164 were tested for association with phenotype). We substituted both JU360 and JU363 as proxies for JU366 and ran the full GWAS pipeline twice; the differences in outcome were negligible, with extremely tight correlation among SNP p-values across all tests and no differences in the set of statistically significant SNPs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Validation of CGV by introgression</title><p>We created the strain QG611, which carries two markers (<italic>mIs12</italic>, expressing GFP in the pharynx, and <italic>juIs76</italic>, expressing GFP in the motor neurons) in the N2 wild-type background. The markers are positioned at the approximate middle and right end of chromosome II, respectively (precise locations are unknown), which flank the region for which <italic>lsy-22</italic> and <italic>pkc-3</italic> phenotypes were associated. We crossed QG611 to wild-type strain EG4348 and then backcrossed to EG4348 for 20 generations, retaining the N2 introgression by selecting for the double markers. The introgression strain, QG1438, carries the N2 haplotype from approximately II 3,174,000 to the right of II 14,430,751. To test the effect of the introgression on <italic>lsy-22</italic> and <italic>pkc-3</italic> perturbations, RNAi was induced by feeding on agarose plates following standard protocols (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wormbook.org">wormbook.org</ext-link>): test worms were singled onto plates, 6 replicates each, at the L4 stage following bleaching and developmental synchronization; worms were transferred daily for 3 days and the number of dead embryos and hatched larvae were counted 24 hr after transfer. Test strains included QG611 (the GFP constructs in QG611 have no effect on phenotype relative to N2, data not shown), EG4348, and QG1438.

We observed nucleotide variation in these genes, but zero mutations in the exons targeted by the RNAi clones we used.

Off-target predictions for our RNAi clones were generated from a sliding window analysis of matching 21-mers between the RNAi reagent and the <italic>C. elegans</italic> reference genome (ce10).

These data were collected on 4-cell embryos, which retain the maternally-inherited mRNA transcripts that were the targets of our study, and include three replicate values (following quantile normalization and log<sub>10</sub> transformation) determined from three pools of 50 embryos each. We examined gene expression values for the 29 targeted genes, collected under control conditions, for five strains: AB2, CB4856, CB4857, N2, and RC301 (identical to PX174, which we tested in our study). We tested for the genotypic effect of strain with an ANOVA and for correlations between the transcriptome data and our estimates of gene-specific CGV using the Spearman Rank method. For each gene, we looked for correlation between the average gene expression value for each of the five strains and the strain coefficients from the strain-by-gene interaction term in our statistical analysis. We used the same generalized linear model structure as described above; in this analysis, we included 29 genes and five strains. We used a two-tailed binomial sign test to assess whether the 29 correlations were disproportionately positive or negative.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank M Mana for RNAi clones, H-L Kao for help in computational data management, and P Cipriani, E Munarriz and K Erickson assistance with the high-throughput phenotyping platform.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper uses counts of dead embryos and living <italic>C. elegans</italic> larvae as a phenotype to explore the extent of naturally occurring genetic variation in the presence of mutations in embryonic genes. The authors report that knockdown of the same gene has different effects in different isolates. These results represent a systematic analysis of the background genetic effects that mitigate gene knockdown on cell or developmental processes. The authors’ results have broad implications for evolutionary, cellular and developmental biology.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors discovered that knocking down the same genes in different isolates has different effects on embryonic lethality and the authors state that this observation indicates that there is cryptic genetic variation. It is not clear that this interpretation is correct. The alternative possibility is that the variation is not “cryptic”: i.e. that development (and/or embryonic lethality) is really phenotypically different in the different isolates.</p><p>The authors state that “Embryogenesis is an essential and stereotypic process.” While it is certainly true that development is stereotypic within the standard lab strain, N2, no study reports the extent of similarity of development across different <italic>C. elegans</italic> isolates. Thus, it seems possible that development could be different between different isolates. Similarly, spontaneous embryonic lethality (in the absence of any gene knockdown) might also vary across <italic>C. elegans</italic> isolates.</p><p>If development and spontaneous embryonic lethality are phenotypically different in different isolates then it does not makes sense to say that a different genetic basis for these traits is “cryptic”. Thus, the authors should either i) demonstrate that development and/or embryonic lethality is phenotypically similar in the different isolates, or ii) better justify in what sense the observed genetic variation is “cryptic”, or iii) not refer to the observed genetic variation as “cryptic”.</p><p>2) The authors state that “We have uncovered pervasive CGV among wild <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains in the molecular and cellular processes of embryogenesis” and their title is “Wild worm embryogenesis harbors ubiquitous polygenic modifier variation”. However, the authors study embryonic lethality. While their results might certainly have interesting implications for the genetic basis of “cellular processes of embryogenesis” and other aspects of “embryogenesis”, strictly speaking, their data does not address phenotypes other than embryonic lethality. The paper would be improved by a more extensive discussion of the limitations of their results in this regard.</p><p>3) The “non-informational” variants are of greatest interest to developmental and evolutionary biologists. It is thus important to rule out as much of this as possible. The authors themselves note that “gene-specific modifiers ... potentially include gene-specific variation in RNAi sensitivity, perhaps due to heritable variation in transcriptional licensing and variation in wild-type expression level of the targeted gene, due to cis- or trans-acting regulatory variation.” This could be tested by generating transcriptomes for five or so strains with unusually divergent phenotype distributions. This would then allow the authors to directly estimate the extent to which gene-by-strain interactions are due to expression levels. RNAi knockdown efficacy is also an important informational variation to explore, but much harder to address.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09178.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors discovered that knocking down the same genes in different isolates has different effects on embryonic lethality and the authors state that this observation indicates that there is cryptic genetic variation.

The paper would be improved by a more extensive discussion of the limitations of their results in this regard</italic>.</p><p>Points 1) and 2) identify important conceptual definitions in our work, and these definitions are inter-related.</p><p>We define cryptic genetic variation in terms of a focal phenotype (in our case, embryonic lethality). There is every expectation that the cryptic variation that affects embryonic lethality also causes variation in cellular or developmental phenotypes in a penetrant, non-cryptic manner, as the comment describes; we would interpret such variation as a potential mechanism for the cryptic differences in lethality. Wild isolates of <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibit measureable variation in several aspects of early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farhadifar et al. 2015</xref>), but under standard conditions the embryos of all strains hatch into larvae at rates approaching 100%. Variation in hatching rates under standard conditions is radically amplified by RNAi perturbation, and this newly exposed variation is CGV (Paaby &amp; Rockman). Thus, to address comment 1), we added the following paragraph to the Discussion, which expands upon our conceptualization of cryptic variation and in doing so follows suggestions i) and ii) above:</p><p>“We describe the variation we uncovered as “cryptic” because its effect on embryonic survival is dramatically magnified under perturbed conditions. Without gene perturbation, our strains exhibit little embryonic lethality. However, under ordinary conditions the strains vary in gene expression and other cellular or developmental phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farhadifar et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grishkevich et al. 2012</xref>), which may be the mechanisms by which the cryptic alleles influence the penetrance of the primary perturbation. Previously, we and others have described such differences as variation in “intermediate” phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Félix &amp; Wagner 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paaby &amp; Rockman 2014</xref>); whether a genetic variant is cryptic requires definition of the focal phenotype, since even at the morphological level an allele can be cryptic in one trait but penetrant in another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duveau &amp; Félix 2012</xref>).”</p><p>In defining the relationship between our embryonic lethality data and hypothetical observations of cellular or developmental phenotypes, the added paragraph more clearly delineates the extent of our results, which is the concern raised by point 2). We also agree with the reviewers that the language of “We have uncovered pervasive CGV among wild <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains in the molecular and cellular processes of embryogenesis” misstates the nature of our data, and we have rephrased this sentence in the Discussion to “We have uncovered pervasive CGV among wild <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains that modifies the probability that an embryo will survive a gene perturbation.”</p><p><italic>3) The “non-informational” variants are of greatest interest to developmental and evolutionary biologists. It is thus important to rule out as much of this as possible. The authors themselves note that “gene-specific modifiers ... potentially include gene-specific variation in RNAi sensitivity, perhaps due to heritable variation in transcriptional licensing and variation in wild-type expression level of the targeted gene, due to cis- or trans-acting regulatory variation.” This could be tested by generating transcriptomes for five or so strains with unusually divergent phenotype distributions. This would then allow the authors to directly estimate the extent to which gene-by-strain interactions are due to expression levels. RNAi knockdown efficacy is also an important informational variation to explore, but much harder to address</italic>.</p><p>This is a very important point and we are glad to expand upon our understanding of the issue. We fully agree with the reviewers that experiments that evaluate variation in efficacy of RNAi across strains would be very valuable. Such an experiment would require extremely good estimates of transcript level (ideally across developmental stage), both with and without RNAi. As suggested, transcript data collected under standard conditions would also address whether and how the strains vary in native gene expression, which is an informative aspect of embryogenesis independent of the question of RNAi efficacy.</p><p>We also agree with the reviewers that the non-informational components of variation are potentially the most interesting. Unfortunately, the myriad and complex ways in which gene-specific knockdown might vary across strains, including by mechanisms that are just beginning to be elucidated (e.g. transcriptional licensing), preclude us from easily distinguishing between different classes of CGV mechanism. The review points to one class of mechanism, variation in wild-type expression level, that we can explicitly test. A very recently published paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vu et al. 2015</xref>) has shown that, across four strains with perturbations to genes involved in the electron transport chain, a strain with a more severe RNAi phenotype tends to have lower wild-type expression of the targeted gene. We acquired embryonic transcriptome data from the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grishkevich et al. (2012)</xref> and tested for a correlation between gene expression level and our estimates of embryonic lethality. These results do not address whether variation in expression is, for example, via a trans effect that elevates overall pathway activity and compensates for knockdown of a particular member (i.e., the gene expression and RNAi phenotype share a common cause), or a cis- or trans-acting effect specific to the targeted gene, revealing pre-existing dosage variation that is tolerated under unperturbed conditions but causal of the RNAi phenotype under perturbation (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Milloz et al. 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, this analysis adds a valuable component to our manuscript and a useful step forward in the larger exploration of the problem.</p><p>Overall, we found that wild-type gene expression in our 29 genes, examined across five strains, did not correlate with the embryonic lethality phenotypes of those strains. We added the following to the Results section:</p><p>“Extragenic modifiers may work by affecting, in trans, the expression level of the targeted gene. Recent work shows that differences in severity of RNAi phenotype, for four <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains perturbed at electron transport chain genes, are associated with differences in expression level of the targeted gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vu et al. 2015</xref>). However, we find no evidence for the reported pattern of lower expression explaining more severe phenotypes. […] Although undetectable differences in transcript level may nevertheless contribute to embryonic survival, these results suggest that much of the gene-specific modifier effect we observe depends on variation beyond the target gene.”</p><p>And we added the following to the Materials and methods (Comparison of gene expression and embryonic lethality data):</p><p>“To test whether native gene expression of our target genes correlates with the embryonic lethality phenotypes, we downloaded microarray transcriptome data published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grishkevich et al. (2012)</xref>. These data were collected on 4-cell embryos, which retain the maternally-inherited mRNA transcripts that were the targets of our study, and include three replicate values (following quantile normalization and log10 transformation) determined from three pools of 50 embryos each. […]For each gene, we looked for correlation between the average gene expression value for each of the five strains and the strain coefficients from the strain-by-gene interaction term in our statistical analysis. We used the same generalized linear model structure as described above; in this analysis, we included 29 genes and five strains. We used a two-tailed binomial sign test to assess whether the 29 correlations were disproportionately positive or negative.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
