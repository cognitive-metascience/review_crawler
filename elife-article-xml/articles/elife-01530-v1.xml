Using a biosensor to visualize p53 action, we find that <italic>Drosophila</italic> p53 is selectively active in gonadal stem cells after exposure to stressors that destabilize the genome. Similar p53 activity occurred in hyperplastic growths that were triggered either by the Ras<sup>V12</sup> oncoprotein or by failed differentiation programs. In a model of transient sterility, p53 was required for the recovery of fertility after stress, and entry into the cell cycle was delayed in p53<sup>-</sup> stem cells. Together, these observations establish that the stem cell compartment of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline is selectively licensed for stress-induced activation of the p53 regulatory network. Furthermore, the findings uncover ancestral links between p53 and aberrant proliferation that are independent of DNA breaks and predate evolution of the ARF/Mdm2 axis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01530.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01530.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01530.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The most common genetic change seen in cancer patients produces a faulty version of the p53 protein, which normally restricts tissue growth. This change promotes cancer because cells can now divide faster and fail to die when they should. Much remains to be learned about how p53 functions to restrain growth. As p53 is found in primitive organisms, and cancer is unlikely to have significantly influenced evolution, suppressing tumor formation was almost certainly not the original function of this gene. Furthermore, p53 works in a different way compared to many other tumour suppressors. Therefore, prevention of cancer is likely to have evolved as a side effect derived from more ancient functions.</p><p>Recently, a link between p53 and stem cells has been uncovered. Stem cells are special because they can develop into many different types of cells, and they are crucial for the growth and repair of tissues. To form a particular type of cell, the stem cell divides to create two daughter cells. Commonly, one daughter cell stays in the stem state, whereas the other becomes a particular type of cell, such as a nerve cell or muscle cell. Because of this special property, scientists hypothesize that stem cells have special mechanisms to protect them from DNA damage that might partially depend on p53. This would prevent the spread of damaged genomes that would otherwise occur among daughter cells.</p><p>To learn more about how p53 influences stem cells, Wylie, Lu et al. monitored its activity in the gonads of fruit flies, which are a powerful genetic model. They found that damaging DNA activates p53 in stem cells and their daughter cells, but not in other types of cells that have been damaged. In addition, p53 is activated by the uncontrolled growth and division of stem cells in the gonad, even when DNA is not damaged. This is unexpected since molecules linking inappropriate growth to p53 were thought to be present only in mammals. Therefore, it appears that the tumor-suppressing behavior of p53 in mammals was adapted from its more ancient ability to regulate stem cell growth—an ability that evolved before organisms divided into vertebrates and invertebrates.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01530.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01530.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>germline</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>biosensor</kwd><kwd>oncogenic stress</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CPRIT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP110076</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abrams</surname><given-names>John M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ellison Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG-SS-2743-11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abrams</surname><given-names>John M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM072124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abrams</surname><given-names>John M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1727</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abrams</surname><given-names>John M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Genetics Training Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32GM083831</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wylie</surname><given-names>Annika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM086647</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buszczak</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ancient features of the p53 regulatory network are coupled to the stem cell compartment in normal and pathologic contexts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Throughout the animal kingdom, p53 occupies a central position within conserved stress response networks. The protein integrates diverse signals associated with DNA damage and uncontrolled proliferation to govern adaptive downstream responses such as increased DNA repair, arrested cell cycle, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vousden and Lane, 2007</xref>). Where examined, the genes encoding p53 are not essential for viability but have been implicated as regulators of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Derry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Donehower et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sogame et al., 2003</xref>). It is now well appreciated that ancestral roles for this gene family must have predated functions in tumor suppression. In support of this, members of the p53 gene family are present in unicellular protists and short-lived multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mendoza et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nordstrom and Abrams, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, cancer was probably a negligible source of selection pressure during the course of human evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aranda-Anzaldo and Dent, 2007</xref>) and the combined removal of canonical p53 effectors (p21, Puma, and Noxa) does not account for tumor suppression in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Valente et al., 2013</xref>). These and other observations suggest that tumor suppressive roles for the p53 family were co-opted from primordial functions, some of which may have been linked to meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, considerable evidence has surfaced linking p53 action to stem cell biology. For example, in mammary stem cells p53 promotes asymmetric division and cell polarity, thereby helping to limit the population of stem cells in the mammary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cicalese et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is greatly increased in p53 deficient cells, suggesting that p53 may act as a ‘barrier for induced pluripotency’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krizhanovsky and Lowe, 2009</xref>). Consistent with this, several labs have shown that p53 induces embryonic stem cell differentiation to maintain genomic stability after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neveu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhao and Xu, 2010</xref>). Together with recent studies in planaria, these observations indicate that an ancestral focus of p53 action could operate in stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pearson and Sanchez Alvarado, 2009</xref>). We directly tested this possibility using a p53 biosensor to visualize <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline stem cells and their progeny. When DNA breaks were exogenously imposed or intrinsically engineered, <italic>Drosophila</italic> p53 (Dp53) was activated selectively in germline stem cells (GSCs) and their immediate daughters, indicating that these cells are uniquely licensed for p53 action. Furthermore, in various germline tumor models Dp53 was constitutively hyperactivated, suggesting that ancient links between p53 and inappropriate growth predate canonical effectors that connect these regulatory networks (e.g., ARF and MDM2).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Damage-induced Dp53 activity in the germline is restricted to stem cells</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> gonad is a classic system for studying the stem cell compartment since stem cells, their immediate daughters, and the surrounding niche are easily identified. In the ovary, germline stem cells (GSCs) undergo self-renewing divisions that typically produce a GSC and a cystoblast (CB). These GSCs support egg production throughout the lifespan of female adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We used in vivo biosensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brodsky et al., 2000</xref>) to visualize p53 activity as GSCs responded to various sources of stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To exclude technical artifacts, two GFP reporters were used—one localizes to the nucleus (p53R-GFPnls) and the other does not (p53R-GFPcyt). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2010</xref>), programed p53 activity triggered by meiosis was only observed in region 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). After exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) stress, p53 activity was induced in virtually all germaria. However, despite widespread damage to the organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), this unprogrammed response was remarkably restricted to germline stem cells (GSCs) and their immediate progeny (CBs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>). Furthermore, as seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1A</xref>, this response was highly penetrant. Since we rarely observe reporter activation only in CBs, the signal seen in CBs probably reflects GFP perduring from the parental stem cells. Furthermore, post-irradiation levels of GFP were noticeably more robust than the programed activity during meiosis (compare solid arrows to open arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). As expected, p53 biosensor activity was not observed within the ovary of p53<sup>−/−</sup> animals and was also absent from ovaries lacking the upstream Chk2 kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A′,A′′</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01530.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genotoxic stress selectively triggers p53 activity in ovarian stem cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Construction of p53 biosensors. A well-characterized p53 enhancer (black line) that contains a p53 consensus binding site (blue box) conserved from flies to humans resides upstream of the <italic>reaper</italic> locus (gray box) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brodsky et al., 2000</xref>). A 150-bp fragment containing this enhancer was placed upstream of GFP (p53R-GFP). Transgenic fly strains are made with two reporter constructs, one contains a nuclear localization signal for GFP (p53R-GFPnls) and the other one does not (p53R-GFPcyt). Stimuli that trigger p53 activation induce GFP expression. These biosensors require wild-type p53 and are effective readouts for p53 function. (<bold>B</bold>) Germline stem cells (GSCs) are in contact with cap cells (in gray) at the apical tip of the germarium and undergo self-renewing division to produce a GSC and cystoblast (CBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spradling et al., 2001</xref>). In unperturbed ovaries, programed activation of the p53R-GFP biosensor is triggered by meiotic recombination in region 2 of the germarium, marked by open arrowhead in (<bold>C</bold>) and (<bold>D</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2010</xref>).

Therefore, to determine whether DSBs are sufficient to induce the p53 reporter, we ubiquitously expressed the I-SceI endonuclease in the germline of flies engineered to harbor a single I-SceI recognition site in each nucleus. As seen with IR exposure, p53 activity occurred only in GSCs/CBs when DSBs were induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1B</xref>). Furthermore, it is notable that a single DSB was sufficient to provoke robust p53 activity in GSCs/CBs. Therefore, whether exogenously imposed or intrinsically engineered, DSBs triggered p53 selective activation that was confined to GSCs and their immediate progeny. Furthermore, this stem cell restricted response is clearly under genetic control. For example, in directed tests of chosen mutants we identified a class of lesions that exhibit non-selective p53 action throughout the ovary only after IR challenge (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1C</xref>). Therefore, p53 is present and potentially functional in all cells of the ovary but, under normal conditions, its action is somehow confined to GSCs and their immediate progeny.</p><p>To ask whether this pattern might reflect a general property of germline stem cells, we similarly examined the male gonad. As seen in the ovary, we observed selective p53 reporter activation in GSCs and their immediate progeny (gonioblasts) in irradiated testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Likewise, stimulus-dependent activity required p53 and was not seen in unchallenged testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1A</xref>). Occasionally, the biosensor was also present in early spermatogonial cysts, perhaps reflecting perduring GFP and/or independent activation associated with dying cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–D′′</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D-E′′</xref>). Collectively, the observations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> demonstrate that selective p53 activation in the stem cell compartment is a general property of germline tissues exposed to genotoxic stress. We note that perturbation-dependent induction of the p53 biosensor in gonadal stem cells was highly penetrant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

In contrast, females lacking p53 remained permanently infertile even when tracked over 2 weeks after IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To confirm that p53 gene function is responsible for this phenotype, we tested p53<sup>−</sup> females carrying a genomic rescue fragment spanning the p53 gene (see ‘Materials and methods’).

To test whether inappropriate growth triggers <italic>Drosophila</italic> p53 function, we examined the p53 biosensors in various germline tumor models. First, we expressed an oncogenic form of RAS commonly found in human cancers together with the p53 biosensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 1996</xref>). Transient expression of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ras<sup>V12</sup> counterpart provoked robust p53 activation mainly in the GSCs and CBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> shows that another oncoprotein, Cyclin E, produced similar results.

Therefore, whether caused by forced oncoprotein expression (panels B, E), failed differentiation programs (panels C, D), or expansion of the stem cell niche (panels F–H), inappropriate growth of <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues was consistently accompanied by p53 activity. As seen with genotoxic stress, biosensor responses seen in these contexts was somewhat variable, perhaps reflecting complex signaling and/or cell cycle dynamics that occur in these tumor models.

We note that stem cell specificity was not an artifact intrinsic to the biosensors, since independent reporters behaved similarly in both the female and male germline and required the wild-type Dp53 locus in both cases. Furthermore, in certain mutant backgrounds stress-induced activity restricted to GSCs was lost and non-selective p53 activation was widespread throughout the ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B′</xref>). Therefore, despite the fact that it is present and activatable throughout the gonad, functional p53 is restricted to stem cells and their immediate progeny by specific genetic determinants.</p><p>Collectively, our work supports previous indications that there is an intimate and ancient link between p53 and stem cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pearson and Sanchez Alvarado, 2009</xref>). Our findings also offer rare and novel opportunities to operationally mark the stem cells in the fly germline, as visualized by p53R-GFP. This marker is distinct from conventional stem cell labels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deng and Lin, 1997</xref>) since it is not constitutively expressed but, instead, represents a functional output that is conditional upon a perturbation. We further note that like all reporter systems, our p53 biosensors may not reflect the full scope of effector output regulated by this network, and activities visualized here could transmit only subsets of p53-mediated responses. Nevertheless, despite this possible limitation, our results are consistent with suggestions that stem cells may be acutely sensitive to sources of genomic instability with a higher propensity for engaging adaptive responses relative to other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mandal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sperka et al., 2012</xref>). We propose that in reproductive tissues, the p53 regulatory network is either preferentially licensed in stem cells or selectively blocked outside of this compartment.</p><p>What upstream regulators might specify p53 activation in GSCs/CBs? Given that stem cells have unique properties, p53 activation in these cells might lie downstream of a novel pathway. Consistent with this idea, ATR expression, was not rate limiting for p53 activation in the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A′</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1C</xref>). Furthermore, unlike meiotic induction, p53 induction in GSCs/CBs was independent of the topoisomerase, Spo11 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al, 2010</xref>). Chk2 could contribute to the selective activation in stem cells seen here, but since Chk2 is also broadly expressed and functionally associated with oocyte development throughout the ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oishi et al., 1998</xref>) any potential role in GSCs must extend beyond a simple presence or absence of this kinase.</p><p>Our findings also imply stimulus-dependent effectors of p53 in stem cells that are not yet appreciated. For example, within detection limits, we observed no obvious connection between p53 status and apoptosis, DNA double-strand break repair, or cell cycle arrest. However, irradiated <italic>p53</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> GSCs were significantly delayed in the re-entry phase for cell cycle. Future studies will explore this defect and also examine progeny derived from stressed GSCs for transgenerational phenotypes that might be adaptive.</p><p>Our discovery that p53 action is coupled to hyperplasia in a non-vertebrate species was unexpected for two reasons. First, the role of this gene family as a tumor suppressor is thought to be a derived feature that evolved only in vertebrate lineages. Second, the canonical ARF/MDM2 pathway that links aberrant growth to p53 is absent outside of higher vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). Surprisingly, our combined results suggest that ancient pathways linking p53 to aberrant stem cell proliferation may predate the divergence between vertebrates and invertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and genetics</title><p>All fly stocks were maintained at 22–25°C on standard food media.

All other stocks were obtained from Bloomington Stock Center (Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA). The Dp53 rescue strain was engineered by ϕC31 integration of a 20-kb genomic fragment BAC containing the Dp53 locus into an attP site on the X chromosome of the PBac{y + -attP-9A}VK00006 line (Bloomington #9726). The parent BAC CH322-15D03 was obtained from the P[acman] resource library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Venken et al., 2009</xref>) and Rainbow Transgenic Flies performed the injection and screening for recombinants. The I-SceI endonuclease strain was generated by K Galindo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galindo et al., 2009</xref>), which was crossed to p53R-GFPnls(STI150); HS-(70Flp)(70 I- Sce I)/TM6 for heat-inducible I-SceI endonuclease expression. Adult females were fattened for 2–3 days after eclosion and then subjected to heat shock in a circulating water bath at 37°C for 90 min and repeated for three consecutive days. 24 hr after the last heat shock, ovaries were dissected for immunostaining. For forced proliferation assays, two GAL4 lines were used: <italic>nanos</italic>-GAL4VP16 was used to achieve overexpression in the germline with UAS constructs for Ras<sup>V12</sup>, CyclinE, and Thickveins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rorth, 1998</xref>). <italic>c587</italic>-GAL4 was used to achieve overexpression of UAS constructs of <italic>Dpp</italic> or <italic>Lsd1-RNAi</italic> in the somatic cells of the ovariole tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Song et al., 2004</xref>). For cyclinE overexpression, stocks were maintained at 25°C and female virgins were collected upon eclosion, shifted to 29°C for 4–5 days then subjected to immunostaining. For the Ras<sup>V12</sup> studies, female virgins were shifted to 29°C for 1 day and then shifted down to 25°C for 3 days prior to immunostaining. The Gal4-UAS system (adapted from yeast) often produces optimal expression at temperatures higher than 25°C. Since the UAS-Rasv12 and UAS-CyclinE constructs were not optimized for expression in the germline we applied these temperature shifts to produce more penetrant phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Irradiation assay</title><p>Well-fed flies were exposed to ionizing radiation using a Cs-137 Mark 1-68A irradiator (JL Shepherd &amp; Associates, San Ferando, CA, USA) at a dose of 4 krad unless otherwise noted. When irradiating several genotypes, each genotype was placed in an individual vial, and all vials were exposed to IR at the same time on a rotating turntable inside the irradiator. For visualizing reporter activation after IR, flies were dissected 24 hr post-IR to allow for stable GFP expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunostaining of fly tissue</title><p>3- to 5-days-old well-fed females were dissected in PBS and fixed in 4% EM-grade formaldehyde (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) diluted in PBS-0.1% tween-20, with three times the volume of heptane. After washing, tissues were blocked in 1.5% BSA, then incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. Antibodies used: rabbit α-GFP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA); rabbit α-pH2Av (kindly provided by K McKim with specific staining protocols), rabbit α-cleaved caspase 3 (Asp175) (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); mouse α-Armadillo, mouse α-BrdU (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), mouse α-HTS clone 1B1 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), and rat α-Vasa (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). For fluorescence visualization, Alexa-488, 568 (Invitrogen), and DyLight 649 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) secondary antibodies were used and 0.1 μg/ml of DAPI (Invitrogen) for DNA staining was added in the first wash step. After three washes, ovaries were further hand dissected and mounted in VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for microscopy imaging. For validating stimulus-dependent p53 action as visualized by the reporters, we routinely confirmed absence of GFP expression using flies null for Dp53. We note that p53R-GFPnls shows constitutive expression independent of p53 in a subset of gut cells and in the region of the testis containing elongated spermatids, reflecting position effects upon this transgene.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fertility tracking and proliferative arrest assay</title><p>In fertility assays, two <italic>p53</italic> null alleles, 238H (ns) and 5A-1-4 (k1) were used in trans-combination to reduce genetic background influences.

Each trial contained 2 to 15 replicates per genotype. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> percentages of fertile samples are plotted based on five trials. In the proliferative arrest assay, ovaries were dissected and immersed in Grace’s media containing BrdU (10 µM) for 1 hr at room temperature.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the three reviewers discussed their comments and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments that require your response before we can make a determination on the suitability of this work for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The referees feel that your findings are intriguing and potentially of sufficient interest for the broad audience of <italic>eLife</italic> because of the provocative finding that p53 may be activated exclusively in germline stem cells after myriad forms of stress. Yet, it was felt that your findings as described are somewhat preliminary and that further details on the roles of p53 in stem cells need to be provided. The reviewers also felt that the text has to be clarified in several instances. Please consider the following points: </p><p>1) The authors observe a phenotype of p53 mutants on recovery from sterility and re-entry into the cell cycle after irradiation. However, it's not clear if the delay in cell cycle re-entry (which is quite modest, especially after 72 hours after irradiation) causes the infertility. For example, at higher doses of irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>), wild type flies did not become sterile and p53 mutants showed a reduced fertility (but not complete infertility). Does this correlate with an accelerated re-entry into the cell cycle (when compared with lower doses of irradiation)? </p><p>2) The role of apoptosis in these phenotypes is also insufficiently explored. Staining with cleaved caspase 3 was performed but did not implicate apoptosis. And is it clear whether inhibition of apoptosis would produce any phenotype in these germaria? Further, what is measured is caspase 3 activation per germarium, which doesn't take into account the number of GSCs or CBs per germarium. C3 is a good marker for induction of apoptosis but doesn't indicate how many cells may have already died and been cleared. </p><p>3) What is the role of p53 in stem cell tumors? The authors show activation of p53 in different tumor models. But what is the phenotype of these tumors when they are also mutant for p53? Would these tumors grow even bigger? Also, in the different tumor models that they use, there seems to be a different pattern of p53 activation. With Ras overexpression they observe a pattern very similar to the one they see after irradiation. However, the rest of oncogenic stresses (<italic>bam</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup><italic>, nanos</italic>&gt;<italic>CyE, nanos</italic>&gt;<italic>TkvCA, c587</italic>&gt;DPP and <italic>c587</italic>&gt;<italic>Lsd1KD</italic>) show a totally different pattern, and in many cases it looks that p53 activation is not restricted to stem cells. In the case of <italic>bam</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> they show that there is an expansion of the stem cell population, and that cells that activate p53 also express the germline marker Vasa. Is that also the case for the rest of them? Or otherwise, what would be the explanation for the different pattern of p53 activation? </p><p>4) What is the evidence that the reporter transgene, which contains an enhancer from the known p53 target gene reaper fused to GFP, actually reports all activation of p53? That is, is this reaper enhancer activated in response to p53 activity in all cell types and under all conditions that p53 is “activated”? Without such knowledge, which is admittedly nontrivial to obtain, the main conclusion that “adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> exposed to genotoxic stress or genome destabilizers selectively activated p53 in GSCs and their immediate progeny” cannot be made. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3B'</xref> may actually address this point somewhat. These data show that the reporter can be activated in non-GSCs of the ovary when ATR is mutated (both follicle cells and nurse cells it appears, although a better image is needed to make this call). Is this activation p53 dependent? If so, then the restriction of reporter activity to GSCs in response to IR is ATR dependent, which would be somewhat counter intuitive since ATR normally activates p53. What is the activity of the reporter in ATR mutants in the absence of IR? In the absence of additional experiments, a more prudent or expansive interpretation of the current data seems warranted. </p><p>5) There are also problems with the presentation and description of the results. As some examples: – In vertebrates there is strong evidence for a role of p53 as a master regulation of stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Here it appears that they don't see a significant change of stem cell numbers in p53 mutants, but this is never clearly stated. </p><p>– Often an experimental result is given but only cursory information is given to assist the reader in interpreting that result. Some of this is because explanations that belong in the main text are only found in supplementary figure legends. </p><p>– Another example occurs with the introduction of the <italic>cuff</italic> and <italic>aub</italic> mutations, where the phenotype of these mutants in ovaries is not described other than to say they are involved in retrotransposon silencing. </p><p>– There are also inconsistencies in some of their results (i.e., biosensor activation outside of the germline) that are not addressed except for the suggestion they result from lack of penetrance or GFP perdurance, etc. How often are these deviations from their model observed? </p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01530.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors observe a phenotype of p53 mutants on recovery from sterility and re-entry into the cell cycle after irradiation.

The studies suggested here provided a way to extend our correlations between defective cell cycle and reduced fertility. Our revision includes the suggested Brdu labeling experiments on samples at informative time points challenged as in original Figure S3 (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>). Also, please note that the experiments in current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref> applied lower irradiation doses when compared to original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In retrospect, we realize that our presentation was confusing and the revised manuscript clarifies these issues.</p><p>At an IR dose of 4 krad (current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) we observe a modest delay in cell cycle re- entry but no effect on fertility. At an IR dose of 11.5 krad, WT flies transiently become infertile while p53-/- flies become permanently infertile (current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In our revised submission we performed Brdu labeling experiments at 4hrs, 2 days, and 7 days post-irradiation on an intermediate dose where WT flies remain fertile and p53<sup>-/-</sup> flies show decreased fertility (current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>). Here we observe that p53<sup>-/-</sup> flies have a persisting delay in cell cycle re-entry, even over 7 days. We have added this new data to the supplement (current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3 B, C</xref>) and have expanded on these observations in the results section.</p><p><italic>2) The role of apoptosis in these phenotypes is also insufficiently explored. Staining with cleaved caspase 3 was performed but did not implicate apoptosis. And is it clear whether inhibition of apoptosis would produce any phenotype in these germaria? Further, what is measured is caspase 3 activation per germarium, which doesn't take into account the number of GSCs or CBs per germarium. C3 is a good marker for induction of apoptosis but doesn't indicate how many cells may have already died and been cleared</italic>.</p><p>p53 genes often control damage-induced apoptotic responses and examining cell death in these germaria was strongly justified. We were surprised that no cell death role was indicated but we also note here that defective apoptosis does not appear to adequately explain tumor suppression by p53 in mice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Valente 2013</xref>, Martins 2006). In our experience, immunohistochemistry with the CC3 antibody is a reliable and robust marker for apoptotic cells. However, like all cell death markers, labeling is transient because the affected cells and their corpses ultimately disappear. For this reason – and to insure a comprehensive examination for possible apoptogenic defects – we completed a well- resolved time course at 2hr, 4hr, 8hr and 24hr post-irradiation (see current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>). Because we obtained a negative result from these exhaustive studies, we did not pursue this point further. Furthermore, tests could be conducted to ask whether inhibition of apoptosis produces a phenotype in the germarium as suggested – however, the results would not help us deconstruct p53 action in the context of stem cells, since a role for cell death was not indicated. Therefore, in our view, the results could be of interest in their own right but would not advance the story we are driving at here.</p><p><italic>3) What is the role of p53 in stem cell tumors? The authors show activation of p53 in different tumor models. But what is the phenotype of these tumors when they are also mutant for p53? Would these tumors grow even bigger</italic>?</p><p>Good questions. We carefully examined these tumors to address precisely these points and we included new experiments establishing that p53 does have a role. We did not observe consistent size differences but we did find characteristic affects on cytology and altered gene expression profiles governed by p53 status. These new findings are included in the revision (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Table 1–source data 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Also, in the different tumor models that they use, there seems to be a different pattern of p53 activation. With Ras overexpression they observe a pattern very similar to the one they see after irradiation. However, the rest of oncogenic stresses (bam</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup><italic>, nanos&gt;CyE, nanos&gt;TkvCA, c587&gt;DPP and c587&gt;Lsd1KD) show a totally different pattern, and in many cases it looks that p53 activation is not restricted to stem cells. In the case of bam</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> <italic>they show that there is an expansion of the stem cell population, and that cells that activate p53 also express the germline marker Vasa. Is that also the case for the rest of them? Or otherwise, what would be the explanation for the different pattern of p53 activation</italic>?</p><p>We find it remarkable that p53 reporter is consistently activated in fly tumor models. The dissimilarities in activation patterns seen here most likely trace to differences in the underlying histology and/or differentially deranged signaling in the hyperplasias themselves. In the revised submission we discuss these differences and consider possible explanations where appropriate. The dissimilarities could be related to signaling dynamics, response dynamics, cell cycle dynamics etc. Technical sources of variation linked to subtle differences in the action of the UAS-GAL4 driver system and/or non-uniform accumulation of the oncogenic product are also possible. Please note that none of these considerations detract from the compelling positive findings that we are documenting here. In each of the models tested here (original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) supernumerary and/or ectopic germline stem cells are already very well documented (Chen 2003; Elazier 2011; Xie 1998; Song 2004). Furthermore, we are confident that p53-activated cells are indeed supernumerary germline cells and, in many cases, a rounded fusome is visible in GFP+ cells. In response to this concern, we revised current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> so that it now includes higher magnification insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E-H</xref>. These images show that p53R-GFP+ cells also have a rounded fusome, which marks germline stem cells. We also substituted panel F in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> with an improved DAPI stained confocal image.</p><p><italic>4) What is the evidence that the reporter transgene, which contains an enhancer from the known p53 target gene reaper fused to GFP, actually reports all activation of p53? That is, is this reaper enhancer activated in response to p53 activity in all cell types and under all conditions that p53 is “activated”? Without such knowledge, which is admittedly nontrivial to obtain, the main conclusion that “adult Drosophila exposed to genotoxic stress or genome destabilizers selectively activated p53 in GSCs and their immediate progeny” cannot be made</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers suggest that our interpretation is unreasonable because our sensors might not be perfect. We strongly disagree with this argument. The comment cites limitations that are inherent to virtually all tools that are used in the cell sciences. In fact, the same concern can be raised for any reporter, any biosensor, any antibody, any phospho-specific antibodies, etc. While they may not reflect the entire scope of output from the p53 regulatory network, our reporters are advantageous because they are validated functional sensors for p53 action in vivo. Furthermore, it is not apparent how one might produce idealized sensors that are immune to this caveat. In the revised text (Discussion, paragraph 2), we explicitly consider this limitation.</p><p><italic>The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 3B'</italic></xref> <italic>may actually address this point somewhat. These data show that the reporter can be activated in non-GSCs of the ovary when ATR is mutated (both follicle cells and nurse cells it appears, although a better image is needed to make this call). Is this activation p53 dependent? If so, then the restriction of reporter activity to GSCs in response to IR is ATR dependent, which would be somewhat counter intuitive since ATR normally activates p53</italic>.</p><p>The relationship between ATR and the p53 network had not been previously examined in flies. Also, given that ATR is not universally required for p53 in mammalian systems (see Nghiem, 2002) the findings are not unexpected. The fact that we see ectopic activation is actually consistent with the probability that ATR exerts constitutive genome stabilizing activities. Where possible, the biosensors are routinely validated by testing them in the p53<sup>-</sup> background. However, we are unable to recover viable animals that are simultaneously homozygous for the biosensor, homozygous for ATR<sup>-</sup> and also homozygous for p53<sup>-</sup>. Ectopic induction of the biosensor here (and in other mutants) raises intriguing implications. But, for purposes of discussion here, the findings have strong merit because they also exclude trivial explanations for the restricted stem cell activity that we observe in the wild type context. For example, it was possible that p53 was simply confined to stem cells or was somehow inert in other cells. It was also possible, for technical reasons, that the biosensor was somehow unable function in somatic cells of the ovary. Our rationale for including these results was twofold: first, we felt it was important to demonstrate that p53 and the biosensor are normally present and ‘activatable’ throughout the ovary; second, we felt it was useful to include additional examples showing that stem cell selectivity is under genetic control.</p><p><italic>What is the activity of the reporter in ATR mutants in the absence of IR? In the absence of additional experiments, a more prudent or expansive interpretation of the current data seems warranted</italic>.</p><p>The revised manuscript adds a new graph (current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>) that quantifies reporter activity in GSCs and in follicle cells of ATR mutants. This information will enable readers to appreciate reporter status in the presence and absence of IR.</p><p><italic>5) There are also problems with the presentation and description of the results. As some examples</italic>:</p><p>We extensively revised the text to clarify our presentation and our interpretations as requested.</p><p><italic>– In vertebrates there is strong evidence for a role of p53 as a master regulation of stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Here it appears that they don't see a significant change of stem cell numbers in p53 mutants, but this is never clearly stated</italic>.</p><p>Good point. The revision adds a section in the results where this topic is explicitly discussed. Modestly altered stem cell pools in certain tissues of p53 mutant mice have been reported to be affected by age (Dumble, 2007). However, to our knowledge, stem cell pools in p53 mutant mice are not universally elevated (Reviewed in Solozobova and Blattner, 2011). Instead, it seems that the master regulation concept mostly derives the effects of p53 upon iPS cell production (Krizhanovsky, 2009) and there are alternative interpretations for the this effect (e.g., prevention of apoptosis).</p><p><italic>– Often an experimental result is given but only cursory information is given to assist the reader in interpreting that result. Some of this is because explanations that belong in the main text are only found in supplementary figure legends</italic>.</p><p>In retrospect, we agree. This is a valid criticism. The revised manuscript comprehensively addresses this through improved transitions and additional background information where needed. For example, we divided the ovary and testis data in original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> into two figures (current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref>). We also moved the description of the p53 biosensors from the supplement to current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>– Another example occurs with the introduction of the cuff and aub mutations, where the phenotype of these mutants in ovaries is not described other than to say they are involved in retrotransposon silencing</italic>.</p><p>The revised manuscript includes additional background and context on these mutants.</p><p><italic>– There are also inconsistencies in some of their results (i.e., biosensor activation outside of the germline) that are not addressed except for the suggestion they result from lack of penetrance or GFP perdurance, etc. How often are these deviations from their model observed</italic>?</p><p>To address this concern, we have improved our presentation of these issues. We emphasize that our ‘licensing’ model refers to the stimulus-dependent action of p53 in a wild type setting. When wild type ovaries are radiation challenged, functional p53 activation is seen only in the stem cell and their immediate progeny – under these conditions, the p53 biosensor is never observed outside of the germ stem cell compartment. This could reflect independent activation in stem cells and their immediate progeny or, alternatively, the GFP signal in cystoblasts could reflect perdurance of GFP from parental stem cells (we favor this for reasons discussed in the text). However, in the ovaries of mutants that affect genome stability, we do observe reporter activation outside of the germline and this observation provides us with important insights. In these cases, we propose that the corresponding genes normally function in ways that ultimately restrict widespread activation. In mutants that produce oncogenic stress, p53 is more broadly activated but the ectopic activation here still occurs within germline cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
