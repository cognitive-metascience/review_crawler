pathogenesis. The protozoan parasite <italic>Entamoeba</italic> switches between invasive trophozoites and dormant cysts, but the encystation process remains poorly understood despite being central to amoebic biology. We identify a transcription factor, Encystation Regulatory Motif-Binding Protein (ERM-BP), that regulates encystation. Down-regulation of ERM-BP decreases encystation efficiency resulting in abnormal cysts with defective cyst walls. We demonstrate that direct binding of NAD<sup>+</sup> to ERM-BP affects ERM-BP conformation and facilitates its binding to promoter DNA. Additionally, cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels increase during encystation and exogenous NAD<sup>+</sup> enhances encystation consistent with the role of carbon source depletion in triggering <italic>Entamoeba</italic> encystation. Furthermore, ERM-BP catalyzes conversion of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, which might have second messenger effects on stage conversion. Our findings link the metabolic cofactors nicotinamide and NAD<sup>+</sup> to transcriptional regulation via ERM-BP and provide the first mechanistic insights into <italic>Entamoeba</italic> encystation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>developmental control</kwd><kwd>Entamoeba histolytica</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>nicotinamide</kwd><kwd>parasite</kwd><kwd>encystation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI119893</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Upinder</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI117171</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Upinder</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cellular NAD+ levels change during stage conversion and regulate function of a novel transcription factor that controls developmental switching in the human pathogen <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Modulation of gene expression plays a crucial role during stage conversion in all organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gomez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kramer, 2012</xref>). Developmentally regulated genes can be controlled by multiple pathways including transcriptional control, post-transcriptional modification, and RNA transport, stability, or translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Day and Tuite, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>). Although transcriptional regulatory networks have been extensively studied in model organisms, our understanding of transcriptional regulation in protozoan parasites is relatively limited.

Infection with <italic>Entamoeba</italic> starts with the ingestion of mature cysts with contaminated food or water; trophozoites are released from the cysts in the small intestine and migrate to the colon where they proliferate. Trophozoites invade the colonic epithelium resulting in the clinical syndrome of dysentery or amoebic colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lozano et al., 2012</xref>). Due to unknown stimuli, some trophozoites in the colon are triggered to initiate stage conversion and transform to cysts. The cysts are passed in feces, are resistant to environmental extremes, and are able to transmit disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones and Newton, 1950</xref>). Thus, stage conversion is crucial to parasite biology and is necessary for both pathogen transmission and disease pathogenesis.</p><p>Developmental studies in <italic>Entamoeba</italic> are performed in <italic>Entamoeba invadens</italic>, a reptilian parasite in which encystation can be induced by transfer to nutrient-deficient media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thepsuparungsikul et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rengpien and Bailey, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vázquezdelara-Cisneros and Arroyo-Begovich, 1984</xref>). Previously, Coppi et al demonstrated several lines of evidence that an autocrine catecholamine system is involved in <italic>Entamoeba</italic> encystation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coppi et al., 2002</xref>). Mi-ichi et al reported that cholesteryl sulfate plays an important role in <italic>Entamoeba</italic> encystation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mi-ichi et al., 2015</xref>). While this system has been vital to increasing our understanding of amebic biology, the key regulators that control stage conversion are still not well understood. Recent RNA-Seq and microarray data from <italic>E. invadens</italic> during encystation offers an opportunity to identify the molecular triggers involved in regulating stage conversion in <italic>Entamoeba</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Cádiz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ehrenkaufer et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we utilized this RNA-Seq data and bioinformatics approaches to identify a transcription factor that binds to CAACAAA motif in gene promoter﻿ and regulates <italic>Entamoeba</italic> stage conversion. The <italic>E</italic>ncystation <italic>R</italic>egulatory <italic>M</italic>otif-<italic>B</italic>inding <italic>P</italic>rotein (ERM-BP) has a nicotinamidase domain; we identified that NAD<sup>+</sup> levels increase during encystation and mediate ERM-BP binding to DNA, and that increased NAD<sup>+</sup> augments encystation efficiency. This work provides the first molecular link between a metabolic coenzyme NAD<sup>+</sup> and regulation of stage conversion in a parasitic protozoan and represents a substantial advancement in a key area of parasite biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of consensus promoter motifs in cyst-specific genes</title><p>In order to define the transcriptional network associated with stage conversion, we utilized RNA-Seq data of different developmental stages of <italic>E. invadens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ehrenkaufer et al., 2013</xref>).

Mut-2 was able to out-compete the labeled ERM-WT probe at 10 and 100-fold excess of cold competitor (10 and 100X) in EMSA assay. In this particular gel, Mut-2 acts as a better competitor at 10-fold excess compared to ERM-WT, but was similar to WT competitor at 100X excess. Importantly, we have noted in multiple other gel shift assays that Mut-2 acts similar to WT-motif as a competitor (data not shown). In contrast, Mut-1 and Mut-3 showed no ability to compete at 10 and 100X, suggesting that changing the C at position four and A at position five in ERM are crucial for binding to cyst nuclear protein. We also observed that the ERM-core 7-nucleotide motif (without linker) was not able to compete, suggesting that this short motif is not efficient at binding to nuclear protein, and flanking sequences are required for physical interaction as seen in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hackney et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To find out whether the ERM motif is functional in the context of a full-length promoter, we used a luciferase reporter construct driven by a cyst-specific promoter that contains the WT-ERM. We have previously demonstrated that this construct increases expression during encystation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manna et al., 2014</xref>). A Mut-3-ERM-Luciferase construct was generated by changing CA to TG at fourth and fifth positions. Stable cell lines were generated by transforming luciferase reporter constructs into <italic>Entamoeba</italic>, and luciferase assays were performed in trophozoites and cysts. We see some basal level of luciferase readings in trophozoites for both WT and Mut-3-ERM. However, mutation of the ERM in this promoter significantly decreased cyst-specific luciferase expression, suggesting that the cyst-specific activity of the full-length promoter is regulated through ERM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Identification of ERM-binding protein</title><p>To identify the ERM-binding protein(s), EMSA shifted bands were excised and analyzed by LC-MS as described in the Materials and methods. The protein content of the positive shifted band (ERM-WT with cyst extract) was compared with the same gel mobilities in negative controls (ERM-core with cyst extract and ERM-WT with trophozoite extract).

To further investigate whether there was any defect in cyst wall formation, we stained mature (72 hr) cysts with anti-Jacob antibodies. Disintegrated or uneven localization of Jacob was observed in cysts from ERM-BP silenced parasites, suggesting that there is indeed a defect in the cell wall formation when ERM-BP is silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Quantitative analysis was done by staining the cyst wall using two markers: one with the calcofluor that stains the chitin in the cyst wall and a second with antibody against cyst wall protein Jacob. Using these two markers, we assessed the number of morphologically normal and defective cysts in the control and ERM-BP downregulated cell lines.

This suggests that trophozoites which are starting to encyst but getting arrested in development have reduced viability. Next, we investigated the excystation of the ERM-BP silenced cells to see whether the cysts formed under ERM-BP silenced conditions can still excyst into functional trophozoites. We encysted ERM-BP silenced and control cells for 72 hr, treated overnight with water to lyse remaining trophozoites, inoculated equivalent numbers of cysts in excystation medium, and counted the number of trophozoites after 48 hr. Cysts from silenced ERM-BP parasites produced 3 – 4 fold fewer trophozoites compared to control cell lines, indicating that the defective cysts from ERM-BP silenced lines also fail to excyst normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

RT-PCR showed reduced expression of all three target genes only in cysts in which ERM-BP had been silenced. However, in control cysts these target genes showed differential but comparatively higher expression compared to the silenced ERM-BP cell line.

However, the change in NADH level was not measured. Our current observations do not match the previous report and for this there are multiple possible explanations. First, Jeelani et al., used 75% chilled methanol to quench the metabolic activity. This also fixes the cells and NAD<sup>+</sup> may leach out during this fixation. Thus, in the later steps when the metabolites are extracted with chloroform and water by sonication to lyse cysts, the results may not accurately measure the NAD<sup>+</sup> levels. Second, NAD<sup>+</sup> is very unstable and can be easily reduced to NADH and this may lead to an apparent artificial reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup>. Despite the differences between our results and Jeelani et al., our results are highly internally consistent, using two assay methods, measuring both NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH and measuring NAD<sup>+</sup> in mature (sarkosyl resistant) cysts.</p><p>Intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH levels control the activity of transcription factors in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rutter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ravcheev et al., 2012</xref>) and we hypothesized that the elevated NAD<sup>+</sup> level may have a role in regulating encystation. To explore whether extracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> has any role in encystation, we added 1 mM extracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> to the encysting parasites and found a significant enhancement of encystation. Addition of extracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> increased the cyst number more than two-fold compared to untreated parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We demonstrated that exogenously applied NAD<sup>+</sup> can be taken into <italic>Entamoeba</italic> cells by measuring the intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> concentration in parasites after exposure to exogenous NAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Our results show a gradual increase of intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> in <italic>Entamoeba</italic> cells treated with 1 mM of NAD<sup>+</sup> up to 8 hr; however, despite the large amount of extracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> concentration the intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> remained in nmole range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Of note, NAD<sup>+</sup> in millimolar concentration is often used in experiments to determine the effect of exogenous NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Billington et al., 2008</xref>) and in some systems endogenous intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> can be in millimolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ying et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, we observed an additive role of NAD<sup>+</sup> and overexpression of ERM-BP in encystation. The addition of NAD<sup>+</sup> to ERM-BP overexpressed cells further enhanced encystation efficiency. However, silenced ERM-BP parasites did not show any enhancement in encystation by the addition of NAD<sup>+</sup>, suggesting that the effect of NAD<sup>+</sup> in influencing encystation efficiency is via ERM-BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Domain characterization, NAD<sup>+</sup>/DNA binding and catalytic activity of ERM-BP</title><p>We performed gel shift assays using recombinant ERM-BP in presence of variable amounts of NAD<sup>+</sup> to investigate its role in DNA binding.

The data demonstrate that binding to DNA and NAD<sup>+</sup> are linked; mutations that decrease NAD<sup>+</sup> binding also decrease DNA binding (C198A). However, DNA binding and enzymatic conversion of nicotinamide can be separated, as shown by the activities of the D12A and K150A mutants. Mutants that abolish DNA binding have no effect on the catalytic activity (ERM-BP-DBM), whereas catalytically deficient mutants retain DNA-binding properties (D12A and K150A). The C198A mutation has the greatest effect on ERM-BP function and abolishes both NAD<sup>+</sup> and DNA binding and nicotinamide turnover. Taken together the data suggest a model for the role of ERM-BP in encystation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). NAD<sup>+</sup>-binding changes the conformation of ERM-BP and facilitates ERM-BP binding to DNA. This binding of ERM-BP to the promoters of cyst-specific genes directly increases expression of genes in the developmental cascade.

Nicotinic acid may function as a second messenger or be converted into NAD<sup>+</sup> by a salvage pathway to mediate stage conversion.

The catalytic role of ERM-BP on nicotinamide to produce nicotinic acid may also have important roles in encystation. The function of ERM-BP is modulated by changes in intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, thus linking cellular energetics to a molecular mechanism controlling parasite development.

Another possibility is that nicotinic acid may be converted back to NAD<sup>+</sup> via a salvage pathway and can then bind to ERM-BP and regulate encystation.

In multicellular eukaryotes, the redox state of NAD<sup>+</sup> modulates the activities of NPAS2: BMAL1 transcription factors and also controls the circadian clock-associated gene expression in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rutter et al., 2001</xref>).

NAD<sup>+</sup> is also a putative metabolic regulator of transcription, longevity and several age-associated diseases, including diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia-Soriano et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenamyre et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin and Guarente, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>).

During encystation, the levels of a majority of metabolites involved in glycolysis markedly decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeelani and Nozaki, 2014</xref>). Pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, and acetyl-CoA is either converted to acetate with a concomitant ATP generation or reduced to ethanol with regeneration of NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeelani and Nozaki, 2014</xref>). Our results show not only the augmentation of NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, but also that NADH levels decrease during encystation. Thus, there is an overall enrichment of the intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio during <italic>Entamoeba</italic> encystation. Given these links between the changing energy state of the parasite and stage conversion, it is reasonable to hypothesize that changing levels of metabolic cofactors could be important in triggering encystation.</p><p>The enrichment of intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH during <italic>Entamoeba</italic> encystation and enhancement of ERM-BP binding to the CAACAAA motif by NAD<sup>+ </sup>in vitro support the notion that NAD<sup>+</sup> regulates ERM-BP function. In addition, our data demonstrate that NAD<sup>+</sup> plays a crucial role by binding to ERM-BP, changing its confirmation and facilitating ERM-BP binding to the promoter motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Mutational analysis of the ERM-BP reveals that NAD<sup>+</sup> binding and DNA binding are linked (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Taken with the finding that NAD<sup>+</sup> binding changes protein thermal stability, it implies that NAD<sup>+</sup> binding induces a conformational change in ERM-BP, which then allows ERM-BP to bind to DNA.</p><p>A second, apparently distinct, function of ERM-BP is the enzymatic catalysis and nicotinamidase activity that generates nicotinic acid from nicotinamide, which may be acting as a second messenger. Nicotinic acid has been reported to control the expression of several genes including virulence factors in bacterial system, and serine threonine kinase in insulin-sensitive animal tissues and plays an important role in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Edwards et al., 2013</xref>). Our results suggest this catalytic activity is independent of DNA binding as demonstrated by the D12A, K120A, and ERM-BP-DBM mutants. The C198A mutation in the nicotinamidase domain is the only mutation that abolishes both DNA binding and nicotinamide catalysis. Which of these two functions of ERM-BP is more important for regulating encystation-specific gene expression is not clear at present, but future analysis with the specific mutant proteins will allow further dissection of this observation.</p><p>ERM-BP specifically binds to a consensus promoter motif ‘CAACAAA’ and regulates the expression of a set of cyst-specific genes.

Data were validated and visualized using Byonic software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>To overexpress the protein in <italic>Entamoeba</italic> the full-length coding region of ERM-BP gene (EIN_083100) was cloned into the AvrII and SacII sites in the pEi-CKII-myc plasmid as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ehrenkaufer and Singh, 2012</xref>). For gene silencing, the 152-trigger construct was used; full-length coding region of the EIN_083100 gene was cloned downstream of the Trigger region at the NotI and AvrII sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Suresh et al., 2016</xref>). Six candidate genes from the LC-MS were cloned in pGEX-4T1 vector at BamHI and NotI sites. The gene IDs and primers used are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>. Mutants of ERM-BP were generated by site-directed mutagenesis utilizing ERM-BP-pGEX-2T1 as a parent vector. The following substitutions were made at the selected sites by changing to Alanine (A) as D12A, C198A and K150A by using QuickChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Catalog # 210518) and following the manufacturer protocol. An ERM-BP-DBM was generated by changing all five predicted amino acids shown in superscript (S<sub>A</sub>R<sub>L</sub>TKR) into alanine using the Gibson assembly method. Briefly, two PCR reactions were performed by splitting the gene ERM-BP into two fragments, ‘A’ and ‘B’; both share the changed nucleotides for the five amino acids. Fragment-A has 44-nt matching with the adjacent Fragment-B and 5’ ends of ‘A’ and 3’ ends of ‘B’ share 30-nt overlap sequences with the two ends of liner vector pGEX-2T1 (Fragment C). All three fragments (A, B and C) were assembled by using Gibson assembly master mix (New England Biolab, Catalog# E2611S) as manufacturer protocol and transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic>. The construct was confirmed by sequencing and primers are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RNA extraction and RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from trophozoites and cysts using TRIzol method (Life Technologies). RNA was subjected to DNase treatment (DNase kit; Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed using oligo (dT) primers (Invitrogen). The resultant cDNA (3 μl) was used in subsequent PCRs (25 μl total volume). The number of PCR cycles was set to 30, and 10 μl of PCR products was run on a 1.5% agarose gel. The negative control (minus reverse transcriptase [RT]) was split away before the addition of Superscript RT (Invitrogen) and otherwise treated like the other samples. The primers used in RT-PCR are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Expression and purification of recombinant proteins</title><p>GST-fusion proteins were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (BL21) and purified by using glutathione beads (GE-healthcare). Briefly, cells were cultured in 100 ml culture media and induced with IPTG (0.5 mM) for 4 hr at 37°C and cells were pelleted. Suspended in 6 ml GST binding buffer [25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)] and lysed by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 mins at 4°C and the supernatant incubated with 50 μl pre-equilibrated GST-beads. The beads were washed with high-salt solution [500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH7.5), 100 mM PMSF]. Both GST and GST fusion proteins bound to beads were eluted with 500 μl elution buffer [10 mM reduced glutathione, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM PMSF, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)]. Protein was dialyzed over night at 4°C in dialysis buffer [5 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol] with two changes to remove Glutathione. The protein was quantified and checked by SDS-PAGE and used in all biochemical experiments as mentioned.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunostaining</title><p>Myc-tagged ERM-BP expressing trophozoites and cysts were fixed with acetone: methanol (1:1) and permeabilized with 0.1% triton-X100. Cells were incubated with 3% BSA for blocking followed by α-myc antibody from mouse (1:1000) (Cell Signaling) and Alexa 488 α-mouse (1:2500) (Molecular Probes). Localization of the cyst wall Jacob-lectin was carried out by hybridization with the Jacob antibody (at 1:200, a kind gift of John Samuelson), followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2500; Molecular Probes). Slides were prepared using Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc) and visualized using a Leica CTR6000 microscope, using a BD CARVII confocal unit. Images were analyzed using Leica LAS-AF software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Measurement of intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH</title><p>Intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH were determined as per the manufacturer's protocol (NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH Assay Kit, Cat No: ab65348, Abcam). Briefly 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were lysed in 400 μl of NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH extraction buffer by sonication (five pulses at 15 amp for 15 s). The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm and the supernatant containing NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH was filtered through a 10kD spin column to get rid of enzymes, which may consume NADH rapidly. To detect the NADH in the sample a decomposition step was performed by heating the samples at 60°C for 30 min; under this condition, all the NAD<sup>+</sup> will be decomposed while NADH will be still intact. 100 μl of reaction mix was prepared for each standard and samples in duplicates in a clear bottom 96-well plate. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 5 min to convert NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH followed by addition of 10 μl NADH developer into each well and incubated at room temperature for 2 hr. OD was measured at 450 nm using a plate reader (BioTek Cytation3). Concentration of NAD<sup>+</sup>t and NADH in the test samples is calculated from standard curve and actual concentration was determined as: NAD<sup>+</sup>t concentration = (NAD<sup>+</sup>t/<italic>Sv</italic>)*D; NADH concentration = (NADH/<italic>sv</italic>)*D; NAD<sup>+</sup> = NAD<sup>+</sup>t - NADH; NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio = (NAD<sup>+</sup>t-NADH)/NADH. Where: NAD<sup>+</sup>t = total amount of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the sample well calculated from standard curve (pmol); NADH = amount of NADH in the sample well calculated from standard curve (pmol); Sv = sample vol added to the reaction well (μl); D = sample dilution factor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Enzymatic assay</title><p>Enzymatic assay using ERM-BP was performed as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Briefly, the reaction was performed in 30 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). For each reaction 160 μg recombinant protein and 20 mM nicotinamide was used as substrate, incubated at 37°C for 1 hr and reaction terminated by adding 20 μl of trichloroacetic acid (80%, v/v). The protein was precipitated by centrifugation at 13,000 RPM for 10 min followed by filtration of the pellet. Samples were diluted 1:25 in 50% acetonitrile/water and 25 μl were injected into an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) and separated on a Luna 3 μm C18(2) 100 Å column with a 5 – 95% gradient of acetonitrile in water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 7.5 min at a flow rate of 200 μl/min and peaks detected by UV light at 254 nm. Area under the curve values for the nicotinamide peaks were calculated for each condition using Analyst software (SCIEX) and normalized by dividing obtained values by those obtained under negative control conditions (GST). Percentage substrate conversion values were calculated by subtracting normalized AUC values from 1. Any obtained negative % conversion values resulting from baseline substrate AUC variability are shown as ‘no conversion’. For initial confirmation of substrate and product peaks LC-analysis was coupled to MS-analysis on an API 150EX single-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) with an electrospray interface.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Protein thermal stability shift assay</title><p>Protein thermal stability shift assay was performed as per the manufacturer’s protocols (Protein thermal Shift starter kit, Cat no: 4462263, Applied Biosystems). In brief, all the reactions were set up in final volumes of 20 μl in 96-well plates. In each well, 1 μg of purified recombinant protein was added with 5 μl of thermal stability buffer and 2.5 μl of 8X dye with varying amounts of NAD<sup>+</sup> (0, 1, 2 and 4 mM). For each set, samples were made in quadruple and at least three biologically independent experiments were conducted. Temperature gradient was set in the range of 25°C to 99°C with a 0.05°C/s ramp rate using real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Melting temperature (Tm) was calculated by using Protein Thermal Shift Software 1x (Applied Biosystems).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to Chris Adams and Ryan Leib, Stanford University Mass Spectrometry facility for their help with Mass spectrometry.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Christine Clayton (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The first part is the summary from the reviewers; the remainder consists of detailed comments.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Encystation is a cellular differentiation process from the proliferative, motile, and disease-causing stage to the dormant stage. Despite the importance of the process, the molecular events that occur during encystation have not been fully elucidated at the molecular levels. Previously Coppi et al., (2002) demonstrated several lines of evidence that an autocrine catecholamine system is involved in Entamoeba encystation. Mi-ichi et al., (2015) reported that cholesteryl sulfate plays an important role in Entamoeba encystation. In this study Manna et al. utilized RNA-Seq data to identify the molecular triggers involved in regulating stage conversion in Entamoeba. They identify a transcription factor, Encystation Regulatory Motif-Binding Protein (ERM-BP), that regulates encystation. This is an important observation with respect to parasite biology. In general, the work is experimentally solid and clearly presented.</p><p>The authors report the identification of Encystation Regulatory Motif-Binding Protein as a transcription factor that regulates encystation, the transition of trophozoites of Entameba histolytica to the dormant cyst form. This developmental transition is key to the life cycle and transmission of ameba as trophozoites are pathogenic but cysts are transmitted. Very little is known about the regulators of developmental transitions in pathogenic protozoa and nearly nothing is known about this transition in this important parasite that causes amebiasis.</p><p>The authors use a combination of complementary techniques to identify ERM-BP. They identified 9 motifs enriched upstream of induced transcripts and tested these in EMSA. Of these only one showed specific binding to nuclear extracts as demonstrated in a series of carefully controlled experiments. The motif was validated in reporter assays and then used to identify the binding protein by MS. The importance of the TF was tested using gene silencing and confirmed lower cyst numbers and cysts that were less robust. They go on to show that the binding of NAD+ to ERM-BP alters the conformation and facilitates binding to promoter DNA. Then they follow up with ERM-BP mutant studies that map DNA binding and nicotinomidase activity.</p><p>To link the biochemical properties of ERM-BP to the biology of the parasite, they show that cellular NAD+ increases during encystation and that exogenous NAD+ promotes encystation. Finally, ERM-BP catalyzes nicotinamide to nicotinic acid implicating these metabolites in potential signaling during stage differentiation. Altogether this paper does a nice job providing mechanistic insights into Entameba encystation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Annotated PDF review of paper is attached. The comments mostly suggest minor modifications.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors reported that they chose early data (24hours) during encystation but according to previous publication by other groups the early period of encystation is 0.5 to 8hours when the trophozoites form large multicellular aggregates.

What is the reason behind choosing the 24hours time point if early time points are available?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that this is an important point to clarify. The reason behind choosing the 24hours time points was to avoid the general stress response (i.e. osmotic stress) that may be a confounding factor in the earlier time points (i.e. 2hours and 8hours). So, as a first attempt at proving that our approach (identifying transcriptional networks based on motif and protein identification) could work we picked the first time point at which morphologically distinct cysts are seen in substantial number. In this way, we hoped to enrich the transcriptional control mechanisms for those that regulate cyst formation (rather than general stress response). We did not analyze later time points (i.e. 48hours or 72hours) as lysing these cysts is more difficult and can hamper nuclear extract generation. However, now that our approach and workflow has been validated, earlier or later time points can certainly be explored in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Identification of ERM-binding protein” &quot;EIN_083100 is a hypothetical.………..during encystation&quot; The authors cited two references De Cadiz et al., 2013 and Ehrenkaufer et al., 2013.

We have indicated the previous EIN nomenclature when we first mention the gene in our manuscript (subsection “Identification of ERM-binding protein”). The RNA expression levels are listed in the supplementary tables in of De Cadiz et al., 2013 and Ehrenkaufer et al., 2013. In the Ehrenkaufer manuscript, this gene was largely regulated at later time point of encystation (i.e. 72hours). However, our RT-PCR results show that EIN_083100 RNA expression is undetectable in trophozoites and up-regulated as early as 24hours of encystation (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). Whether this difference is due to technical differences in RNA-Seq versus RT-PCR or changes in parasites that have occurred over several years is not clear. However, the overall point is that this gene is developmentally regulated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding Figure 3C and Figure 4A instead of showing relative percentage of encystation the authors should show actual percentage of encystation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this concern. In our manuscript, the encystation efficiency was determined by automated quantitative imaging in 96-well plates as described in earlier studies (Ehrenkaufer et al., 2018; Suresh et al., 2016). In this approach, encystation efficiency or cysts percentage compared to total cell count (i.e. those that remained as trophozoites) cannot be calculated. However, we do have the data for the actual number of cysts for each experiment and have changed the figures to show the actual cyst numbers. These changes have been made in Figure 3C, Figure 4A and Figure 5C. In the revised figures the actual number of cysts are presented from three biological experiments with eight replicates for each biological experiment (subsection “Parasite culture, transfection and induction of stage conversion”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors completely silenced ERM-BP (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) and reported that loss of ERM-BP significantly decreased the encystation efficiency.

We also point out that the ERM-BP is likely not the only gene that regulates encystation and so some level of cyst formation can still happen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors further reported that the defect is in cyst wall formation. Do all the cysts contain the defective cyst wall?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment. In order to get quantitative data on the percentage of cysts with defective cyst wall, we did quantitative analysis by staining the cyst wall using two markers: one with the calcofluor white that stains the chitin in the cyst wall and a second with an antibody to the cyst wall protein, Jacob. Using these two markers, we assessed the number of morphologically normal and defective cysts in the control and ERM-BP downregulated cell lines. The data are shown in Figure 4D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors reported that silencing of ERM-BP decreased parasite viability in encystation media however they also reported that it also decreased the encystation efficiency. In my opinion the decreased in encystation efficiency is due to growth defect caused by silencing of ERM-BP.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to clarify this issue. Parasites with ERM-BP silenced have no obvious growth defects under trophozoite conditions. This suggests that trophozoites, which are starting to encyst but getting arrested in development have reduced viability. This point has been clarified in the text (subsection “Silencing of ERM-BP expression levels reduces encystation efficiency and produces ghost like cysts”). We also show that the cysts produced in ERM-BP downregulated parasites are defective in excystation. Thus, overall, the downregulation of ERM-BP results in fewer cysts and even the cysts that are produced are largely defective in viability and ability to excyst.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Intracellular NAD+/NADH is elevated during encystation and NAD+ facilitates Encystation”: The cited Ref.

We have included the original ref. Jeelani et al., 2012 in revised manuscript. In this paper Jeelani et al., reported slight increase of NAD<sup>+</sup> from 0 to 2hours and in latter time points of encystation the NAD<sup>+</sup> level decreased gradually. It is true that our findings do not match those of the previous publication, but there are some clarifications that need to be made:</p><p>(i) Importantly, we used two different assay methods: NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH assay kit (Abcam, Cat no: ab65348) and NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH-Glo assay (Promega, Cat no: G9071).

This also fixes cells and NAD<sup>+</sup> may leach out during this fixation. Thus, in the latter step when the metabolites are extracted with chloroform and water by sonication to lyse the cyst, the results may not accurately measure NAD<sup>+</sup> levels.</p><p>b) Second, Jeelani et al., 2012 didn’t mentioned the concentration of NADH. NAD<sup>+</sup> is very unstable and can be easily reduced to NADH and this may lead to an apparent artificial reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 5A, the authors mentioned NAD/NADH ratio.

Additionally, we have measured the concentration of intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> in <italic>Entamoeba</italic> cells treated with 1 mM NAD<sup>+</sup>.

We agree that we have not done the definitive experiments to demonstrate that nicotinic acid has an important role in enystation, and have thus indicated with a ? in the model. This and many other follow-up experiments are undoubtedly needed and will form the basis of the next manuscript.

Are there specific pathways upregulated?</p><p>Yes, this is an important point to clarify. The genes that contain ERM in their promoters are listed as Figure 1—source data 3 with annotation and molecular weight. We have identified 131 genes having ERM motif in their promoter. Out of 131 genes 65 (~50%) are annotated as hypothetical. Of the remainder, some genes are annotated as cyst wall proteins (EIN_066080: Chitin binding lectin, EIN_284810: Chitin synthase), and we do see a reduction in RNA level by RT-PCR (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). Additionally, a few genes are associated with metabolism and stress response (Figure 1—Source data 3). However, considering 50% as hypothetical genes it is difficult to speculate whether any specific pathways upregulated. Future studies with RNA-Seq of ERM-BP downregulated parasites will give us a better idea about the transcriptional network associated with the ERM-BP transcription factor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What can they tell us about proteins ID in mass spec?

However, it is important to note that the mass-spectrometry was performed from the gel-shifted band with the idea that this was a starting point to identify candidate proteins. The criteria we used are relatively standard, however, the point is less about the stringency of our initial mass spec analysis but that this allowed us to identify proteins that could potentially bind to ERM-BP. Only six proteins consistently showed up in all three biological experiments and were considered candidate proteins for binding to ERM (Table 1). Subsequently, we have done extensive experiments to prove that EIN_083100, does in fact bind ERM and has important biological effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1.

We agree with the reviewer that Mut-2 looks as a better competitor at 10X excess probe in this particular gel. However, it is important to note that at 100X excess probe it doesn’t show much difference compared to WT competitor. Importantly, we have noted in multiple other gel shift assays that Mut-2 acts similar to WT-motif as a competitor (data not shown). Thus, the apparent difference in this gel may be due to unequal loading of nuclear extract or probe. This point has been clarified in the manuscript (subsection “Motif-2 specifically binds to cyst nuclear protein(s)”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
