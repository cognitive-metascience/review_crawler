It is still unknown how follicles become competent for follicle rupture/ovulation. Here, we identify a zinc-finger transcription factor Hindsight (Hnt) as the first transcription factor regulating follicle’s competency for ovulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Hnt is not expressed in immature stage-13 follicle cells but is upregulated in mature stage-14 follicle cells, which is essential for follicle rupture/ovulation. Hnt upregulates Mmp2 expression in posterior follicle cells (essential for the breakdown of the follicle wall) and Oamb expression in all follicle cells (the receptor for receiving adrenergic signaling and inducing Mmp2 activation). Hnt’s role in regulating Mmp2 and Oamb can be replaced by its human homolog Ras-responsive element-binding protein 1 (RREB-1). Our data suggest that Hnt/RREB-1 plays conserved role in regulating follicle maturation and competency for ovulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29887.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The release of an egg from the ovary of a female animal is a process known as ovulation. Animals as different as humans and fruit flies ovulate in largely similar ways. Yet the systems involved in controlling ovulation are still not well understood. An egg cell develops within a collection of cells that help the egg to form properly. Together, this unit is called a follicle. During ovulation, connections between the egg and the rest of the follicle break down and the egg is eventually ejected.</p><p>Ovulation happens in response to a hormone signal from the brain. In humans, this hormone is called luteinizing hormone, whereas in flies it is called octopamine. Specialized protein molecules on the surface of the follicle cells receive these hormone signals, but can only cause ovulation in mature follicles. It was not clear what allows only mature follicles to ovulate.</p><p>Deady et al. have now used the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to examine ovulation to identify how the process is controlled. The results showed that a protein called Hindsight primes follicle cells for ovulation. When a follicle reaches its final stage (called stage 14 in flies), the gene for Hindsight becomes active and produces the protein. This protein then activates other genes. One of the activated genes makes a protein that receives the hormone signal, while another makes a protein that breaks down follicle cells and allows the egg to be released.</p><p>The findings of Deady et al. reveal that Hindsight is needed for ovulation in flies. Further experiments then showed that the gene for equivalent human protein can be transplanted into flies and can still prime follicles for ovulation. This indicates that the genes in humans and flies may perform the same tasks. Studying ovulation is an important part of understanding female fertility and could help scientists to understand more about human reproduction. These results may also lead to new contraceptives and improved approaches for treating infertility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>follicle maturation</kwd><kwd>ovulation</kwd><kwd>Hindsight</kwd><kwd>RREB-1</kwd><kwd>Mmp2</kwd><kwd>Oamb</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HD086175</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jianjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1160858</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jianjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007710</institution-id><institution>University of Connecticut</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Startup</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jianjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hindsight/RREB-1 plays a conserved role in follicle maturation and ovulation by sequential upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase and adrenergic receptor in follicle cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ovulation is a complex process of releasing fertilizable oocytes from mature follicles and is essential for animal reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Espey and Richards, 2006</xref>). To ensure successful ovulation, a follicle must be developed to full maturity to be competent to receive an ovulatory stimulus and to activate proteolytic systems for follicle rupture. Several proteolytic systems have been found to regulate follicle rupture in vertebrates, including matrix metalloproteinase (Mmp), plasminogen activator/plasmin, and ADAMS-TS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Curry and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takahashi et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) serves as a master regulator to initiate the ovulation event and activates the EGF/EGFR-Ras-MAPK signaling pathway to propagate the ovulatory signal from outer granulosa cells to inner cumulus cells in the preovulatory follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Conti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsieh et al., 2007</xref>). However, molecular mechanisms coupling the Ras-MAPK pathway to the activation of proteolytic systems for follicle rupture are largely unknown.</p><p>Ovulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> utilizes conserved molecular mechanisms and involves a follicle rupture process to release mature oocytes from the ovary. <italic>Drosophila</italic> have two ovaries, connected at their posterior ends by bilateral oviducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Each ovary contains ~16 ovarioles, where egg chambers are assembled in the germarium at the anterior and develop through 14 characteristic stages toward the posterior end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spradling, 1993</xref>). Each egg chamber contains one oocyte and 15 nurse cells surrounded by a layer of somatic follicle cells. In stage-14 egg chambers (also named mature follicles), all nurse cells are degraded, leaving an oocyte surrounded by follicle cells; Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (Mmp2) is upregulated in posterior follicle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deady et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, <italic>Oamb (octopamine receptor in mushroom body)</italic>, encoding an α-adrenergic receptor-like G-protein-coupled receptor for octopamine (OA), is also upregulated in all follicle cells of stage-14 egg chambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deady and Sun, 2015</xref>). OA, released from terminal nerves that innervate ovaries, activates Oamb receptor in stage-14 follicle cells, which induces calcium rise and activates Mmp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deady and Sun, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heifetz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Middleton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Monastirioti, 2003</xref>). Mmp2 enzymatic activity leads to degradation of posterior follicle cells and release of the encapsulated oocyte (called follicle rupture; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deady et al., 2015</xref>). The rest of the follicle cells remain at the end of the ovariole to form a corpus luteum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deady et al., 2015</xref>). Local adrenergic signaling has also been suggested to regulate mammalian ovulation but no molecular mechanisms have been illustrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kannisto et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmidt et al., 1985</xref>). In parallel to progesterone signaling in mammalian ovulation, ecdysteroid signaling is also activated in stage-14 follicle cells and is essential for <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovulation; ecdysteroid signaling modulates OA/Oamb-induced Mmp2 activation, but does not affect Oamb expression nor Mmp2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knapp and Sun, 2017</xref>). Thus, it is currently unknown what induces Mmp2 and Oamb expression in stage-14 follicle cells and how these follicles become fully competent for ovulation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29887.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>An illustration of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovulation process.</title><p>The female reproductive system, consisting of two ovaries, oviduct, uterus, seminal receptacle, and a pair of spermathecae and parovaria, was depicted in the cartoon.

Hnt is also expressed in follicle cells of stage 7-10A egg chambers, where it functions as a downstream target of Notch signaling to suppress Hedgehog signaling and to induce the mitotic/endocycle transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun and Deng, 2007</xref>). Hnt continues its expression in anterior follicle cells throughout late oogenesis. In contrast, Hnt expression in mainbody follicle cells is downregulated from stage 10B to stage 13 and re-upregulated in stage-14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deady et al., 2015</xref>), where its role is unknown. Moreover, few downstream targets of Hnt have been identified and its relationship to Ras signaling is also unknown.</p><p>Here, we characterized the dynamic expression of Hnt in stage-14 follicle cells. By using molecular and genetic tools, we demonstrated that Hnt expression in stage-14 follicle cells is essential for follicle rupture partly by upregulation of Oamb and Mmp2 expression in these follicle cells. Thus, Hnt functions as an essential transcription factor to prime follicles to be competent for follicle rupture/ovulation. In addition, Hnt’s role in follicle rupture can be replaced by human RREB-1. Our data, along with the involvement of Ras-MAPK signaling in mammalian ovulation, lead us to propose that Hnt/RREB-1 has a conserved role in regulating follicle rupture/ovulation downstream of Ras-MAPK signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynamic expression of Hindsight in stage-14 follicle cells</title><p>Hnt is not expressed in stage-13 follicle cells except those at the anterior region; however, it is upregulated in all stage-14 follicle cells and the corpus luteum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deady et al., 2015</xref>). Upon closer examination, we found three distinct patterns of Hnt expression throughout stage-14 egg chambers: (I) high Hnt expression in anterior and posterior but low/no Hnt in the middle follicle cells (‘A/P-Hnt’ egg chambers; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>); (II) high Hnt expression in all follicle cells (‘high-Hnt’ egg chambers; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and G</xref>); (III) low Hnt expression in all follicle cells (‘low-Hnt’ egg chambers; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and H</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). To determine the developmental sequence of the aforementioned three types of stage-14 egg chambers, we analyzed the expression patterns of Hnt against the expression of a stage-14 follicle-cell Gal4 driver (44E10-Gal4; renamed as FC1 for simplicity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deady and Sun, 2015</xref>) and the number of nurse cell nuclei in these egg chambers. 86% of A/P-Hnt egg chambers had medium-level GFP expression driven by FC1, while more than 73% of high-Hnt and 80% of low-Hnt egg chambers had high-level GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). This indicates that A/P-Hnt egg chambers are the youngest, which is consistent with the observation that A/P-Hnt egg chambers typically have more residual nurse-cell nuclei than the other two types of egg chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, high-Hnt egg chambers still contained one or two nurse-cell nuclei, while low-Hnt egg chambers typically did not contain nurse-cell nuclei and were skinner and dehydrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Oocyte maturation has been well studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eichhorn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kronja et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Von Stetina and Orr-Weaver, 2011</xref>); however, the maturation of follicle cells surrounding the oocyte in the stage-14 egg chamber is poorly defined at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duhart et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klusza and Deng, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spradling, 1993</xref>). According to Hnt expression in stage-14 egg chambers, we define the stage-14 egg chambers into three sub stages. Hnt is first upregulated in posterior follicle cells of stage-14A egg chambers, which is likely corresponding to Hnt’s role in upregulating Mmp2 expression in these follicle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Then Hnt is upregulated in all main-body follicle cells of stage-14B egg chambers, which is likely corresponding to Hnt’s role in upregulating <italic>Oamb</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The sequential upregulation of Mmp2 and Oamb is fully consistent with the fact that FC1-expressing egg chambers, in comparison to FC2-expressing egg chambers, are less efficient for OA-induced follicle rupture, but fully competent to respond to ionomycin-induced follicle rupture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D and H</xref>). The orchestrated upregulation of Mmp2 and Oamb, and possibly other components in the OA/Oamb-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Mmp2 pathway, by Hnt makes the final stage-14C egg chambers fully competent for ovulation. Components in the ecdysteroid signaling pathway, including the enzyme Shd for steroid production and Ecdysone receptor (EcR), also changes its expression pattern from stage-13 to stage-14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knapp and Sun, 2017</xref>). It is unknown whether Hnt is also responsible for such changes; however, it is unlikely that ecdysteroid signaling upregulates Hnt in stage-14 follicle cells, because ecdysteroid signaling does not affect Mmp2 and Oamb expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knapp and Sun, 2017</xref>). Hnt is upregulated in follicle cells from stage 7 to stage 10A, which depends on Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun and Deng, 2007</xref>); however, Notch signaling is not active in stage-14 follicle cells and is unlikely to upregulate Hnt at this stage. Thus, the developmental signal for Hnt upregulation in stage14 and the transition from stage 13 to stage 14 is still unknown.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29887.026</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A schematic cartoon summarizes the role of Hindsight in stage-14 follicle cells.</title><p>Hnt expression is shown in red with different intensity indicating different expression level.

Our work clearly defines the role of Hnt in regulating Mmp2 expression and basement membrane remodeling during ovulation.

Data were represented as mean percentage ± standard deviation (SD).</p><p>In situ zymography for detecting gelatinase activity was performed as previously reported with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deady and Sun, 2015</xref>). 20–25 μg/mL of DQ-gelatin conjugated with fluorescein (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) was added into the culture media with 20 μM OA for three hours. Mature follicles with posterior fluorescein signal were directly counted, and data represented as percent of follicles with posterior fluorescein signal. Follicles with lateral fluorescein signal, which is likely induced by damage during dissection, are not counted as Mmp2 activity, because Mmp2 is only expressed in posterior follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deady et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>For quantitative RT-PCR, total RNA was extracted from 60 stage-14 egg chambers isolated from 10 flies using Direct-zol RNA MicroPrep Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). cDNA synthesis, real-time PCR amplification and primers of <italic>Oamb.K3</italic> and <italic>Mmp2</italic> were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knapp and Sun, 2017</xref>). The data are presented as mean ± SEM from three biological replicates, except for <italic>RREB-1</italic> rescue experiment, in which one single biological experiment was presented.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunostaining and microscopy</title><p>Immunostaining was performed following a standard procedure, including ovary dissection, fixation in 4% EM-grade paraformaldehyde for 15 min, blocking in PBTG (PBS + 0.2% Triton + 0.5% BSA + 2% normal goat serum), and primary and secondary antibody staining diluted in PBTG. For <italic>vkg::GFP</italic> analysis, stage-14 egg chambers were first isolated from ovaries in cold Grace’s medium before fixation. Mouse anti-Hnt (1:75; Developmental Study Hybridoma Bank), mouse anti-GFP (1:2000; Invitrogen), rabbit anti-GFP (1:4000; Invitrogen), and rabbit anti-RFP (1:1000; MBL international) were used as primary antibodies, and Alexa 488, 546, and 633 goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit (1:1000, Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies. Images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope or Leica MZ10F fluorescent stereoscope with a sCOMS camera (PCO.Edge), and assembled using Photoshop software (Adobe Inc., Mountain View, CA) and ImageJ.</p><p>To visualize calcium response to ionomycin and octopamine, egg chambers expressing GCaMP5G and <italic>hnt<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> were isolated into an imaging chamber. Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axio Zoom microscope at 0.2 FPS, and 10 μL of ionomycin or octopamine were added to the solution after frame five to a final concentration of 5 μM or 20 μM, respectively. A ROI in the center of the main-body follicle cells was selected and the integrated intensity was measured. F0 was defined as the average baseline intensity (first five frames), and ΔF/F0 is reported.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical tests were performed using Prism 7 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). For comparison of more than two means, one-way ANOVA with <italic>post hoc</italic> Fisher’s Least Significant Difference test was used. For comparison of distribution, Chi square test was used except in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and H</xref>, where Fisher’s exact test was used. In addition, Z-score test was used for egg-laying time analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are thankful to Drs.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript &quot;Zinc-finger transcription factor Hindsight regulates ovulation competency of <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicles&quot;<italic>eLife</italic> by Deady, Li, and Sun is a thoroughly conducted study of what is possibly a conserved mechanism regarding the release of mature oocytes from the ovary. The present study builds on previous work and explores the regulation of oocyte competency in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system. The submitted manuscript establishes that the expression of hindsight (hnt), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of mammalian RREB-1, is required for this process. The manuscript is well written and the results are, for the most part, clearly presented.</p><p>Using follicle cell-specific GAL4 drivers as well as the morphology of nurse cell degeneration, the authors report that developing stage 14 egg chambers show strong hnt expression in follicle cells in a highly dynamic pattern. Stage 14 egg chambers are subdivided into 14A, 14B, and 14C stages and, stage 14B is shown to have the highest level of hnt expression. RNAi mediated knockdown of Hnt in stage 14 egg chambers is shown to result in ovulation defects and not oogenesis defects. These defects are demonstrated as being associated with reduced Mmp2 activity using a variety of assays. The hnt-knockdown phenotypes are corroborated by expression of the Mmp2 inhibitor Timp as well as Mmp2 RNAi mediated knockdown. Using an ex vivo assay, hnt-knockdown stage 14 egg chambers were found to be unresponsive to treatment with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore ionomycin. Later stage, weaker hnt-knockdown egg chambers were responsive to ionomycin but were not responsive to the OA ligand for Oamb, which was previously known to be required for ovulation. The authors go on to show that reduced hnt expression results in reduced <italic>Mmp2</italic> and Oamb expression, and correctly state that this is not necessarily a direct relationship. Based on RT-PCR the authors show that hnt likely functions to up-regulate the transcription of Mmp2 and Oamb. It is suggested that RNAi mediated hnt knockdown can be rescued by co-expression of human RREB1-GFP.</p><p>Overall, this work is sound and is certainly of great interest to <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis specialists. The extent to which this work would be of broader interest relates to the final rescue experiment, and it is here we feel further experiments would be required to support and validate the idea of a conserved function of hnt in ovulation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although most of the experiments are conducted in a rigorous manner, supporting their conclusions, weaknesses revolve around the fact that the validation of the RNAi-based method is not sufficient to fully support their conclusions. First, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> show that knockdown is quite incomplete. Thus, additional validation that the phenotypes are indeed caused by hnt knockdown is required.</p><p>The <italic>UAS-RREB-1</italic> rescue experiment should be controlled for possible GAL4 / UAS &quot;competition&quot;. This key experiment shows that there is a rescue of the hnt RNAi mediated knockdown phenotype by co-expression of <italic>UAS-RREB-1::GFP</italic>. I believe that it is possible that the rescue effect could be due to reduced efficiency of the RNAi knockdown, possibly through a non-specific effect such as less effective induction of UAS-hnt-RNAi expression due to the presence of the additional UAS responder element of <italic>UAS-RREB-1::GFP</italic>. (A possible titration effect of having additional UAS sequences available for the GAL4.) To control for this possibility of &quot;GAL4 competition&quot;, a control experiment should be performed with a UAS-GFP in place of <italic>UAS-RREB-1::GFP</italic>. The level of expression of the UAS-GFP should be comparable to the <italic>UAS-RREB-1::GFP</italic>.</p><p>Does hnt-overexpression resemble RREB-1 expression? It would be informative to show if there is a phenotype associated with hnt over-expression (using UAS-hnt, UAS-GFP-Hnt, EP55, or P<sup>GSV1</sup>GS1018) in stage 14 follicle cells. Or if not over-expressed per se, is there a consequence to a prematurely high level of hnt expression, or maintenance of a high level of expression, in stage 14C – and could this address whether the down-regulation of hnt expression in 14C stage is functionally significant? I.e. Is hnt over-expression sufficient for the premature rupture phenotype and/or upregulation of <italic>Mmp2</italic> and Oamb? Would such a phenotype resemble UAS-RREB1 expression, for example? These are fairly achievable experiments and their omission from this study seems puzzling to me.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The zinc-finger transcription factor Hindsight regulates ovulation competency of <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicles&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues, described in the review attached below, that need to be addressed before acceptance. These remaining issues are minor and can be addressed easily, so we anticipate to be able to accept your manuscript without further review upon revision. If you choose not to do the requested experiment, please provide an explanation in your response letter.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I have gone through the revised manuscript, &quot; The zinc-finger transcription factor Hindsight regulates ovulation competency of <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicles&quot;<italic>eLife</italic> by Deady, Li, and Sun.</p><p>I believe the authors have made clarifications and explanations to my satisfaction. It is an interesting story – and the investigations of ovulation and follicle cell rupture as a conserved mechanism is of general interest to the field of developmental biology.</p><p>I believe that much of the difficulty relates to the subtly with which hnt depletion or expression can affect the phenotype during the relatively short time window of stage 14 egg chambers.</p><p>I was initially concerned that the RREB-1 rescue of UAS-hnt-RNAi might not be specific. The authors did address my concerns regarding UAS-titration effects.</p><p>The authors spend a fair amount of time addressing the issue of using GAL4 mediated co-expression of UAS-hnt-RNAi and UAS-hnt, presumably to demonstrate that the UAS-hnt-RNAi phenotype is specific to hnt depletion. I'm not sure if these arguments, since the experiments were not effective, add anything to the manuscript other than some confusion.</p><p>What was much more convincing in my mind was the demonstration of ovulation defects using the temperature sensitive allele <italic>hnt<sup>peb</sup></italic> – which the authors call hnt<sup>1</sup>, as shown in the supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. In the follicle cell rupture, both <italic>hnt<sup>peb</sup>/hnt<sup>XE81</sup></italic> and <italic>hnt<sup>peb</sup>/hnt<sup>EH704a</sup></italic> were reduced to below 30%, where FC2 controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> show ~80%.</p><p>Two questions come to mind:first,is <italic>hnt<sup>peb</sup></italic> /+ control (~ 50%) showing a dosage effect compared to + /+ control (~80%)?;</p><p>and second,can the loss-of-function phenotype of <italic>hnt<sup>peb</sup>/hnt<sup>XE81</sup></italic> and <italic>hnt<sup>peb</sup></italic> /<italic>hnt<sup>EH704a</sup></italic> be rescued by FC1 or FC2 GAL4 expression of <italic>UAS-RREB-1</italic>?</p><p>This latter experiment would completely and definitively address any concerns regarding effectiveness of RNAi depletion phenotypes and their rescue by UAS-RREB1.</p><p>Since the rescue of the knockdown is pivotal to a conserved function, I would really like to see inclusion of this experiment. It should only take a couple of fly generations to get the GAL4 + UAS lines into the <italic>hnt<sup>peb</sup>/hnt<sup>XE81</sup></italic> and <italic>hnt<sup>peb</sup>/hnt<sup>EH704a</sup></italic> backgrounds, and the assay is well established in the lab. I think it will strengthen the rescue results.</p><p>Also, is there any evidence that RREB-1 is expressed in the mammalian ovary? Is it possible to find out somehow? (Such as some high throughput data somewhere?) If so, then it would certainly strengthen the conserved function in ovulation. But if it is not? Then…?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29887.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although most of the experiments are conducted in a rigorous manner, supporting their conclusions, weaknesses revolve around the fact that the validation of the RNAi-based method is not sufficient to fully support their conclusions.

Thus, additional validation that the phenotypes are indeed caused by hnt knockdown is required.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we have used two independent <italic>hnt<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> lines, which are targeting non-overlapping regions of <italic>hnt</italic> mRNA (<italic>hnt<sup>RNAi1</sup></italic> targeting nucleotide 4864-5206 and <italic>hnt<sup>RNAi2</sup></italic> targeting nucleotide 1787-2077), to demonstrate that both <italic>hnt<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> lines cause similar ovulation phenotypes. Although both <italic>RNAi</italic> lines are predicted to have potential off-targets (<italic>hnt<sup>RNAi1</sup></italic>: CG10597 and CG5119; <italic>hnt<sup>RNAi2</sup></italic>: CG10228, CG12673, and CG7991), the only overlapping target between these two <italic>hnt<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> lines is the <italic>hnt</italic> gene. These data strongly suggest that <italic>hnt</italic> is responsible for the ovulation defect. We have also tried to use <italic>UAS-hnt<sup>EP55</sup></italic> to rescue the defect of <italic>hnt<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> females. Despite using the Gal4/UAS system to overexpress <italic>hnt</italic> mRNA, unfortunately Hnt protein was still depleted by RNAi and not restored to normal level, and thus no rescue was observed (we added this result to new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, mammalian homolog RREB-1, which will not be targeted by <italic>hnt<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>, is able to fully rescue the follicle rupture defect caused by <italic>hnt</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This data also strongly support our conclusion that rupture defect in RNAi-based method is indeed caused by <italic>hnt</italic> knockdown, not peculiar RNAi off-target effect. Furthermore, we showed that mature follicles from <italic>hnt</italic> transheterozygous mutant females with a temperature-sensitive <italic>hnt</italic> allele also showed defect in OA-induced follicle rupture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). All these genetic evidence support our conclusion that <italic>hnt</italic> is the gene required for follicle rupture/ovulation.</p><p>Reviewers also pointed out that <italic>hnt<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> knockdown is quite incomplete. It is true that <italic>hnt</italic> knockdown is incomplete, which is largely due to the late expression of Gal4 driver (both are in stage-14 egg chambers) and short developmental time (stage 14 only lasts for a little more than two hours and it only takes six hours to develop from stage 10 to stage 14). However, <italic>hnt</italic> is strongly depleted whenever Gal4 driver has high expression. For example, FC1 Gal4 is efficient to deplete <italic>hnt</italic> in stage 14B and stage 14C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>), while FC2 Gal4 is efficient to deplete <italic>hnt</italic> in stage 14C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). The incomplete depletion of <italic>hnt</italic> is also quite consistent with incomplete block of ovulation in <italic>hnt<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> females. Thus, we strongly believe the ovulation defect is indeed caused by <italic>hnt</italic> depletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The UAS-RREB-1 rescue experiment should be controlled for possible GAL4 / UAS &quot;competition&quot;.

We used <italic>hnt<sup>EP55</sup></italic> line to perform the rescue and overexpression experiments as <italic>RREB1::GFP</italic> line. Unfortunately, <italic>hnt<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> lines are strong enough to block any overexpressed <italic>hnt</italic> mRNA through Gal4/UAS system and leave Hnt protein still depleted in rescue experiments, and no rescue effect was observed. The strong depletion of Hnt protein by <italic>hnt<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> when <italic>hnt<sup>EP55</sup></italic> was included was further validated using a flip-out actin-Gal4 system. These data are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>. In addition, we also observed slight increase of follicle rupture when <italic>hnt</italic> is overexpressed using FC1 Gal4, very similar with overexpression of <italic>RREB1::GFP</italic> with FC1 Gal4. This is consistent with our hypothesis that Hnt functions as competency factor to regulate follicle maturation. The phenotype is weak, which is likely due to the fact that FC1 Gal4 only starts to be expressed in stage 14, when endogenous Hnt already starts expression. It would be ideal to have a Gal4 driver expressed in stage 13 and use such Gal4 driver to overexpress <italic>hnt</italic>, but unfortunately, we are not aware of the existence of this type of Gal4 line. Furthermore, we tried to maintain high <italic>hnt</italic> expression in stage-14C using FC2 Gal4, it caused slight reduction of follicle rupture but no egg-laying defect. Thus, we didn’t make any conclusion to avoid over-interpreting the data. We also performed similar experiments with UAS-Hnt::GFP lines from Dr. Howard Lipshitz’s lab and they showed the same result as <italic>hnt<sup>EP55</sup></italic> line.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Two questions come to mind:first,is hnt<sup>peb</sup>/+ control (~ 50%) showing a dosage effect compared to + /+ control (~80%)?;</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated this experiment multiple times with two different researchers. Both came out the same result that <italic>hnt<sup>peb</sup>/+; FC2&gt;RFP/+</italic> follicles showed ~50% rupture rate instead of ~80% in wild-type control. Therefore, we think it is possible that <italic>hnt<sup>peb</sup>/+</italic> causes a dosage effect. This dose effect may not just caused by <italic>hnt</italic> in the mature follicle cells, but also from other tissues expressing <italic>hnt</italic> (see response to question 2). Alternatively, <italic>hnt<sup>peb</sup></italic> may behave as a dominant negative allele since the nature of the temperature sensitivity is unknown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>and second,can the loss-of-function phenotype of hntpeb /hntXE81 and hntpeb /hntEH704a be rescued by FC1 or FC2 GAL4 expression of UAS-RREB-1? This latter experiment would completely and definitively address any concerns regarding effectiveness of RNAi depletion phenotypes and their rescue by UAS-RREB1. Since the rescue of the knockdown is pivotal to a conserved function, I would really like to see inclusion of this experiment. It should only take a couple of fly generations to get the GAL4 + UAS lines into the hntpeb /hntXE81 and hntpeb /hntEH704a backgrounds, and the assay is well established in the lab. I think it will strengthen the rescue results.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not believe that FC1 or FC2 driving <italic>UAS-RREB-1</italic> expression will rescue the <italic>hnt</italic> loss-of-function phenotype for the following reasons: Hnt is not only expressed in stage-14 follicle cells, but also expressed in follicle cells of stage 7-stage10B, which is essential for follicle cell differentiation according to my previous study (Sun and Deng, 2007). Although no morphological defect was observed in <italic>hnt<sup>peb/XE81</sup></italic>and <italic>hnt<sup>peb/EH704a</sup></italic>mature follicles, we cannot exclude that subtle defect in early development may contribute to the follicle rupture defect. That’s why we used RNAi to bypass earlier Hnt function in our initial experiments. In addition, Hnt is also expressed in the midgut enterocytes and secretory cells in the female reproductive tract. The latter has been demonstrated to regulate ovulation as well (Sun and Spradling, 2013). Hnt may also function in the secretory cells in the female reproductive tract to regulate follicle rupture in addition to its role in the mature follicle cells. This is supported by our recent finding that another transcription factor is functioning in both secretory cells and mature follicle cells to regulate follicle rupture (Knapp and Sun, manuscript in preparation; this story is also going to be presented in the Annual <italic>Drosophila</italic> Research Conference in April 2018). We are interested in investigating the role of Hnt in serectory cells, but this is out of the scope of this study. Therefore, we do not believe this experiment will work. Even this will work, which will take another two months with several generations of crosses, it would not add any new findings to our current conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, is there any evidence that RREB-1 is expressed in the mammalian ovary?

We are interested in this question and our preliminary data had showed that RREB-1 is expressed in follicles in LH-dependent manner. We are in the process of generating RREB-1 conditional knockout mouse to test its role in mammals. This project is out of the scope of this current study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
