membrane fusion is required for TANGO1-dependent export of procollagen VII from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nogueira, et al., 2014</xref>). Along with the t-SNARE Syntaxin 18, we now reveal the complete complement of SNAREs required in this process, t-SNAREs BNIP1 and USE1, and v-SNARE YKT6. TANGO1 recruits YKT6-containing ER Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC) membranes to procollagen VII-enriched patches on the ER. Moreover residues 1214-1396, that include the first coiled coil of TANGO1, specifically recruit ERGIC membranes even when targeted to mitochondria. TANGO1 is thus pivotal in concentrating procollagen VII in the lumen and recruiting ERGIC membranes on the cytoplasmic surface of the ER. Our data reveal that growth of a mega transport carrier for collagen export from the ER is not by acquisition of a larger patch of ER membrane, but instead by addition of ERGIC membranes to procollagen-enriched domains of the ER by a TANGO1-mediated process.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10982.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10982.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>vesicle biogenesis</kwd><kwd>collagen secretion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) 625149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santos</surname><given-names>António JM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>609989</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raote</surname><given-names>Ishier</given-names></name><name><surname>Scarpa</surname><given-names>Margherita</given-names></name><name><surname>Brouwers</surname><given-names>Nathalie</given-names></name><name><surname>Malhotra</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SEV-2012-0208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malhotra</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Plan Nacional BFU2013-44188-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malhotra</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Consolider CSD2009-00016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malhotra</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Nogueira et al., 2014), we describe a mechanism for the generation of a mega-carrier for the export of bulky procollagen from the endoplasmic reticulum.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human cells express 28 collagens, most of which are secreted, constituting roughly 25% of our dry body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kadler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malhotra et al., 2015</xref>). Given their abundance and importance, an understanding of the mechanism by which collagens are sorted, packaged and exported across the secretory pathway, is of fundamental importance. A challenge arises from the fact that procollagens contain rigid, rod-like triple-helical domains that can reach 450 nm in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgeson et al., 1985</xref>) and are too large to be exported from the ER by conventional COPII (Coat Protein complex II)-coated vesicles of 60–90 nm diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glick and Malhotra, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Malhotra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miller and Schekman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Saito and Katada, 2015</xref>). Vesicles generated by a COPII-dependent mechanism have been characterised extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlowe et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2004</xref>) and it is clear that they are too small for procollagen export from the ER. So, how are collagens exported from the ER?</p><p>An important first step in addressing the mechanism of procollagen export from the ER was the identification of an ER-exit site resident protein called TANGO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saito et al., 2009</xref>). The SH3-like domain of TANGO1 is required for its binding to procollagen VII in the ER lumen. On the cytoplasmic side, the second coiled coil domain of TANGO1 binds a protein called cTAGE5 and the C-terminal proline rich domains (PRD’s) of TANGO1 and cTAGE5 interact with the COPII coat proteins Sec23A and Sec24C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Saito et al., 2011</xref>). Together, these proteins nucleate a complex that drives procollagen VII export from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Malhotra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miller and Schekman, 2013</xref>). TANGO1 mediates export of the only collagen expressed and secreted by Drosophila, and TANGO1 knockout mice are defective in the sorting and export of many collagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, TANGO1 connects procollagens in the lumen of the ER to the cytoplasmic components of the COPII coats.</p><p>Other studies have suggested that ubiquitination of Sec31 could potentially increase the size of the COPII coats to produce a mega carrier for collagen export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jin et al., 2012</xref>). Sedlin, a gene implicated in spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Matsui et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mumm et al., 2000</xref>) that is characterised by altered extracellular matrix production, could modulate the size of nascent carriers by regulating Sar1A-mediated COPII coat dynamics for procollagen export from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Venditti et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We showed previously that knockdown of Sly1 and the ER-localised t-SNARE, Syntaxin 18, inhibited the ER export of procollagen VII. This indicated that fusion of membranes with the ER was involved in events leading to procollagen VII export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nogueira et al., 2014</xref>). We hypothesised that membranes from a post-ER membrane compartment fuse with a procollagen VII-enriched domain at the ER, which grows into a collagen VII-containing mega-carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Malhotra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nogueira et al., 2014</xref>). We present here the entire complement of t-SNAREs required for procollagen VII export from the ER - BNIP1, USE1 and the previously described Syntaxin 18; that ERGIC membranes containing the v-SNARE YKT6 are required for fusion with the ER; and that the first coiled coil domain of TANGO1 is sufficient to recruit these membranes. We named this domain of TANGO1 TEER, for Tether of ERGIC at ER. The description of our findings follows.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Membrane fusion is required for procollagen VII export from the ER</title><p>Membrane fusion requires four coiled coil domains collectively provided by v- and t-SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weber et al., 1998</xref>). We decided to identify all four SNAREs in the complex involved in procollagen VII export and, by localising the v-SNARE involved, identify the source of membranes in this fusion reaction. Syntaxin 18 (STX18), an ER-resident t-SNARE, and the SNARE-activity-promoting protein SLY1 are required for procollagen VII export, but not the t-SNARE Syntaxin 17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nogueira et al., 2014</xref>). Two other t-SNAREs reported to act in coordination with STX18 are BNIP1/Sec20 and USE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belgareh-Touze et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burri et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cosson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dilcher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lewis and Pelham, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sweet and Pelham, 1992</xref>). siRNA oligos designed to knockdown t-SNAREs STX18, USE1 and BNIP1; or v-SNAREs YKT6, SEC22B and BET1 which function in transport between ER and the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hong, 2005</xref>); and a scrambled oligo were transfected into RDEB/FB/C7 cells. 48 hr after transfection, cells were washed and re-plated in fresh medium containing ascorbate for 20 hr to promote procollagen export from the ER. The cell lysate and the medium from cells depleted of BNIP1, STX18, USE1, BET1, SEC22B or YKT6 and the control cells were probed for collagen VII. Depletion of t-SNAREs BNIP1, STX18 and USE1 resulted in approximately 91%, 72% and 78% block in collagen VII secretion compared to control cells, respectively. Depletion of v-SNAREs only revealed a significant reduction in collagen VII secretion for the case of YKT6 - approximately 84% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10982.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>V- and t-SNAREs required for procollagen VII export from the ER RDEB/FB/C7 cells were transfected with siRNAs directed against BNIP1, STX18, USE1, BET1, SEC22B, YKT6 or a scrambled siRNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Collagen VII secretion was measured by western blotting and probing for collagen VII in RDEB/FB/C7 cell lysates and supernatants collected for 20 hr in the presence of ascorbic acid.

Depletion of the individual t-SNAREs led to intracellular accumulation of collagen VII that colocalised with HSP47 in ~74, ~59 and ~62% of the cells after depletion of BNIP1, STX18 and USE1, respectively, as opposed to ~8% measured in control cells. For the v-SNAREs, significant procollagen accumulation was only evident in cells depleted of YKT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). Taken together, these findings reveal that v-SNARE YKT6, and t-SNAREs BNIP1, Syntaxin 18, and USE1 are all required for the export of procollagen VII from the ER. Knockdown efficiencies were measured by RNA isolation followed by qRT-PCR to quantify the levels of remaining mRNA of USE1, BNIP1 and BET1; or by western blotting, to quantify remaining protein levels of STX18, YKT6 and SEC22B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The effects of all these SNAREs on procollagen VII export were also confirmed qualitatively in Het-1A, a cell line that endogenously expresses collagen VII in a small fraction of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>YKT6 localises to the ERGIC</title><p>The v-SNARE YKT6 is a cytoplasmic protein that is recruited to membranes of the Golgi complex and the ERGIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fukasawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McNew et al., 1997</xref>).

However, knockdown of TANGO1 dissociated ERGIC membranes from these patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), strongly indicating the involvement of TANGO1 in this recruitment. We mapped this function to amino acids 1214–1396 of TANGO1, corresponding to the first coiled coil domain in the cytoplasm. This “TEER” domain of TANGO1, when expressed at the surface of mitochondria, was able to specifically recruit ERGIC-53 membranes, but not COPII components or membranes representing early or late Golgi cisternae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

In addition, ER-localised t-SNAREs (STX18, USE1 and BNIP1) are also required for this export, providing compelling evidence that membrane fusion with the ER is necessary for procollagen VII export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The fact that not all ERGIC-53 membranes are recruited by TANGO1’s TEER domain and a specific set of SNAREs are required for fusion with the ER provides an explanation for our observation that TANGO1 knockdown does not alter general ER protein export or retrograde traffic from Golgi to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nogueira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saito et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A model for the export of procollagen VII from the ER</title><p>We propose the following pathway by which mega-carriers form at the ER for procollagen VII export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>):</p><p>First, TANGO1 binds procollagen VII in the ER lumen by a process that is dependent on its SH3-like domain.

TANGO1’s second coiled coil domain binds cTAGE5 via its second coiled coil domain, and together the PRD’s of these proteins interact with Sec23/Sec24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Saito et al., 2011</xref>).

The fusion of ERGIC membranes to procollagen VII-enriched domains provides a means for the growth of a mega export carrier commensurate with cargo size. This process of carrier biogenesis is thus fundamentally different from the mechanism by which generic COPII vesicles form at the ER to transport secretory cargoes.</p><p>There are approximately 40,000 TANGO1 molcules per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kulak et al., 2014</xref>) and the number of ER exit sites is estimated to be a few hundred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hammond and Glick, 2000</xref>). This suggests 100–200 TANGO1-cTAGE5 dimers at each exit site and if each TANGO1 (cTAGE5 does not contain a procollagen binding site in the lumen of the ER) binds a procollagen trimer, this would pack 100–200 fully folded trimers of procollagen into a mega-carrier at each ER exit site. We suggest that after packing approximately this quantity of procollagen, the separation of the collagen-filled carrier is triggered by dissociation of TANGO1 from procollagen VII and its concomitant detachment from Sec23/Sec24. Sec13/Sec31 would then be recruited to Sec23/Sec24 at the neck of the container filled with procollagen VII for its movement further along the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>cDNA cloning and constructs</title><p>TEER constructs were amplified from TANGO1 constructs described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saito et al., 2009</xref>).

Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking reagent and incubated overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488, Alexa 594 or Alexa 647 were diluted in blocking reagent and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. For YKT6 localisation studies, HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated constructs; after 48 hr after transfection, cells were processed for immunofluorescence. Briefly, cells were washed twice with room temperature KHM buffer (125 mM potassium acetate, 25 mM HEPES [pH 7.2], and 2.5 mM magnesium acetate). Cells were permeabilised by incubation in KHM with 0.1% Saponin for 5 min on ice followed by washing for 7 min on ice with KHM buffer. Cells were subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. For staining of mitochondria, before fixation, cells were incubated with a final concentration of 200 nM of MitoTracker (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 30 min in serum-free medium or, after fixation and permeabilisation immunostaining was carried out with anti-ATP5A1. Images were taken with a Leica TCS SPE or Leica TCS SP5 confocal with a 63x objective. Two-channel colocalisation analysis was performed using ImageJ, and the Manders’ correlation coefficient was calculated using the plugin JaCop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolte and Cordelieres, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Collagen secretion</title><p>The secretion assay was carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nogueira et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly RDEB/FB/C7 cells were transfected with siRNA as described above. 24 hr after the last siRNA transfection, the medium was replaced with a fresh medium containing 2 μg/ml ascorbic acid. Medium with ascorbate was added to the cells for 20 hr to allow for collagen secretion. The media were centrifuged at low speed to remove any cells or cellular debris and then the supernatant was boiled for 5 min with Laemmli SDS-sample buffer. For cell lysis, the cells were washed with PBS, lysed and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatants were boiled for 5 min with Laemmli SDS-sample buffer. Both media and cell lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE (6% acrylamide) and western blotting with Collagen VII, SEC31 and Tubulin antibodies. ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, Maryland) was used for quantification. Values plotted are a ratio of the signal obtained from the intensities of bands of collagen VII in the medium to those in the corresponding lysate to obtain a quantitative measure of collagen secretion free from variations that arise due to differences in cell densities. A similar procedure was used to measure secretion from HeLa cells that were transfected with Collagen VII-FLAG. Briefly, control or CrispR HeLa cells lacking TANGO1 (ΔTANGO1) were transfected with a FLAG-epitope-tagged collagen VII plasmid. 28 hr later, cells were washed and changed into medium with ascorbate for 20 hr. The cell lysate and medium were processed to assess secretion of Collagen VII as described for RDEB/FB/C7 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Protease protection assay to determine the topology of Mit-TEER and Mit-CC-TMCC3</title><p>Crude mitochondrial-membrane isolation was carried out from HeLa cells transiently transfected with either Mit-TEER or Mit-CC-TMCC3 by mechanical lysis of transfected cells from one to two 10 cm culture dishes, spinning at 700 g to remove intact cells and nuclei and then spinning at 7000 g for 10 min to obtain a pellet substantially enriched in mitochondrial membranes. These membranes were split into three fractions. The first was kept as a control; to the second fraction was added proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml); and to the third fraction, we added both proteinase K as well as the detergent NP40 (at a final concentration of 1%). Samples were incubated on ice for one hour to allow proteinase K to digest all accessible protein. The reaction was terminated by the addition of PMSF (1 mM) for ten minutes and then immediate boiling at 100°C for ten minutes along with acrylamide gel loading buffer. Western blotting was performed on these samples using an anti-Myc antibody and an antibody against the mitochondrial matrix protein ATP5A1 (a subunit of the ATP synthase, localised to the mitochondrial inner membrane). We compared the accessibility of the respective proteins to proteinase K in the presence and absence of detergent. Loss of a Mit-TEER/Mit-CC-TMCC3 in the absence of detergent would indicate that the protein was exposed to the cytoplasm. The mitochondrial inner membrane protein ATP5A1 served as a control to confirm that mitochondrial membranes were intact at the outset of the experiment and remained so in the absence of detergent (NP40).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Generation of TANGO1 knockout HeLa cell line by CRISPR</title><p>To generate a HeLa cell line in which TANGO1 protein expression has been abolished, we performed genome editing with the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 system. We obtained a pool of three plasmids each containing a 20 nt guide RNA (gRNA) sequence designed to target double-strand breaks in the Tango1 coding sequence and the pSpCas9 ribonuclease (Santa Cruz, sc-403994). In addition, plasmids contained the GFP coding sequence to allow for positive selection of transfected cells. HeLa cells were transfected with 1μg of pooled plasmid using the TransIT HeLa MONSTER reagent (Mirus Bio LLC). 96 hr after transfection GFP-positive cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and single cells were collected in 96-well plates. After expansion till 6-well format, cells were collected and protein lysates were prepared to assess TANGO1 presence by immunoblotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Results shown are mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The goal of a Research Qdvance is to publish experiments that build on work in an important way that has been published by <italic>eLife</italic> as a Research Article. This manuscript fits this description and will be of broad interest to the readers of <italic>eLif</italic>e after the authors address the following concerns.</p><p>Previous papers have shown that TANGO1 drives collagen secretion from the ER and works together with cTAGE and COPII coat proteins in this process. In a previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper, these authors found that the ER t-SNARE, STX18 is also needed. Here they reveal the full complement of SNARE proteins needed and report that a domain of TANGO1 may help tether ERGIC membranes to the ER as part of the present process. If the authors can address all the following comments, the work should be published in <italic>eLife</italic> as an Advance.</p><p>1) The weakest part of the otherwise strong story relates to the conclusion that CC1 is sufficient to tether ERGIC membranes and drive retargeting of TANGO CC1 to mitochondria. First, the authors use a transmembrane domain at the N-terminus of CC1 that is normally present in the middle of the protein to test possible tethering function of CC1. Please verify in some manner that this really acts as a tail anchor, leaving the CC1 facing the cytosol. Next, the authors cut the same domain in half and it goes to mitochondria, even though one reviewer thought that mitochondrial targeting signals are amphipathic helices. Please add quantitation of the overlap between an ER marker and the mitoTEER construct. Also, how much ERGIC overlap is seen with mitotracker in cells not expressing mitoTEER? This is important because it impacts the significance of mitoTEER retargeting of ERGIC in their experiments. There are more and more reports of close interaction between ER and mitochondria that are important for lipid exchange. Please look closely at this section and address this with careful quantitation. Also, the mitochondrial experiment obviously needs a control construct to be analyzed under identical conditions. A Mit-CC3 construct seems a good choice.</p><p>2) The results of the assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> need to be quantified and it should be done by an objective measure using image analysis tools. This will mean thinking about what constitutes recruitment in the assay. How close does an ERGIC spot need to be? How many per collagen structure? What fraction of total ERGIC spots is recruited?</p><p>3) Please quantify the overlap between ERGIC53 and YKT6. Also, please indicate mobility of size markers on all blots.</p><p>4) In the last paragraph of the subsection “TANGO1 recruits ERGIC membranes for fusion with the ER”, how clear is it that it is a subpopulation of ERGIC53 membranes that are recruited? Please clarify with quantitation.</p><p>5) The effects shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> are very modest, and it would be informative to know what the Pearson's value is for a mock-transfected (vector only) control. Furthermore is a difference between 0.5 and 0.65 Pearson's biologically relevant? I think the authors should change their description of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> (subsection “A domain in TANGO1 directly recruits ERGIC membranes”). However, the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> are much more convincing, indicating that a sub-population of ERGIC compartments (YKT6 positive) are indeed recruited, as the authors eventually discuss. Therefore, I agree with the overall interpretation but I was put off by the overstatement regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>.</p><p>6) Is collagen secretion blocked in the tango1-CRISPR cells? This seems like an important control for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> uses quadruple labeling (all in one panel) to compare ERGIC/collagen juxtaposition between control and TANGO1 knockdown cells. It is really difficult to assess the result. Side-by-side presentation of single channel images is needed (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>8) The idea seems to be that Mit-TEER repositions the entire ERGIC53 (or YTKT6) pattern so that it aligns with the mitochondrial pattern. A larger field view (in addition to the enlarged insets) would probably convey this point well, particularly if evident for TEER but not CC3.</p><p>9) In the previous study, the authors showed that knockdown of SLY1 and Syntaxin 18 did not significantly affect the ER-Golgi recycling pathway or secretion of a different collagen. The authors appear to be assuming that knockdown of USE1, BNIP1, and YKT6 are similarly specific, but they did not actually demonstrate this. Are they? Please clarify in the text.</p><p>10) There is a typo in the third paragraph of the subsection “A model for the export of procollagen VII from the ER”: &quot;Sec12-GTP&quot; should be &quot;Sar1-GTP&quot;. It was not clear to me why, as described in the next paragraph, binding of Tango1 to Sec23/24 would &quot;expose the TEER domain&quot;. Is there any evidence that the TEER domain is normally masked?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;TANGO1 recruits ERGIC membranes to the endoplasmic reticulum for procollagen export&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and a Reviewing editor. The paper has been greatly improved by significant rewriting and inclusion of new data and better quantification. We favor publication of the story after correction of three minor items.</p><p>1) Ykt6 staining is weak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>.</p><p>2) Although you have shown that the TEER domain is sufficient to recruit ERGIC to mitochondria, you have not yet shown that other regions of TANGO don't also have this capacity. Please state this explicitly.</p><p>3) The ERGIC vesicles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref> are likely larger than those shown. If it is not too difficult, it would be worth trying to make the various compartments of appropriate scale.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10982.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] 1) The weakest part of the otherwise strong story relates to the conclusion that CC1 is sufficient to tether ERGIC membranes and drive retargeting of TANGO CC1 to mitochondria.

We compared the accessibility of the respective proteins to proteinase K in the presence and absence of detergent. A near-complete loss of a Mit-TEER/Mit-CC-TMCC3 in the absence of detergent confirmed that the protein was exposed to the cytoplasm. The mitochondrial inner membrane protein ATP5A1 served as a control to confirm that mitochondrial membranes were intact at the outset of the experiment and remained so in the absence of detergent (NP40).

Importantly, every cell that expresses Mit-TEER shows a distinct recruitment of ERGIC membranes, quantification of the fraction of ERGIC recruited will be misleading as it will depend on a number of factors such as expression levels of the Mit-TEER. To avoid confusion, we have changed the text and do not refer to it as a subpopulation of ERGIC membranes.</p><p><italic>5) The effects shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> are very modest, and it would be informative to know what the Pearson's value is for a mock-transfected (vector only) control. Furthermore is a difference between 0.5 and 0.65 Pearson's biologically relevant? I think the authors should change their description of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> (subsection “A domain in TANGO1 directly recruits ERGIC membranes”). However, the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> are much more convincing, indicating that a sub-population of ERGIC compartments (YKT6 positive) are indeed recruited, as the authors eventually discuss. Therefore, I agree with the overall interpretation but I was put off by the overstatement regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>.</italic></p><p>Instead of using only a TEER constructs (Mit-TEER), we now added a coiled coil-containing construct TMCC3 (Mit-CC-TMCC3) as a control for our observations. We now make comparisons between mitochondrial TEER and TMCC3 expressing cells. Adding more experiments to our analysis has resulted in an even more reliable and enhanced difference in the overlap coefficients. This is now included in the text.</p><p><italic>6) Is collagen secretion blocked in the tango1-CRISPR cells? This seems like an important control for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>.</italic></p><p>Yes. We have included this control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> uses quadruple labeling (all in one panel) to compare ERGIC/collagen juxtaposition between control and TANGO1 knockdown cells. It is really difficult to assess the result. Side-by-side presentation of single channel images is needed (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</italic></p><p>Done.</p><p><italic>8) The idea seems to be that Mit-TEER repositions the entire ERGIC53 (or YTKT6) pattern so that it aligns with the mitochondrial pattern. A larger field view (in addition to the enlarged insets) would probably convey this point well, particularly if evident for TEER but not CC3.</italic></p><p>As mentioned above, there is a distinct ERGIC recruitment to Mit-TEER, but importantly, a large pool of ERGIC is clearly not mis-localised/repositioned. This is not seen with CC-TMCC3 domain. We have changed the images as required.</p><p><italic>9) In the previous study, the authors showed that knockdown of SLY1 and Syntaxin 18 did not significantly affect the ER-Golgi recycling pathway or secretion of a different collagen. The authors appear to be assuming that knockdown of USE1, BNIP1, and YKT6 are similarly specific, but they did not actually demonstrate this. Are they? Please clarify in the text.</italic></p><p>Based on the data obtained from TANGO1 it is very likely that this combination of SNAREs is likely involved in the export of procollagen VII. Other combinations might be used to transfer cargo between ER and the Golgi.</p><p><italic>10) There is a typo in the third paragraph of the subsection “A model for the export of procollagen VII from the ER”: &quot;Sec12-GTP&quot; should be &quot;Sar1-GTP&quot;. It was not clear to me why, as described in the next paragraph, binding of Tango1 to Sec23/24 would &quot;expose the TEER domain&quot;. Is there any evidence that the TEER domain is normally masked?</italic></p><p>We have rewritten the Discussion to better explain our model. Briefly, the process we describe must be regulated to prevent rampant retrograde fusion of ERGIC membranes with the ER. One reasonable way to regulate this would be to expose the CC1 domain of TANGO only when it is needed. This we propose might be triggered by the binding of PRD’s of TANGO-cTAGE5 to Sec23/Sec24 (Figure 9). Structural analysis of these components in the future would be real test of this working model.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1) Ykt6 staining is weak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>.</italic></p><p>We have included new images where, according to the editor’s suggestions, the gain for the YKT6 signal was boosted while acquiring images for control conditions and this has described in corresponding figure legends. This increase in gain has lead to a clearly visible staining in the nuclear area, probably due to the quality of the antibody. Regardless, we do not see any significant localization of YKT6 to mitochondria when cells express CC-TMCC3 or in untransfected cells.</p><p><italic>2) Although you have shown that the TEER domain is sufficient to recruit ERGIC to mitochondria, you have not yet shown that other regions of TANGO don't also have this capacity. Please state this explicitly.</italic></p><p>Done.</p><p><italic>3) The ERGIC vesicles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref> are likely larger than those shown. If it is not too difficult, it would be worth trying to make the various compartments of appropriate scale.</italic></p><p>Done.</p></body></sub-article></article>
