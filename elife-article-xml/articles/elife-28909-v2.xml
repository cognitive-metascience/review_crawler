Our approach employs a fast docking algorithm to find shape complementary ligand placement in protein scaffolds, followed by design of the surrounding residues to optimize binding affinity. Co-crystal structures of the highest affinity binder reveal a highly preorganized binding site, and an overall architecture and ligand placement in close agreement with the design model. We use the designs to generate plant sensors for fentanyl by coupling ligand binding to design stability. The method should be generally useful for detecting toxic hydrophobic compounds in the environment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28909.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many small molecules, including toxins and some medicines, have flexible structures, which makes it difficult to detect and/or neutralize them. The pain medication fentanyl, for example, can rotate to adopt many shapes. In recent years, fentanyl drug abuse has become increasingly common, and the drug is often illegally produced. The number of deaths caused by fentanyl has risen greatly, which provides a strong reason to find new ways to detect this and other drugs.</p><p>Now, Baker et al. have created new sensors that are able to detect fentanyl. First, the 11 most likely shapes that fentanyl could adopt were identified based on known information about the structure of the molecule. Then, a computer program was used to design proteins that were predicted to strongly bind to these most common shapes. Next, genes that coded for these proteins were synthesized in the laboratory and introduced into bacteria, which read the genes to build the proteins.</p><p>Similar to a well-fitted lock and key, the shape of the newly designed protein had to complement a likely shape of the fentanyl molecule. Baker et al. used a technique called X-ray crystallography to visualize the proteins in atomic detail and confirm that these fentanyl-binders matched their corresponding computational models. Those proteins that bound fentanyl best were then engineered into plant cells, and later into whole plants, together with reporter systems that gave signals when the sensors detected fentanyl.</p><p>In future, these specifically synthesized proteins could be integrated into entire panels of plants or other systems to detect toxins and other harmful chemicals. Such systems would be of interest in a medical setting and for detecting environmental contamination.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein

μ-opioid receptor (MOR), with an affinity of approximately 1 nM and a potency 100-times that of morphine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Volpe et al., 2011</xref>). It is used both pre- and post-operatively as a pain management agent. The fast acting nature and strength of fentanyl have been attributed to its high degree of lipophilicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peckham and Traynor, 2006</xref>). Fentanyl has become a widespread drug of abuse, and has played a central role in the growing opioid epidemic. Reports of illegal manufacturing and fentanyl-related deaths across the country and other parts of the world have increased significantly in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drug Enforcement Administration, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Custom-designed ligand-binding proteins offer the possibility of both detecting and counteracting toxins such as fentanyl. Antibodies raised against small molecules generally require mammalian expression systems and conjugation of the compound (hapten) to an immunogenic carrier protein. In addition, elicitation of antibodies by immunization does not provide control over the interactions that the protein makes with the ligand. In contrast, computationally designed proteins can be readily expressed in bacterial and other low-cost expression systems, and specific interactions can be directly programmed. However, computational design of precise protein–ligand interactions for flexible, predominantly hydrophobic compounds is challenging. As these molecules are in some sense ‘featureless’, due to their overall hydrophobic character, binding depends heavily on the protein-ligand shape complementarity. We previously reported a method for generating binders for relatively rigid molecules containing hydrogen bonding functional groups, where the focus was on solutions with optimal hydrogen bonding geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tinberg et al., 2013</xref>). However, this approach is not well suited for flexible, nonpolar compounds such as fentanyl.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We pursued a two-step approach to designing fentanyl binders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Fentanyl contains 6 rotatable bonds, which increases the combinatorial complexity of possible protein–ligand interactions to be considered. Starting from the structure of a fentanyl-citrate toluene solvate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peeters et al., 1979</xref>), we generated 11 conformers plus an additional hydrated model of fentanyl, based on the small molecule structure, with non-covalently bound water atoms at both the tertiary amine (3 Å nitrogen to water distance, 109° carbon-nitrogen-water angle) and the carbonyl oxygen (3 Å oxygen to water distance, 120° carbon-oxygen-water angle) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). For each fentanyl conformer, we identified a large number of shape complementary placements of fentanyl within protein scaffolds from the MOAD database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2005</xref>) using the fast docking algorithm PatchDock, which identifies shape complementary interactions between binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duhovny et al., 2002</xref>). Multipose binding has been observed in many naturally occurring protein-ligand complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kulp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barelier et al., 2015</xref>), but for our approach we sought precise control of the fentanyl pose by considering only a single conformer per protein scaffold.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28909.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of Fen49 and a comparison with the parent scaffold.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The sugar bound to the native scaffold (2QZ3), xylotetraose (left), is much more polar than fentanyl (middle), a predominantly hydrophobic compound.

Similar to other MOR agonists, fentanyl possesses a charged tertiary amine, one of only two sites capable of making electrostatic interactions. We sought to exploit the tertiary amine to confer directionality and allow atomic level control over the placement of the otherwise hydrophobic molecule. Two design strategies were pursued: (1) The introduction of specific side chain–fentanyl interactions, either acidic (Asp or Glu) or cation-pi (Phe, Tyr, Trp) with the tertiary amine, and (2) the use of the hydrated fentanyl, as described above, for bridging indirect fentanyl-protein interactions. Designs were filtered based on shape complementarity, protein–fentanyl interface energy and the solvent-accessible-surface-area (SASA), and 62 were selected for experimental characterization.</p><p>The designs were expressed using yeast surface display and probed for binding with a bovine serum albumin-fentanyl (Fen-BSA) conjugate. Sixty-one of the 62 designs expressed well, and three bound fentanyl with low micromolar to high nanomolar affinities. Fen49, the strongest binder (500 nM affinity for Fen-BSA) on yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), and Fen21 (10 μM) were chosen for further experimental characterization, as they represent two different scaffold classes. Of these two designs, recombinantly expressed Fen49 proved to be more stable and amenable to crystallization (see below).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28909.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Experimental characterization of Fen49 binding and affinity enhancement.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) left, Expression of Fen49 (FITC coupled anti-C-myc, x-axis) and binding of Fen-BSA (phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated streptavidin, y-axis) on yeast.

Yeast–binding experiments of individual Fen49 point mutants corresponding to the computationally substituted positions showed that most are crucial for recognizing fentanyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Fentanyl does not bind the unmodified Fen49 scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), a glycoside hydrolase (PDB 2QZ3). Purified Fen49 displayed an affinity of 6.9 μM for a fentanyl-Alexa-488 conjugate by fluorescence polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). We chose to conjugate the Alexa-488 fluorophore at the 4-phenyl position, as this site is compatible with the designed binding mode, and is also the site of fentanyl conjugation to the BSA probe used in our initial yeast display experiments (see Materials and Methods). 2QZ3 was cocrystallized with xylotetraose (only 3 of the 4 xylose molecules were placed in the final 2QZ3 model), a sugar molecule with a high degree of polarity compared with fentanyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vandermarliere et al., 2008</xref>). Such a dramatic repurposing of a sugar–binding protein is possible because the initial low-resolution docking step is agnostic to the polar character of the scaffold–binding cavity, as shape complementarity is the primary focus.</p><p>We solved an atomic resolution (1.00 Å) X-ray crystal structure of Fen49 in the apo state, one of the first examples of an original (non-optimized) computational design that has been structurally characterized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The structure reveals a highly preorganized binding cavity (28 of 30 non-alanine/non-glycine side chains within ~8Å of fentanyl adopt the designed rotamer) and an overall structure in very close agreement with the design model; the r.m.s.d. of the design model to the parent structure is 0.26 over 184 of 185 residues (TM_align (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang and Skolnick, 2005</xref>) score of 0.99). The Fen49 apo crystals were obtained from a condition containing 25% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 as the precipitant. During model building, a well-ordered portion of PEG was observed in the binding cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Soaking experiments with fentanyl tended to crack the crystals and destroy X-ray diffraction, likely as a result of PEG being displaced from the binding cavity.

At each position, each of the 20 amino acids were allowed, resulting in 3680 unique, single-mutant sequences (184 × 20 = 3680). Next-gen sequencing (millions of sequence reads) was carried out after each of 4 rounds of affinity enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The majority of the binding site residues were preserved during selection, suggesting that Fen49 was designed with a near-optimal binding cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Exceptions to this were three alanine residues, A67, A78 and A172, at the base of the binding pocket that were frequently substituted with larger hydrophobic residues, which provide additional packing for fentanyl. Two positions above the binding cavity enriched to amino acids that could reduce steric hindrance (Arg 112 to smaller aliphatic amino acids) or function as a hydrophobic lid over the binding site (Pro 116 to larger side chains). Charged amino acids, which might be expected to destabilize the hydrophobic cavity of Fen49, were disfavored during selection. However, a modest enrichment for glutamate at position 37 was observed in the second round of selection, suggesting an E37-tertiary amine salt bridge and the possibility of alternative poses of fentanyl within the binding site. This substitution was depleted in later rounds as a hydrophobic pocket was ultimately selected. We identified a combination of 2 substitutions, A78V plus A172I, that produced a Fen49 variant with an approximate 100-fold affinity improvement for fentanyl, to 64 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). These substitutions increase packing in the binding site, and likely require a modest positional adjustment of fentanyl to avoid a steric clash with I172 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>From the SSM experiments, we identified a Fen49 Y88A point mutant, termed Fen49*, that proved to be more suitable for complex structure determination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The 1.79 Å Fen49*-apo structure again revealed a highly preorganized binding site, and an overall structure in close agreement with the Fen49 design (0.72 r.m.s.d. for Fen49* compared with the design model over 184 of 185 residues (TM_align score of 0.98)). The majority</p><p>of Fen49* side chains adopt the design conformations (25 of 30 non-alanine/non-glycine residues within ~ 8 Å of fentanyl are correct) and the structure shows minimal backbone rearrangements. The only significant deviation from the parent Fen49 is in the loop region Thr87 – Thr93, which contains the Y88A substitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, a 3-residue polar network between Arg89, Asp106 and Tyr108 on the backside of the binding cavity is disrupted in Fen49* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). As a consequence of the altered loop, tryptophans 63 and 90 adopt non-designed rotamers and collapse inwards towards the center of the binding cavity, with the designed Trp90-fentanyl stacking interaction replaced by a Trp63-fentanyl dipole-quadrupole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the parent Fen49, Fen49*-apo produced crystals with an empty binding cavity that proved to be useful for soaking experiments. We solved a 1.67 Å Fen49*-fentanyl complex structure, which exhibits a high degree of similarity both with the designed model (r.m.s.d. of 0.64 over 184/185 residues, TM_align score of 0.99), and the Fen49*-apo structure (r.m.s.d. of 0.420 over all 185 residues, TM_align score of 0.99). The Thr87 – Thr93 loop adopts the same structure found in Fen49*-apo. With the exception of Trp63, which is flipped nearly 180° in the complex, fentanyl does not induce any significant changes to the active site upon binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Fentanyl appears to stabilize the binding site; Fen49*-apo Trp63 and the Thr87 – Thr93 loop exhibit higher than average B-factors when compared both with the Fen49*-apo structure overall and with the corresponding residues in the Fen49* complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Despite the divergent Thr87 – Thr93 loop, the parent Fen49 and Fen49* have virtually identical affinities for fentanyl, suggesting that this loop, and more specifically the differential Trp63-90 interaction with fentanyl, do not substantially lower the free energy of fentanyl binding. Instead, preorganization of the inner binding cavity residues appears to be the main determinant for binding.</p><p>Fen49 was designed to bind a solvated fentanyl. The water modeled at the fentanyl tertiary amine was introduced to bridge an indirect protein–ligand interaction with Tyr80. During structure refinement, a strong electron density peak was observed at this location (3 Å distance and 109.2° angle). Refinement with water at this position produced a strong positive signal in the <italic>F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub></italic> difference map, and it became clear that the density corresponded instead to a chloride ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The chloride occupies the site of the designed water; it is coordinated by the tertiary amine, which is protonated at the crystallization pH (7.5), Tyr80 and a nearby water, a trigonal planar arrangement for chloride typically found in the PDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carugo, 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>). To address the role of the chloride in binding, we carried out binding experiments using potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), free of chloride, as the assay buffer (protein was prepared in KPi as well). Nearly identical affinities were observed for Fen49.1, while Fen49* showed a modest 3-fold (~20 μM) reduction in affinity (data not shown), suggesting that a chloride may be preferred, but is not required for binding. We speculate that in the absence of chloride, a water molecule takes its place as in the design model. The Tyr80–chloride interaction observed in Fen49* is mimicked by a Tyr80-PEG hydrogen bond in the Fen49 parent structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). A second water molecule is observed bound to the fentanyl carbonyl oxygen at the designed position (2.7 Å distance, 135.2° angle).</p><p>A fentanyl detector would have applications in both medicine and public health. To this end, we incorporated our fentanyl binders into a transcription factor (TF)-based biosensor system, which couples ligand binding to transcription activation by stabilizing the protein against degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banaszynski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 2015</xref>). This sensor can be placed in any system; we chose plants as they offer inexpensive on-site sensors for public health workers. We first tested our sensors in isolated plant cells (Arabidopsis protoplasts). The sensors were cloned into a plasmid containing a Gal4-responsive promoter-driving expression of a luciferase reporter, and expressed transiently in protoplasts. Fentanyl was added to the liquid media in which the protoplasts were incubated. In the presence of fentanyl, both the Fen21 and Fen49 TFs activated luciferase expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). The Fen21-based sensor, which proved to be the better of the two, produced an 8-fold increase in luciferase expression over background when treated with 250 μM fentanyl. Fen49-expressing protoplasts displayed a modest background signal in the absence of ligand, suggesting that Fen49 is too stable in its apo form to function effectively as a sensor without additional engineering. To demonstrate that our computationally designed fentanyl sensor could function in a multicellular organism, we stably transformed Arabidopsis plants with the Fen21 TF directing luciferase expression. Plants were incubated in liquid plant culture media supplemented with 100 μM fentanyl (250 μM fentanyl was toxic to plants; data not shown). As early as 24 hr, the Fen21 TF transgenic plants showed an approximately 5-fold increase in luciferase activity, which increased to 10-fold at 72 hr post incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28909.018</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Fentanyl-dependent transcriptional activation in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Protoplasts expressing a conditionally stable transcription-factor (TF) firefly luciferase construct respond to treatment with fentanyl.

Initially, the designs were filtered based on the orientation of the ligand to allow egress of the chemical linker from the binding cavity for yeast display. For poses where the ligand had been placed according to the matching procedure, restraints were added and minimized in the context of an alanine backbone. For the initial round of designs, the catalytic residues were fixed and not allowed to change rotamer or amino acid identity. This was repeated 10 times and the lowest restraint score was kept for further design. The native scaffold residues were given a bonus of 1.5 REU, and the sequence was optimized with the matched residues fixed for 10 iterations. Again, the designs with the lowest interface energy (IFE) were kept. In order to limit the number of designs, we applied filters to remove poses that scored that did not meet the following thresholds: SC &gt; 0.5, IFE &lt; −10 REU, dsasa ≥ 0.8 of the ligand, a geometrical restraint score ≤ 5, packing of the rotamers in the binding pocket with an RMSD &lt; 1 Å, ddG between the protein and the ligand of &lt; −10 REU, and finally that the electrostatic field of the charged hydrogen and the oxygen of the carbonyl were negative.

The first step involved 2 separate PCR reactions to generate the 5’ and 3’ fragments flanking the site of interest. The reaction conditions were as follows: 16.125 μl ddH<sub>2</sub>O, 5 μl of HF Buffer (5X), 0.125 of Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB), 1.25 μl of 10 mM dNTPs, 0.5 μl of template DNA at 10 ng/μl, 1 μl each of either the 3’-MCS primer (5’-GTACGAGCTAAAAGTACAGTGGGAAC-3’) plus the forward NNK-containing primer, or the 5’-MCS primer (5’-TGACAACTATATGCGAGCAAATCCCCTCAC-3’) plus a reverse primer designed to have a partial overlap with the NNK primer. The second PCR step reconstituted the full Fen49 gene containing a single SSM site, plus 5’- and 3’-flanking sequences derived from the pETCON vector. The reactions conditions were as follows: 33.25 μl ddH<sub>2</sub>O, 10 μl HF Buffer (5X), 0.25 μl DNA Polymerase, 2.5 μl dNTPs, 1 μl each of the 5’- and 3’-MCS primers, 1 μl each of both PCR products described in step one.

Anisotropy values were collected over a period of 15 min, and the equilibrium dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) were determined as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tinberg et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Protein crystallization</title><p>Protein was spun at 4°C, 20,817 x <italic>g</italic> for 20 min to remove insoluble material prior to crystallization. Typically none was observed. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-rad) and BSA to generate the standard curve. Crystallization trials were conducted using a variety of 96-condition spare matrix suites from Qiagen and Hampton Research. All crystallization trials were conducted with the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 20°C, using 3-well MRC crystallization plates (Swissci).</p><p>Fen49 crystallization trials were conducted using a Mosquito Crystal nanoliter robot (TTP Labtech). Fen49 at 30 mg/mL was mixed in 1:2, 1:1 and 2:1 protein to crystallization solution ratios in 400 nl drops. Crystals displaying a shard-like cluster morphology were obtained after ~1 week from a solution containing 0.1M citric acid pH 3.5% and 25% (w/v) PEG-3350. Microseeding was employed in order to obtain crystals suitable for diffraction experiments. A drop containing Fen49 crystals was added to 50 μL of crystallization solution in a microfuge tube containing a Seed Bead (Hampton). This solution was vortexed for 30 s. Fresh drops were set up using 1 μL of Fen49 at 20 mg/mL plus 1 μL crystallization solution, to which 0.2 μL of a 1:100 dilution of the seed stock was added. Large, single crystals were observed overnight, which grew to a maximum size of over 300 μm in length within ~3 days. Crystals were briefly dipped in a solution of 0.085M citric acid pH 3.5, 21.25% (w/v) PEG-3350% and 15% glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p><p>Crystals of Fen49*-apo were obtained manually by mixing 0.5 μL of protein at 10 mg/mL with 0.5 μL and 0.8 M sodium phosphate, 0.8 M potassium phosphate and 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5. Rod-like crystals appeared after ~3 days and grew to a maximum of 200 μm in length. Crystals were briefly soaked in a solution of 0.6M sodium phosphate, 0.6 M potassium phosphate, 0.075 M HEPES pH 7.5% and 25% glycerol, then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p><p>The Fen49*-fentanyl complex was obtained by soaking Fen49*-apo crystals overnight in mother liquor plus 20 mM fentanyl citrate (solution made in dH<sub>2</sub>O to ~50 mM). The soaked crystals were sealed in a well containing mother liquor to allow excess water from the added fen-citrate to diffuse. Fen49*-complex crystals were cryo-protected the same as Fen49*-apo. Crystals were flash frozen the same as for Fen49*-apo.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Data collection and processing</title><p>All datasets were collected at the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley, CA) beam line 8.2.2. using an ADSC Q315R CCD area detector.

Two copies of Fen49 were placed in the asymmetric unit (AU). An initial model was generated using the PHENIX Autobuild module. All defaults were used, with the following exceptions: ‘Build-in-place’ was set to ‘False’, simulated annealing was used for refinement, and prime-and-switch maps were used during model building to remove search model bias. All atoms except hydrogen were refined with anisotropic atomic displacement parameters.</p><p>Fen49*-apo – PDB 2QZ3, the parent scaffold from which Fen49 was designed, was used as the MR search model.

The binding designs can be used as an antidote or sensor component for the drug. The work is absolutely state-of-the-art for protein design. The paper is dense with report of the initial designs, their optimization, binding assays, crystal structures for apo and complexed proteins, and initial results for sensor systems in plants. The fact that they were able to redesign a sugar (polar molecule) binding protein to bind fentanyl is striking, as is the performance of Fen49.1. There are no significant issues with the manuscript.</p><p>Experiment for consideration during revision.</p><p>The observation of the bridging chloride ion must have come as a surprise, and its properties will differ greatly from the design bridging water. How important is that chloride? Without it, the fentanyl's cationic nitrogen – which for the Mu Opioid Receptor is certainly the key recognition feature – is not complemented by any single protein group. This not only distinguishes it from MOR recognition, but from almost all aminergic transmitters and drugs (some, it is true, are recognized by groups other than acids, but they are almost always recognized by *something*, such as Tryp/Tyr cages).

The chloride observed in the structure very closely mimics this water; it is precisely positioned at the design location, and satisfies the design interaction of the fentanyl tertiary amine with Y80. We agree with the reviewers that the presence of a chloride in the structure was a surprise. The chloride appears to be dispensable for binding, however, as fentanyl is still able to bind to Fen49 in a buffer system without chloride, albeit with slightly reduced affinity. Chloride would be better suited than water to complement the positive charge of the tertiary amine. However, in the absence of chloride, water appears to be sufficient for binding in a manner that is dependent primarily on apolar interactions and shape complementarity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
