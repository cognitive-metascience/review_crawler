How pluripotency is transited during embryo implantation, followed by cell lineage specification and establishment of the basic body plan, is poorly understood. Here we report the transcription factor Zfp281 functions in the exit from naive pluripotency occurring coincident with pre-to-post-implantation mouse embryonic development. By characterizing <italic>Zfp281</italic> mutant phenotypes and identifying Zfp281 gene targets and protein partners in developing embryos and cultured pluripotent stem cells, we establish critical roles for Zfp281 in activating components of the Nodal signaling pathway and lineage-specific genes. Mechanistically, Zfp281 cooperates with histone acetylation and methylation complexes at target gene enhancers and promoters to exert transcriptional activation and repression, as well as epigenetic control of epiblast maturation leading up to anterior-posterior axis specification. Our study provides a comprehensive molecular model for understanding pluripotent state progressions in vivo during mammalian embryonic development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mouse embryo</kwd><kwd>epiblast maturation</kwd><kwd>lineage commitment</kwd><kwd>nodal signaling</kwd><kwd>A-P patterning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM095942</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jianlong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21-HD087722</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jianlong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004856</institution-id><institution>New York State Department of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C028103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jianlong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004856</institution-id><institution>New York State Department of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C028121</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jianlong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DK084391</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hadjantonakis</surname><given-names>Anna-Katerina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hadjantonakis</surname><given-names>Anna-Katerina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004856</institution-id><institution>New York State Department of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C029568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hadjantonakis</surname><given-names>Anna-Katerina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Irma T.

The earliest stages of mammalian development culminate in the formation of a blastocyst comprising three cell lineages: the pluripotent epiblast (Epi) which gives rise to somatic and germ cells, and two extra-embryonic lineages, the primitive endoderm (PrE) and trophectoderm (TE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schrode et al., 2013</xref>). Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from, and represent an in vitro self-renewing counterpart of, the so-called ‘naive’ pluripotent epiblast cells of the blastocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nichols and Smith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boroviak et al., 2014</xref>). Pluripotency comprises a continuum of states sequentially encompassing naive, formative and ultimately primed pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith, 2017</xref>). Upon blastocyst implantation into the maternal uterus, epiblast cells acquire characteristics of the more developmentally advanced formative and then primed states of pluripotency, which are represented by epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayashi et al., 2011</xref>) and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brons et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tesar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kojima et al., 2014</xref>), respectively. Exploiting the ability of ESCs to transition into EpiLCs/EpiSCs has advanced the mechanistic understanding of epiblast maturation. However, while in vitro studies are instrumental, it remains critical to confirm whether the insights they provide are relevant to events taking place in vivo where the only <italic>bona fide</italic> pluripotent population, the epiblast, normally exists. The transition to more developmentally advanced states of pluripotency occurs in the mouse embryo coincident with its implantation into the maternal uterus, at around embryonic day (E)4.5–5.0, and is marked by several stereotypical morphological and molecular changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bedzhov and Zernicka-Goetz, 2014</xref>). Acquisition of the primed state of pluripotency precedes the onset of gastrulation (at E6.25), the process in which the three embryonic germ layers - ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm - are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold and Robertson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takaoka and Hamada, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Key events of epiblast maturation include coordinated expression of specific transcription factors (TFs) across developmental stages. Nanog, Klf4, and Rex1 (also named Zfp42) are highly expressed in the epiblast of the blastocyst and ESCs, whereas Fgf5, Oct6 (also named Pou3f1), and Otx2 are upregulated in the epiblast following embryo implantation, or when ESCs differentiate toward EpiSCs. Factors such as Eomes or T (also named Brachyury) are expressed in gastrulating embryos at the primitive streak (the site where pluripotent cells undergo lineage differentiation) and in EpiSCs. Other pluripotency-associated TFs, such as Oct4, Sox2, and Zfp281, are expressed in the pluripotent epiblast throughout these state transitions, suggesting they may play distinct roles in different pluripotent states, or enable transitions between them. Specific DNA modifications and reorganization of enhancer landscapes also occur during the naive-to-primed transition, together with genome-wide relocation of Oct4, as well as elevated binding of Otx2 and the P300 histone acetyltransferase at enhancers of genes specific to the primed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buecker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Concomitantly, during early post-implantation embryo development, the A-P axis is established. A-P patterning is not readily recapitulated in ESC or EpiSC cultures since it necessitates cross-talk between the epiblast and its adjacent extra-embryonic tissue, the visceral endoderm (VE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen, 2007</xref>). In the mouse embryo, distal visceral endoderm (DVE) cells, specified at the late blastocyst stage as a sub-population of the PrE, are critical for A-P axis establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beddington and Robertson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takaoka and Hamada, 2012</xref>). At E5.5, DVE cells are localized at the distal tip of the embryo from where they migrate proximally towards the extra-embryonic/embryonic boundary, recruiting a second population (the anterior visceral endoderm or AVE) and defining an anterior to the embryo, thereby establishing an A-P axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stower and Srinivas, 2014</xref>). The TGF-beta ligand Nodal, which is expressed by the epiblast, and several of its pathway components, such as the left-right determination factors (Lefty1 and 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brennan et al., 2001</xref>), Cripto (also named Tdgf1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ding et al., 1998</xref>), and Foxh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamamoto et al., 2001</xref>) are required for DVE/AVE specification, migration, and A-P axis formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brons et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takaoka and Hamada, 2012</xref>). Whether epiblast maturation and A-P axis specification can be mechanistically linked remains an open question.</p><p>Zfp281 was recently identified as a TF required for the commitment of ESCs to differentiation in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Betschinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fidalgo et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we investigate pluripotent state transitions in vivo in their native context, and identify a key role for Zfp281 in early mammalian development. Mouse embryos lacking Zfp281 reach the blastocyst stage and establish a pluripotent epiblast lineage. However, they exhibit defects in epiblast maturation, indicated by the failure to robustly activate Nodal signaling and genes associated with the primed pluripotent state. Hence, they are unable to exit the naive pluripotent state, resulting in a failure to establish an A-P axis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Zfp281 functions specifically within the epiblast to coordinate the epigenetic regulators acting to initiate expression of lineage-specific genes and modulate the Nodal signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Zfp281 is expressed in early mouse embryos and required for early post-implantation development</title><p>To begin to investigate the role of Zfp281 in vivo during mouse embryonic development when the pluripotent epiblast population is established and matures, we determined the localization of the Zfp281 protein by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Zfp281 binding at regulatory regions of these Nodal signaling-related genes is biologically important, as expression of Lefty2 is downregulated by <italic>Zfp281</italic>KD in EpiSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), and many of Nodal signaling genes were perturbed in <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO EpiLCs relative to their WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), supporting a critical role of Zfp281 in transcriptional activation of Nodal signaling during the transition to primed pluripotency in vitro. To provide direct evidence that Zfp281 binds and regulates these Nodal signaling related genes in vivo, we performed ChIP experiments on E6.5 WT embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).

While the in vitro pluripotent state transition model provides a useful tool to infer how the epiblast transitions between states and prepares for germ layer differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weinberger et al., 2016</xref>), it cannot substitute for direct investigations into the transition occurring during epiblast maturation in vivo in embryos. Notably, none of the pluripotency-associated factors, for which mouse mutants are available, have described phenotypes directly associated with the exit from naive pluripotency in the embryo. Zfp281 is the first factor demonstrated to be critical in vivo for this developmental transition; its loss results in embryonic lethality due to a failure in epiblast maturation. Our data reveal that Zfp281 is concomitantly required for the initiation of expression of genes encoding Nodal signaling components and the lineage specification program during epiblast maturation. Zfp281 coordinates crosstalk among multiple epigenetic pathways through physical association with histone methylation (PRC2) and acetylation (Ep400, P300) complexes within epiblast cells. Crosstalk converges on the coordinated regulation of bivalent promoters and reorganization of enhancers leading to activation of lineage-specific genes and downregulation of pluripotency genes during the naive-to-primed transition, arguing for a master regulator status of Zfp281 in controlling key molecular events leading to epiblast maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, top panel). Accordingly, loss of Zfp281 results in a series of developmental defects within the epiblast, which non-cell-autonomously lead to a failure to establish or maintain the DVE/AVE resulting in A-P axis specification defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, bottom panel).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33333.030</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Working model for the role of Zfp281 in epiblast maturation.</title><p>Upper panel describes a working model for Zfp281 function during epiblast maturation in the post-implantation embryo.

Our combined in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated high consistency of the regulatory functions of Zfp281 on the lineage-specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, there are also some differences between our findings in embryos and those made in pluripotent stem cell models. For instance, embryo RNA-seq data indicated non-significant changes in expression of lineage markers T and Eomes between WT and <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), while their expression was markedly downregulated in <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO EpiLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This disparity could be due to EpiLC representing a pluripotent state that does not match with the embryonic stage examined for RNA-seq in embryos, and/or extra-embryonic expression, in the case of Eomes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nowotschin et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>), that is not represented in EpiLC culture. Similarly, <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO embryonic phenotypes described for the VE layer cannot be reproduced in vitro since there is no equivalent cell population in ESC/EpiSC cultures. We noted that the morphology of VE cells in <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO embryos was different from the WT and resembled their adjacent extra-embryonic VE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). As we identified that <italic>Afp</italic>, a pan-VE marker whose downregulation is coincident with the onset of gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Viotti et al., 2014</xref>), is upregulated in our mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>), we speculate that <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO embryos may also fail in VE maturation.</p><p>Furthermore, we also observed that Nodal signaling was significantly reduced in <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), whereas in EpiSCs, p-Smad2 level was not affected by <italic>Zfp281</italic>KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We speculate that this discrepancy may be attributable to the presence of Activin in the primed cell culture medium, which constitutively activates Nodal signaling. Compared to the in vitro system, crosstalk between the in vivo epiblast and its adjacent extra-embryonic tissues is dynamic and context-dependent, and unable to be precisely captured in a single defined cell culture system. Moreover, mRNA and protein levels of Oct4 and Otx2, the two factors required for reorganization of the enhancer landscape during the naive-to-primed transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buecker et al., 2014</xref>), are significantly downregulated in <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>), which may also explain why Nodal signaling fail to be activated in epiblast maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Taken together, our studies highlight the importance of direct in vivo functional investigations using mouse models to refine and/or authenticate in vitro findings of pluripotent state transitions for a better understanding of epiblast maturation.</p><p>Nodal signaling has been extensively studied in key sequential events ranging from epiblast maturation to left-right patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen, 2007</xref>). In <italic>Nodal</italic> mutant embryos, epiblast cells do not mature properly and embryos exhibit a failure in DVE/AVE establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brennan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mesnard et al., 2006</xref>). A recent study suggests that Nodal guides the transition from naive to formative pluripotency in vitro (Mulas et al., 2017). Although pluripotency factors have been reported to occupy and regulate enhancers at the <italic>Nodal</italic> locus during the ESC-to-EpiSC transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Papanayotou et al., 2014</xref>), how they contribute to lineage specification during the exit from a naive pluripotent state in vivo has remained an open question. Our work reveals that Zfp281 acts as a master regulator of epiblast maturation through the regulation of primed pluripotency genes and Nodal signaling components. Zfp281 binds the PEE, NDE, and HBE <italic>Nodal</italic> enhancers in vitro and in vivo, with binding at the HBE decreasing during epiblast maturation. In ESCs, HBE is bound by Oct4/Sox2/Nanog/Klf4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Papanayotou et al., 2014</xref>), as well as Zfp281, however neither Zfp281 nor Oct4 binds ASE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), suggesting that loss of Zfp281 binding at HBE may be a prerequisite for decommissioning the naive-specific <italic>Nodal</italic> enhancer in transitioning to the primed state. In addition, Nodal expression is reduced or not restricted proximally in <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO embryos, which could further indicate a failure in enhancer switching. Our findings are thus in agreement with the proposed switch of <italic>Nodal</italic> enhancers, from HBE to ASE, concomitant with the transition from ESCs to EpiSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Papanayotou et al., 2014</xref>). Together with the crosstalk between Zfp281 and mulitiple histone modifying complexes (PRC2/Ep400/NuRD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), our data have thus uncovered a critical role for the pluripotency factor Zfp281 in coordinating transcriptional and epigenetic control of the exit from naive pluripotency through promoter and enhancer remodeling, leading to activation of lineage-specific genes and genes encoding Nodal signaling components while embryos are progressing to a primed pluripotency state during epiblast maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>As the targets and antagonists of Nodal signaling in embryo development, <italic>Lefty</italic> genes (<italic>Lefty1</italic> and <italic>Lefty2</italic>) are sensitive to status of DNA methylation at promoters.

Our previous work indicated that Zfp281 physically interacts with Tet1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fidalgo et al., 2016</xref>), therefore Zfp281 may recruit Tet1 at <italic>Lefty1/2</italic> promotors and maintain Lefty expression, suggesting a Nodal signaling-independent role of Zfp281. Although, developmental arrest of <italic>Zfp281</italic> mutant embryos (~E6.5) precedes that of Tet-TKO (triple KO) mutants (~E7.5), and defects observed in Tet-TKO mutants were attributed to downregulation of Lefty1/2 through promoter hyper-methylation, leading to constitutive activation of the Nodal signaling pathway due to the disruption of Lefty-mediated negative-feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dai et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, these results raise the question of a possible link between Zfp281 and DNA modification for epigenetic control of proper embryonic development, which is worthy of future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains, embryo collection and staining</title><p>Mouse strains used in the study were <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fidalgo et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>Hex-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodriguez et al., 2001</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>You will see that two of the reviewers are positive and we do not disagree with the positive comments of our fellow reviewers. However, we do not think that a description of a mouse gastrulation phenotype is sufficient for publication in a high profile journal today. Our particular concern with this paper is that both parts are incomplete and are being forced together to fit a particular interpretation which may be only partly correct or even completely incorrect. To summarise briefly: the authors are working on a gene of interest in embryonic stem cell biology and here they describe a requirement for proper axis formation and gastrulation. Based on altered expression patterns in the mutant embryos they attribute this phenotype to disruption of Nodal signalling. They then provide genome location data indicating that potentially Zfp281 might regulate Nodal directly. So far, so good. What they do not go on to provide is direct evidence that Nodal or Nodal signalling are perturbed either in the embryo prior to overt phenotype manifestation or in the in vitro ES cell system. Nor do they determine which effects are cell autonomous in the epiblast. This is central to their argument that Zfp281 drives pluripotency progression. The missing experiments are straightforward for investigators of this experience and expertise and in would be expected by any developmental or stem cell biology journal and general interest journal too.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The transcription factor Zfp281 was recently shown to be a key regulator of primed pluripotency in vitro (Fidalgo et al., 2016). In this manuscript, the Wang group focuses on the role of Zfp281 in vivo, elegantly and comprehensively describing a critical requirement for Zfp281 during the earliest stages of mouse post-implantation development.</p><p>Between the pre-implantation and early post-implantation periods, Zfp281 expression resolves from a broader distribution within the blastocyst (all 3 lineages) to the egg cylinder epiblast. (There is pesky background staining with their antibody in the visceral endoderm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.) The authors next derive mice from a previously published mutant Zfp281 mouse ES cell line (Fidalgo 2011 Stem Cells). Zfp281 homozygous embryos are morphologically distinct from their WT littermates by E6.5, with a thickened distal visceral endoderm and smaller size, and do not survive beyond embryonic day (E) 8.0. Thus, the authors performed comparative RNA-seq on whole wild-type and Zfp281-/- E6.5 embryos in an effort to identify the gene networks dysregulated by loss of Zfp281. The most significantly downregulated genes in Zfp281 mutants were prominent components of the Nodal signaling pathway (e.g., Nodal itself, Foxh1, Lefty1/2) as well as genes that display specific spatiotemporal expression domains in the epiblast such as the posterior primitive streak or visceral endoderm. Posterior primitive streak markers (e.g., Fgf8, T/Bra, Nodal, Eomes) showed a &quot;radialized&quot; expression pattern by whole-mount, that is, situated proximally in the epiblast abutting the extraembryonic ectoderm. Consistent with this finding, AVE markers were rarely expressed, or only expressed at low levels in the distal visceral endoderm, which fails to migrate anteriorly. Taken together these findings indicate a failure to establish the primary anterior-posterior axis, suggesting that Zfp281 mutant embryos are stuck at the precipice to axis and lineage specification.</p><p>To determine those genes directly bound and regulated by Zfp281, the authors turned to an in vitro model of naïve (ESC) and primed (epiblast-like cells, EpiLC) pluripotency and performed Zfp281 ChIP-seq. Interestingly, the promoters of lineage-specific genes, which are typically expressed at higher levels in primed cells (EpiLC and EpiSC) than ESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), were bound by Zfp281 with greater enrichment in ESC than in EpiLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). The authors interpret these findings to mean that Zfp281 regulates lineage-specific genes during epiblast &quot;maturation.&quot; They next combined their Zfp281 ChIP-seq data with publically available binding data sets for epigenetic regulators and transcription factors. Zfp281, Ep400 and the PRC2 components Ezh2 and Suz12 have the most similar binding patterns, with Zfp281/Ep400 and Suz12 co-binding observed at bivalent genes marked by co-enrichment of active H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3. During the transition from naïve to primed pluripotency, the authors propose that there is a reduced association between Zfp281 and the PRC2 complex at bivalent promoters, resulting in decreased H3K27me3 and transcriptional activation of lineage-specific genes. Lastly, the authors revisit the role of Zfp281 and transcriptional activation of the Nodal locus and determine that Oct4 and P300 collaborate with Zfp281 to activate Nodal and is components Foxh1 and Lefty2 during epiblast &quot;maturation.&quot; Their findings support a model of enhancer switching from HBE to ASE as the epiblast exits pluripotency.</p><p>This reviewer finds the present work to be both comprehensive and insightful, certainly meriting publication in <italic>eLife</italic> and highlighting the importance of in vivo studies to more fully understand the role of Zfp281 previously described only in vitro.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript, Huang et al. characterise the function of the zinc finger protein, Zfp281, in early mouse development during exit from pluripotency, axis specification and lineage priming. Zfp281 was previously identified from ES cell screening as a potential candidate for facilitating differentiation in vitro. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the expression profile of Zfp281 in mouse embryos at significant stages around the time of implantation and gastrulation, including quantification of levels of fluorescence. They show enriched expression in the epiblast from E4.25 until early postimplantation. The knockout phenotype begins very soon after implantation, with a thickening of the visceral endoderm and reduced proliferation of the epiblast. Thereafter, the mutant embryo lacks anterior-posterior patterning with no evidence of gastrulation, explaining the absence of homozygous null embryos from E8.5. Using gene expression profiling of null versus wild type embryos the authors identify Nodal as the most affected signalling pathway in mutant embryos, with Nodal itself and its downstream targets being underrepresented in null embryos by E6.5. As expected, the perturbation of the Nodal pathway affects the anterior-posterior patterning of mutant embryos and prevents specification of the primitive streak. This was manifested by mis-regulation of Nanog, T, Eomes, FGF8, Axin2, Otx2 and Sox2, even though their total expression levels were largely unaffected. Many of the known anterior markers were lost or disrupted in mutant embryos. This explains the encroachment of primitive streak genes to the anterior epiblast in mutant embryos.</p><p>To address the mechanism of Zfp281 activity during exit from naïve pluripotency the authors used EpiLCs generated after 2 days culture of ES cells in EpiSC conditions. They used ChIP-seq to show that Zfp2981 is enriched at regulatory regions of multiple genes with both conservation and divergence between ES cells and EpiLCs, implying a dynamic role during differentiation. In particular, Zfp281 bound to early lineage genes in ES cells. Interestingly, only the enhancers and not the promoters of FGF5 and 8 were bound by Zfp281, implying both promoter dependent and independent mechanisms for its action. Zfp281 associates with specific sets of epigenetic regulators, which differ between ES cells and EpiSCs. There was also reduced chromatin occupancy at bivalent promoters for T and Eomes in mutant compared with wild type ES cells. The authors suggest that Zfp281 is actively involved in reduction of H2K27me3 during exit from pluripotency. Nodal enhancer activity was explored in ES cells and EpiSCs and confirmed to be dynamic during the transition from naïve to primed pluripotency in vitro. Direct evidence for the mechanism of action of Nodal during lineage priming in vivo was obtained by performing ChIP experiments on wild type E6.5 embryos. Zfp281 binding was observed in regulatory regions of Nodal and some of its targets affected in mutant embryos.</p><p>This study is beautifully planned, executed and presented with sufficient novel and interesting findings to enhance understanding of the mechanism of exit from pluripotency and lineage priming and the role of Nodal signalling during this process in vivo and in vitro.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this paper Huang et al. first describe the early lethality in mouse embryos deficient for Zfp281 and then apply ChIP-seq in ES cells and EpiSCs. Previous studies from Jianlong Wang have implicated Zfp281 in regulation of both ES cell self-renewal and early differentiation. Given a strong in vitro effect on ES cell differentiation there is interest in elucidating the stage, character and causality of the in vivo phenotype. In the present study the authors infer a relationship with Nodal signalling in early embryogenesis and suggest that Zfp281 lies directly upstream of Nodal itself. This would be very interesting, if proven. The latter section of the paper, comprising genome-wide analyses in ES cells and EpiSCs, is only loosely connected to the embryo phenotype and doesnot provide mechanistic data. Overall, neither component in the study is taken through to completion and the whole is rather less than the sum of the parts.

Previous studies from Jianlong Wang have implicated Zfp281 in regulation of both ES cell self-renewal and early differentiation. Given a strong in vitro effect on ES cell differentiation there is interest in elucidating the stage, character and causality of the in vivo phenotype. In the present study the authors infer a relationship with Nodal signalling in early embryogenesis and suggest that Zfp281 lies directly upstream of Nodal itself. This would be very interesting, if proven.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's interest in our work. However, we want to clarify that our data, for example our in vitroand in vivoChIP-qPCR experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D-E</xref>, support the direct binding of Zfp281 on the <italic>Nodal</italic> promoter during epiblast maturation. Ours is the first study to demonstrate direct in vivobinding at the <italic>Nodal</italic> locus. We would therefore argue that we do not <italic>per se</italic> infer a role for a relationship between Zfp281 and Nodal signaling.

These correlative in vitro and in vivo studies together forged the link to Nodal signaling, which was confirmed by performing technically challenging ChIP-qPCR experiments on embryos. We would also like to point out that our present study is one of the first to demonstrate direct binding of a transcription factor to cis-regulatory elements in vivo in mouse embryos.</p><p>We believe that the reviewer's comment that our genome-wide analyses in ES cells and EpiSCs do not provide mechanistic data explaining the embryo phenotype was unfair and unjustified. The in vitro ESC-to-EpiSC differentiation system coupled with genome-wide analyses have been widely applied in providing mechanistic understanding of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation underlying naïve-to-primed pluripotency transition (work from the Surani, Wysocka, Smith labs, as well as our own previous work).</p><p>Perhaps the most pertinent example is a study from Austin Smith's laboratory (Cambridge, UK), recently published in the journal Stem Cell Reports (Mulas et al., 2017), in which the authors utilized an in vitro ESC-to-EpiSC model and uncovered a role for Nodal in securing pluripotency upon ESC progression from the ground state. Importantly, in their Discussion, Mulas et al. concluded that &quot;Our findings point to a pivotal role for NODAL signaling in establishing formative pluripotency, in keeping with observations of a requirement for continuous NODAL activity to sustain pluripotency in the early postimplantation epiblast&quot;.</p><p>Similarly, we have also provided a careful discussion in our manuscript for how our in vitro findings may offer mechanistic insights into molecular control underlying the early postimplantation epiblast, and transitions between pluripotent states. More importantly, our data supports a model whereby Zfp281 directly binds the Nodal promoter during epiblast maturation (as shown by both our in vitro and in vivo ChIP-qPCR data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D-E</xref>), and that Nodal expression is affected by loss of Zfp281 in the embryo. We also show the direct regulation by Zfp281 of genes that need to be activated for the epiblast to properly mature.</p><p>We have added more data, as detailed below, to strengthen the statements made and hypotheses arising from our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The first section of the paper reports a gastrulation stage phenotype in Zfp281 null embryos and notes common features with Nodal mutants.

To our knowledge, Oct6 protein distribution at this stage has never been published (only WISH data were published at early post-implantation (Zhu et al., 2014) or by RNA-seq of E5.5 embryos (Kalkan et al., 2017) and as noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>, seems to be quite mosaic in embryos.</p><p>We also added WISH for Nodal at E5.5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>, showing that its expression is already downregulated in E5.5 <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO embryos when compared to WT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Conversely, it is necessary to determine whether the epiblast defects are indeed cell-autonomous, as the authors argue, or are entirely secondary to failure of the DVE and subsequent absence of AVE.

The authors report that gene expression is perturbed in EpiLCs but the protocol for generating EpiLCs involves addition of activin, so should not be affected by diminished nodal expression.</p></disp-quote><p>In accordance with the reviewer’s comments, the following additional experiments were performed to dissect the functional connection between Zfp281 and Nodal signalingin vitroin ESCs and differentiation.</p><p>Firstly, we determined the level of phospho(p-)Smad2 in WT and <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO ESCs. As shown in our new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, p</xref>-Smad2 intensity in <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO ESCs was significantly diminished compared to that observed in WT ESCs.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that endogenous Zfp281 is required for survival of EpiSCs or longterm culture of EpiLCs in primed conditions containing Activin (Fidalgo et al., 2016), suggesting that Zfp281 is important for the integrity of Nodal signaling. In this regard, we examined levels of p-Smad2 in EpiSCs with Zfp281 knockdown. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>, knockdown of Zfp281 didn’t change p-Smad2 activity in EpiSCs, probably because of the Activin in culture constitutively activates p-Smad2. However, we did observe that the expression of Lefty (using an antibody detecting both Lefty1/2) significantly decreased. This is in accordance with our ChIP-qPCR results that Zfp281 binds to <italic>Lefty2</italic> enhancer in in vitro ESCs/EpiSCs and in vivo E6.5 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, G</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we treated ESCs and EpiSCs with ALK receptor inhibitor (ALKi) specifically diminishing Smad2/Nodal signaling. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> (copied below), ALKi treatment significantly reduces pSmad2 and Lefty expression.</p><p>In summary, our new data further demonstrated the functional role of Zfp281 in regulating Nodal signaling, particularly in EipSCs with Nodal signaling activation, Zfp281 is required to transcriptionally activate Nodal and downstream target <italic>Lefty</italic> in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>To further understand the functional significance of Zfp281 in controlling the Nodal signaling pathway during embryonic development, we employed the following four in vitrodifferentiation models that relate to Activin/Nodal signaling: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) ESCs to EpiLCs; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) ESCs to primitive streak (PS)-like cells; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) ESCs to definitive endoderm (DE)-like cells; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">4</xref>) ESCs to PGCLCs.</p><p>1) With Fgf2 and Activin, ESCs can differentiate into EpiLCs representing a subsequent stage of pluripotency, and we have previously shown that <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO is not compatible with the longterm culture of EpiLCs (Fidalgo et al., 2016).</p><p>2) It is reported that Activin and GSK3β inhibitor (CHIR) promote differentiation of ESCs to primitive-streak (PS)-like cells (Tsakiridis et al., 2014). We therefore tested the role of Zfp281 in this differentiation. As shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>, we treated ESCs with Activin/CHIR, and with ALKi or Zfp281 shRNAs. Morphology of Zfp281 knockdown cells indicated a strong phenotype of differentiation resistance, which resembles that of ALKi treatment. Dome-shaped ESC-like colonies persisted in Zfp281 KD cells after Activin/CHIR treatment; a striking difference compared to control cells. RT-qPCR at different time points after treatment also indicated that the Zfp281 KD cells reproduced Nodal signaling inhibition by ALKi in terms of the expression of the PS marker gene <italic>T</italic> and the Nodal target gene <italic>Lefty2</italic> (expressed in PS).</p><p>3) Activin/Nodal activity is required forin vitro differentiation of ESCs to definitive endoderm (DE)-like cells. According to a protocol developed by Gouon-Evans et al. (Gouon-Evans et al., 2006), DE differentiation starts within 2-days of embryonic body (EB) formation (Day2) in serumfree medium, then followed by additional 2~3 days (Day4~Day5) of Activin/Nodal activation. We first confirmed that WT ESCs (J1, CJ7) can form DE-like cells in our hands, indicated by robust activation of DE marker <italic>Foxa2</italic>. We then performed DE differentiation of <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO ESCs. At Day 2 of EB formation, similar percentages of live cells were obtained, indicating that Zfp281 is dispensable in forming EBs as we previously reported (Fidalgo et al., 2011). However, significant cell death was observed upon DE differentiation (Day4~Day5) (Huang et al., manuscript under preparation). Since DE is a descendant lineage of epiblast, these data suggest that the failure of <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO ESCs to differentiate into DE may be due to an overall requirement for Zfp281 in epiblast development, which is consistent with the failure of <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO ESC in the ESC-to-EpiSC transition.</p><p>4) A recent study from Austin Smith’s lab (Cambridge, UK) has reported a role for Nodal signaling in differentiation of ESCs to Primordial Germ Cell Like Cell (PGCLC) (Mulas et al., 2017). Following the protocol of PGCLC differentiation from Mitinori Saitou’s lab (Hayashi et al., 2011), we firstly adapted WT and <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO ESCs in 2iL (2i+LIF) conditions for 2 passages (&gt;10 days), followed by 2 days of EpiLC differentiation, and 4 days in conditions promoting PGCLC formation. Both WT and <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO cells can form PGCLCs. By assaying the mRNA expression of PGC markers (<italic>Nanos3, Stella, Tfap2c, Nanog, Prdm1, Prdm14</italic>), we found that these genes generally followed a similar trend in PGCLC differentiation. Moreover, we observed that many of them exhibited higher levels of expression in <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO cells compared to WT cells, in the initial 2iL naive ESC state and the final PGCLC state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><p>These data differ from Smith’s results in which inhibition of Nodal signaling led to a reduction in the expression of PGC marker genes. However, since Activin is not used in the standard PGCLC differentiation protocol, it is still not clear how Nodal signaling can contribute to PGCLC formation. Furthermore, Mulas et al. indicated Activin treatment can rescue the Nodal KO phenotype in PGCLC formation, and speculated that expression of Gdf3, a Vg-1 homolog, may elicit a Nodal-like response (Mulas et al., 2017). In our experiments, we find PGC markers to also be expressed in naive ESCs, and we previously showed these naive markers (Nanog, Stella, Prdm14) are repressed by Zfp281 in 2iL ESCs (Fidalgo et al., 2016). These observations may, at least in part, explain the higher levels of PGC marker genes observed in <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO cells.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33333.033</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33333-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Thus, in our attempts to answer the reviewer’s question “To what extent is the Zfp281 phenotype recapitulated by inhibition and/or genetic ablation of nodal signaling”, we applied multiple in vitro differentiation protocols (EpiLC, PS, DE) from WT/<italic>Zfp281</italic>KO ESCs especially in contexts in which Activin/Nodal signaling is essential for the respective differentiation. We also showed <italic>Zfp281</italic> KD can reproduce Nodal signaling inhibition in terms of cell morphology change upon differentiation and expression of Nodal signaling targets. However, we did not directly test the outcome of <italic>Nodal</italic> KO because the function/requirement of/for Nodal has been well-studied in many of these contexts, and is outside the scope of our present study. Furthermore, even with <italic>Nodal</italic> KO cells, it has been reported that Nodal signaling is unaffected upon Activin treatment with respect to the expression of pathway target genes, for example <italic>Lefty2</italic> (Mulas et al., 2017).</p><p>In our revised manuscript, we provide these additional in vitro ES cell differentiation data to support our hypothesis that Zfp281 is required for maintaining the integrity of Nodal signaling in in vitro ESC differentiation models. For DE differentiation, it is still unclear why <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO cells fail to differentiate and instead exhibit massive cell death/apoptosis. For the ESC-to-PGCLC differentiation paradigm, we believe that the function of Nodal signaling remains ill-defined, and thus we decided not to include our DE and PGCLC data in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Previous reports from the Wang lab have asserted that Zfp281 acts via Nanog and NuRD and most recently Tets.

We are left with insufficient clarity as to how and when Zfp281 is required in vitro or in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we focus on the function of Zfp281 within the epiblast of the early post-implantation mouse embryo, and comparablein vitroexit from pluripotency and concomitant lineage gene specification. In this way, the present study is complementary to, and indeed significantly extends, our previous knowledge on Zfp281 in pluripotency (Fidalgo et al., 2012; Fidalgo et al., 2016; Fidalgo et al., 2011). In the present study we uncover two regulatory machineries in which Zfp281 has a central and critical role: Zfp281/PRC2/Ep400 on Class I (bivalent) genes, and Zfp281/PRC2/Ep400 on Class II (pluripotency) genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). We have shown Zfp281 is a repressor for pluripotency-associated genes (through NuRD) in ESCs (Fidalgo et al., 2012), we therefore focused on the role of Zfp281 on bivalent/lineage specific genes in this work. Specifically, as we state in our manuscript: &quot;The lack of association between Zfp281 and NuRD in EpiSCs may also explain why pluripotency genes including <italic>Sox2</italic> and Nanog are not regulated by Zfp281 in the epiblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, D</xref>), which is in contrast with NuRD-mediated Nanog repression in ESCs due to their physical association (Fidalgo et al. 2012).&quot;</p><p>In our (E6.5) embryo qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and immunofluorescent staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, D</xref>) data, we report no difference in Nanog expression between WT and <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO embryos, therefore we did not go on to further investigate Nanog as a target of Zfp281 at post-implantation stages. For the TET proteins, previously we showed that Zfp281 represses <italic>Tet2</italic> expression, but has no effect on <italic>Tet1</italic> (Fidalgo et al., 2016). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>, qPCR of E6.5 embryos indicated Tet1 is the highest expressed TET gene at this stage, while Tet2 exhibits highly reduced expression. We confirmed that Tet1 expression is not affected in <italic>Zfp281</italic>KO embryos, whereas Tet2 is appreciably upregulated. Moreover, Zfp281 physically interacts with Tet1 (but not Tet2), suggesting Zfp281/Tet1 may have similar function on their target genes (Fidalgo et al., 2016). Previously, Anjana Rao’s group (La Jolla, USA) reported that Tet1 is required for the demethylation of the <italic>Lefty1</italic> promoter in ESCs (Koh et al., 2011). More recently, a study from Guoliang Xu’s group (Shanghai, China) suggested that TET proteins are essential for the demethylation of <italic>Lefty</italic> promoters in vivo before the onset of gastrulation (Dai et al., 2016). Both these studies are supportive of our data reporting Zfp281 as an upstream regulator of the Nodal signaling pathway. The fact that Zfp281 is a key transcription factor that can not only coordinate the opposing functions of Tet1 and Tet2 during the naive-to-primed transition in vitro (Fidalgo et al., 2016), but also directly bind and control <italic>Nodal</italic> enhancer elements justifies referring to it as a master regulator.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33333.034</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33333-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>Thus, we have provided explanations/coherent synthesis on these different mechanisms and their relative significance.
