orchestrated by the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex. AP2 dwells in a closed, inactive state in the cytosol, but adopts an open, active conformation on the plasma membrane. Membrane-activated complexes are also phosphorylated, but the significance of this mark is debated. We recently proposed that NECAP negatively regulates AP2 by binding open and phosphorylated complexes (Beacham et al., 2018). Here, we report high-resolution cryo-EM structures of NECAP bound to phosphorylated AP2. The site of AP2 phosphorylation is directly coordinated by residues of the NECAP PHear domain that are predicted from genetic screens in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Using membrane mimetics to generate conformationally open AP2, we find that a second domain of NECAP binds these complexes and cryo-EM reveals both domains of NECAP engaging closed, inactive AP2. Assays in vitro and in vivo confirm these domains cooperate to inactivate AP2. We propose that phosphorylation marks adaptors for inactivation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>clathrin adaptor</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>NECAP</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>genetic screen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM127548-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hollopeter</surname><given-names>Gunther</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-#2285-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>Richard W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1650441</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beacham</surname><given-names>Gwendolyn M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-EM reveals how a protein called NECAP inactivates the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex through concerted engagement of two domains which confer specificity for membrane-activated and phosphorylated AP2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis (CME) enables cells to dynamically regulate the composition of the plasma membrane and mediate uptake of transmembrane cargo, such as ligand-bound receptors. This process is orchestrated by the clathrin Adaptor Protein two complex (AP2), which interacts with much of the endocytic machinery and functions during the earliest stages of CME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>). Inactive, closed AP2 is initially recruited to the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane through its interaction with PhosphatidylInositol-4,5-bisPhosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Höning et al., 2005</xref>). At the plasma membrane, conformational rearrangement of AP2 to an active, open conformation is promoted by membrane-associated muniscin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hollopeter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Umasankar et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Conversion of AP2 to the open conformation exposes a second binding site for PIP<sub>2</sub> that stabilizes membrane engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kadlecova et al., 2017</xref>), and also reveals binding sites for clathrin and membrane-embedded cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kelly et al., 2014</xref>).

Some data suggest that phosphorylation of AP2 enhances binding to PIP<sub>2</sub> and cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fingerhut et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Höning et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ricotta et al., 2002</xref>). Additionally, mutation of the phosphorylated threonine (mu T156A) or addition of kinase inhibitors have been shown to inhibit transferrin uptake in tissue culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Olusanya et al., 2001</xref>), implying that phosphorylation promotes AP2 activity. Two kinases have been shown to phosphorylate AP2 (mu T156) in vitro: AP2-Associated Kinase (AAK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conner and Schmid, 2002</xref>) and cyclin-G associated kinase (GAK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Umeda et al., 2000</xref>). Curiously, studies involving these kinases suggest that phosphorylation may function in an inactivation pathway, as AAK1 appears to inhibit endocytosis using in vitro assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conner and Schmid, 2002</xref>), and GAK seems to function in vesicle uncoating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>). Whether phosphorylation is an activating or inactivating mark, and whether it functions in multiple stages in the endocytic pathway remains to be determined.</p><p>While the pathways of clathrin adaptor activation have been well characterized both structurally and biochemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kelly et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jia et al., 2014</xref>), it is unknown whether inactivation of AP2 is also a regulated process. Adaptor inactivation likely occurs throughout the endocytic cycle. High-resolution imaging reveals that many endocytic pits abort prematurely, presumably when a requirement for activation is unmet, such as an absence of PIP<sub>2</sub>, cargo, or muniscin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kadlecova et al., 2017</xref>). Abortive events could represent a mechanism to limit futile vesicle formation in the absence of cargo or prevent ectopic budding from off-target membranes lacking PIP<sub>2</sub>. Additionally, when adaptors are removed from vesicles prior to fusion with target organelles, they must also revert to the cytosolic, inactive state. Adaptor uncoating appears to require PIP<sub>2</sub> phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cremona et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2017</xref>), but it is not known whether PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis is sufficient to uncoat AP2, as cytosol and ATP are required in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hannan et al., 1998</xref>). It remains to be determined whether adaptor inactivation occurs via stochastic disassembly of endocytic pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ehrlich et al., 2004</xref>), or if it is driven by regulated mechanisms, such as an endocytic checkpoint to ensure cargo incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loerke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Puthenveedu and von Zastrow, 2006</xref>).</p><p>We recently found that NECAP appears to act as a negative regulator of AP2 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beacham et al., 2018</xref>). NECAP is a coat-associated protein that binds to the alpha appendage and beta linker regions of AP2 to facilitate endocytic accessory protein recruitment to sites of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ritter et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ritter et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ritter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ritter et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, loss of the muniscin, <italic>fcho-1</italic>, causes AP2 to dwell in an inactive, closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hollopeter et al., 2014</xref>). Deletion of the gene encoding NECAP (<italic>ncap-1</italic>) in <italic>fcho-1</italic> mutants restores AP2 to an active, open and phosphorylated state, suggesting that NECAP counterbalances AP2 activation. Consistent with this model, NECAP binds open and phosphorylated AP2 complexes in vitro, however it is unclear how NECAP recognizes the open and phosphorylated states and whether NECAP can directly close these complexes.</p><p>Here, we determined cryo-EM structures of NECAP-AP2 complexes which show that NECAP clamps AP2 complexes into the closed, inactive conformation. This mechanism requires coincident binding of two domains of NECAP, one of which confers specificity for open complexes, and another that detects AP2 phosphorylation. Our structures are supported by in vitro biochemistry along with functional assays and unbiased genetic screens in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Importantly, the site of AP2 phosphorylation is directly bound by NECAP, defining phosphorylation as a key step in the dynamic regulation of AP2 inactivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structural basis for recognition of phosphorylated AP2 by NECAP</title><p>We previously demonstrated that NECAP binds to the phosphorylated AP2 core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beacham et al., 2018</xref>). NECAP is a ~ 29 kDa, soluble protein composed of three domains: an N-terminal <underline>P</underline>leckstrin <underline>H</underline>omology with <underline>ear</underline>-like function (NECAP<sub>PHear</sub>), a central <underline>Ex</underline>tended region of conservation (NECAP<sub>Ex</sub>), and a C-terminal domain with low conservation (NECAP<sub>Tail</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ritter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ritter et al., 2013</xref>). While there are two paralogues of NECAP in vertebrates, we have previously shown that they function equivalently to bind phosphorylated and open AP2 complexes in vitro and rescue loss of NECAP in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beacham et al., 2018</xref>). In this work, we use human or mouse NECAP2 for all experiments because of their ease of purification and stability. To narrow down which domain of NECAP binds phosphorylated AP2, we performed in vitro pulldown assays using NECAP truncations and phosphorylated AP2 cores lacking appendages (phosphoAP2; rodent; boxed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our analysis showed that NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> is necessary and sufficient to bind phosphorylated AP2 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Phosphorylation is thought to stabilize the open conformation of AP2 and we previously showed that NECAP can bind open AP2 that is not phosphorylated. To understand whether NECAP binds to the site of phosphorylation or a conformation induced by phosphorylation, we determined a ~ 3.2 Å cryo-EM structure of the phosphorylated AP2 core bound to full-length NECAP2 (mouse; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Globally, AP2 has adopted a conformation similar to the crystal structure of the closed complex (PDB 2VGL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2002</xref>), which is inactive due to the occlusion of binding sites for cargo and the plasma membrane. We observe density for the entire AP2 core, with additional density contacting the mu subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Most of this additional density can be attributed to NECAP<sub>PHear</sub>, due to similarity with a solution NMR structure of the mouse NECAP1 PHear domain (PDB 1TQZ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ritter et al., 2007</xref>). The remaining unassigned density at this interface extends from the amino terminus of residue 159 of mu, and can be attributed to the phosphorylated mu linker (amino acids 154–158, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The register leading up to this new density is based on a previous crystal structure (PDB 2VGL), and is confirmed by the positions of several landmark residues near T156 that fit the density well. A detailed schematic for building the critical T156 residue in our model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. Our structure is of sufficient quality to build a near-complete molecular model for the phosphoAP2-NECAP complex, which shows that residues in NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> interact directly with the phosphorylated mu T156 (pT156; see Figure 3B below). These data show that the phosphorylated complex can exist in a closed conformation and suggest that the mechanism of NECAP binding to open complexes that are not phosphorylated must be fundamentally different.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50003.006</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM data collection, refinement, and

NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> and its interaction with mu pT156 is central to the function of NECAP. To test this hypothesis, we turned to <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where we devised a genetic strategy to specifically isolate critical residues required for NECAP interaction with AP2, while avoiding mutations that destabilize the NECAP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This screen was based on our previous screen for mutations that suppressed the morphological and fitness defects of <italic>fcho-1</italic> mutants and restored the active, open state of AP2. In the original screen, the predominant mutations identified were either gain-of-function mutations in AP2 subunits that destabilize the closed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hollopeter et al., 2014</xref>) or null mutations in the gene encoding NECAP, <italic>ncap-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beacham et al., 2018</xref>). To identify rare mutations that specifically disrupt the functional interface between AP2 and NECAP, we repeated the screen with a fluorescent tag on NECAP to enable secondary classification of suppressed animals based on fluorescent hallmarks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Because gain of function mutations in AP2 result in NECAP recruitment to the nerve ring, a membranous tissue with a high concentration of AP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beacham et al., 2018</xref>), we visually eliminated suppressed animals that had fluorescent nerve rings. We also eliminated suppressed animals that were no longer fluorescent, as these likely harbored null mutations in NECAP. We reasoned that the remaining animals, which suppressed <italic>fcho-1</italic> phenotypes without altering the fluorescent signal, might possess missense mutations that prevented NECAP from binding AP2. Worms that met these requirements were selected, and the genes encoding NECAP and AP2 were sequenced. We isolated mutations in NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> and AP2 mu that were previously proposed to disrupt NECAP-AP2 interaction, as well as new potential interface mutations in the AP2 alpha and beta subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Strikingly, the overwhelming majority of mutations (8 out of 13) isolated were in mu T156, suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue generates the substrate for NECAP activity.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50003.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Genetic screen for NECAP-AP2 interface mutations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of genetic screen to identify residues important for AP2-NECAP binding.

Mutations of T156 itself disable phosphorylation completely, and the two residues in NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> (A32 and S87) lie within 10 Å of mu T156, which suggests that they disrupt coordination of the phosphate group and explains how they might break the AP2-NECAP interaction in vivo (throughout the text, all residue numbers are for vertebrate proteins, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> for <italic>C. elegans</italic> equivalents). We also noticed that NECAP R112 forms electrostatic interactions with the T156 phosphorylation mark and may be required for binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To test the hypothesis that coordination of mu T156 phosphorylation is necessary for NECAP function, we introduced these mutations into recombinant vertebrate complexes and <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains and tested each using a panel of in vitro and in vivo assays. A bona fide interface mutant should reduce the function of NECAP in multiple assays, but not necessarily to the same degree in every assay.

Consistent with the screen, the mutations suppressed the morphological and fitness defects of <italic>fcho-1</italic> mutants, as quantified by the number of days for a population to expand and consume a food source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). It is worth noting that mutation of R112 did not fully suppress the fitness defect, and thus would likely not have been isolated from our genetic screen. Additionally, chemical mutagenesis favors cytosine to thymine DNA transitions, thus disfavoring charge reversal of R112. Nonetheless, all three mutations reduced NECAP recruitment to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nerve ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and resulted in accumulation of open AP2 complexes according to an in vivo protease sensitivity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Together, our data show that NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> binding to the phosphorylated threonine dictates AP2 inactivation.</p><p>While the AP2-NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> interface is clearly important for inactivation, our cryo-EM structure does not explain why. NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> only contacts the mu subunit of AP2, and there are no clashes when mu-NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> is modeled as a rigid body into the crystal structure of open AP2 (PDB 2XA7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> does not block cargo- or PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding sites and no obvious steric clashes would prevent AP2 from transitioning between open and closed states when bound to NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). One feature that might prevent NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> binding to the open conformation is that mu T156 is packed against the beta subunit of AP2 in this structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that release and phosphorylation of the mu linker are important regulatory steps in NECAP recruitment. Nonetheless, while NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> is required to inactivate AP2, binding of NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> alone does not explain inactivation. Because mutations in NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> do not disrupt binding to open, non-phosphorylated AP2 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beacham et al., 2018</xref>), we believe another domain of NECAP may contribute to its function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Membrane mimetics stimulate opening of AP2</title><p>To understand how NECAP recognizes open AP2 in the absence of phosphorylation, we needed to control and measure the conformation of AP2 in vitro. We used structural data to engineer a protease site on AP2 that is preferentially cleaved in the open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilar et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hollopeter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsui and Kirchhausen, 1990</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and introduced a mutation in the mu subunit (mu E302K) that is known to promote the open conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hollopeter et al., 2014</xref>). Despite this mutation, our AP2 complexes remained largely protease insensitive (i.e. closed) in the absence of other factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To produce open AP2, we turned to the observation that binding of AP2 to cargo is dramatically stimulated by the addition of long chain heparin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). Long anionic polymers are hypothesized to mimic negatively-charged PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes. To test whether these types of negatively charged macromolecules could affect AP2 conformation, we included them in our protease sensitivity assay. Indeed, two anionic polymers, heparin and nucleic acids, generated protease-sensitive complexes, suggesting that they stimulated a conformational rearrangement of AP2 to the open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, the PIP<sub>2</sub> mimetic, inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), blocks the stimulatory effect of DNA on AP2, and is not sufficient to open the complex itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), consistent with the model that open AP2 is stabilized by simultaneous engagement of multiple PIP<sub>2</sub> binding sites by a contiguous polyanionic substrate.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50003.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Membrane mimetics stimulate opening of AP2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of protease sensitivity assay.

In contrast to other AP2 (mu E302K) complexes incubated with DNA, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and E</xref>), AP2 was not open, but was in a closed, inactive conformation. As in our previous phosphoAP2-NECAP structure, NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> was bound to the mu subunit, coordinating pT156. However, in this new structure we observed additional density contacting the beta subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Comparing isosurface threshold levels of the unsharpened, refined map clearly shows that this density is contiguous and extends from the C-terminus of NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting it represents NECAP<sub>Ex</sub>. Because we cannot assign a definitive sequence register to the NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> density in this structure, we model the most ordered region as a poly-alanine peptide. We believe this structure may represent a post-open, inactive conformation of the AP2 complex, corresponding to phospho-AP2 simultaneously bound by NECAP and partially engaged with the membrane via the PIP<sub>2</sub> pocket on the alpha subunit. We refer to this structure as ‘clamped’ phosphoAP2-NECAP.</p><p>While NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> appears to make extensive contact with the beta subunit of AP2 in this structure, the differences in AP2 conformation that might account for the appearance of the NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> binding site are subtle (relative to that lacking DNA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, which we refer to as ‘unclamped’ phosphoAP2-NECAP). The region with the greatest structural changes is the alpha-beta interface, with several helices in the C-terminus of alpha shifting ~1–3 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, an alpha helix in beta that is part of the Ex domain binding site appears to partially melt when the Ex domain is bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Ordered density for DNA is not seen at any of the known PIP<sub>2</sub> binding sites, consistent with observations that PIP<sub>2</sub> binding sites are not ordered pockets but rather a collection of basic residues that protrude into the solvent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Owen et al., 2004</xref>). Notably, phosphoAP2-NECAP binds to the single-stranded DNA construct used in this experiment with an affinity of ~60 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that our sample is &gt;95% bound to DNA at the concentrations used to make cryo-EM grids (3 μM protein, 15 μM DNA). Importantly, only the PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site on the alpha N-terminus is solvent-exposed in the clamped conformation, so the structural consequences of membrane engagement are fundamentally different in the open (several exposed membrane binding sites) versus the closed (a single membrane binding site) conformations.</p><p>After our cryo-EM structure revealed the NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> binding site, we sought to understand the functional consequences of this interaction. Intriguingly, our genetic screen provided an unexpected insight, as it identified two mutations in the AP2 alpha and beta subunits that escape inactivation by NECAP and are in close proximity to the NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Purified AP2 complexes with these mutations have reduced affinity for NECAP in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Additionally, mutation of the most conserved residues of the NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> domain results in loss of binding to open AP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ritter et al., 2013</xref>). All three of these mutations recapitulate the NECAP knockout phenotype in our in vivo fitness assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), imaging assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), and protease sensitivity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

Previous work in vertebrate tissue culture suggests that NECAP<sub>Tail</sub> mediates binding of AP2 through the alpha appendage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ritter et al., 2003</xref>). However, NECAP<sub>Tail</sub> is poorly conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and is dispensable for activity in our assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beacham et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that we have found an additional and perhaps more ancient activity of NECAP, by which the conserved NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> and NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> domains cooperate to stabilize the closed conformation of AP2 in a three-step cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). First, AP2 complexes are recruited to the plasma membrane where PIP<sub>2</sub> and other activators induce the opening and stabilization of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Höning et al., 2005</xref>). Next, NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> recognizes open AP2 complexes and binds to the beta subunit, placing NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> close to AP2 at a high local concentration. Finally, after AP2 phosphorylation, NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> engages the mu subunit of AP2 to clamp the complex in a state resistant to activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our data confirm this complex is closed despite the otherwise activating signal of membrane mimetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and is resistant to proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Importantly, this inactivation cycle has a strong dependence on phosphorylation of AP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that inactivation of AP2 is a tightly regulated mechanism.</p><p>In general, data from our vertebrate and <italic>C. elegans</italic> systems are consistent, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of the NECAP-AP2 interaction. However, some of the incongruities in our data show the limitations of translating results between model systems. For example, mutation of R112 in NECAP<sub>Phear</sub> is less disruptive than mutation of mu T156, despite R112 directly coordinating pT156 in our cryoEM structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). It is possible that R112 is not the sole determinant for NECAP binding, and that other residues also aide in coordinating pT156. Indeed, NECAP R89 lies only 5 Å from mu pT156, suggesting that it may also contribute to coordination of the phosphorylation mark. Additionally, we find that the R112 mutation appears less potent in our <italic>C. elegans</italic> assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>) than in pulldowns using vertebrate proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) possibly due to evolutionary variance in how NECAP recognizes the phosphate on AP2. Also, mutations that disrupt NECAP binding to phosphoAP2, such as mu T156A, do not fully abolish recruitment of NECAP to AP2 in our nerve ring assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). It is possible that NECAP<sub>Phear</sub> binding to phosphoAP2 is not a major determinant of NECAP binding in vivo. The residual level of NECAP enrichment could be due to an additional interface between NECAP and AP2, such as NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> with AP2 beta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) or NECAP<sub>Tail</sub> with the AP2 alpha ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ritter et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, we have proposed an additional interface in our phosphoAP2-NECAP ‘clamped’ structure obtained in the presence of nucleic acids, in which we observed density contacting AP2 beta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The resolution of our structure (~3.5 Å) is not sufficient to unambiguously assign this density to NECAP, but we believe this density is NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> for several reasons. First, at low isosurface thresholding, the C-terminus of NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> appears continuous with the new density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, the surface of AP2 beta in contact with this new density is negatively charged and unlikely to bind polyanions such as DNA. Third, an unbiased genetic screen to identify mutations that reduce activity and binding of NECAP in vivo produced two mutations in AP2 that lie beneath this new density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). However, there still exists the possibility that the density we assign to NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> actually represents DNA or a portion of NECAP bound to DNA.</p><p>If one assumes that our interpretation of the ‘clamped’ structure is correct, then most of our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) is directly supported by cryo-EM structures. An exception is the depiction of NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> interacting with an open, unphosphorylated AP2 complex. We have not resolved a structure for this complex, and instead propose its existence based on biochemical and in vivo data. AP2 complexes that have been incubated with polyanion membrane mimetics adopt an open conformation according to protease sensitivity and cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We observe that NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> binds these complexes in the absence of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We propose that this AP2-NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> complex occurs early in the AP2 cycle for two main reasons. First, the active state of AP2 appears to induce phosphorylation in vivo, suggesting that AP2 opens on the membrane prior to phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hollopeter et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> can engage open AP2 complexes before phosphorylation and subsequent NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> binding. Second, NECAP is observed early at sites of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>) and can be incorporated into the coat, apparently without inhibiting pit assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sochacki et al., 2017</xref>). A priming interaction of NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> with activated AP2 is consistent with these observations; initially, NECAP is not competent to inactivate AP2, but is poised to do so later in the cycle, after phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>While we have uncovered new molecular details of how an endocytic regulator can inactivate the AP2 complex, how this process is controlled both spatially and temporally remains an open question. One possibility is that NECAP action is dictated by the timing of AP2 kinase recruitment or activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jackson et al., 2003</xref>) and that AP2 complexes become inactivated by NECAP immediately upon phosphorylation. Another possibility is that NECAP cannot inactivate stabilized AP2 complexes, but only complexes that are not yet fully initiated, thereby serving as a quality control mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ehrlich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Puthenveedu and von Zastrow, 2006</xref>). However, NECAP is reported at endocytic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sochacki et al., 2017</xref>) coincident with the arrival of clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that NECAP may act later in the endocytic cycle, after AP2 activation. More speculatively, it is possible that clathrin adaptor inactivation may be involved in vesicle uncoating, as closed AP2 complexes cannot interact with cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>) and a clathrin-binding motif on the beta hinge is occluded in this conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kelly et al., 2014</xref>). The results of this study do not distinguish whether NECAP acts early in endocytosis to promote productive pit formation by limiting aberrant events, or late in the endocytic cycle to uncoat AP2 and allow the complex to initiate new pits. Regardless of when NECAP acts, AP2 must release NECAP and be dephosphorylated to regenerate the steady-state cytosolic pool. It remains to be determined whether NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> must disengage prior to dephosphorylation, or whether a phosphatase plays a role in NECAP removal from closed complexes.</p><p>During review of this manuscript, another study involving AP2, NECAP, and the role of phosphorylation was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wrobel et al., 2019</xref>). This study reports a solution structure of NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> bound to a fragment of the phosphorylated mu linker (AA 149–163) that agrees with our cryo-EM structures. Their data supports the notion that phosphorylation is a key determinant in the timing and action of NECAP in the AP2 regulatory cycle, a finding generally consistent with this study. However, Wrobel et al. propose an activating role for AP2 phosphorylation and NECAP, which directly counters our model for NECAP action.</p><p>It is also not clear whether NECAP has functions apart from regulation of AP2. For example, the phosphorylated threonine of the AP2 mu subunit is conserved on the mu subunit of AP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghosh and Kornfeld, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heldwein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ren et al., 2013</xref>) and NECAP has been proposed to both interact with and control AP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chamberland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ritter et al., 2004</xref>).

Using combined structural, biochemical and worm-based approaches, an appealing model for AP2 mu2 adaptin phosphorylation and NECAP binding in returning AP-2 to the closed conformation is proposed. The quality of the data is high. The work is nicely presented and documents of five substantial advances:</p><p>1) Cryo-EM structures of recombinant phosphorylated AP2 core bound to NECAP2 as well as to the non-phosphorylated open form of AP2.</p><p>2) The formulation and use of various polymeric negatively charged membrane mimetics to dissect NECAP-AP2 interactions.</p><p>3) The identification that the middle &quot;Ex&quot; region of NECAP recognizes the membrane bound open AP2 core without a requirement for phosphorylation.</p><p>4) A bivalency model for AP2 closure based upon the data collected.</p><p>5) The description that the NECAP clamped AP2 structure functionally deactivates all but the α adaptin PIP2 binding sites.</p><p>Together, this provides important and novel structural insight into the conformational changes needed for AP2 function.</p><p>Because of the rather limited Discussion section, my concerns are more at the level of interpretation and explanation than with the primary data itself. In the Introduction, the authors indicate AP2 inactivation may also regulate abortive events, but do not clearly explain this at the end in light of the structural findings. They do not seriously consider why NECAP is recruited to CCPs quite early, as seen in time-resolved live cell imaging and clearly a steady-state component of bulk CCPs; they vacillate between this being possibly related to abortive disassembly or perhaps indicative of a role later in CME. They do not discuss how multiple site bound NECAP detaches from the locked state to allow dephosphorylation, which must explain the bulk cytosolic population of AP-2 that is closed but dephosphorylated. In other words, they do not explore why NECAP is not bound stoichiometrically to the cytosolic pool of closed AP2.</p><p>As far as I can follow, the authors used mouse NECAP2 for their studies. However, there is published data that show NECAP2 is unnecessary for CME, that NECAP1 and -2 have functionally diverged (cannot rescue knockdown of the other paralog), and that NECAP2 instead regulates AP1 during endosomal recycling. Better justification/rationalization of the choice of NECAP2 is required.</p><p>There are now three reports of inherited NECAP1 mutations associated with human neurological disease, and also a reported disease-associated NECAP1 mutation in dogs. How these mutations are related to the structural functional findings in this works should be addressed for the general reader.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Partlow et al. report cryoEM structures of the phosphorylated AP-2 complex bound to its regulator, NECAP. AP-2 is thought to cycle between a &quot;closed&quot;, inhibited conformation in the cytosol and an &quot;open&quot;, membrane-bound state during endocytosis. AP-2 is phosphorylated, but whether phosphorylation promotes AP-2 opening and endocytosis-or AP-2 closing to inhibit endocytosis-remains controversial. A subset of these authors proposed previously that NECAP, a negative regulator of endocytosis, binds to phosphorylated and open-conformation AP-2-and this hypothesis motivated their current cryoEM structural study of NECAP-bound and phosphorylated AP-2. Combined with an impressive set of genetic observations and biochemical binding experiments, this study could clarify NECAP's role in regulating endocytosis through regulatory phosphorylation. However, in its current form the manuscript is confusing and makes what seem like unwarranted leaps in interpretation.</p><p>1) At this average resolution, and from the figures presented, I am not yet confident in the model building for AP-2 mu, especially Thr156-Phospho. Would the authors be willing to provide the experimental maps and models for direct inspection? Do the cryoEM maps allow for unambiguous assignment of the amino acid register for AP2 mu subunit residues 154-158? Are the two phospho maps, phosphoAP2-NECAP-DNA 'clamped' versus phosphoAP2-NECAP closed consistent in this region, and do independent modeling efforts cross-validate?</p><p>2) Related to point 1, there seem to be mismatches between the structure-based mutagenesis (where R112 plays a major role in coordinating the phosphate), the genetic assays, and the protease sensitivity assay. Specifically, R112 (R109 in worms) was not found as a genetic hit, while A32 (A29 in worms), which is rather far away and not obviously involved in Thr156-phospho binding, was found genetically along with S87 (S84 in worms). S87N and R112E phenocopy in the mouse-based protein pulldown experiment, moreover, but in worms scored for fitness S84N does NOT phenocopy R109E. In the worm nerve ring localization experiment, NECAP R109E and S84N DO phenocopy. Finally, in the protease sensitivity assay, R109E does NOT phenocopy S84N or AP-2 mu T160A. Together with my uncertainty about the register for the structural model, it is unclear to me how to synthesize these observations into an internally consistent model.</p><p>3) The use of polyanion membrane mimetics to stabilize conformationally &quot;open&quot; AP-2 lead to further confusion. Specifically, the authors argue that their protease sensitivity assay and 2D class averages reveal how polyanions promote the formation of an open AP-2 complex (although we never see this open state in 3D). They propose that NECAP binds this open state, selectively, in the presence of anions like heparin. Their 3D cryoEM of supposedly activated AP-2 bound to ssDNA and NECAP, however, is of a closed conformation AP-2 that the authors refer to as &quot;post-open.&quot; This seems like an unwarranted leap since the structure of the closed-state AP-2 that resolves the NECAPPHEAR domain looks very similar to the structure of the closed-state AP-2 with both NECAPPHEAR and NECAPExTail resolved. Rather, it seems NECAP binds and stabilizes the AP-2 closed state with or without polyanions, and it's hard to know why new, hard-to-interpret cryoEM density resolves in the ssDNA-incubated state. Overall, I am not yet convinced that NECAP binds &quot;open&quot; AP-2 and do not see how the structures reveal NECAPExTail &quot;specificity for open complexes&quot;. The cartoon model in Figure 7C illustrates presumed states that are not based on these NECAP-bound structures: the ExTail domain binding to an &quot;open&quot; but not phosphorylated AP-2, and both the PHEAR and ExTail domains bound to an &quot;open&quot; and membrane-associated AP-2.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A structural mechanism for phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of the AP2 complex&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior and Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>The reviewer was convinced by your response to the initial round of comments. He had a few remaining issues however, and we agreed that if you address these directly in a revised discussion (as possible limitations, whether you think they are likely or not), we would be happy to present your story as an <italic>eLife</italic> Research Advance.</p><p>The reviewer wrote, &quot;I am convinced that the structural models that include phospho-Thr156 are sound and that the structure of NECAP bound to this moiety is an important advance.</p><p>The rest of my comments are, admittedly, nit-picking. I raise them for discussion, not to stand in the way of publishing an interesting study. First, I remain concerned that the functional tests of the structural model were somewhat inconsistent, as I noted previously. Yes, the assays are very different and have different sensitivities and dynamic ranges. But it is still puzzling that the R109E mutant looks more-or-less indistinguishable from WT in the rescue experiments of Figure 3E-F, while mutating Thr156 (160 in the worm) is a clear loss-of-function in 3F, but not in 3E.&quot; Please discuss.</p><p>&quot;…Also, I remain concerned about the experiments that rely on anionic polymers to mimic PIP2-containing membranes. The authors may be right, DNA and heparin may be transiently inducing structural changes that are akin to membrane-induced opening, but does it follow from this premise that inositol hexakisphosphate should block the effect of these mimetics on AP2? If heparin, RNA and DNA work, why doesn't IP6 also work to open the complex? Because purifying AP2 required high ionic strength solutions (500mM to 1M), but the binding studies done with heparin were done at 150mM NaCl, perhaps non-specific electrostatic &quot;stickiness&quot; may be confounding? A less interesting interpretation of the &quot;post-open&quot; clamped structure is that the new density is non-specifically bound DNA or some combination of a portion of the Ex domain and DNA.&quot; Please discuss.</p><p>Finally, please include the Molprobity and Clashscore percentiles as well as the absolute scores, as requested previously.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50003.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the reviewers would be in favor of presentation of the story in eLife if you are able to address the concerns of reviewer #2.

This shows the docking of the AP2 crystal structure and the 5 residues we built into the new density in our cryoEM map.</p><p>In summary, the register of the mu linker is built from an earlier crystal structure of AP2 (PDB 2VGL). This structure is highly congruent with our pAP2-NECAP cryoEM map (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Additionally, AP2 has been crystallized many times (PDB 2VGL, PDB 2XA7, PDB 2JKR, PDB 4UQI) and all of these models have an identical register in the mu linker region (residues 159-168). Thus, we are confident in the register of mu starting at residue I159. To build our model of the phosphorylated mu linker, we only had to build Q158 and G157 to reach the critical pT156 residue. We hope we have shown this clearly in our new figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). We have also added text to the manuscript to clarify these points and direct readers to the new figure.</p><p>Results: “The register leading up to this new density is based on a previous crystal structure (PDB 2VGL), and is confirmed by the positions of several landmark residues near T156 that fit the density well. A detailed schematic for building the critical T156 residue in our model is shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 3.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My other comments may be harder to address. Given the uncertainty around the modeling of Thr156, their combination of protease accessibility, worm fitness, localization microscopy, and genetic suppressors, altogether, leaves some room for doubt.”</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the varying effect of our mutants across our assays is potentially confusing. We have added language in the main text to clarify this point.</p><p>Results: “A bona fide interface mutant should reduce the function of NECAP in multiple assays, but not necessarily to the same degree in every assay. This is because each assay exhibits a different linear range, and point mutations may affect <italic>C. elegans</italic> and vertebrate proteins differently.”</p><p>Results: “It is worth noting that mutation of R112 did not fully suppress the fitness defect, and thus would likely not have been isolated from our genetic screen. Additionally, chemical mutagenesis favors cytosine to thymine DNA transitions, thus disfavoring charge reversal of R112.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Finally, the use of 2D cryoEM class averages to support their claim of an induced open state does not convince me. If they have an open state in solution due to interactions with polyanions, they should be able to resolve it in 3D, not just in 2D.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>3D reconstructions of open AP2 complexes in the presence of DNA oligo are shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1B. Unfortunately, incubation with DNA causes AP2 complexes to have an extreme preferred orientation in the grid, likely due to exposed hydrophobic regions that interact with the air-water interface. This severely limits the resolution of 3D reconstructions. Nonetheless, we can resolve 3D complexes to 7-10 Å resolution, sufficient to distinguish open and closed complexes.</p><p>We have added a new panel to Figure 4—figure supplement 1 which quantifies the 3D classification of complexes into open or closed states and corroborates the results obtained using analysis of 2D classes. The following details were added to the manuscript, and clarifying changes were made to “2D and 3D classification of ‘open’ versus ‘closed’ AP2 complexes” in the “Quantification and Statistical Analysis” section.</p><p>Results: “Similar values are calculated when 3D classification is used (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C).”</p><p>Method details: “After this initial cleaning step, each particle set was randomly split into 10 subsets and subjected to 2D and 3D classification. […] Quantification of particles in the ‘open’ vs. ‘closed’ conformation is described in the following section.”</p><p>Figure 4—figure supplement 1 legend: “(C) Quantification of 3D classification. Four datasets were analyzed and the percentage of particles that classified into open or closed 3D classes were quantified and plotted.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We would welcome a revised manuscript that addresses these issues and/or clarifies the conclusions so that there is no confusion for readers. We hope you will find these comments constructive, and I include the details to help guide your revision process.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for including the detailed reviewers comments, which we have found helpful in clarifying and improving our manuscript, especially the Discussion. Below is our response to specific reviewer comments.</p><p>We have added a paragraph to the Discussion to better explain our model figure, specifically the open AP2-NECAP complex we propose for which we have not resolved a 3D structure. This complex is poorly behaved in solution, and we have been unable to produce concentrated samples for cryo-EM. In addition, micrographs of grids prepared using low concentration samples have not produced classifiable particles. Nonetheless, we believe there is sufficient evidence to propose this structure and place it early in our model.</p><p>Discussion: “The model in Figure 7 depicts NECAP first interacting with an open, unphosphorylated AP2 complex through the NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> domain. […] A priming interaction of NECAP<sub>Ex</sub> with activated AP2 is consistent with these observations; initially, NECAP is not competent to inactivate AP2, but is poised to do so later in the cycle, after phosphorylation (Figure 7C).”</p><p>We have also added several sentences later in the Discussion to address the unanswered questions of when and where NECAP acts, how NECAP detaches from AP2, and how AP2 becomes dephosphorylated.</p><p>Discussion: “The results of this study do not distinguish whether NECAP acts early in endocytosis to promote productive pit formation by limiting aberrant events, or late in the endocytic cycle to uncoat AP2 and allow the complex to initiate new pits. […] It remains to be determined whether NECAP<sub>PHear</sub> must disengage prior to dephosphorylation, or whether a phosphatase plays a role in NECAP removal from closed complexes.”</p><p>We clarified our choice of using NECAP2 for our in vitro experiments.</p><p>Results: “While there are two paralogues of NECAP in vertebrates, we have previously shown that they function equivalently to bind phosphorylated and open AP2 complexes in vitro and rescue loss of NECAP in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Beacham et al., 2018). In this work, we use human or mouse NECAP2 for all experiments because of their ease of purification and stability.”</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing us towards reports of inherited NECAP1 mutations associated with human or canine diseases. While these pathogenic mutations in NECAP are exciting, it is difficult to interpret these mutations in the context of this work. The human variants appear to result in loss of NECAP expression, and the missense mutation observed in Giant Schnauzer dogs is outside the PHearEx region of NECAP that we identified as the minimal functional region in our assays and visualized in our cryo-EM structures.</p></body></sub-article></article>
