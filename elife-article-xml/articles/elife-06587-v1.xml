Here we report that the female gametophyte-expressed glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (GPI-AP) LORELEI and the seedling-expressed LRE-like GPI-AP1 (LLG1) bind to the extracellular juxtamembrane region of FER and show that this interaction is pivotal for FER function. LLG1 interacts with FER in the endoplasmic reticulum and on the cell surface, and loss of LLG1 function induces cytoplasmic retention of FER, consistent with transport of FER from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane in a complex with LLG1. We further demonstrate that LLG1 is a component of the FER-regulated RHO GTPase signaling complex and that <italic>fer</italic> and <italic>llg1</italic> mutants display indistinguishable growth, developmental and signaling phenotypes, analogous to how <italic>lre</italic> and <italic>fer</italic> share similar reproductive defects. Together our results support LLG1/LRE acting as a chaperone and co-receptor for FER and elucidate a mechanism by which GPI-APs enable the signaling capacity of a cell surface receptor.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06587.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06587.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06587.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants respond to changes in their environment by altering how they grow and when they reproduce. A protein called FERONIA is found in most types of cells and regulates many of the processes that drive these responses, such as cell growth and communication between male and female cells. FERONIA sits in the membrane that surrounds the cell, where it can detect molecules in the cell wall and from outside the cell, and send signals to locations within the cell. However, it is not clear how FERONIA is able to specifically regulate different processes to produce the right response in a particular cell at a particular time.</p><p>A family of proteins called glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs for short) play important roles in plants, animals, and other eukaryotic organisms. Li et al. studied FERONIA and two closely related GPI-APs called LLG1—which is produced in seedlings, and LORELEI, which is only found in female sex cells<italic>.</italic> The experiments show that plants missing either LLG1 or FERONIA had similar defects in growth and in how they respond to plant hormones. Plants missing LORELEI had similar defects in their ability to reproduce as the plants missing FERONIA. This suggests that FERONIA works with either LLG1 or LORELEI to regulate similar processes in different situations.</p><p>Li et al. found that FERONIA binds to LLG1 in a compartment within the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum—where proteins are assembled—before both proteins are moved together to the cell membrane. In the absence of LLG1, FERONIA fails to reach the cell membrane, and a large amount of FERONIA remains trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, LLG1 acts as a ‘chaperone’ that delivers FERONIA to the membrane where it is required to regulate plant growth. Li et al. found that LORELEI also interacts with FERONIA. Both LLG1 and LORELEI bind to the same region of FERONIA, which is on the outer surface of the cell membrane.</p><p>These findings show that FERONIA is able to perform different roles in cells by teaming up with different members of the GPI-AP family of proteins. The next challenges will be to find out if, and how, LLG1 and LORELEI affect the ability of FERONIA to respond to signals from the cell wall and outside the cell.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06587.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06587.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>malectin domain-containing receptor kinase</kwd><kwd>FERONIA  as coreceptor</kwd><kwd>receptor kinase and GPI-AP as functional partner</kwd><kwd>plant Rho GTPase signaling</kwd><kwd>RALF</kwd><kwd>LORELEI/LLG1 as coreceptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1127002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>Alice Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Hen-Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1146941</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Hen-Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>FERONIA receptor kinase interacts with phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins LORELEI and LLG1 to ensure its proper functional location in the cell membrane and engages them as co-receptors on the cell surface to mediate a broad spectrum of growth and signaling processes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Arabidopsis FERONIA (FER) receptor kinase critically controls growth and development, is indispensable for reproduction, and participates in defense-related responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wolf and Hofte, 2014</xref>). FER was initially identified as an essential regulator for female fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huck et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rotman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Escobar-Restrepo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kessler and Grossniklaus, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duan et al., 2014</xref>); its expression in the female gametophyte is responsible for inducing rupture of an invading pollen tube to release sperm for fertilization. It is also required to prevent supernumerary pollen tube entrance to individual ovules, precluding polyspermy and maximizing seed yield. Thus <italic>fer</italic> mutant plants are severely female-deficient, producing few seeds. FER is, however, broadly expressed and absent only in pollen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zimmermann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duan et al., 2010</xref>); its functions intersect several major plant hormone signaling pathways, including auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duan et al., 2010</xref>), abscisic acid (ABA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2012</xref>), brassinosteroid, and ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deslauriers and Larsen, 2010</xref>). FER has also been shown to interact with the peptide hormone rapid alkalinization factor 1 (RALF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haruta et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore <italic>fer</italic> knock-out mutants are pleiotropic, with vegetative phenotypes attributable to defects in growth processes regulated by these hormones. FER also mediates susceptibility to the fungal pathogen powdery mildew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kessler et al., 2010</xref>) and has been implicated in mechano-sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shih et al., 2014</xref>). Thus it is likely that FER mediates distinct signals under different cellular and developmental conditions and environmental challenges.</p><p>How FER achieves its multiple functionality remains unclear. We showed earlier that FER interacts with ROPGEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duan et al., 2010</xref>), guanine nucleotide exchange factors that stimulate GDP/GTP exchange in RAC/ROPs, the RHO GTPases of plants, activating them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berken et al., 2005</xref>). We demonstrated that FER acts as a cell surface regulator for RAC/ROP-mediated NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production to support polarized root hair growth in seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duan et al., 2010</xref>), and induce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pollen tube rupture and sperm release in the female gametophyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duan et al., 2014</xref>). RAC/ROPs are known to mediate multiple signaling pathways that underlie normal plant growth and development, as well as stress-related responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nibau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). ROS are ubiquitous and regulate a broad spectrum of cellular processes as diverse as cell growth and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carol and Dolan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jaspers and Kangasjarvi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Swanson and Gilroy, 2010</xref>). Utilizing RAC/ROPs and ROS as signal mediators potentially provides almost limitless permutations of how FER-mediated signals might be propagated.</p><p>The diverse functionality of FER could also be provided by its potential ability to interact with multiple ligands. Its extracellular domain shows homology with malectin, a disaccharide-binding protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schallus et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2010</xref>). That FER might interact with carbohydrate moieties suggests the potential of mediating cell wall perturbations elicited by a battery of endogenous and environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hematy and Hofte, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boisson-Dernier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheung and Wu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lindner et al., 2012</xref>) such as hormonal changes impacting cell growth and pathogen attacks eliciting cell wall restructuring. RALF1 is one of ∼40 related secreted peptides in Arabidopsis that collectively are ubiquitously present, albeit individually they are all expressed at low levels and their functional roles in plant growth and development remain largely unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morato do Canto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Srivastava et al., 2009</xref>). If, similar to RALF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haruta et al., 2014</xref>), more of these peptide hormones interact with FER, using individual RALFs as signals might be another strategy to achieve its multi-functional roles.</p><p>Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) are cell surface-located proteins known to play important roles in regulating a broad range of biological processes including growth, morphogenesis, reproduction, and disease pathogenesis in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujita and Kinoshita, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). They localize to sphingolipid- and cholesterol-enriched domains in the cell membrane where they are believed to play key roles in regulating cell surface signaling dynamics, although much remains to be learned about their precise functional mechanisms. In plants, GPI-APs play indispensable roles throughout development, required for cell wall biosynthesis, embryo viability, organogenesis, reproductive development, and male–female interactive processes crucial for fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2014</xref>). LORELEI (LRE) and LRE-like GPI-APs 1, 2, 3 (LLG1, 2, 3) are closely related but differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsukamoto et al., 2010</xref>). LRE is expressed exclusively in the ovule and loss of LRE function suppresses female fertility. <italic>lre</italic> mutants display reproductive phenotypes almost identical to those in <italic>fer</italic> mutants: a majority of <italic>lre</italic> and <italic>fer</italic> female gametophytes fail to induce rupture of the invading pollen tubes and their ovules are penetrated by multiple pollen tubes, yet fail to be fertilized because of the lack of sperm release. Here we show that LRE and LLG1 interact physically with FER and that they are crucial for its cell surface signaling capacity. Our results show partnering with related but differentially expressed proteins as a strategy for FER to execute its diverse biological roles; they also elucidate a novel mechanism for how GPI-APs might control cell surface signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>llg1</italic> and <italic>fer</italic> mutants have indistinguishable growth and developmental phenotypes</title><p>Gene expression and mutant analyses showed that LLG1 is important for vegetative growth and development.

Partnering with and relying on this differentially expressed protein pair clearly would provide versatility for the almost constitutively expressed FER to control when and where signaling can be deployed. Moreover, modulation of LLG1 and LRE expression and their post-translational modifications, which involve numerous GPI-anchor biosynthetic and restructuring steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujita and Kinoshita, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kinoshita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2014</xref>), would provide many opportunities for FER signaling activity to be fine-tuned to meet a broad range of developmental needs and environmental challenges. Given the spectrum of phenomena already known to be regulated by FER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wolf and Hofte, 2014</xref>), LLG1 and LRE could be of core importance to how FER treads among several signaling pathways to mediate growth and developmental processes regulated by multiple hormones, reproduction, and defense, each potentially controlled by distinct signals. FER is a member of a family of 17 related Arabidopsis receptor kinases, which are also conserved in other plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hematy and Hofte, 2008</xref>); LRE-like proteins are also present in other plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsukamoto et al., 2010</xref>). It is conceivable that pairing with their cognate LRE-like proteins also underlies the signaling functions of other FER-related receptor kinases. GPI-APs, including, for example, the COBRA family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schindelman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2013</xref>) and arabinogalactan proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demesa-Arevalo and Vielle-Calzada, 2013</xref>), play crucial roles in plant growth and reproduction. Demonstrating that FER depends on LLG1 and LRE for efficient localization to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6, 7</xref>) elucidates not only a strategy whereby FER acquires its cell surface signaling capacity but also a mechanism with which GPI-APs might enable the signaling capacity of a broader set of cell surface receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>LLG1 and LRE as ‘chaperones’ for FER delivery to the cell membrane</title><p>The FER-LLG1/LRE partnership also underscores the importance and the versatility of GPI-APs as regulators for cell signaling activities. GPI-APs are secreted to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane. LLG1 and LRE binding to the exJM domain of FER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) is consistent with their being tethered to the cell membrane via the GPI anchor, thus facilitating interactions with FER immediately along the outer cell surface. GPI anchors are assembled and transferred to proteins destined for lipid modification in the ER. GPI-APs are known to undergo structural remodeling in the ER for efficient trafficking to the Golgi in vesicles that are distinct from those for other secretory proteins, already marking them for delivery to specialized sphingolipids- and cholesterols-enriched cell membrane microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujita and Kinoshita, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kinoshita et al., 2013</xref>). With its signal peptide, FER could be secreted by default to the cell membrane. That FER and LLG1 already interact in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) and this interaction underlies efficient FER localization to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7 fig10">Figures 6, 7 and 10</xref>) are consistent with at least a fraction of FER exiting the ER as a FER-LLG1/LRE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). That FER and LLG1/LRE remain associated with the RAC/ROP signaling complex along the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig9">Figures 5, 9</xref>) also provides additional support for FER-LLG1/LRE being transported from the ER to the cell membrane as a complex. In complexing with FER in the ER and ‘chaperoning’ its delivery to the cell membrane, LLG1 and LRE ensure delivery of FER to GPI-AP-destined micro membrane environments for its proper functional location and assembly of the RAC/ROP signaling apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). In the remaining part of the FER-ROPGEF-RAC/ROP signaling complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and being required for several RAC/ROP regulated processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duan et al., 2014</xref>), LLG1 and LRE apparently also function as an integral component of the FER signal reception apparatus. They might directly participate in signal perception by FER and/or regulate how FER interacts with various possible binding targets, such as RALF1 or other hormones and cell wall carbohydrates. They also conceivably provide a landmark for the assembly of the FER signaling apparatus and regulation of its activity such as by maintaining its stability or inducing its recycling from the cell membrane, roles known to be played by GPI-APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujita and Kinoshita, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2013</xref>).

The non-additive phenotype of <italic>fer-4 llg1-2</italic> double mutant relative to each of its parent single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) provides further support that FER and LLG1 function in and both are required for the same pathways. Biochemically, both LLG1 and LRE physically interact with FER on the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) and exist as components of the FER-ROPGEF-RAC/ROP-NADPH oxidase signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), consistent with their serving with FER as signal mediators on the cell surface to RAC/ROPs. This is further supported biologically by loss of LLG1 or LRE inducing the same signaling defects as in <italic>fer</italic> null mutants, including processes regulated by auxin, ABA, RALF1, and ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3, 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duan et al., 2014</xref>). Besides LLG1/LRE, RALF1 is thus far the only other molecule reported to interact with the FER extracellular domain, although the precise RALF1 target site on FER remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haruta et al., 2014</xref>). That RALF1 interacts with co-expressed FER and LLG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) and that both FER and LLG1 are needed to mediate RALF1 signaled responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>) indicate that the FER-LLG1 complex indeed has the capacity to serve as a co-receptor for this first known ligand of FER. Given the already known participation of FER in multiple hormone and defense signaling pathways, the FER-LLG1/LRE complex could equally be a surface co-regulator for multiple signals. Moreover, FER is also broadly speculated to interact with cell wall carbohydrates by virtue of its extracellular homology with the disaccharide-binding malectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kessler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheung and Wu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lindner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wolf and Hofte, 2014</xref>). Therefore, the extracellular interactions engaged by FER are likely to be complex and influenced by multiple factors whose presence fluctuates depending on cellular and environmental conditions. The FER-LLG1/LRE partnership discovered here laid the ground work towards a more comprehensive understanding of how FER attains its multiple biological role; this will however require first deciphering other biochemical interactions maintained by FER.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant growth and transformation</title><p>Plant growth followed previously described conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duan et al., 2010</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sheila McCormick (Reviewing editor and reviewer) and Venkatesan Sundaresan (reviewer). A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The FER kinase is involved in several signaling pathways that are important for plant development, so the problem investigated is of high interest. The findings provide new insights into the mechanism of signaling by FER, and into the molecular functions of the LRE-related GPI-anchored proteins, which are poorly understood in plants. Overall the study appears be well-executed and the data are solid. Evidence for LLG1 functioning as a chaperone for FER delivery to the cell membrane is robust, but evidence for it functioning as a co-receptor for signal perception is weaker. Additionally, we think the manuscript can be improved (e.g., sentence structure, better explanation of the logic behind each experiment), as in many places it was difficult to follow or information was missing.</p><p>1) Clarifications and additional experiments needed to support the model. The proposed model is that LRE/LLG1 forms a tetrameric signaling complex with FER and inactive RAC/ROP proteins. The FER- LRE/LLG interactions are supported by yeast 2-hybrid as well as BIFC studies and are convincing that LLG1 is a chaperone for localization of FER to the PM. However, several experiments are needed to strengthen the conclusion about LLG1's role as a co-receptor: (A) FER-mediated molecular responses to RALF1, such as gene expression, should be analyzed in <italic>fer</italic> and <italic>llg1</italic> mutants (e.g. the TCH and BR6ox genes reported in Shih et al., and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haruta et al. 2014</xref>). (B) Does RALF1 alter FER-LLG1 interaction, e.g. in the co-IP assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>? (C) Is RALF1 binding to FER affected in the <italic>llg1</italic> mutant (as assayed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haruta et al., 2014</xref>)? In other words, if LLG1 + FER bind RALF, but LRE + FER do not (based on the phenotypes of <italic>llg1</italic> and <italic>lre</italic>), that would be strong support of the model that FER selectivity is due to association with LRE-like proteins. As we understand it, the ROP2 pulldown was performed with LLG1 and LRE expressed in protoplasts (not <italic>E. coli</italic>), which should have the endogenous FER. Therefore, the likely explanation is that FER mediated the pulldown. But then this should be tested using the <italic>fer</italic> mutant and FER co-overexpression, and also in the presence and absence of RALF1 peptide. That is, <italic>fer</italic> mutant protoplasts transformed with (1) LLG1-HA, (2) LLG1-HA + 35S-FER, and (3) LLG1-HA+35S-FER + RALF1 treatment. These three samples can potentially answer several key questions raised by their model. Furthermore, whether LLG1 function is required for the FER-ROP2 interaction can be tested by doing the ROP2-pulldown-FER assay in <italic>llg1</italic> mutant protoplasts. Their model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) proposes the “signal” (somehow) causes RACROP disassociation from the receptor complex and could be tested by including RALF1 in their ROP pulldown assays. These experiments can potentially add significant insights and clarify some important uncertainties of their model.</p><p>2) Clarifications re phenotypic characterization: Phenotypes were compared in detail between <italic>llg1</italic> and <italic>fer</italic>, but double mutant and epistatic analyses were not performed. Although an additive effect can be caused by partial loss of function (with redundant genes present), absence of an additive effect between <italic>llg1</italic> and fer would provide key support for their function in the same pathway. If there is a reason why double mutants were not analyzed, it should be explained. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haruta et al., 2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shih et al., 2014</xref> showed longer roots in <italic>fer</italic> than in wild type, opposite to the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>. This requires clarification! While the RALF1 insensitive root of <italic>llg1</italic> supports the requirement of LLG1 for RALF1 signaling, the retarded root growth of untreated <italic>llg1</italic> mutant, similar to RALF1-treated wild type, is consistent with constitutive RALF1/FER signaling.</p><p>3) Microscopic data need clarification. For example, the “well-defined cell membrane localization” and “mislocalized… in <italic>llg1</italic> mutant” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> is not obvious, because the signal intensity in WT is lower than that in <italic>llg1</italic>, and the cell membrane still shows a stronger signal than the ER in <italic>llg1</italic>. A similar amplified view should be provided for WT (there is empty space in the figure layout). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, is the effect specific to FER or would any cell surface receptor be affected by this root hair tip defect? What is the difference between WT and <italic>llg1</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and C</xref> lack wild type and non-transgenic controls for the “auto-green fluorescent patches”. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>: why is the signal intensity different between WT and <italic>lre</italic> and <italic>lre llg1</italic>? And why in the <italic>lre</italic> mutant gametophytes, is FER-GFP localization cytoplasmic? Wouldn't the FER-GFP signal be expected in the ER of the synergids, similar to the ER localization of FER-GFP in the hypocotyl cells of <italic>llg</italic>1 mutants? Furthermore, the ratios of FER in the FA vs. outside the FA in the synergids are estimated based on integrating the GFP signal over a ROI. It is not clear how the ROIs were selected, because the outline of the synergids is not clear. The ROIs for the mutants seem larger, especially in the case of the <italic>lre llg1</italic> double mutant. This might result in an artificially high value for the signal outside the FA in the mutant gametophytes. A justification for the ROIs selected should be provided. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>: would be more convincing and clear if random views of multiple protoplasts were shown.</p><p>4) The <italic>lre</italic> mutants used in the study should be described in the Methods. In the case of <italic>lre</italic>, which is a female gametophyte mutant, the plants might be assumed to be heterozygous for the mutation. Based on the frequencies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, it would appear that the <italic>lre</italic> plants are in fact homozygous, but it is not obvious. In general, the Methods section should clarify the homozygosity of all the mutants used.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06587.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Clarifications and additional experiments needed to support the model.

These experiments can potentially add significant insights and clarify some important uncertainties of their model</italic>.</p><p>The list represents a comprehensive set of biochemical studies to unravel the FER-LLG1/LRE and RALF1 relationship which are in fact ongoing projects in our lab. Although we explained above that RALF1 is not the only concern in this study, we add to the revised manuscript a result showing that RALF1 pulled-down co-expressed FER and LLG1 (added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>; please see the subsection headed “FER interacts with LLG1 on the cell membrane and in the ER”), supporting interaction between RALF1 and the FER-LLG1 complex. Together with the expanded results showing comparable reduction of sensitivity to RALF1-regulated gene expression (response above) and lack of additive effects of combining <italic>fer4</italic> and <italic>llg1</italic> (response below), we believe that the current version contains data that considerably strengthen the FER-LLG1 co-receptor concept.</p><p>As for the list of experiments suggested by the reviewers, investigations along similar lines were already ongoing (by F-L.

We do not wish to treat any of these aspects without the thoroughness we like to maintain in our work or without being able to take into account the multiple facets of FER functions. Given the already very extensive study presented in Li et al., we feel that we cannot do justice to the depth that these studies requires or to the junior investigators who carry out these works by hastily putting results from ongoing work into this paper.</p><p><italic>2) Clarifications re phenotypic characterization: Phenotypes were compared in detail between</italic> llg1 <italic>and</italic> fer<italic>, but double mutant and epistatic analyses were not performed.

We respond first on the comments on Haruta et al. and Shih et al.</p><p>Regarding Haruta et al. and Shih et al. results. We do not agree with the assessment that “Haruta et al. and Shih et al., 2014 showed longer roots in <italic>fer</italic> than in wild type”. If one examines Haruta et al. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, mock-treated <italic>fer-4</italic> roots were shorter than wild type ones (compare first and second data sets in the plot). The seedling image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, one of the <italic>fer-4</italic> seedlings was longer, the other was shorter or at most comparable to wild type, suggesting that the illustrated images were likely among the longer population of <italic>fer-4,</italic> which are routinely the better survivors. As for the Shih et al. study, the main text and SI together showed two partial <italic>fer-4</italic> root images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, and S2E). The more severely growth-retarded seedlings also have strong cell wall defects, including rips between cells (D. Kita, Ph.D. dissertation, and manuscript under preparation) and, in our opinion, would not have been good candidates for assessment of mechanical sensing. Judging from the notable root hairs still observable in <italic>fer-4</italic> in Shih et al. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, plants used in the mechanical sensing studies would indeed have been the larger-sized seedlings, possibly approximating wild type. However, the overall plant sizes in Shih et al. could not be evaluated from the results shown in the paper.</p><p>Detail description of <italic>fer-4</italic> growth and to clarify the RALF regulated growth phenotype<italic>:</italic> The vegetative phenotypes of <italic>fer-4</italic> and <italic>llg1</italic> and the reproductive phenotypes (i.e. female gametophyte sterile) of <italic>fer-4</italic> and <italic>lre-5</italic> are not 100% penetrant. Seedlings vary in sizes (see added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>) and only a majority of <italic>fer-4</italic> and <italic>lre-5</italic> female gametophytes are sterile but a percentage remains fertile, producing homozygous mutant progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsukamoto et al., 2010</xref>). All <italic>fer-4</italic> phenotypes are complemented by FER-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2014</xref>). The most severe <italic>fer-4</italic> seedlings do not survive, but the same range of phenotypes bled true in progeny from less severely defective mutant plants. We tested another allele, <italic>fer-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deslauriers and Larsen, 2010</xref>), the non-penetrant phenotype is the same. <italic>llg1-1</italic> and <italic>llg1-2</italic> seedlings are also heterogeneous in sizes.</p><p>Larger and smaller <italic>fer</italic> and <italic>llg1</italic> seedlings persisted in RALF treatment samples (added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2A, B</xref>), consistent with reduced sensitivity to RALF in the overall mutant seedling populations. The size (thus growth) heterogeneity led to our measuring “actual growth” during the two days of treatment and using the smaller seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref> as in original manuscript) because they were more homogeneous. We believe the actual growth measurements adds strength to just comparing root lengths of wild type and mutant seedlings after treatments (as in Haruta et al., and as we also show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2B and 2C</xref>, right).</p><p><italic>3) Microscopic data need clarification.

In fact, FER-GFP signals were consistently not notably different between wild type and <italic>llg1-2</italic>; this is also evidenced here by the comparable signal to background contrast.</p><p><italic>And the cell membrane still shows a stronger signal than the ER in</italic> llg1<italic>.</italic></p><p>The point we wanted to convey is that there was considerably higher retention of FER-GFP in <italic>llg1</italic> tissues but not that it was entirely removed from the cell periphery (where the cell membrane and cortical ER are often not easily resolved). We change the sentence that refers to this result to: “intracellular FER-GFP signal was considerably more pronounced in <italic>llg1</italic> hypocotyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>) than in wild type tissues”.</p><p><italic>A similar amplified view should be provided for WT (there is empty space in the figure layout)</italic>.</p><p>Done (added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p><italic>In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6C</italic></xref><italic>, is the effect specific to FER or would any cell surface receptor be affected by this root hair tip defect?</italic></p><p>We opt to leave this question open for this study, and added a sentence in the Discussion: “To what extent the LRE family protein controls the delivery of receptor kinases as a class or more specifically those closely related to FER remains to be determined”.</p><p>On a practical level, we cannot exhaustively examine all, or even a large number of cell surface receptors, so cannot generalize “specificity” for FER even if we report on a very small subset of them. On the other hand, <italic>fer</italic> mutants have multiple signaling phenotypes (e.g. auxin, ethylene, ABA, brassinosteroid, pathogen, mechanical sensing). Beyond the phenotype reported here, unpublished observations from our lab indicate that <italic>llg1</italic> has similar brassinosteroid and ethylene-related phenotypes as <italic>fer-4</italic>. So, it is quite plausible that additional cell surface signaling molecules can be impacted by loss of LLG1.
