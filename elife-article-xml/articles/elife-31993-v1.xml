We labeled endogenous EGFR with GFP by genome-editing of human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells, which were used to examine EGFR-GFP behavior in mouse tumor xenografts in vivo. Intravital multiphoton imaging, confocal imaging of cryosections and biochemical analysis revealed that localization and trafficking patterns, as well as levels of phosphorylation and ubiquitylation of EGFR in tumors in vivo closely resemble patterns and levels observed in the same cells treated with 20–200 pM EGF in vitro. Consistent with the prediction of low ligand concentrations in tumors, EGFR endocytosis was kinase-dependent and blocked by inhibitors of clathrin-mediated internalization; and EGFR activity was insensitive to Cbl overexpression.

EGFR is an essential player during mammalian development and involved in the maintenance of various tissues in adult organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sibilia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pastore et al., 2008</xref>). Because EGFR is mutated or overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, it has become a major prognostic marker and therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grandis and Sok, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herbst et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nicholson et al., 2001</xref>). Pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR has been a successful strategy for the treatment of patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) expressing mutant EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee, 2017</xref>). However, therapies targeting wild-type EGFR in tumors such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have been less effective due to intrinsic and acquired tumor resistance to EGFR inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leemans et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rieke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>EGFR may be activated by seven different ligands that bind the extracellular domain of the receptor with varying affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Singh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roepstorff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ebner and Derynck, 1991</xref>). These ligands are synthetized as transmembrane precursors that undergo proteolysis by metalloproteases at the cell surface to produce functional soluble molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). Ectodomain ‘shedding’ is proposed to be the rate-limiting step of the molecular processing that determines the concentration of a mature ligand in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peschon et al., 1998</xref>). Ligand binding leads to EGFR dimerization and the activation of its tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). Subsequent phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the carboxyl-terminus of EGFR provides docking sites for proteins with SH2 and PTB domains, which trigger signal transduction through Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1/2 (MAPK/ERK1/2), phosphoinositide 3-kinase, AKT, Src family kinases (SFKs), STATs, phospholipase Cγ1, Rho family GTPases and other pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Once ligand-bound, EGFR is rapidly endocytosed via clathrin-dependent and -independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sorkin and Goh, 2009</xref>). Subsequently, EGFR-ligand complexes may recycle back to the plasma membrane from early and sorting endosomes but are also efficiently targeted to lysosomes for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sorkin and Goh, 2009</xref>). Recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligases, the Cbl proteins (c-Cbl and Cbl-b), to activated EGFR is a key event leading to receptor ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levkowitz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levkowitz et al., 1999</xref>). Ubiquitylation of the receptor and its binding to the clathrin adaptor AP-2 serve as two redundant mechanisms for receptor recruitment into clathrin-coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fortian et al., 2015</xref>). Poly-ubiquitylation also mediates binding of EGFR to ESCRT proteins in sorting endosomes leading to the incorporation of the receptor into intraluminal vesicles of multi-vesicular endosomes and subsequent lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). Despite the extensive literature on EGFR endocytosis and intracellular sorting, the mechanisms underlying these processes and how they regulate EGFR signaling in normal and tumor cells are poorly understood.</p><p>A significant reason for the gaps in understanding of the physiologic mechanisms and function of EGFR endocytosis is the unusual threshold dependence of EGFR endocytosis and signaling on ligand concentration. Activation of &lt;10,000 EGFRs per cell with low ligand concentrations (&lt;1–2 ng/ml) results in EGFR internalization specifically via the clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) pathway, whereas at higher EGF concentrations the process becomes largely clathrin independent (CIE), presumably, due to saturation of the CME pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lund et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang and Sorkin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sigismund et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, a ligand concentration threshold was observed in EGFR ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sigismund et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sigismund et al., 2013</xref>). It has been proposed that at low EGF concentrations (1–2 ng/ml) activated EGFRs are not ubiquitylated in HeLa cells, and therefore, not efficiently targeted to lysosomes, which leads to continued recycling and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sigismund et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sigismund et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly though, previous studies in B82 mouse fibroblasts have shown that endosomal sorting of EGFR is rapid in the presence of low EGF concentrations but is saturated by high ligand concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">French et al., 1994</xref>). Furthermore, a small pool of ligand-occupied EGFRs was shown to be sufficient to fully activate the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in several types of cultured cells, in contrast to other downstream signaling pathways which demand high EGFR ligand concentrations before significant activation is apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krall et al., 2011</xref>). The concentration of EGFR ligands in human body fluids and tumors is typically below 1–2 ng/ml, with the exception of breast milk, saliva and urine, fluids where EGF is more abundant though inaccessible to EGFRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishikawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dvorak, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Connolly and Rose, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murdoch-Kinch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirata and Orth, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oka and Orth, 1983</xref>). However, even given this knowledge, majority of studies of EGFR endocytosis and signaling utilize extremely high, non-physiological concentrations of EGFR ligands, for example, 100 ng/ml.</p><p>The second major reason for our limited understanding of the EGFR physiology and pathophysiology is the lack of quantitative, high-resolution studies of endocytosis and signaling of endogenous EGFR in vivo, particularly, in tumor models. What are the levels of EGFR activity in tumor cells in vivo? Is EGFR endocytosed in tumors in vivo in the presence of endogenous ligands? Is EGFR ubiquitylated in tumors? What are the mechanisms of EGFR endocytic trafficking in vivo in tumor cells? In the present study, we have begun to address these questions using mouse tumor xenografts of human HNSCC cells engineered using gene-editing to express GFP-tagged endogenous EGFR (EGFR-GFP). A combination of intravital imaging of tumors, high-resolution fluorescence microscopy of tumor sections and biochemical analysis demonstrated activation, ubiquitylation and endocytosis of EGFR in tumors in vivo. We found that an extremely small pool of EGFRs is activated and ubiquitylated in tumor xenografts, indicative of low (picomolar) concentrations of endogenous EGFR ligands accessible to receptors in these tumors. These few active EGFRs are capable of efficient endocytosis in a receptor-kinase-activity-dependent manner and are sufficient to drive tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and characterization of gene-edited HSC3 cells expressing endogenous GFP-tagged EGFR</title><p>To study EGFR endocytosis and signaling in tumors, we have used the human oral squamous carcinoma HSC3 cell line as the primary experimental model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Momose et al., 1989</xref>). These HNSCC cells have five copies of the wild-type <italic>EGFR</italic> gene (canSar v3.0) and thus express ~5×10<sup>5</sup> EGFRs per cell, which is 5–10-fold higher than EGFR levels in normal keratinocytes and fibroblasts. HSC3 cells produce tumors in athymic nude mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Momose et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kudo et al., 2003</xref>), and the growth of HSC3 tumor xenografts is inhibited by blocking EGFR activity, indicating that these tumors are EGFR-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kudo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shintani et al., 2003</xref>). Because overexpression of EGFR is observed in the majority of human HNSCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leemans et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rieke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grandis and Tweardy, 1992</xref>), HSC3 cells is considered to be a suitable model to recapitulate human EGFR-dependent head-and-neck carcinoma.</p><p>To enable direct visualization of endogenous EGFR in tumor cells in vivo, EGFR was tagged with eGFP in HSC3 cells using a zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN)-based genome-editing method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doyon et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After two cycles of gene-editing and multiple rounds of clonal selection, several clonal pools of HSC3 cells (single HSC3 cells do not survive) were obtained, in which EGFR-GFP constituted 40–50% of total cellular EGFR protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>), indicating that 2–3 copies of <italic>EGFR</italic> gene were edited. Clonal pool B7F8 (further referred as HSC3/EGFR-GFP cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) was selected for subsequent experiments based on the homogeneity of subcellular distribution of EGFR-GFP within the cell population and the similarity of cell morphology with that of the parental cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31993.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation and characterization of HSC3 cells expressing endogenous GFP-tagged EGFR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of genome-editing.

When HSC3/EGFR-GFP cells were stimulated with EGF-Rhodamine (EGF-Rh), efficient endocytosis of EGF-Rh:EGFR-GFP complexes was observed in living cells as evidenced by the accumulation of 80–90% of these complexes in endosomes with only a minimal EGF-Rh presence at the cell surface after 12 min of continuous endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Subcutaneous (s.q.) grafting of HSC3/EGFR-GFP cells into the flanks of athymic nude mice led to tumor formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Intracellular GFP puncta were detected in a limited fraction of cells in the tumor (insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Consistent with the observations from intravital imaging, clusters or vesicles of EGFR-GFP were often seen in close proximity to the plasma membrane or could not be resolved from the plasma membrane even by the highest resolution confocal imaging. Many GFP-positive clusters/vesicles, including those that are proximal to the plasma membrane, contained early endosome antigen 1 (EEA.1), suggesting that this pool of EGFR-GFP is located in early/sorting endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Montage images covering large areas of tumors revealed predominant localization of EGFR-GFP at the cell surface with occasional clusters of GFP in vesicles, a distribution pattern essentially similar to that observed in flank tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Together, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref> strongly suggest that only a small fraction of EGFRs are endocytosed under steady-state growth conditions of HSC3/EGFR-GFP tumor xenografts (in the presence of endogenous EGFR ligands).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Small pool of active EGFRs is predictive of picomolar ligand concentrations in tumors</title><p>The finding of a relatively low incidence of detectable EGFR-GFP endocytosis in HSC3 tumor xenografts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>) suggests that either the concentration of ligands accessible to EGFR in these tumors is quite low, resulting in activation of only a small pool of EGFRs, or EGFRs are incapable of efficient endocytosis in vivo. To test the first hypothesis, we measured EGFR activity in tumors by determining the levels of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and compared the levels of EGFR phosphorylation in tumors with those measured in vitro in the same HSC3/EGFR-GFP cells treated with a range of EGF concentrations. The reasons for focusing on EGFR activity rather than carrying out direct measurements of ligand concentrations are two-fold. First, receptor activity is the key parameter for defining down-stream signaling events. Second, it is not feasible to measure concentrations of all seven EGFR ligands, and some ligand detection kits do not differentiate between soluble and immature transmembrane ligands.</p><p>In vitro, phosphorylation of Tyr1068 in EGFR and EGFR-GFP (measured as the pY1068/EGFR ratio) displayed a linear dependence on the concentration of EGF when incubated with cells for 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). When cells were incubated with the same range of EGF concentrations for 12 hr, the extent of Tyr1068 phosphorylation mirrored the results obtained using an acute stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, ligand dose-response curves were similar in cells stimulated acutely (10 min) with EGF and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα), an EGFR ligand that is frequently produced by cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grandis and Tweardy, 1993</xref>) but is more readily dissociated from the receptor in the acidic environment of endosomes when compared with the canonical ligand, EGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roepstorff et al., 2009</xref>) (data not shown). Therefore, EGF-dose-dependence of the pY1068/EGFR ratio measured using a 10-min stimulation of cells in vitro was employed as a linear standard to estimate ligand concentrations in vivo in tumor xenografts. In the example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>, the pY1068/EGFR ratio measured in two tumor xenograft samples (last two lanes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) was interpolated into the corresponding in vitro curve to estimate the EGFR ligand concentration in these two tumors. Such an estimation of ligand concentration based on the in vitro/in vivo comparison of EGFR phosphorylation was performed in multiple flank and tongue xenografts of HSC3/EGFR-GFP cells in several independent series of experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). The analysis yielded mean predicted concentrations of EGFR ligands as low as ~0.2 and ~0.6 ng/ml (~34 and 100 pM) in the flank and tongue implants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). It should be emphasized that this estimation is based on the assumption that all cells in vitro and in vivo have access to EGFR ligands. This assumption is technically difficult to test directly with high precision, although immunolabeling of flank tumor xenograft sections with the pY1068 antibody demonstrated EGFR phosphorylation in almost all cells in tumor sections with the predominant localization of the phosphorylated receptor at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results indicate that EGFRs are certainly able to bind to ligands in a large fraction of cells in vivo. The intensity of pY1068 signal was proportional to the intensity of GFP (EGFR-GFP) signal, suggesting the relatively homogenous activation of EGFR within the tumor.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31993.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Quantification of EGFR phosphorylation and EGFR ligand concentrations in tumor xenografts and human HNSCC specimens.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Serum-starved HSC3/EGFR-GFP cells were treated with 0–2 ng/ml EGF for 10 min or 12 hr at 37°C as described in ‘Materials and methods’.

While EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr1068 displayed linear dependence on EGF concentration in the range of 0–5 ng/ml EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation reached 75–80% of the maximum phosphorylation in cells stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml (85 pM) EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

The key technical advance that enabled these analyses was the generation of human cancer cells expressing endogenous GFP-tagged receptor, which eliminates potential confounding effects of EGFR overexpression commonly seen when using constitutive promoters, and permits the use of intravital imaging of receptor dynamics in living tumors and direct fluorescence imaging of fixed tumors. During preparation of our manuscript, Yang and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2017</xref>) reported generation of a knock-in mouse expressing EGFR tagged with the Emerald fluorescent protein, which was exploited to study the localization of EGFR in normal mouse tissues and carcinogen-induced colon adenocarcinoma. The latter study and our experiments illustrate the advantage of the direct fluorescence imaging of EGFR as compared with imaging using immunofluorescence approaches with its inherently lower signal-to-noise ratio and the potential to not label hidden or complexed epitopes. Additionally, having membranes of tumor cells labeled with EGFR-GFP in our experimental system allowed clear separation of tumor boundaries from the surrounding mouse tissue and stroma.</p><p>Overall, combining intravital and confocal imaging with the comparative in vivo:in vitro biochemical analyses allowed us to conclude that the EGFR physiology in EGFR-dependent tumor xenografts displays all characteristics observed in cells grown in vitro and exposed to low (&lt;1–2 ng/ml) EGFR ligand concentrations. The prediction of low EGFR ligand concentrations in tumors in vivo is based on comparing: (1) apparent levels of EGFR phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) in vivo and in vitro; (2) patterns of EGFR-GFP and EGF-Rh localization, and mechanism(s) of their endocytosis in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>); and (3) effects of c-Cbl overexpression on EGFR levels, ubiquitylation in vitro and in vivo, and tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Our principal approach was based on measuring EGFR phosphorylation (as a direct measure of its activation) and other receptor activities downstream of, and dependent on, ligand binding, instead of attempting to measure intra-tumoral concentrations of multiple EGFR ligands. Such measurements are particularly challenging because autocrine produced ligands are rapidly depleted from the extracellular fluids by binding to EGFRs and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeWitt et al., 2001</xref>). Tumor cells have access to circulating ligands that induce paracrine activation of EGFR, and in addition, some tumor cells produce augmented amounts of EGFR ligands, which initiate signaling in an autocrine fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hobor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Tumorigenesis may elevate ligand concentrations by altering the expression or surface maturation of EGFR ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamane et al., 2008</xref>). For example, increased production of TGFα, amphiregulin or heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor was observed in some tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grandis and Tweardy, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grandis and Tweardy, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yagi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Normanno et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vermi et al., 2013</xref>). EGF concentration in tumors may also be increased by the paracrine mechanism, for example, through EGF production by tumor-associated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goswami et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, variations from the ligand concentration range predicted in our studies are possible in tumors simply due to varying stages of development and vascularization. However, as we found that predicted EGFR ligand concentrations were essentially similar in HCS3/EGFR-GFP flank xenografts harvested 1–5 weeks old after implantation and within the range of tumor volumes of 100–700 mm<sup>3</sup> (data not shown), such deviations are unlikely to significantly elevate ligand concentrations. We did find that ligand concentrations in tongue tumors can be slightly higher than in flank xenografts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), probably, because of the tumor proximity to submandibular glands, the main site of mouse EGF synthesis.</p><p>It should be emphasized that our measurements give a range of ligand concentrations in tumors (mean values: 17–100 pM) and do not provide the precise concentrations. These estimations are based on the assumption that the same fraction of cells is accessible to ligands in vitro and in vivo. Based on quantification of the experiments with EGF-Rh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), at least ~50% of cells in the tumor are accessible to the circulating ligands. Assuming that in vitro all cells have access to the ligand, the actual ligand concentrations in vivo may be two-fold higher than those predicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. However, the fraction of cells containing EGF-Rh-bound receptors in thin cryostat sections may be an underestimate because cells, that contain labeled endosomes situated out of the section plane, could not be accounted for. Further, the pattern of pY1068 localization suggested that EGFR is activated in the majority of cells in tumors. Significant variations in the intensity of EGF-Rh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and pY1068 fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) relative to the EGFR-GFP signal have not been observed within the tumor, providing no indications that there is a significant population of cells which are exposed to ligand concentrations that would result in qualitatively different EGFR activation and behaviors. Thus, based on all considerations above, EGFR ligand concentrations in tumor xenografts are predicted to be less than 1–2 ng/ml.</p><p>Experiments demonstrating that dramatic overexpression of c-Cbl in vivo did not affect EGFR phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), equivalent to cells exposed to low EGF concentrations in vitro, further support the prediction of low concentrations of EGFR ligands and a small pool of active EGFRs in tumors. EGFR ubiquitylation shows a two-phase dependence on EGF concentrations with the threshold at ~1–2 ng/ml EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>). At low EGF concentrations, the extent of receptor ubiquitylation may not be sufficient for an efficient targeting of EGFR to lysosomes both in vivo and in vitro as in agreement with that proposed by Sigismund and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sigismund et al., 2008</xref>). Alternatively, the steady-state level of EGFR is maintained in the presence of overexpressed Cbl because degradation of the small pool of ubiquitylated receptors is compensated by de novo receptor biosynthesis.</p><p>In summary, EGFR ligand concentrations in tumors predicted in the present study are within the range of K<sub>D</sub> values measured for high-affinity EGF binding to EGFR (20–200 pM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ringerike et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rees et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sorkin et al., 1991</xref>). Therefore, it can be hypothesized that a small pool of high-affinity EGFRs are ligand-occupied in tumor xenografts and sufficient to drive EGFR-dependent tumorigenesis. The importance of the ‘high-affinity EGFR’ hypothesis is three-fold:</p><p>First, EGFR-dependent tumor growth of HSC3 xenografts is driven mainly by the activity of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway because when few EGFRs are activated only the ERK1/2 axis is significantly activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Consistent with the hypothesis of the essential role of ERK1/2 signaling, inhibition of this pathway suppressed the EGFR-dependent growth of tumor xenografts of MDA-MB-468 and other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhao and Adjei, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Second, a small number of ligand-occupied receptors per cell in tumors predicts that the internalization of activated EGFR is via the CME pathway. In vitro, internalization of 1–4 ng/ml <sup>125</sup>I-EGF was strongly inhibited by siRNA knockdown of clathrin heavy chain in HSC3 cells (data not shown). An efficient internalization of EGF-Rh in tumors in vivo resembles the observations of similarly efficient EGF-Rh CME in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The kinase-dependence of EGF-Rh endocytosis in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) further strengthens the notion of the CME as the primary mechanism for EGFR internalization in tumors in vivo. On the other hand, the results with clathrin/dynamin inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) should be considered with caution. Although these compounds and their combination were previously used in in vivo mouse studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joffre et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jensen et al., 2017</xref>), it is unclear how much of the compounds actually reach tumor cells, and what the concentrations within the tumor are. The same compounds inhibit EGFR endocytosis in the presence of low EGF concentrations (conditions favoring CME) in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pinilla-Macua and Sorkin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garay et al., 2015</xref>); however, high concentrations of Pitstop-2 and Dyngo-4A are known to inhibit clathrin-independent endocytosis and/or cause general cell toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dutta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Third, the high-affinity EGFR model predicts that even minimal or residual activity of EGFR in human tumors treated with EGFR kinase inhibitors may be sufficient for tumor growth and may therefore underlie tumor resistance to such treatments. Importantly, as shown in our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), EGFR phosphorylation and ubiquitylation detected in human HNSCC specimens are within the range of those parameters detected in mouse xenografts, suggesting that the high-affinity model can be applied to human tumors.</p><p>Finally, because qualitatively different endocytosis mechanisms and signaling outcomes are observed in cell culture in response to low (&lt;1–2 ng/ml) versus high EGFR ligand concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang and Sorkin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sigismund et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sigismund et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caldieri et al., 2017</xref>), the conclusions and physiological relevance of the vast literature of in vitro studies of EGFR, majority of which utilized high EGF concentrations (20–100 ng/ml), may have to be re-evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Recombinant human EGF was from BD Biosciences.

Western blotting was performed by incubating with appropriate primary antibodies followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to far-red fluorescent dyes (IRDye-680 and −800) and detection using an Odyssey Li-COR system. Quantifications were performed using Li-COR software. pY20 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Pierce (Rockford, IL, USA). Quantifications were performed using Image J 1.48 v software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>EGFR degradation</title><p>HSC3/EGFR-GFP/Cbl cells grown with or without doxycycline were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA with or without EGF for 16 hr at 37°C.

Your article has been reviewed favorably by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>This is very nice study that looks at the activation and trafficking of EGFR in situ using a 3D tumor model. To accomplish this, the authors use gene editing techniques to tag endogenous EGFR with GFP in the human squamous cell carcinoma cell line HSC3. They demonstrate that EGFR-GFP appears to be normally activated and processed in the modified cells. HSC3/EGFR-GFP cells form tumors when injected into the tongues or flanks of mice, and the authors compare the behavior of EGFR-GFP in cell culture and in tumors using multiple methods including intravital fluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy of fixed tumor sections. The authors show that the activation, ubiquitylation, and endocytosis of EGFR-GFP is similar in cells and tumors and use these studies to estimate effective high-affinity EGF ligand concentrations in mouse flank and tongue of ~0.2 and 0.6 ng/ml, respectively. The authors demonstrate that at these relatively low ligand concentrations the principal downstream pathway activated is the Erk pathway and that Cbl-mediated targeting to lysosomes is not strongly engaged.</p><p>Technically, the studies are extremely well done, well controlled and internally consistent. The data presented are generally clean. The fluorescent images are beautiful. The most novel aspect of this study is the careful comparison between the dynamics and activation of the tumor cells and their in vitro counterparts, thus providing a basis for extrapolating data from in vitro studies to observations of receptor dynamics and tumor responses in situ. The reviewers appreciate the fact that the authors take pains to carry out their experiments with apparently physiological levels of ligand and receptor as well as to compare in vitro and in vitro results. This is extraordinarily useful and thus this is potentially a very significant study.</p><p>The reviewers have identified several issues that must be addressed before the manuscript can be considered for publication. Note that it should be possible to address these issues without further experimentation, although any additional data that help clarify these points would be welcome.</p><p>1) It is the positioning of the paper as having made a &quot;discovery&quot; that tumors show low levels of occupied receptors that is its weakest aspect. Why would the authors have expected anything else (see specific citations given below)? Serum and plasma concentrations of EGF and other growth factors are low (&lt;1ng/ml) and there are no obvious sources for high ligand concentrations. Most of the literature over the last two decades suggests that autocrine signaling is the primary determinant driving EGFR occupancy in cells. For example, mutations that abrogate the activity of ligand &quot;sheddases&quot; (e.g. TACE) have essentially the same effect as knocking out the EGFR, demonstrating the critical role of local production of ligands in regulating EGFR activity (PMID: 9812885). There is also a large literature on regulation of autocrine ligands which shows that (a) their rate of production controls the level of activation of the EGFR in situ, (b) they cannot be effectively measured in situ because they are essentially consumed as quickly as they are produced and (c) they are produced at extremely low levels (e.g. see PMID: 11493669). These prior studies support both the approach and conclusions of the authors, but observing low levels of receptor activation in vivo certainly should not have come as such a surprise.</p><p>The idea that high concentrations of EGFR ligands (e.g. &gt;1ng/ml) are not physiologically relevant has been extensively discussed in the literature for many years and thus this conclusion is confirmatory at best. For example, mitogenesis (Albeck et al., 2013), endosomal sorting (Villasenor et al., 2015), adaptor phosphorylation (Krall et al., 2011), and ERK phosphorylation (Shi et al., 2016) all saturate at around 1ng/ml EGF, to cite just a handful of recent papers.

Thus, indeed, low levels of EGFR activity in vivo could have been expected, perhaps, except for the liver. That said, it is important to stress that studies listed above and most of other quantitative studies of EGFR signaling were performed in cultured cells or normal tissues, whereas our studies are aimed at the quantitative analysis of EGFR activities in <underline>tumors</underline> in vivo. Several major groups maintain that they study EGFR using high ligand concentrations because an autocrine production of ligands may be elevated in tumors in vivo (due to increased gene expression, trans-activation of shedding enzymes by other signaling systems, and other mechanisms). Additionally, tumor cells may be exposed to a high concentration of EGFR ligands due to increased paracrine ligand production, e.g. by infiltrating TAMs (tumor-associated macrophages). Clearly, the regulation of ligand levels is tumor-type-specific, and these levels cannot be simply extrapolated from in vitro studies, but must be directly examined in a particular experimental model of tumorigenesis. Therefore, it was essential to perform studies of EGFR activities directly in EGFR-dependent tumors in vivo, and using comparative analysis of in vitro versus in vivo EGFR activities in the same cells.</p><p>I must admit that extremely low levels of EGFR endocytosis and activity that we observed in tumors in vivo were surprising to me, despite my own views on this issue and my efforts over the years to convince the EGFR community that low EGFR ligand concentrations should be used in experiments. Importantly, our experiments showed that even with the cell-to-cell heterogeneity of the EGFR activity in the tumor, the number of active EGFR per tumor cell in vivo would not exceed the threshold leading to the activation of a multitude of signaling pathways and clathrin-independent internalization of EGFR observed in vitro when receptor-saturating ligand concentrations are used.</p><p>We greatly appreciate that the reviewers recognize the importance of EGFR ligand concentrations and share our view that low EGFR ligand concentrations are physiologically relevant. Unfortunately, this is not the case for the vast majority of EGFR researchers. For example, among most recent 15 Pubmed citations on the keyword “EGFR”, 13 papers used EGF at concentrations 20 ng/ml or higher, the most popular EGF concentration was 100 ng/ml, and none used ligands at less than 1 ng/ml. In most of these papers, measurements of EGF response were routine, and high concentrations were used not “because of insensitivity of analytical measurement techniques”. In the revised manuscript, we emphasized that qualitatively different conclusions can be made about the biology of the EGFR system using high versus low ligand concentrations (Discussion section). This point can be further illustrated by an example of a recent high-profile publication (Caldieri et al., 2017) describing a novel mechanism of clathrin-independent endocytosis of EGFR. This is an excellent and pioneering study, which may, however, mislead EGFR researchers who are studying the role of EGFR endocytosis in tumorigenesis and developing approaches for altering receptor trafficking in tumors.</p><p>In summary, we made following changes in the revised manuscript:</p><p>1) We cite and discuss papers listed above by the reviewers (Introduction; Discussion section) and additionally, with regards to the saturation of the endosomal sorting, we cite an earlier study by French et al. that originally demonstrated the saturation of EGF degradation system by increasing ligand concentrations (Introduction).</p><p>2) We state in subsection “ERK1/2 pathway is the primary signaling axis that is significantly activated by picomolar EGFR ligand concentrations” that the pattern of activation of various signaling pathways by EGFR in HSC3 cells in vitro is similar to that pattern observed in other cell types in previous studies.</p><p>3) We cite additional papers that propose increased autocrine and paracrine production of EGFR ligands that are accessible to cells in tumors (Discussion section) to emphasize the importance of our findings obtained by the direct examination of the activity and endocytic mechanisms of EGFR in <underline>tumors</underline> in vivo.</p><p>4) The expression “surprisingly” was omitted in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors use a tumor type that overexpress EGFR. Thus, despite the use of endogenous labeling techniques, they are still dealing with cells overexpressing the EGFR. This should be more clearly pointed out as a caveat of their studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have chosen HSC3 cells because they (i) were derived from human patient oral carcinoma; (ii) resemble receptor levels of human HNSCC, 90% of which overexpress wild-type EGFR, and (iii) recapitulate the growth dependence of tumors on wild-type EGFR. We clarified the issue of the receptor levels and our rationale for choosing HSC3 in subsection “Generation and characterization of gene-edited HSC3 cells expressing endogenous GFP-tagged EGFR”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The calculation of the concentration of EGF ligands in the tumor is very indirect and we have doubts about the extent to which it should be considered reliable. And there is a nagging question about the extent to which the residual 50% of wild type EGF receptors in the gene-edited cells contribute to the signaling and internalization properties of the cells and tumors. The authors should address both points to the best of their ability in the revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Though we have made all possible efforts to perform quantitative in vitro:in vivo analysis in each set of experiments and conducted double-blind counting of tumor cells accessible to systemic EGF-Rh, we emphasize in the manuscript the Discussion section that our measurements predict a range of the ligand concentration rather than provide a precise measurement of these concentrations.</p><p>With regards to the presence of both untagged and GFP-tagged EGFR in HSC3/EGFR-GFP cells, our biochemical measurements showed no evidence for different signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and trafficking properties of these two EGFR species. While we cannot directly measure endocytosis of untagged EGFR in HSC3/EGFR-GFP cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref> demonstrates an essentially similar extent of EGF-induced degradation of both these EGFR species. To strengthen this point, we performed new experiments in which total EGFR was immunolabeled on tumor sections (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These experiments demonstrate high extent of co-localization and essentially similar localization patterns of GFP and total EGFR, which is indicative of no additional endocytic activity by untagged EGFR.
