spliced mRNA by a specific interaction between its central protein, eIF4AIII, and splicing factor CWC22, we found that eIF4AIII and the other EJC core proteins Y14 and MAGO bind the nascent transcripts of not only intron-containing but also intronless genes on <italic>Drosophila</italic> polytene chromosomes. Additionally, Y14 ChIP-seq demonstrates that association with transcribed genes is also splicing-independent in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. The association of the EJC proteins with nascent transcripts does not require CWC22 and that of Y14 and MAGO is independent of eIF4AIII. We also show that eIF4AIII associates with both polysomal and monosomal RNA in S2 cell extracts, whereas Y14 and MAGO fractionate separately. Cumulatively, our data indicate a global role of eIF4AIII in gene expression, which would be independent of Y14 and MAGO, splicing, and of the EJC, as currently understood.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19881.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19881.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19881.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells and organisms survive and thrive in large part due to the activities of thousands of proteins. The instructions for making these proteins are found in the DNA sequences of genes. However, these genes also tend to contain large sections called introns that do not encode protein.</p><p>To make a protein, the gene’s full sequence is first copied to a temporary molecule called pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA for short). The introns are then removed from the pre-mRNA in a process known as splicing in the cell nucleus, during which the remaining regions of the molecule, called exons, are joined together to form a mature mRNA molecule. This mature mRNA can then move out of the cell nucleus and be used as a template to build proteins around the cell.</p><p>Intriguingly, splicing of the pre-mRNAs in the nucleus affects how the mRNA is used to make proteins in the cytoplasm of the cell. This nucleus-cytoplasm connection is currently explained by the so-called exon junction complex, which is thought to attach to mature mRNAs at the junction between two exons and stay bound until the mRNA moves to the cytoplasm. Evidence suggests the exon junction complex affects how the mRNA is used to make protein, yet little is known about how it would do so.</p><p>Choudhury, Singh et al. examined how exon junction complex proteins bind to newly made RNA in salivary gland cells of fruit flies and in cultured cells. Contrary to expectations, the three proteins thought to make the central part of the exon junction complex were found on different mRNAs and regardless of whether the mRNAs derived from genes with introns. Specifically, one of these proteins – eIF4AIII – can remain on the mRNA independently of the two other exon junction complex proteins or CWC22, a protein required for splicing. CWC22 is also thought to be required for the complex to be deposited precisely at exon junctions in human cells.</p><p>Overall, it appears that our current understanding of the exon junction complex needs to be revised. The findings presented by Choudhury, Singh et al. predict alternative roles for these proteins, particularly eIF4AIII, which will be independent of any deposition of the exon junction complex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19881.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19881.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>EJC</kwd><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>9340/Z/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brogna</surname><given-names>Saverio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RPG-2014-291</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brogna</surname><given-names>Saverio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deposition of the exon junction complex is thought to be the missing link between pre-mRNA splicing and translation in multicellular organisms, but no evidence of such deposition has been found in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pre-mRNA splicing is typically co-transcriptional, yet by modulating the protein composition and conformation of the ribonucleoprotein complex consisting of mature mRNA and associated proteins (mRNP), it can affect cytoplasmic processes such as mRNA localization, translation and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dreyfuss et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Le Hir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moore and Proudfoot, 2009</xref>). The main distinctive feature of spliced mRNAs appears to be the presence of the exon junction complex (EJC), a four-protein core-complex consisting of eIF4AIII, Y14, MAGO and MLN51, which is typically deposited 20–24 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the exon junctions in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kataoka et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le Hir et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saulière et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Singh et al., 2012</xref>). Such sequence-independent but position-specific deposition is initiated by the recruitment of the EJC core protein eIF4AIII to the spliceosome via its association with spliceosome component CWC22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexandrov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbosa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Steckelberg et al., 2012</xref>). While associated with CWC22, eIF4AIII is in an inactive conformation which is incompatible with ATP and RNA binding, and therefore, with EJC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buchwald et al., 2013</xref>). The current model predicts that following exon ligation, eIF4AIII dissociates from CWC22, binds the spliced mRNA, typically at the −24 nt position of exon junction, and then triggers EJC assembly by recruiting the three remaining EJC core proteins, Y14, MAGO and MLN51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballut et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bono et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steckelberg et al., 2015</xref>). The association of MAGO and Y14 stabilizes binding of the complex to mRNA by inhibiting eIF4AIII ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballut et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The EJC core proteins are well conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; where Y14, MAGO and MLN51 are also known as Tsunagi, Mago Nashi and Barentsz, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Macchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mohr et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Palacios et al., 2004</xref>). The genes encoding these four proteins are all required for oskar mRNA localization to the posterior end of the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Macchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mohr et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Palacios et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Eeden et al., 2001</xref>). Specifically, similar to that reported in mammalian cells, the EJC consisting of eIF4AIII-MAGO-Y14 (MLN51 is mostly cytoplasmic) is deposited at the canonical position 20–24 nt upstream of exon junctions on in vitro spliced mRNAs, and both splicing and deposition of the EJC appear to be required for oskar mRNA localization during oogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hachet and Ephrussi, 2004</xref>). Only some introns appear to trigger EJC-dependent nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gatfield et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saulière et al., 2010</xref>). These observations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and recent reports that the EJC is not present at all exon junctions or solely at canonical positions in mammalian cells, raise the possibility that either deposition or stability of the EJC on spliced mRNA might be a regulated process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mühlemann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saulière et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Singh et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, EJC deposition on partially spliced pre-mRNA might modulate splicing of flanking introns in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, yet only for a subset of transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashton-Beaucage et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roignant and Treisman, 2010</xref>).</p><p>With the aim to understand the mechanism that regulates EJC deposition, we used the giant polytene chromosomes from <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary glands. Similar to other eukaryotes, pre-mRNA splicing occurs co-transcriptionally in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khodor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">LeMaire and Thummel, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Osheim et al., 1985</xref>). Therefore, the polytene chromosomes provide an ideal system to visualize and analyze the mechanism of the association of EJC proteins with both pre-mRNA and nascent spliced transcripts. The data we show here reveal that deposition of the EJC proteins eIF4AIII, Y14 and MAGO on nascent transcripts, neither depends on the presence of introns nor requires the spliceosomal protein CWC22 in this organism. Additionally, ChIP-seq analysis of Y14 similarly indicates that this protein associates with transcriptionally active genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells independently of splicing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EJC proteins associate with the nascent transcripts</title><p>Using antibodies against eIF4AIII, MAGO and Y14, which detect the proteins with minimal cross-reactivity in Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), we found that EJC proteins are present in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The absolute amounts of these proteins are comparable between the nucleus and cytoplasm, but as indicated by whole salivary gland immunostaining, they are more concentrated in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). On the polytene chromosomes, the signals of all three proteins are most prevalent at transcriptionally active sites, which correspond to distinct cytologically decondensed segments (interbands) of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This localization is apparent by simultaneously inspecting the intensity profile of the EJC proteins and DAPI signals along the same chromosome segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> rightmost panel); these line profile plots show apparent complementarity of eIF4AIII, Y14 and MAGO signals with DAPI signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>III, VI</italic> and <italic>IX</italic>). The signals of the EJC proteins colocalize with those of RNA Pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, the antibody H5, a marker of transcription elongation recognizes the Ser2 hyperphosphorylated CTD of the largest Pol II subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buratowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O'Brien et al., 1994</xref>). The association of the EJC proteins with polytene chromosomes is predominantly with nascent transcripts as the signals are RNase sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). There is some residual signal of EJC, which cannot be attributed to incomplete RNA digestion, since that of Hrb87F, the hnRNPA1 homologue in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lakhotia et al., 2012</xref>), is completely removed from the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The banding pattern of eIF4AIII at polytene chromosomes is different from that of Y14 and MAGO. While the eIF4AIII signal is detected at every Pol II transcription site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), there are sites at which Y14 and MAGO signals are either absent or just detectable (yellow arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <italic>IV-IX</italic>). As all three EJC antibodies used in the present study were raised in rabbits, we used transgenic flies expressing Y14 and eIF4AIII double tagged with HA and FLAG to analyze further the extent of colocalization of the EJC proteins (Material and methods). The tagged proteins are of the predicted size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>) and show a chromosomal banding pattern very similar to that of the endogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Double immunostaining of tagged Y14, and endogenous MAGO shows complete colocalization along the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that the two proteins are in close association at transcription sites, most likely forming a stable heterodimer, as previously observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lau et al., 2003</xref>). In agreement with the staining patterns of endogenous Y14 and MAGO differing from that of eIF4AIII, Y14 is either absent from, or just detectable, at many sites at which there is a very strong signal for tagged eIF4AIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Cumulatively, our data indicate that the chromosomal binding pattern of Y14 and MAGO differs from that of eIF4AIII, which instead appears to bind at all Pol II transcription sites. In view of the EJC model, at this stage the data could therefore have been interpreted to signify that either Y14 and MAGO associate with eIF4AIII at a later stage, perhaps post-transcriptionally, or as envisaged by previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saulière et al., 2010</xref>), that the EJC is not as stable in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as in mammalian cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19881.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The EJC core proteins associate with nascent transcripts at polytene chromosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunolocalization of EJC proteins (red), eIF4AIII (<italic>I-III</italic>), Y14 (<italic>IV-VI</italic>) and MAGO (<italic>VII-IX</italic>), on salivary gland polytene chromosomes of wandering third instar larvae.

Initially, we reasoned that perhaps Y14 and MAGO associate with eIF4AIII selectively, possibly on nascent transcripts of intron-containing genes. To test this hypothesis, we examined the distribution of the EJC proteins at heat shock genes on polytene chromosomes, some of which characteristically do not carry introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lis et al., 1981</xref>). Remarkably, following heat shock, clear accumulation of the EJC proteins was observed at heat-shock puffs (classically denominated by their chromosomal map position) of both intron-containing genes (63B, encoding Hsp90; and 93D, encoding hsrω lncRNAs) as well as that of intronless genes (87A and 87C, encoding Hsp70; and 95D, encoding Hsp68) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These observations indicated that interaction of the core EJC proteins with nascent RNA might be splicing independent in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. To assess further whether these proteins associate independently of introns under standard growth conditions at non-heat-shock genes, we constructed a novel inducible expression vector and used it to generate two transgenes, one carrying an intron (S118) and another without intron (S136) (Material and methods). A distinctive feature of these transgenes is that they are flanked by an inducible promoter regulated by an ecdysone responsive element (ERE) (Material and methods). Another feature is that they carry lacO repeats at the upstream of the promoter; these repeats can be easily visualized and cytologically mapped by GFP-lacI immunolocalization on polytene chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robinett et al., 1996</xref>). The transgenes were mapped at position 3B on the X chromosome (S118) and at 63B on 3L chromosome (S136) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The genes are transcriptionally silent in in vitro cultured salivary glands in the absence of ecdysone, but upon ecdysone treatment, a large puff is formed at both loci, indicative of strong transcriptional induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Notably, immunostaining revealed that eIF4AIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) as well as Y14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) associate with both transcription puffs, and as expected, there is a strong Pol II Ser2 signal at these loci. These observations therefore indicate that association of the EJC proteins with nascent transcripts can occur independently of splicing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary glands.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19881.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>EJC proteins accumulate at heat shock transcription puffs.</title><p>Parallel immunolocalization of hyperphosphorylated RNA Pol II Ser2 (red, <italic>II, III, V, VI, VIII, IX</italic>) and EJC proteins (green) eIF4AIII (<italic>I, III</italic>), Y14 (<italic>IV</italic>, <italic>VI</italic>), and MAGO (<italic>VII</italic>, <italic>IX</italic>), on polytene chromosomes following heat shock at 37°C for 1 hr.

ChIP experiments were carried out for all three EJC proteins; however, only the Y14 antibody worked well in this assay and produced a clear enrichment profile relative to input DNA; this is most apparent at transcription start sites (TSS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and selectively with genes that are expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Y14 enrichment does not appear to correlate with expression level though. While genes with a very low expression (RPKM between 1 and 10) show lower enrichment, genes ranging from low (RPKM 11–50) to very high expression levels are comparably enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The result of this analysis is therefore consistent with the chromosome immunostaining data shown above, which demonstrated that Y14 and MAGO, unlike eIF4AIII, are either absent or very weak at transcription sites with strong active Pol II signal. Notably Y14 appears to bind both intron-containing and intronless genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and the enrichment is only slightly higher for genes with introns. When all genes, expressed and unexpressed, are included in the analysis, there is a positive correlation between Y14 binding and intron number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>); however, in view that Y14 associates selectively with expressed genes, this must signify that many intronless genes are either not or very weakly expressed. A representative genome browser example of this intron-independent association is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, which corresponds to a region of chromosome three where apparent enrichment is detected at different genes. The highest association is at the <italic>Big brother</italic> (<italic>Bgb</italic>) and <italic>RpL23A</italic> gene loci (indicated by blue and red arrows respectively), both genes are highly expressed in S2 cells, but only <italic>RpL23A</italic> encodes introns. The results of this ChIP-seq analysis are therefore consistent with our observations with polytene chromosomes described above, and further indicate that the association of Y14 with gene loci is dependent on whether they are transcribed, yet unlinked to intron presence. Given that Y14 association with transcription sites is RNA-dependent at the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the prediction is that ChIP is detecting mostly Y14 associated with nascent transcript and that the enrichment at TSSs mirrors that of RNA Pol II, which globally in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as in other metazoan, is detected by ChIP, and other biochemical assays, mostly around TSSs, rather than the gene body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman and Lis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Core et al., 2012</xref>). However, following up on our observation that association of Y14 (and the other EJC proteins) at the chromosomes is not as sensitive to RNase as hnRNPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we examined whether the EJC proteins might also associate with Pol II directly. We immunoprecipitated (IP) elongating RNA Pol II using a Ser2 CTD antibody (Material and methods). The result was that none of the three EJC proteins make an interaction with Pol II which is stable enough to be detect by IP, instead the association with general elongation factor Spt6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaplan et al., 2000</xref>), which was used as a positive control, was readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19881.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Y14 associates with expressed genes independent of introns in S2 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome-wide average Y14 ChIP-seq enrichment 3000 bases around transcription start sites (TSS) of ChIP (blue trace) versus input DNA (green).

The prediction from current models is that depletion of CWC22 (known as Nucampholin or NCM in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) would impair association of eIF4AIII with nascent transcripts. RT-PCR quantification shows that CWC22-RNAi efficiently reduces the CWC22 mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Its depletion in the early stages of development (<italic>fkh-Gal4&gt;NCM-RNAi</italic>) strongly inhibits salivary gland developmental growth and polytenization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), to an extent that we were unable to spread the polytene chromosomes for immunolocalization. Due to unavailability of an antibody, the extent of protein depletion could not be assessed directly. The presence of residual CWC22 could not be ruled out. However, the striking growth phenotype indicates that RNAi is efficient at depleting CWC22 essential function. There are no sequences in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome which could encode similar proteins, the strong phenotype should therefore indicate that there are also no distant-related proteins that could complement CWC22 function in its absence. Therefore, to asses whether CWC22 might have a role in the association of EJC proteins at the chromosomes, the small-gland phenotype was partially circumvented by inhibiting expression of CWC22-RNAi till early third instar larval stage, by co-expression of the temperature-sensitive Gal80 protein, which represses Gal4 activity when larvae are grown at 18°C (<italic>tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>; Fkh-Gal4&gt;NCM-RNAi</italic>). Larvae were then transferred to 29°C and by the late third instar stage the chromosomes were big enough to proceed for immunostaining. Notably, both eIF4AIII and Y14 remain localized in the nucleus in CWC22 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <italic>I-IV</italic> vs. <italic>IX-XII</italic>), and polytene chromosome immunostaining demonstrates that eIF4AIII can still associate with chromosome interbands. Although chromosome morphology is not as well defined in these glands, the banding pattern and relative intensities of the signals are comparable to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <italic>V-VIII</italic>). Additionally, Y14 can also still associate with interbands, producing a staining pattern as intense as, and very similar to, that in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <italic>XIII-XVI</italic>). These observations demonstrate that while CWC22 has an essential function in salivary gland development, it does not appear to be required for the association of eIF4AIII and Y14 (and by inference MAGO) with the nascent transcripts in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19881.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>EJC proteins associate with nascent transcripts independently of CWC22 (NCM).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Real-time PCR quantification of NCM RNA level in salivary glands of <italic>tubGAL80<sup>ts</sup>; +; FkhGAL4&gt;NCM-RNAi</italic> (right) relative to that in wild type (left).

We tested this by visualizing the distribution of Y14 on the polytene chromosomes from salivary glands depleted of eIF4AIII by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B and C</xref>). As for CWC22, depletion of eIF4AIII from an early stage of development (<italic>Fkh-Gal4&gt;eIF4AIII-RNAi</italic>) strongly inhibits salivary gland growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>); therefore, indicating that RNAi is effectively depleting an essential function of the protein. Again, the phenotype prevented polytenization of the chromosomes. However, by restricting RNAi activation until early third instar stage, (using <italic>tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>; Fkh-Gal4&gt;eIF4AIII-RNAi</italic>) glands were big enough to prepare satisfactory chromosome spreads for immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Remarkably, we observed that despite the drastic reduction in chromosomal eIF4AIII signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>VII</italic> and <italic>VIII</italic> vs. <italic>V</italic> and <italic>VI</italic>), and despite the low level of polytenization, Y14 could still be detected at cytologically distinguishable interbands, similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>XV</italic> and <italic>XVI</italic> vs. <italic>XIII</italic> and <italic>XIV</italic>). In contrast to depletion of CWC22 and eIF4AIII which strongly inhibited salivary glands growth, depletion of either Y14 or MAGO resulted in visually normal salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), despite their depletion being very efficient, based on salivary gland Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). Although some Y14 signal persists in the nucleolus (which often remains attached to the chromosomes during the spreading procedure), the respective chromosomal signals are completely absent from the chromosome arms (6F, <italic>I</italic> and <italic>II</italic>). Particularly, depletion of neither Y14 nor MAGO affects the association of eIF4AIII with the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,</xref> <italic>V</italic> and <italic>XI</italic>); we observed instead that depletion of Y14 eliminates MAGO from the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <italic>III</italic> and <italic>IV</italic>) and depletion of MAGO also reduces the Y14 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <italic>IX</italic> and <italic>X</italic>). In summary, these observations indicate that association of Y14 (and by inference MAGO) with nascent transcripts does not require eIF4AIII and that of eIF4AIII is independent of Y14 or MAGO. Additionally, the RNAi phenotype of eIF4AIII is drastically different: while eIF4AIII knockdown impairs salivary gland development, neither that of Y14 nor MAGO has any apparent visual phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19881.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>eIF4AIII is not required for the association of Y14 and MAGO with nascent transcript.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunolocalization of EJC proteins (red) eIF4AIII and Y14 in whole salivary gland (<italic>I</italic>-<italic>IV</italic>, <italic>IX</italic>-<italic>XII</italic>) and polytene chromosomes (<italic>V</italic>-<italic>VIII</italic>, <italic>XIII</italic>-<italic>XVI</italic>), in wild type (left panels) and <italic>tubGAL80<sup>ts</sup>; +; fkhGAL4/eIF4AIII-RNAi</italic> (right panels) larvae.

A key observation supporting this model is that Y14 is present in monosomal but not polysomal fractions in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diem et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dostie and Dreyfuss, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gehring et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore analyzed the distribution of the EJC proteins in polysomal fractions of <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. Surprisingly, we detected neither Y14 nor MAGO in monosomal fractions; both proteins remain on the top of the gradient, corresponding to free proteins or small molecular weight complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In contrast, eIF4AIII was detected in all the fractions, but it was least abundant in the fraction containing Y14 and MAGO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). There is a small correlation between eIF4AIII levels and the ribosomal trace; however, eIF4AIII is no more abundant in either monosomal or lighter fractions, it is therefore unlikely that more of it is associated with mRNAs at or before the first round of translation when they are loaded with just one ribosome or with the 40S ribosomal subunit. Such distribution suggests that eIF4AIII is not removed by translation and remains associated actively translated mRNA; this interpretation is further substantiated by the fact that mild RNase treatment, which breaks down polysomes by digesting the mRNA (Material and methods), shifts most of eIF4AIII into lighter sub-ribosomal fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The sedimentation of Y14 and MAGO is not affected by the RNase treatment. In vitro dissociation of polysomes by EDTA treatment also shifts most of eIF4AIII in the lightest fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, lane 12), indicative of both polysome breakdown and perhaps release of the protein from mRNA. Notably, a portion of eIF4AIII apparently co-fractionates with the 60S ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, lanes 9 and 10), and seemingly to a lesser extent with the 40S (fraction 11 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; the red arrow indicates a faster migrating form of the protein in lane 12, which possibly was generated by proteolysis during the in-vitro incubation). Some of eIF4AIII might fractionate with ribosomal subunits also in the untreated sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, fractions 9 and 10). We investigated further whether there is an association with ribosomal subunits by pre-treatment of the cell culture with puromycin, followed by dissociation of the subunits by incubation at either 4°C or room temperature in presence of high-salt in vitro prior to loading on the gradient (Material and methods). This treatment also delocalized eIF4AIII to lighter fractions, consistent with most of the protein being associated with actively translated mRNA. The majority of the protein was detected in the top two light fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, lanes 11 and 12; as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, a large fraction of the protein runs as a faster migrating photolytic cleavage product). Cumulatively, the data demonstrate that eIF4AIII cosediments with both monosomes and polysomes, yet Y14 and MAGO fractionate separately in normal conditions, and therefore, it is not likely they form a stable complex with eIF4AIII on translating mRNA in S2 cells. Although some eIF4AIII is detected in the light fraction containing Y14 and MAGO, this is a relatively very minor amount of what is found in the heavier fractions (possibly the result of some unavoidable mixing during fractionation).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19881.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>eIF4AIII but not Y14-MAGO associates with ribosome-loaded mRNA in S2 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Polysome profiling of cytoplasmic extracts of S2 cells, and Western blotting of corresponding fractions, show distribution of eIF4AIII (upper lane), Y14 (middle lane) and MAGO (lower lane).

To further investigate this, we assayed protein levels following RNAi-mediated knockdown of Y14, MAGO and eIF4AIII in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. Notably, consistent with what we observed at the chromosomes, knockdown of Y14 drastically reduces MAGO, and conversely, MAGO knockdown reduces the level of Y14, although not completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In both cases, the level of eIF4AIII was not affected. Furthermore, while knockdown of eIF4AIII led to an overall reduction in protein levels, it did not noticeably affect Y14 or MAGO. The inter-dependence is most likely the result of a change in stability of the proteins, as depletion of Y14 does not affect MAGO mRNA level and that of MAGO does not affect Y14 mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

Our data indicate that Y14 and MAGO form an obligatory heterodimer in vivo, as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lau et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Le Hir et al., 2001</xref>). Y14/MAGO associates with nascent transcripts on polytene chromosomes, yet this association neither correlates with, nor requires eIF4AIII, suggesting that the Y14/MAGO heterodimer engages with nascent mRNAs independently of eIF4AIII. Moreover, Y14 and MAGO do not cosediment with eIF4AIII by sucrose gradient fractionation of S2 cell cytoplasmic extracts, indicating that these proteins are not forming a stable complex with eIF4AIII. As Y14 and MAGO stay on the top of the gradient, it is most likely that they are not bound to mRNA in the cytoplasm. In contrast, eIF4AIII associates with mRNA loaded with multiple ribosomes; it does not therefore appear to be removed, at least not irreversibly, by translocating ribosomes. Perhaps eIF4AIII primarily binds mRNA UTRs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cytoplasmic extracts, and, to a smaller extent, as indicated by our sucrose fractionation data, ribosomal subunits, rather than coding regions, as reported for mammalian whole-cell lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saulière et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Singh et al., 2012</xref>). Particularly, our data indicate that Y14-MAGO dissociates from mRNA before translation initiation, unlike in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diem et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dostie and Dreyfuss, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gehring et al., 2009</xref>). This interpretation is consistent with the report that Partner of Y14-MAGO (PYM) does not engage with the ribosome and that PYM-mediated dissociation of EJC proteins from oskar mRNA is independent of translation in ovarian extracts in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We speculate that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> eIF4AIII, similar to related RNA helicases, dynamically binds mRNA in an ATP-driven reaction rather than making a stable interaction with a specific location on the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Linder and Jankowsky, 2011</xref>). Our data suggest that eIF4AIII is a general mRNP component, and it may therefore have a global role in pre-mRNA processing and translation, independently of splicing and EJC assembly in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The protein shares extensive sequence and domain similarity with the essential eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4A across eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parsyan et al., 2011</xref>), which is its closest homolog in <italic>Drosophila</italic> with 71% aminoacid sequence identity. The protein eIF4A is the prototype of an RNA helicase which is required for unwinding 5’UTR secondary structures during the initial recruitment of the ribosome to mRNA 5’ end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Linder and Jankowsky, 2011</xref>). Consistent with this role, eIF4A was reported to sediment in lighter sucrose fraction corresponding to mRNAs not yet engaged in translation elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bordeleau et al., 2006</xref>). However, as we find eIF4AIII in heavy polysomal fractions, we predict that the protein might mostly bind 3’UTRs rather than 5’UTRs of polysomal mRNA. What the significance is of the partial cosedimentation of eIF4AIII with ribosomal subunits will need to be investigated. In this respect, eIF4AIII might be similar to VASA, another eIF4A-related protein that is required for germline differentiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; VASA appears to regulate translation via its association with specific 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). While it has long been understood that human eIF4AIII is functionally distinct from eIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parsyan et al., 2011</xref>), it was recently reported that the protein enhances translation of mRNAs associated with the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC) in human cells, independently of the presence of introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choe et al., 2014</xref>). As depletion of eIF4AIII impairs salivary gland growth, we predict that its essential role in <italic>Drosophila</italic> development might primarily reflect a global requirement in translation, rather than localization of specific mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Palacios et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Depletion of the EJC proteins causes changes in splicing patterns in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashton-Beaucage et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Michelle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roignant and Treisman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). These changes can be interpreted in two ways: either canonical EJC deposition can influence splicing of neighbouring introns or the EJC proteins can affect splice site recognition by being functional components of pre-spliceosome intermediates. Both interpretations are based on the assumption that EJC assembly is either constitutively coupled to splicing in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ghosh et al., 2012</xref>), or that it is at least deposited on a subset of spliced mRNAs or pre-mRNAs. Our data are inconsistent with these interpretations. We cannot exclude the possibility that the EJCs may be deposited at specific junctions on some mRNAs, and that these are stable enough to persist through nuclear export and cytoplasmic mRNA localization in some cells, oocytes in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hachet and Ephrussi, 2004</xref>). While the Y14 ChIP-assay shows slightly higher association with genes containing multiple introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), this might be a consequence of their higher transcription rate, rather than being driven by a direct interaction with spliceosome components. The most parsimonious explanation is that the so-called EJC proteins bind nascent transcripts independently of splicing and eIF4AIII, and therefore may not form a stable complex which can tag splice junctions, or even spliced mRNPs, on <italic>Drosophila</italic> mRNAs. Therefore, the mechanisms by which these proteins regulate pre-mRNA splicing, transposon activity, mRNA localization and translation possibly need to be re-examined in the context of the absence of an EJC.</p><p>A well-characterized function of the EJC is its role in linking pre-mRNA splicing to translation and NMD in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chazal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Le Hir and Séraphin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Saltzman et al., 2008</xref>). While this might apply to some <italic>Drosophila</italic> introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saulière et al., 2010</xref>), it has instead been reported that splicing does not affect NMD of well-characterized mRNA reporters in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gatfield et al., 2003</xref>). Additionally, deposition of the EJC, or a similar complex which would tag splice junctions, does not appear to be the mechanism that links pre-mRNA splicing to NMD in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wen and Brogna, 2010</xref>).

The supernatant and pellet were resolved as cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunoprecipitation (IP)</title><p>S2 cells nuclei were isolated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khodor et al., 2011</xref>), and lysed in 5 vol of lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 110 mM potassium acetate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween-20, 10 mM MnCl2, 1X EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), 1X PhosStop (Roche) and 50 U/ml Ribolock RNase inhibitor) with 110 U/ml RNase-free DNase (Roche) and incubated for 1 hr at 4°C on rotator. The suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was transferred in fresh tube and incubated with 20 µL of DynabeadsProtein-G (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which were coated with 5 µg of RNA Pol II Ser2 antibody (Merck Millipore), for 1 hr at 4°C on a rotator. The beads were washed with wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 110 mM potassium acetate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween-20, 50 U/mL RNase inhibitor, 4 mM MnCl2) and mixed with cleared cell supernatant and incubated for 1 hr at 4°C on rotator. Beads were washed 3X with wash buffer. For RNase treatment, the beads were incubated with 1 mg/ml RNase in wash buffer, while control sample was incubated in same buffer without RNase at 4°C for 20 min on rotator. The beads were further washed three times with wash buffer and bound proteins were then eluted in 40 µL SDS-sample buffer and boiled 7 min prior loading on the SDS-PAGE gel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>ChIP-seq and sequence analysis</title><p>S2 cells (10<sup>7</sup>) were fixed in 1% formaldehyde (EM grade, Polyscience) for 15 min at room temperature and then transferred in 125 mM glycine for 5 min to stop the cross-linking reaction. Following centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C, the cell pellet was resuspended in 500 µL of PBS containing EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and washed twice. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 µL of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA) and sonicated at high intensity for 12 min with 15 s on/off cycles in a Bioruptor sonicator (Diagenode). Samples were diluted in 1 ml ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 167 mM NaCl) and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 18°C. An aliquot (100 µL) of soluble chromatin was kept to extract input DNA. For each ChIP, typically 2 µg of antibody was incubated with 25 µL of DynabeadsProtein-G beads at 4°C overnight. Beads were washed four times with 1 mL of PBS with 5 mg/ml BSA, and resuspended in 40 µL of PBS with 5 mg/mL BSA. The coated beads were then added to the remaining chromatin sample and incubated for two and a half hours at room temperature with rotation. Beads were then sequentially washed with 1 mL of low-salt wash (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCL pH 8.1, 150 mM NaCl); high-salt wash (as above but with 500 mM NaCl); LiCl wash (0.25M LiCl, 1% IGEPAL-CA630, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCL (pH 8.1); two 5 min washes in 1 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA). The beads were then incubated with elution buffer (0.1M NaHC0<sub>3</sub>, 1% SDS) at a room temperature for 15 min and reverse crosslinks overnight at 65°C in presence of Proteinase K (2 µL of 50 mg/ml). Chromatin was purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). ChIP and input DNA were further fragmented to 250 bp fragment size using a Covaris S2 focused ultrasonicator prior to library preparation, sequencing and genome mapping was as previously described using SOLiD four genome analyser (Life Technologies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kwon et al., 2016</xref>). Reads were aligned to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome (BDGP R5/dm3 assembly). Average enrichments across gene regions were calculated and plotted prior or after background (input DNA) subtraction. Genes were divided as expressed (RPKM &gt;= 1) or unexpressed (RPKM = 0) based on expression level calculated using <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell expression data (GEO accession no. GSM410195). Average Y14 enrichment was also plotted at expressed gene further divided based on the number of introns (0,1,2,3,4, &gt;= 5) as annotated in R5/dm3 assembly. All our Chip-seq data were deposited in the GEO repository (accession no. GSE84595).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Polytene chromosomes and whole salivary gland immunostaining</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, polytene chromosomes squashes were prepared from salivary glands, dissected in 1X PBS (13 mM NaCl, 0.7 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.3 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4) and transferred to 1% Triton X-100 in 1X PBS for 30 s. Glands were then transferred to 3.7% formaldehyde in 1X PBS followed by 3.7% formaldehyde with 45% acetic acid for 1 min each. Finally, glands were transferred to 45% acetic acid for 1 min and squashed under a coverslip as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Singh and Lakhotia, 2012</xref>). In some of the experiments, salivary glands were dissected out in a different dissection buffer (15 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 60 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Spermine, 1.5 mM Spermidine and 1% Triton) and then processed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Jubran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rugjee et al., 2013</xref>). Both procedures produce similar immunostaining results. For RNase treatment, salivary glands were dissected in M3 media and incubated in a solution containing 1% Triton X-100 in M3 media for 2 min at room temperature. Glands were then transferred to M3 media with or without 1 mg/ml RNase A (Invitrogen, California, USA) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. For whole salivary gland immunostaining, larvae were dissected in M3 media, glands were immediately fixed in ice cold PBS with 4% formaldehyde (10% EM grade, Polyscience) and processed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Jubran et al., 2013</xref>). All the glands were mounted in PromoFluor Antifade Reagent (PromoKine). Images were taken using either a Nikon Eclipse Ti epifluorescence microscope, equipped with ORCA-R2 camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) or a Leica TCS SP2-AOBS confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Polysome profiling and protein extraction</title><p>S2 cells were grown in a T75 tissue culture flask as described above until they reached 80% confluence. Cultures were briefly treated with 25 µg/mL cycloheximide for 5 min, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min and washed by resuspension in ice cold buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 2 mM magnesium chloride, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 100 mM potassium acetate, prepared in DEPC treated H<sub>2</sub>O). Cells were pelleted again, resuspended and left to lyse by incubating on ice for 10 min in 600 µL lysis buffer (HEPES buffer with 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT, 1.2 µL Ribolock RNase inhibitor, 250 µg/mL heparin, 0.6% Triton X-100 and 1X complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail). The lysate was cleared twice by centrifugation at maximum speed in a microfuge for 10 min. For RNase-treated samples, RNase inhibitor was excluded from the lysis buffer and 10 µL of 1 mg/mL RNase A was added to the cleared lysate and incubated on ice for 10 min. For EDTA treatment, the cleared lysate was supplemented with 30 mM EDTA for 30 min on ice prior fractionation. For puromycin treatment, 100 µg/mL puromycin was added to the cleared lysate and incubated either on ice or at room temperature for 30 min. The lysis buffer used for the puromycin treatment was as described above, but supplemented with 375 mM KCl and lacked magnesium as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Jubran et al., 2013</xref>). The equivalent of about 20 absorbance units at OD<sub>260</sub> (NanoDrop readings, blanked with water) was loaded onto a 10–50% (w/v) sucrose gradient; gradients were prepared using a gradient mixer which mixed 50% and 10% stock sucrose solutions prepared in polysome buffer (10 mM Tris acetate pH7.4, 70 mM ammonium acetate, 4 mM magnesium acetate, 25 µg/mL cycloheximide in DEPC treated H<sub>2</sub>O), dispensing directly into SW41 rotor tubes (Beckman Coulter). Puromycin treated samples were loaded on 10–30% sucrose gradients instead of 10–50% prepared as described above but lacking magnesium. Samples were centrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 160 min at 4°C. Fractions were collected by inserting a steel capillary needle to the bottom of the tube, through which the gradient was pumped using a peristaltic pump through an ISCO UA-6 absorbance detector (254 nm) connected to a plotter. Gradients were dispensed as ~800 µL aliquots using a fraction collector. Proteins were extracted using the methanol/chloroform method. A 200 µL aliquot of each fraction was mixed with 800 µL of methanol in a 1.5 mL tube to which 200 µL chloroform was then added and vortexed, followed by addition of 400 µL of H<sub>2</sub>O. The sample was then vortexed followed by centrifugation at maximum speed for 5 min (proteins/RNA form a white disc at the aqueous/organic interface). The upper phase was discarded and 900 µL of methanol was added, mixed by inversion and centrifuged again for 5 min. The protein-containing pellets were air dried and analyzed by standard SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Carl Thummel for providing a clone of the ERE cassette, Ido Golding for plasmids with MS2 repeats, and Julio Vazquez for providing GFP-LacI fly stocks.

Please address the points raised by the reviewers as thoroughly as possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Brogna and coworkers describes a series of experiments indicating that some core components of the EJC complex associate with nascent transcripts independently of each other, suggesting that the EJC may not assemble in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In particular the authors investigated the association of eIF4AIII and Y14:Mago heterodimers with polytene chromosomes. They observed that while Y14:Mago colocalize their staining pattern does not always overlap with that of eIF4AIII, although some overlap is observed.</p><p>Furthermore the proteins associated with both intron-containing and intronless transcripts suggesting that their binding is not coupled to splicing. Finally, the authors show that depletion of CWC22, which acts downstream of eIF4AIII in human cells, has no effect on eIF4AIII or Y14:Mago deposition, suggesting that models based on vertebrate systems may not apply to invertebrates.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Choudhury and colleagues stained polytene chromosome spreads of <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary glands with anti-EJC factor antibodies and found that eIF4A3 appears to be present at all transcribed loci, whereas Y14 and MAGO co-localized but only were detected at a fraction of the interbands/puffs. Since heat shock loci with and without introns were all stained by all three EJC Abs (eIF4A3, Y14 and MAGO), the authors conclude that the observed Y14 and MAGO pattern does not correlate with the presence of introns in the respective genes. Supporting this conclusion, they also introduced two ecdysone-inducible transgenes, one without and one with introns, into the genome and also reported association of all three EJC factors with both genes (although they only show the data for eIF4A3). A ChIP-seq experiment detected Y14 enriched at transcription start sites, irrespective if the gene had introns or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), but curiously the Y14 association seemed to peak around the transcription start sites (see below).</p><p>To analyze the interdependence of these factors' chromatin association, the authors performed knockdowns of CWC22, eIF4A3, Y14 and MAGO in the salivary glands followed by immunostainings of polytene chromosome squashes. CWC22 and eIF4A3 knockdowns gave a negative result, which prevents any firm conclusions. Knockdown of Y14 and MAGOH had no effect on the localization of eIF4A3 but destabilized the respective partner in the heterodimer and hence prevented each other's association with chromatin. Finally, to corroborate their evidence that eIF4A3 associates with RNA independently of Y14/MAGO, the authors showed that eIF4A3 and Y14/MAGO fractionate differently in sucrose gradients, suggesting that the Y14/MAGO heterodimer does not form a stable complex with eIF4A3 on translation mRNA in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells.</p><p>The author's conclusion challenges the current view that <italic>Drosophila</italic> EJC factors form mainly canonical EJCs on mRNA. They propose instead independent association and functions of eIF4A3 and Y14/MAGO. I would however argue that the possibility should be considered that a majority of these 3 proteins might occur in association with RNA polymerase II and only a small proportion is found in assembled EJCs at steady-state in a cell. The authors would then have observed mainly these pol II-associated proteins in their experiments. Can the authors rule out this interpretation?</p><p>Specific points to address:</p><p>1) It would be nice to see a co-staining with anti-HA and with anti-Y14 or anti-MAGO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref> to confirm that the two Abs give identical staining patterns.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: Show the Y14 and MAGO stains at the transgene loci along with the eIF4A3 staining.

Assuming random fragmentation of the chromatin, this would indicate that there must be significant amounts of Y14 associated with chromatin upstream of the TSS. Did the authors check in the ChIP experiments if the obtained signal was RNase sensitive? Could it be that the observed enrichment at TSS is due to pol II associated Y14 that is preferentially captured in this ChIP? How long is the average DNA fragment length obtained after the sonication following cell lysis? In my view, the distribution of Y14 in these ChIP-seq experiment does not fit with the authors' overall conclusions.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: The CWC22 knockdown experiment is inconclusive with respect to the necessity of CWC22 requirement for EJC factor association with chromatin, because it is a negative result and there is a lack of showing how much the CWC22 protein abundance was effectively reduced.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: For a non-expert, it is difficult to appreciate from the eIF4A3 knockdown glands the interbands in the polytene squash and hence whether Y14 co-localizes there.

In addition, as for CWC22, there is the general issue here that knockdowns yielding negative results (i.e. nothing changes) remain inconclusive.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript Chouduryet al. study the interaction of Exon Junction Complex (EJC) subunits with the nascent RNA in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In mammals, the EJC is known to be deposited during splicing at a well-defined position relative to the exon-exon junction and has many roles including earmarking mRNAs containing premature stop codons for degradation. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the role of the EJC and its modalities of deposition remain poorly understood, in spite of the conservation of the individual EJC components. The prevailing model for the deposition of the EJC on the RNA posits that the eIF4AIII component is first recruited during splicing via an interaction with a splicing factor, CWC22. In a second time, eIFIIIA recruits the core EJC (MLN51, Y14 and MAGO).</p><p>In this study, the authors use a combination of immunostaining and ChIP Seq analyses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and report the interesting and surprising finding that the recruitment of the core EJC does not require splicing or the CWC22 splicing factor in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. They also show that Y14 and Mago appear to be recruited independently of eIF4AIII to the nascent RNA and have a different distribution in polysomal fraction then the former.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19881.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>As you will see, all referees thought that the work was potentially quite interesting and significant but all also raised a number of concerns that must be dealt with before the manuscript can be reconsidered.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Although the paper is well done, it is difficult to draw strong conclusions from RNAi-based depletions, as these depletions are not complete and the residual amounts of the proteins may be sufficient to sustain function, at least partially.

Westerns blots should be included for these proteins.</italic> </p><p>There might be some residual CWC22 and eIF4AIII, yet, the no-growth phenotype should indicate that both RNAi knockdowns are efficient in depleting these proteins essential function. As we explained in the Results section, when we drive expression of either RNAi construct early in glands development (with Fkh-Gal4), the salivary glands are underdeveloped to an extent that make it difficult to dissect them and to prepare chromosome squashes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). So, to be able do the experiments, we partially circumvent this phenotype by inducing RNAi at a later developmental stage (early 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae). Yet as the larvae are shifted to the RNAi-permissive temperature the salivary glands fail to grow any further, consistent with protein depletion being efficient and rapid. Unfortunately, no antibody is available for fly CWC22, but the mRNA reduction is apparent. It should also be added that dissection of such small glands make it prone to contamination with fragments of fat body (the white-looking tissue seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> which is now labeled with fb on the pictures; these were not targeted by RNAi. Some of the mRNA detected by qRT-PCR is likely to derive from these difficult to avoid contamination even by the most experienced of us. As for eIF4AIII RNAi, even though the glands are particularly small, even under the conditional knockdown setting, immunostaining of the whole glands shows very apparent depletion of the protein in the nucleus and at the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, panel III and VII respectively). Instead, the signal remains intense in the nuclei of the adhering fatbody. Instigated by the reviewer’s criticism we now dissected enough glands for Western blotting, the result is that also the protein level is very reduced (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Related to CWC22, can the authors rule out that a functional analog operates in Drosophila?</italic> </p><p>There are no apparent sequences in the fly genome which could encode similar proteins, and, given the strong phenotype, genetically it does not seem likely that there is some evolutionarily distant protein that in CWC22 absence could complement its function or functions. We now discuss this point directly in the section where we describe the CWC22 results in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) Although the data supports a model suggesting that Y14 and Mago have functions independent of eIF4AIII and splicing and vice versa, it is possible that EJC deposition occurs at some splice junctions. Essentially the data presented in this manuscript is rather qualitative and lacks sequence resolution to make very strong conclusions. Therefore, the authors should tone down some of the conclusions.</italic> </p><p>We agree and have tried to make it clearer in the revised Discussion (and in the more detailed response to reviewer 3 points) that we cannot formally exclude that EJC deposition occurs at some junctions (such as those reported previously by Ghosh et al. 2012). However, our data indicate that globally these proteins bind nascent RNA independently of splicing and that binding of Y14/MAGO does not require eIF4AIII.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should consider the possibility that a majority of these 3 proteins might occur in association with RNA polymerase II and only a small proportion is found in assembled EJCs at steady-state in a cell. The authors would then have observed mainly these pol II-associated proteins in their experiments. Can the authors rule out this interpretation?</italic> </p><p>We cannot exclude that a minor fraction of the proteins associate with Pol II. We had considered this possibility at length. Particularly initially, following some preliminary experiments which indicated that the chromosomal signal was only slightly sensitive to RNase compared to that of Sm proteins (Y12 antibody) which we used as a positive control at the time. However, all subsequent experiments in which we used hnRNPA1 as comparison, showed visibly apparent RNase sensitivity. Perhaps the snRNAs to which Sm proteins are bound are more sensitive to RNase digestion then nascent RNA. Why the EJC signal is not as sensitive to RNase-treatment as that of hnRNPA1, remains unclear. The residual signal might signify some association with Pol II, but it could also mean that these proteins can make secondary contacts with chromatin components or perhaps DNA directly at the loosely packed interbands, which may or may not be of functional significance. It is also possible that such secondary contacts are produced promiscuously during the 20 minutes unphysiological incubation in which gland membranes are permeabilised to allow RNase access. Early in the work, we had done some preliminary Pol II IP in which could not detect any interaction with EJC proteins. In view of the criticism, we have optimized our Pol II solubilization and performed additional Co-IP experiments. The result is that none of the EJC proteins Co-IP with Pol II while general transcription elongation factor Spt6, which was used as positive control clearly does (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In summary, while we cannot exclude that a minor fraction of the proteins are in contact with Pol II directly, particularly Y14/MAGO as it is not associated to RNA in the cytoplasm, cumulatively the data should indicate that these proteins primarily bind RNA directly at transcription sites, and independently of splicing. We discuss this point further in our response below to reviewer 2 point 3.</p><p><italic>The individual reviews are pasted below.

The colocalisation we have shown between MAGO and HA-Flag double tagged Y14 is unambiguous though (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>) and it seems to us a more convincing sign that the tagged proteins are functional, as well as Y14 and MAGO strictly colocalising. That previous staining was with anti-FLAG together with anti-MAGO, in the revision we also show the result of a similar double-staining for Y14-HA and MAGO (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: Show the Y14 and MAGO stains at the transgene loci along with the eIF4A3 staining.

As we have shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and associated supplements, MAGO and Y14 invariably colocalise producing indistinguishable immunostaining patterns. In view of this and the data indicating that the proteins form constitutive heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, see also reviewer 3 point 4 and 5), staining for both proteins seemed unnecessary, this is why here and in later experiments we used only anti-Y14 which is a more sensitive and reliable antibody.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: How do the authors explain the Y14-enrichment shoulder upstream of the TSS? Assuming random fragmentation of the chromatin, this would indicate that there must be significant amounts of Y14 associated with chromatin upstream of the TSS.

How long is the average DNA fragment length obtained after the sonication following cell lysis? In my view, the distribution of Y14 in these ChIP-seq experiment does not fit with the authors' overall conclusions.</italic></p><p>We don’t yet have an explanation for this interesting “left shoulder”, perhaps some derives from some bidirectional transcription, which though far less prevalent than in mammalian cells it was reported also in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Core et al., 2012), or, more likely possible, might reflect high occurrence of head-to-head gene pairs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> which are transcribed from separate promoters in opposite directions. An example of such gene pair is shown center of the IGB profile in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>: CG7970-Vta1 which both are expressed in S2 cells (info in Flybase). Clearly these are hypotheses that will need to be addressed directly by future studies.</p><p>Unfortunately we have not done the RNase control when the ChIP-seq experiments were originally done due to financial considerations and also in view that such assay is not always straightforward to interpret. Standard ChIP protocols, like the one that it was used here, involves extensive cell fixation which not only crosslinks the protein of interest to the nascent transcript but also indirectly via multiple protein-protein linkages to chromatin. Based on our experience, the apparent RNase sensitivity of the polytene signals is a more convincing indication that the protein associates mostly with the nascent transcript.</p><p>We disagree that the ChIP-seq profile does not fit with our overall conclusion. Although, as we discussed above, it is possible that some of Y14 might bind directly to Pol II, it is also feasible that ChIP is biased to detect Y14 that is in close proximity to DNA as this would be less likely to break off during sonication (the sonication cycle we use produces fragments of around 500bp). Additionally, as ChIP and other assays have shown that the majority of Pol II is found near TSS in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as in mammalian cells (Core et al. 2012, and references therein), the prediction would be that a protein associated with the nascent RNA, as short or long as it may be, would produce a TSS enrichment profile in any case, even if there weren’t any bias for ChIP detecting proteins that are tethered closest to DNA. While the mechanism that drives Y14 (and by inference MAGO) to transcription sites, will need to be investigated in future, our ChIP-seq data should demonstrate that beyond reasonable doubts the protein binds active genes independently of splicing. As we discussed above, we could not detect an association with Pol II by IP (see answer to Reviewing Editor point 4).</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: The CWC22 knockdown experiment is inconclusive with respect to the necessity of CWC22 requirement for EJC factor association with chromatin, because it is a negative result and there is a lack of showing how much the CWC22 protein abundance was effectively reduced.</italic> </p><p>Please see response to Reviewing Editor point 1 which was exactly about this.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: For a non-expert, it is difficult to appreciate from the eIF4A3 knockdown glands the interbands in the polytene squash and hence whether Y14 co-localizes there.

This should now be more apparent in the new figure in which we show, as suggested, Pol II and Y14 double staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). While the stainings banding pattern is not as apparent as in wildtype chromosomes, there are segments where a banding pattern is visible, and at these, co-localization of Y14 with Pol II is evident (panel V). Additionally, as on wildtype chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), there are many sites which show high Pol II but weak Y14 signal.</p><p>As for the criticism of the CWC22 RNAi experiment, please see above answer to the Reviewing Editor point 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
