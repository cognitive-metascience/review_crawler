Intriguingly, organelles avoid clashing and entangling with each other in such limited space. Mitochondria form extensive networks constantly remodeled by fission and fusion. Here, we show that mitochondrial fission is triggered by mechanical forces. Mechano-stimulation of mitochondria – via encounter with motile intracellular pathogens, via external pressure applied by an atomic force microscope, or via cell migration across uneven microsurfaces – results in the recruitment of the mitochondrial fission machinery, and subsequent division. We propose that MFF, owing to affinity for narrow mitochondria, acts as a membrane-bound force sensor to recruit the fission machinery to mechanically strained sites. Thus, mitochondria adapt to the environment by sensing and responding to biomechanical cues. Our findings that mechanical triggers can be coupled to biochemical responses in membrane dynamics may explain how organelles orderly cohabit in the crowded cytoplasm.</p></abstract><kwd-group

2001</xref>). Some organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, assemble into highly branched and dynamic networks, adding complexity to the subcellular architecture. Moreover, cells constantly remodel their cytoplasm. For instance, vesicular and membrane trafficking continuously move large complexes and organelles across long distances in the cytoplasm. Given the limited space, it is surprising that large organelle networks can coexist without entanglement or encroachment. In the particular case of mitochondria, collisions and entanglements could lead to catastrophic consequences, such as leakage of cytochrome-C into the cytosol and the induction of apoptosis.</p><p>We thus postulate here that cells must be equipped with mechanisms allowing mitochondria to resolve potential stresses resulting from collisions with other structures, and investigate how mitochondria cope with intracellular crowdedness.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effect of <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> actin-based motility on mitochondria</title><p>We wondered how mitochondria cope with being hit by an intracellular fast-moving object. <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> are pathogenic bacteria belonging to the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> family, and infection in humans causes diarrhea and severe inflammation in the gut. Upon entry into the cytoplasm of infected cells, a sub-population of the bacteria hijacks the actin cytoskeleton and stimulates its polymerization on the bacterial surface, forming so-called actin comet tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ray et al., 2009</xref>), allowing them to propel rapidly through the cytoplasm reaching speeds of up to 0.5 µm/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gouin et al., 1999</xref>). We infected U2OS or COS7 cells with virulent, fluorescently labelled <italic>S. flexneri</italic> and visualized mitochondria using mitochondria matrix-targeted BFP (mtBFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kanfer et al., 2015</xref>). Using time-lapse microscopy, we observed that bacteria oftentimes collided with mitochondria, pushing the mitochondrial tubules aside, above or below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In some cases, collisions caused a visible reduction of the mitochondrial fluorescence, indicating that the matrix was constricted. In 60% of such cases, mitochondria underwent fission at the constricted site within one to five minutes (n = 23; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

Both processes are highly regulated and culminate with specific recruitment of dynamin-related GTPases, which catalyze mitochondrial fission and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van der Bliek et al., 2013</xref>). The fission GTPase DRP1 (Dynamin-related protein 1) assembles as homomultimeric rings around mitochondria and uses the energy of GTP hydrolysis to squeeze mitochondria, causing fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Francy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To assess whether the collision-associated mitochondria division events involved the canonical fission machinery, we imaged bacterial movement in DRP1-depleted cells. Here and throughout this manuscript, we achieved DRP1 depletion by three different approaches: (1) treatment with DRP1–directed siRNA, (2) lentiviral transduction of DRP1-directed shRNA, and (3) CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of exon 2 (DRP1<sup>CRISPR</sup>). All conditions led to efficient reduction of DRP1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) and caused mitochondria to hyperfuse in both mock-infected and <italic>Shigella</italic>-infected cells. Mitochondria from DRP1-depleted cells were strongly affected by bacterial movements. They were pushed and dragged, and sometimes visibly thinned by constriction. However, in contrast to wild-type cells, mitochondria from DRP1<sup>CRISPR</sup> cells recovered without undergoing fission in 100% of the cases (n = 50, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>, p&lt;10<sup>−7</sup> from a Fisher's exact test), and despite the strong reduction in matrix staining during mechanical stimulation of mitochondria, we could observe that mitochondria remained connected at all time. Similarly, DRP1 siRNA treatment completely abolished motile <italic>Shigella</italic>-induced fission in wild-type cells (n = 19, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>). These results indicate that DRP1 is necessary for bacteria-induced fission.</p><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-30292-video3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30292.006</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Disturbance to mitochondrial morphology by <italic>Shigella</italic> in DRP1<sup>CRISPR</sup> knockout cells.</title><p>DRP1<sup>CRISPR</sup> knockout U2OS KERMIT cells (stably expressing mtBFP) were transfected with mCherry-Lifeact plasmid and infected with mCherry-labelled <italic>S. flexneri</italic>.

Interestingly, actin-based <italic>Shigella</italic> motility was not affected by INF2 depletion, probably because <italic>Shigella</italic> use N-WASP and Arp2/3 to promote actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gouin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ray et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, 83% of the cells grown on gramophone records and showing a constricted cytoplasm had separated mitochondrial populations (n = 35), again comparable to what we have observed in control cells. These results suggest that the INF2-mediated pathway does not play essential roles in mechanically induced fission. To address more globally if actin fibers were necessary for force-induced fission, we treated cells with cytochalastin D (cytD), a commonly used drug that inhibits actin polymerization.

DRP1 is a cytosolic protein, and is recruited to mitochondria by integral mitochondrial membrane adaptor molecules such as mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gandre-Babbe and van der Bliek, 2008</xref>) and mitochondrial dynamic protein of 49/51 kDa (Mid49/51) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palmer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). These adaptors are therefore thought to recruit DRP1 to presumptive fission sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>). MFF, for instance, accumulates on dotted structures on mitochondria independently of the presence of DRP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Otera et al., 2010</xref>). It was therefore tempting to hypothesize that adaptor proteins acted directly as mechano-sensors on the mitochondrial surface. To test this idea, we examined the localization of MFF on the mitochondrial surface by immunofluorescence. We performed these experiments in the absence of DRP1 to exclude the possibility that DRP1 may influence MFF localization. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Otera et al., 2010</xref>), MFF localized to foci irrespective of the presence of DRP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, we observed that MFF had a tendency to accumulate at constrictions that happen sporadically on non-perturbed mitochondrial tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, arrowheads in right panels). This propensity was already observed previously in live cells using GFP-tagged MFF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>). To assess if MFF would localize to force-induced constrictions, we again cultured DRP1-depleted cells on gramophone records, and observed MFF on constricted mitochondria at the groove edge. In the majority of the cases where mitochondria were visibly constricted, we observed MFF foci right on or at the edge of constrictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that MFF senses mechanical constrictions on mitochondria upstream of DRP1.

To test this hypothesis, we turned to computer-assisted Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and modelled a generic protein with an affinity for constricted mitochondria. To simulate the desired affinity, we designed a protein with a curved membrane-binding surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and placed several copies of it on a membrane tube, the radius of which was larger than that of the protein’s binding surface. After finding the optimal ratio of the protein and tube diameters that led to protein assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), we performed a first simulation, where we used an arbitrarily low protein density. Under such conditions, the protein diffused freely on the membrane tube and remained homogenously distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video19">Video 19</xref>). We then repeated the simulation, but this time, we pre-imposed a constriction in the membrane tube, to mimic mechanical stimulation, and observed that the proteins accumulated at the constriction site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video20">Video 20</xref>), resembling MFF recruitment to mechanically strained sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video17">Video 17</xref>).

We report a yet-unknown property of MFF – a preference for mitochondrial tubules of smaller diameter. Thus, a straightforward model for force-induced fission is that physical constriction might reduce mitochondrial diameter, causing MFF accumulation, subsequent DRP1 recruitment and mitochondrial fission.</p><p>We also observe that MFF acts not only as a sensor but also as an inducer of constrictions. As shown by our Monte-Carlo simulations, a protein with increased affinity for mitochondria of reduced diameter will rapidly accumulate at constricted sites. At high concentrations however, it will induce and stabilize constrictions, two behaviors that mimic what we observe for GFP-MFF in live cells. Therefore, the propensity of a protein to localize to constricted sites is intrinsically coupled to its ability to stabilize constrictions. The difference between the inducing and sensing behaviors seems to lie in the quantity of the protein. Indeed, MFF only stabilized constrictions when highly overexpressed. In fact, similar observations have been made for membrane curvature-sensing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baumgart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Simunovic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sorre et al., 2012</xref>). Of note, the protein simulated here is not meant to reflect the shape of MFF. Our simulations however highlight that sensing and inducing constrictions are two sides of the same coin, and that the difference between sensing and inducing lies in the expression level of the factor. Actually, it is unknown if MFF monomers or oligomers have a curved membrane-binding interface, like our model protein in the simulations. MFF affinity for constricted mitochondria may stem from other determinants such as affinity for specific lipid species, or properties of its transmembrane domain. Several other DRP1 adapters exist in the cell, hinting at a diversity of determinants for DRP1 recruitment. In this context, MFF might not be the only force sensor on the mitochondrial surface. Similarly, force is unlikely to be the only trigger for mitochondrial fission.</p><p>In unperturbed adherent cells, mitochondria fission happens almost exclusively at sites in contact with the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>). Force-induced mitochondrial fission may provide a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon. Indeed, adherent cells have a very flat periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2012</xref>) where a single layer of ER tubules is present, making them especially suited for microscopy studies. For this reason, ER-mediated mitochondrial division has mostly been studied in peripheral areas of adherent cells. Mitochondrial tubules are generally larger in diameter (~500–700 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Youle and Karbowski, 2005</xref>) than the thickness of the cytoplasm in these peripheral regions. Indeed, super-resolution imaging studies show that peripheral mitochondria are flattened by the proximity of the ‘ventral’ and ‘dorsal’ actin cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2016</xref>), adopt an elliptic – rather than tubular – cross-section, and slightly bulge from the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wojcik et al., 2015</xref>). In live-cell high-speed AFM experiments, mitochondria are seen to deform the plasma membrane and underlying actin cytoskeleton by ~ 50 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yoshida et al., 2015</xref>). It is therefore clear that peripheral mitochondria, sandwiched between the ‘dorsal’ and ‘ventral’ actin cortices, are mechanically constrained in these areas. Why does the pressure then not fragment the peripheral mitochondria? Probably because the pressure from the actin cortices applies uniformly over the whole length of the mitochondria and does not create local constrictions where MFF and DRP1 could enrich. In this context, it is tempting to speculate that crossing-over ER tubules, rigidified by an INF2- and Spire1C- mediated actin shell, might impose localized mechanical force to underlying mitochondria, triggering fission at ER-mitochondria encounter sites. Being the most extended intracellular membrane network, the ER is also the most likely to physically clash with the mitochondrial network, explaining the frequent observation of fission at ER contact sites. In support of this idea, we observe that mechanically-stimulated fission does not appear to be dependent on ER tubules. An appealing hypothesis is that the ER constitutes an intrinsic source of mechanical force. It therefore appears dispensable in our experimental conditions because an extrinsic source of mechanical force is present. This, in turn, suggests that for ER-mediated fission events, the ER may be imposing force rather than providing biochemical signals. Because actin is an important force-generator in the cell, our model might also explain why it is necessary for mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Manor et al., 2015</xref>), unless cells are mechanically stimulated with an AFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>).</p><p>The role of mitochondrial fusion and fission has remained mysterious. Both processes have been proposed to serve in the repair of damaged mitochondria by fusing with healthy ones, in the segregation of terminally damaged mitochondria for disposal by mitophagy, and in the correct apportionment of mitochondria to daughter cells upon mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Katajisto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Twig et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we show that mitochondria undergo DRP1- and MFF-mediated fission in response to mechanical stimulation.</p><p>Cells constantly undergo events of organelle transport, cytoskeleton growth and shrinkage, and general cytoplasm remodeling. Organelles as extended as the ER and mitochondria have to cope with an ever-changing environment and avoid clashes and entanglement with each other. By resolving any resulting mechanical strain, fission might enable mitochondria to escape shearing and ripping, (which could lead to Cytochrome-C release and apoptotic cell death), and avoid entanglements. In that capacity, DRP1 activity may be paralleled to that of topoisomerase-II in disentangling the genome. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, we observe concatenations between mitochondria and the ER in mammalian cells (our unpublished observations). Given the dynamic nature of these organelles, entanglements are likely to induce mechanical strain on mitochondria, therefore leading to their resolution by fission.

This paper is interesting in that it details a mechanism by which the mitochondrial network can respond to mechanical forces thereby equipping the organelle with the ability to cope with intracellular crowdedness. Using a variety of mechanical-inducing mechanisms the authors convincingly show that mechanical force is sufficient to induce Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The role of actin polymerization on the OMM should be investigated in more depth. The application of cytochalasin D disrupts cell structure and perturbs several cellular events. While nice approaches were used here to eliminate or reduce Drp1 expression, experiments on the role of actin in force-induced mitochondrial fission are underdeveloped. Does INF2- or Spire-depletion affect this process? It is also surprising that the authors did not show mitochondria in cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>.</p><p>2) The statement (subsection “Mechanism of force sensing and DRP1 recruitment”, first paragraph) that the adaptor proteins (e.g. Mff or MiD49/51) are recruited to presumptive fission sites upstream of Drp1 is not correct, especially in case of Mff. Drp1 association with the mitochondria induces Mff foci on the OMM (therefore, endogenous Mff foci can be easily detected in wild type cells, but are missing in Drp1<sup>-/-</sup> cells, where Mff shows diffuse localization). Thus, while the role proposed here for Mff in sensing mechanical stress of the mitochondria is very interesting, the authors should provide some evidence that in the absence of Drp1, endogenous Mff indeed accumulates on highly constricted/tubulated mitochondria. The authors could perform immunofluorescence of Drp1<sup>-/-</sup> cells growing on vinyl discs etc. Without such data, I have a problem believing that these GFP-Mff-based experiments reflect function of endogenous Mff in the process.</p><p>3) The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> does not seem to support the authors' conclusion that the &quot;ER is not necessary for mechanical force induced fission&quot;. While the ER does appear to be &quot;pushed away&quot; following AFM stimulation there appears to be a tubule (panel A) that localizes to the same vicinity as the mitochondrial constriction prior to fission. However, it is nearly impossible to really resolve what is going on at the ER level with the tiny insets, and resolution of the images (ER staining is unclear as to what is really ER structure in panels A, B and C). Merged images in dual colors, as well as better resolution of the ER network will help to clarify whether the ER is recruited or not. The authors may need to look for fission events in cells with resolvable ER tubules to address whether the ER has a role or not.</p><p>4) Do the authors see any change in the rate of mechanical force induced mitochondrial fission vs. non-mechanical force induced following defects in ER shape (+Climp63) or tubule fusion (+ATL1-K80A)? The authors comment that they still visualized fission in both conditions, however, there is no mention to how frequent or what the sample size was. Quantification of the imaging observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-D</xref> as to the rate and frequency of these events would strongly strengthen the conclusions from this figure. In addition, others have found that even when tubular ER is reduced (as in Reticulon depleted cells), mitochondrial fission still occurs at the remaining ER tubules still present. And even when Climp63 is overexpressed there are a lot of tubules still around. As it is impossible to fully deplete cells of ER, the strong conclusion about the role of ER in mechanical force-induced mitochondrial fission should be tempered.</p><p>5) The authors should comment on whether they would consider ER-mediated constriction as a form of mechanical force.</p><p>6) In reference to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, the authors report that mechanically induced fission still took place with rates similar to untreated cells. Can the authors expand on what the rate was and add quantification to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to demonstrate this conclusion?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30292.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Helle and Feng et al. observe that mitochondria divide following physical perturbations; either by intracellular bacterium collision or external cues induced by atomic force microscopy and growth on vinyl records.

In this version of the manuscript, we show that MFF has a preference for mitochondrial tubules with a reduced diameter. Mechanical stimulation of mitochondria induced local constriction of the mitochondrial tubules and enrichment of MFF at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, C</xref>). We further show that MFF, when overexpressed to a high level, was able to induce and stabilize thin mitochondrial tubules in the absence of exogenous mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-F</xref>). This apparent paradoxical behavior of MFF could be modeled by a computer-assisted simulation of a minimal system, which shows that the ability to sense and induce constrictions are coupled (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video17">Videos 17</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video19">19</xref>).</p><p>We also addressed the role of ER and actin in mechano-fission.

Finding examples of this would greatly increase the significance of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>While we obviously agree with this reviewer that evidence of physiological function of mechanically induced fission would greatly increase the significance of our study, we have to point out that the physiological roles of ER wrapping-induced mitochondrial fission, and in fact, fusion and fission in general, have also largely remained speculative.</p><p>In the case of mechanically induced mitochondrial fission, we believe that there could be two conceivable physiological functions. Firstly, using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy we have observed concatenations (locked rings) between ER and mitochondria in both untreated and DRP1 shRNA-treated cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Since ER fission is not frequently observed, these entanglements presumably have to be resolved by mitochondrial fission. Similar entanglements and local clashes may also occur between mitochondria and other cellular structures. Secondly, it is long known that immune and cancer cells are capable of extreme forms of deformation during migration (Proebstl et al., 2012; Starke et al., 2013). Two recent papers published back-to-back in Science (Denais et al., 2016; Raab et al., 2016) showed that cells “squeeze” to such an extent that the nuclear membrane transiently loses integrity. Under such conditions, we assume that mitochondria, and other organelles, must also adapt, and it is tempting to imagine that mechano-sensing by MFF facilitates controlled fission at the bottle-neck, resolving internal physical tension during such deformations.</p><p>We, however, believe that these questions are beyond the scope of this current manuscript, which is aimed at describing the novel phenomenon that a mechanical trigger can be sensed by mitochondria and translated to a biochemical response, namely the recruitment of the fission machinery.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Concatenations between the ER and mitochondria in the absence of mitochondrial fission machinery.</title><p>Two examples of concatenations observed in DRP1 shRNA-treated U2OS KERMIT cells.

As a matter of fact, this intuition is not verified by our observations. We have a very efficient proxy for mechanical strain, since the matrix stain is systematically “squeezed” away from the zone of mechanical stimulation. This proxy indicates that in resting cells, mitochondria are only seldom constricted.

By contrast we could observe DRP1 foci on most fission sites. Thus we decided to quantify fission events instead.</p><p>Individual, identifiable mitochondria in the edge and ledge areas on vinyl disks were followed for as long as they remained in focus, or until the end of the movie acquisition.

For mitochondria that did not undergo fission within observation period, we plotted the total amount of time the mitochondria were under observation (Black circles). Note that the maximal plottable time is 1000 seconds, the total length of the acquisition sessions. We also added these data in the Results section as following: “Indeed, a few minutes into time-lapse recording, mitochondria vacated the edge area by first undergoing fission (averagely within 93 sec), and then moving towards the ledge and the groove areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

INF2 was previously shown to participate in ER wrapping-induced mitochondrial fission, and as the reviewer suggested, may play a more specific/subtle role in mechano-fission. We observed that the frequency of mechano-fission remained the same in INF2-depleted cells as in control cells in both experimental systems. These data have been added to the Results section of the manuscript, under the subtitle “Inhibiting ER or actin dynamics does not detectably affect force-induced fission” (last paragraph).</p><p>We have also attempted to examine the effect of Spire1C depletion in similar experiments. Spire1C is an alternate splice isoform of Spire1, an actin-nucleating factor. This specific isoform localizes to mitochondria where it interacts with INF2 and thereby facilitates ER tubule-mediated fission (Manor et al., 2015). We have tried to deplete Spire1C using two siRNA sequences derived from the two reported shRNA constructs (Manor et al., 2015). Although some knockdown effect was maybe attained, it was however clear that residual Spire1C signal, as immunostained using the Exon C antibody, also used in the original study, was found on the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). We have contacted the authors of the Manor et al. study for the reported shRNA constructs but they could not send it to us for reasons beyond our control. We feel that we cannot make a decisive point on the involvement of Spire1C in the present manuscript, given the poor knock down effect. We feel, however, that the main conclusions of our study would not change whether or not Spire1C influences mechano-fission. Also, having performed the INF2 knockdown as well as cytochalasin D experiments, we believe we have sufficiently ruled out the INF2-specific pathway and actin polymerization, in a more general way, as essential players in mechano-fission. Moreover, our conclusions on this aspect do not exclude a subtle role of Spire1C, INF2 and actin in mechano-fission (“These results suggest that the INF2-mediated pathway does not play essential roles in mechanically induced fission” and “Thus, actin polymerization does not appear to be a necessary step in force-induced fission.”).</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Immunostaining of Spire1C in cells treated with scrambled or Spire1C-targeting siRNAs.</title><p>U2OS cells expressing mitochondrial matrix-targeting BFP (Mito) were transfected with either scrambled (SCR) or two siRNAs targeting either the ORF or 3’ UTR of Spire1C.

The authors could perform immunofluorescence of Drp1<sup>-/-</sup> cells growing on vinyl discs etc. Without such data, I have a problem believing that these GFP-Mff-based experiments reflect function of endogenous Mff in the process.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we would like to apologize for forgetting to include a reference for our claim that “adaptor proteins are recruited to presumptive fission sites upstream of Drp1”. We were specifically thinking of the report from Friedman and colleagues, where MFF was shown to accumulate at ER tubule-driven constrictions in the absence of Drp1 (Friedman et al., 2011). Yet, Friedman et al. also used GFP-tagged MFF and not the endogenous one, therefore we guess that the reviewer’s criticism also applies there.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out a piece of literature that has apparently escaped our attention. We have however not found the said study(-ies) reporting that MFF shows a diffused staining pattern in Drp1<sup>-/-</sup> cells in the literature. The only MFF immunofluorescence experiment performed in the absence of Drp1 we could find was from Otera and colleagues, using Drp1KD rather than KO cells (Otera et al., 2010) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Here is an excerpt of this paper:</p><p>“Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that Mff is localized mostly in puncta on mitochondria. […] Interestingly, these structures were detected on the extended tubular networks in Drp1 RNAi cells but were not affected by hFis1 RNAi or Drp1/hFis1 double RNAi (unpublished data for Drp1/hFis1 RNAi), suggesting that Mff is present as preassembled structures on the MOM irrespective of Drp1 or hFis1 expression.”</p><p>Thus, it appears that the literature is controversial on this issue. Regardless, it is a great idea to examine endogenous MFF in our study, especially since good antibodies make this experiment completely feasible. We have observed endogenous MFF by immunofluorescence (IF) in control and DRP1-depleted cells and, in agreement with Otera et al., did not observe that “MFF localization shows diffuse localization” in either case (see below). Instead, endogenous MFF stained as punctae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We have performed two additional sets of experiments with regard to endogenous MFF localization:</p><p>1) We performed IF of endogenous MFF in Drp1 KD cells, and observed that MFF foci show a preference for naturally occurring constrictions on mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>2) We developed a new protocol for immunofluorescence on vinyl records. Using this protocol, we show that endogenous MFF often accumulates at pattern-induced constrictions in Drp1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Together these data nicely complement our GFP-tagging approach and demonstrate that the propensity of MFF to accumulate to constrictions is not an artifact of GFP tagging nor of overexpression. The new data on endogenous MFF have been added to the Results section of the manuscript, under the subtitle “Mechanism of force sensing and DRP1 recruitment” (first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> does not seem to support the authors' conclusion that the &quot;ER is not necessary for mechanical force induced fission&quot;. While the ER does appear to be &quot;pushed away&quot; following AFM stimulation there appears to be a tubule (panel A) that localizes to the same vicinity as the mitochondrial constriction prior to fission. However, it is nearly impossible to really resolve what is going on at the ER level with the tiny insets, and resolution of the images (ER staining is unclear as to what is really ER structure in panels A, B and C). Merged images in dual colors, as well as better resolution of the ER network will help to clarify whether the ER is recruited or not. The authors may need to look for fission events in cells with resolvable ER tubules to address whether the ER has a role or not.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the image quality and resolution of the ER in panel A, B, and C. In fact, their quality is limited by constraints associated with either mounting an atomic-force microscope on an optical microscope, or with the imaging conditions on vinyl records (with very unusual refractive properties of the sample and at a considerable working distance from the microscope’s objective). Clearly resolving individual ER tubules is not possible with these setups.</p><p>We entirely agree with the reviewers’ opinion that the data from the AFM alone are not conclusive regarding the involvement of the ER, and apologize for the lack of clarity. We never meant to draw strong conclusions from the AFM experiment alone. Our original text read:</p><p>“When performing AFM stimulation of U2OS cells stably expressing both a mitochondrial (mtBFP) and an ER (GFP-Sec61β) fluorescent marker, we observed that the tip-mediated indentation of cells pushed the ER away from the site of force application and subsequent mitochondrial fission, suggesting that the ER was not necessary for force-mediated fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>). To investigate this further, we observed the ER together with mitochondria, in conditions where ER dynamics was perturbed by […]”</p><p>The sentence the reviewers referred to was not meant as a conclusion, but rather as an introduction to the set of experiments thereafter, involving perturbations of ER dynamics (CLIMP63 and ATL1DN overexpression). The actual conclusion for this set of experiment was:</p><p>“Thus, while the ER might have a function in force-induced fission, this function does not appear strictly necessary.”</p><p>This conclusion, we think, adopts an appropriately prudent tone and reflects what we observe: whatever we do to the ER, we do not see a detectable effect on force-induced fission. This conclusion is also nicely supported by the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video14">Video 14</xref>, showing a clear event of force-induced fission happening at a considerable distance from any ER tubule. Nevertheless, to avoid any confusion, we have rephrased the introductory sentence to:</p><p>“However, when performing AFM stimulation of U2OS cells stably expressing both a mitochondrial (mtBFP) and an ER (GFP-Sec61β) fluorescent marker, we observed that the tip-mediated indentation of cells pushed the ER away from the site of force application and subsequent mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>). This did not appear consistent with an important role of the ER in force-induced fission. To investigate this further, we observed the ER together with mitochondria, in conditions where ER dynamics was perturbed by the overexpression of dominant negative Atlastin (ATL) mutants or of CLIMP-63.”</p><p>and removed the misleading part (“suggesting that […]”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Do the authors see any change in the rate of mechanical force induced mitochondrial fission vs. non-mechanical force induced following defects in ER shape (+Climp63) or tubule fusion (+ATL1-K80A)? The authors comment that they still visualized fission in both conditions, however, there is no mention to how frequent or what the sample size was. Quantification of the imaging observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-D</xref> as to the rate and frequency of these events would strongly strengthen the conclusions from this figure. In addition, others have found that even when tubular ER is reduced (as in Reticulon depleted cells), mitochondrial fission still occurs at the remaining ER tubules still present. And even when Climp63 is overexpressed there are a lot of tubules still around. As it is impossible to fully deplete cells of ER, the strong conclusion about the role of ER in mechanical force-induced mitochondrial fission should be tempered.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this suggestion, we have quantified the proportion of cells showing a complete separation of the mitochondrial network, when their cytoplasm is constricted by the record’s edge under the said conditions. We found this proportion to be 89% for ATL1-K80A cells (n=38 cells from 5 independent experiments) and 86% for CLIMP63 overexpressing cells (n=21 cells from 3 independent experiments). This is not significantly different from wildtype cells (79% and 85%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These data have been added to the manuscript (subsection “Inhibiting ER or actin dynamics does not detectably affect force-induced fission”, second paragraph and– subsection “Statistics”).</p><p>Hence, we cannot detect any obvious effect of ER disturbance on force-induced fission. This result is a negative one and should be interpreted as such. We wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer that it is impossible to exclude a contribution from the ER in force-induced fission at this stage, for the reasons that s/he explained above, and because this being a negative result, it is logically impossible to conclude. Indeed, “absence of evidence is no evidence for absence”. We however think that the conclusion that we draw is not strong (see response to point 3). We have additionally softened the header of the section from</p><p>“Inhibiting ER or actin dynamics does not affect force-induced fission”</p><p>to</p><p>“Inhibiting ER or actin dynamics does not detectably affect force-induced fission”</p><p>We would also like to point out that this set of experiments on ER involvement in force-induced fission was specifically made upon the request of reviewers in a first round of reviews for <italic>eLife</italic>. The only sensible conclusion that we can draw from these experiments is that whatever we do to the ER, we are not able to detect any notable effect on force-induced fission. We think that this is now better reflected in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should comment on whether they would consider ER-mediated constriction as a form of mechanical force.</p></disp-quote><p>We originally addressed this point in the Discussion with the following two sentences:</p><p>“It is tempting to speculate that the additional pressure imposed on the mitochondrial surface by crossing-over ER tubules, rigidified by an INF2- and Spire1- mediated actin shell, might be what triggers fission at ER-mitochondria encounter sites.”</p><p>and</p><p>“An appealing hypothesis is that the ER, being an intrinsic source of mechanical force, appears dispensable in our experimental conditions because an extrinsic source of mechanical force is present.”</p><p>We understand that these sentences might come across less affirmative than one might wish for, but these ideas are purely speculative at this stage, and to our opinion, should remain speculative. In attempt to state our hypotheses more directly, but without overstepping our confidence, we have rephrased them to:</p><p>“It is tempting to speculate that crossing-over ER tubules, rigidified by an INF2- and Spire1- mediated actin shell, might impose mechanical force to underlying mitochondria, triggering fission at ER-mitochondria encounter sites.”</p><p>and</p><p>“An appealing hypothesis is that the ER constitutes an intrinsic source of mechanical force. It therefore appears dispensable in our experimental conditions because an extrinsic source of mechanical force is present.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In reference to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, the authors report that mechanically induced fission still took place with rates similar to untreated cells. Can the authors expand on what the rate was and add quantification to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to demonstrate this conclusion?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for omitting the quantification of fission in cytochalasin D-treated cells in the “statistics” subsection of the Materials and methods section. This was an oversight, and these data should have been there from the beginning. We also apologize for the poor choice of the word “rates”. It should have rather been “proportion”.</p><p>Indeed, from 17 different AFM touchdowns, in two independent experiments, we observed 16 fission events, a proportion (94%) that is well in agreement with that of untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The quantification has been added to the manuscript (–subsection “Inhibiting ER or actin dynamics does not detectably affect force-induced fission”, last paragraph and subsection “Statistics”), and the word “rate”, replaced by “proportion”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
