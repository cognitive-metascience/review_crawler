cytokinetic abscission. This process is regulated by the abscission checkpoint, a genome protection mechanism that relies on Aurora B and the ESCRT-III subunit CHMP4C to delay abscission in response to chromosome missegregation. In this study, we show that Unc-51-like kinase 3 (ULK3) phosphorylates and binds ESCRT-III subunits via tandem MIT domains, and thereby, delays abscission in response to lagging chromosomes, nuclear pore defects, and tension forces at the midbody. Our structural and biochemical studies reveal an unusually tight interaction between ULK3 and IST1, an ESCRT-III subunit required for abscission. We also demonstrate that IST1 phosphorylation by ULK3 is an essential signal required to sustain the abscission checkpoint and that ULK3 and CHMP4C are functionally linked components of the timer that controls abscission in multiple physiological situations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06547.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06547.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06547.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our cells multiply by dividing into two. Many proteins are involved in this process, including a group called the ESCRT-III complex. This group is required to complete the final stage of cell division when the single membrane that surrounds the two new daughter cells separates. Before the cell divides, its DNA—which is packaged in structures called chromosomes—is copied, and the two sets of chromosomes are pulled to opposite ends of the cell. This ensures that each daughter cell will have a complete set of DNA.</p><p>If the cell divides before the chromosomes have finished moving to opposite ends of the cell, the daughter cells may end up with the wrong number of chromosomes. This can lead to cancer or other diseases. To prevent this, cells have evolved a quality control system called the ‘abscission checkpoint’, which delays cell division until the chromosomes have properly separated. Previous studies have shown that when the checkpoint is active, an ESCRT-III complex protein called CHMP4C is inactivated by an enzyme, which prevents the cell from dividing.</p><p>Other signals that indicate that the new daughter cells are not yet ready to separate can also delay cell division, but it is not clear how those defects are detected by the checkpoint. Here, Caballe, Wenzel et al. found that a protein called ULK3 can bind to several proteins in the ESCRT-III complex, including one called IST1. In doing so, ULK3 is able to delay cell division if the chromosomes have not finished separating, if there are defects in the nucleus of the cell, or if the cell is experiencing high levels of mechanical tension at the site where the membrane will separate.</p><p>The experiments also show that ULK3 needs to bind to and regulate the activity of IST1 to sustain the abscission checkpoint, and that CHMP4C is required for this process. Caballe, Wenzel et al.'s findings reveal that ULK3 plays an essential role in controlling when a cell divides and imply that there may be additional proteins involved that release cells from the checkpoint delay imposed by ULK3. The next challenges will be to identify these proteins and to understand how all checkpoint proteins work together to regulate cell division.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division when two daughter cells are physically separated. The process comprises several steps, including cleavage furrow ingression and abscission of the midbody—the thin intercellular bridge connecting the nascent daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caballe and Martin-Serrano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mierzwa and Gerlich, 2014</xref>). Midbody abscission occurs adjacent to the Flemming body, a central protein complex, and is mediated by the ESCRT pathway (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morita et al., 2007</xref>). The ESCRT machinery performs topologically equivalent membrane fission events throughout the cell, including intraluminal vesicle formation at the multivesicular body, retroviral particle release, plasma membrane wound repair and abscission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hurley and Yang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCullough et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jimenez et al., 2014</xref>). The core ESCRT machinery comprises five different factors or complexes: ALIX, ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II and ESCRT–III, and VPS4. In most cases, location-specific adaptors initially recruit the early-acting ALIX and ESCRT-I/-II factors, which then recruit the late-acting ESCRT-III and VPS4 complexes to mediate membrane fission. In late stages of cytokinesis, the Flemming body protein CEP55 binds TSG101 (ESCRT-I) and ALIX, which leads to ESCRT-III subunit recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlton et al., 2008</xref>). ESCRT-III-based helical filaments form on either side of the Flemming body and induce cortical constriction, thereby promoting abscission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guizetti et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to driving membrane scission mechanically, ESCRT-III proteins recruit cytokinetic cofactors that contain MIT (microtubule interacting and trafficking) domains. MIT domains bind short motifs within the C-terminal tails of ESCRT-III proteins called MIMs (MIT-interacting motifs), which become exposed and concentrated when the ESCRT-III proteins polymerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCullough et al., 2013</xref>). MIT domain-containing proteins that participate in cytokinesis include the AAA-ATPase VPS4 and its activator LIP5, which remodel and recycle the ESCRT-III subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babst et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hurley and Yang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lata et al., 2008</xref>), Spastin, an AAA-ATPase that severs microtubules, and MITD1, a membrane-binding protein that stabilizes the intercellular bridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Connell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Skalicky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hadders et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azmi et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Evolutionarily conserved monitoring mechanisms regulate the proper timing of events during cytokinesis progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Agromayor and Martin-Serrano, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mierzwa and Gerlich, 2014</xref>). When chromosomes persist within the midbody, the abscission checkpoint (also known as NoCut) inhibits abscission until chromatin has been cleared from the spindle midzone, thereby preventing aberrant segregation or cleavage furrow regression and tetraploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Norden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mendoza et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steigemann et al., 2009</xref>). Lagging chromosomes are sensed by the Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates the ESCRT-III subunit CHMP4C to delay abscission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capalbo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlton et al., 2012</xref>). Defective nuclear pore complex assembly also triggers Aurora B-dependent abscission delays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mackay et al., 2010</xref>). The full signaling cascade that connects nuclear pores to abscission is not yet clear, but ESCRT proteins themselves are involved in the surveillance and clearance of defective nuclear pore complex assembly intermediates in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Webster et al., 2014</xref>). Tension forces applied by dividing cells on the midbody also regulate cytokinesis, with high-tension delaying abscission, and tension release triggering ESCRT-III assembly and membrane scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lafaurie-Janvore et al., 2013</xref>). How these different physiological inputs converge to influence abscission timing is not understood.</p><p>Here, we investigate the function of Unc-51-like kinase 3 (ULK3), a poorly characterized member of the ULK family of serine/threonine kinases that is predicted to contain tandem MIT domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Row et al., 2007</xref>). Live-cell imaging analysis revealed that ULK3 regulates abscission timing in response to lagging chromosomes, defects in nuclear pore complex assembly, and tension forces at the midbody. Furthermore, our biochemical and structural studies show that the ULK3 MIT domains bind tightly to IST1, an ESCRT-III subunit required for cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agromayor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bajorek et al., 2009a</xref>). Finally, we show that ULK3 phosphorylates IST1 and other ESCRT-III proteins and that IST1 phosphorylation provides an essential inhibitory signal in the abscission checkpoint, thereby ensuring proper coordination of the final events in cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ULK3 binds to ESCRT-III via tandem MIT domains</title><p>The predicted MIT domains in ULK3 suggested a novel mechanism of ESCRT regulation, and we, therefore, surveyed potential ULK3–ESCRT interactions using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) experiments. ULK3 binding was observed for three ESCRT-III subunits: CHMP1A, CHMP1B, and CHMP2A, but not for other ESCRT complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These interactions were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged ESCRT-III proteins from mixed 293T cell lysates that contained One-strep-flag (OSF)-tagged ULK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, note interactions in lanes 2, 4, 6, and 14). This approach revealed that ULK3 also bound the ESCRT-III subunit IST1 (lane 26), an interaction not tested by Y2H because IST1 fusion constructs activated transcription non-specifically. Endogenous ULK3 also co-precipitated with overexpressed HA-tagged CHMP1A, CHMP1B, CHMP2A, or IST1, but not with CHMP2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Finally, endogenous IST1 was efficiently biotinylated in cells that expressed a biotin ligase BirA-ULK3 fusion protein, which promiscuously biotinylates proximal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 4, bottom panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roux et al., 2012</xref>).

We, therefore, focused on characterizing the IST1-ULK3 interaction. The IST1-binding site on ULK3 was mapped using co-precipitation experiments with Myc-tagged IST1 and different OSF-ULK3 deletion constructs. IST1 bound with similar efficiencies to full-length ULK3 (residues 1–472) and to a minimal construct that spanned just the C-terminal tandem MIT domains (residues 277–449, hereafter denoted ULK3(MIT)<sub>2</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lanes 2 and 5, respectively), but did not bind to the isolated ULK3 kinase domain (residues 1–270; lane 3). Thus, the ULK3 MIT domains form the primary IST1-binding site. As discussed below, co-expression of full-length ULK3 resulted in the appearance of lower mobility IST1 species, suggesting that the kinase can phosphorylate IST1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lane 2).</p><p>NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments were used to map ULK3-binding sites on IST1. IST1 contains two different MIT interaction motifs, termed MIM1 (residues 352–363) and MIM2 (residues 325–329), that were included within a C-terminal IST1 peptide used in these experiments (IST1<sub>303-366</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agromayor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bajorek et al., 2009a</xref>). Both MIMs exhibited backbone amide proton chemical shift perturbations upon titration of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled IST1<sub>303-366</sub> with ULK3(MIT)<sub>2</sub>, indicating that both IST1 MIMs can contact ULK3(MIT)<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), whereas the upstream IST1 residues 303–317 were not perturbed. To assess the binding contributions of each MIM and MIT element, we performed FP-binding experiments with fluorescently labeled peptides comprising either one or both of the IST1 MIM elements and one or both ULK3 MIT domains. The tightest interaction was observed for ULK3(MIT)<sub>2</sub> binding to a construct that spanned both IST1 MIMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). However, nearly all of the binding energy was contributed by the IST1 MIM1 element, which bound ULK3 MIT2. Consistent with these experiments, IST1<sub>316-366</sub> binding to ULK3(MIT)<sub>2</sub> was reduced more than 100-fold by a single point mutation in the MIM1-binding site of ULK3 MIT2 (M434D), but not by an equivalent mutation in the MIM1-binding site of ULK3 MIT1 (residues 277–358, V338D mutant; &lt;twofold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Hence, both IST1 MIM elements can contact both ULK3 MIT domains, but IST1 MIM1 binding to ULK3 MIT2 domain is the energetically dominant interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Structure of IST1 MIM1-ULK3 MIT2 complex</title><p>We determined the crystal structure of ULK3 MIT2 in complex with IST1 MIM1 to 1.4 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). ULK3 residues 372–446 form the characteristic MIT three-helix bundle, and the IST1 MIM1 helix binds parallel to MIT helix 3 in the groove between MIT helices 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The N-terminus of the MIT domain (residues 360–373) forms a short helix that packs in the groove connecting MIT helices 1 and 3. This helix has not been seen in previous MIT domain structures and is expected to interfere sterically with the binding of canonical MIM2 (and MIM3) elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Core IST1 MIM1 residues make a series of interactions that are similar to those seen in other MIT-MIM1 complexes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> magnification and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Obita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stuchell-Brereton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hadders et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo and Xu, 2015</xref>). The ULK3 M434 residue is central to this interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, red), which explains why the M434D mutation inhibits IST1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>The interaction between ULK3 MIT2 and IST1 MIM1 (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> = 0.77 µM) is significantly tighter than many previously described MIT–MIM1 interactions (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> ∼2–100 µM). The additional binding energy appears to be contributed by N-terminal IST1 MIM1 residues I350 and F352, and by the central F359 residue, all of which make hydrophobic interactions that are absent in other MIM1-MIT complexes. Binding of the bulky hydrophobic IST1 MIM1 F352 and F359 residues is accommodated by complementary small ULK3 MIT2 interfacial residues A415 and G408, respectively. Charged or polar residues are found in equivalent positions of other MIT domains such as VPS4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or ULK3 MIT1. These interactions likely explain why IST1 MIM1 binds tightly and specifically to the ULK3 MIT2 domain.</p><p>ULK3 binding also mapped to the MIM1 of CHMP1B as binding was inhibited by removal of CHMP1B MIM1 or by MIM1 point mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, lanes 3–7 vs lane 2), but not by a mutation in the more extended CHMP1B MIM3 binding site (lane 8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). However, unlike IST1, the binding of CHMP1A and CHMP1B was reduced by point mutations in the MIM1-binding sites of either ULK3 MIT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, lanes 1–4 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, the binding specificities of the CHMP1A/B and IST1 proteins differ, and our data indicate that CHMP1 MIM1 elements can bind either ULK3 MIT domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ULK3 regulates abscission timing and is an essential component of the abscission checkpoint pathway</title><p>We used siRNA depletion to test whether ULK3 participates in endosomal sorting or virus budding. Effects on ESCRT-dependent lysosomal targeting were tested using two established assays; down-regulation of MHC class I by the Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) K3 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hewitt et al., 2002</xref>), and degradation of Tetherin by the KSHV K5 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agromayor et al., 2012</xref>). ULK3 depletion did not affect either of these ESCRT-dependent degradation reactions, whereas control depletion of TSG101 inhibited both processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Similarly, ULK3 depletion had no effect on ESCRT-dependent HIV-1 budding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We, therefore, conclude that ULK3 is not required for either of these ESCRT pathway functions.</p><p>We next tested whether ULK3 functions in cytokinetic abscission using live imaging of HeLa mCherry-Tubulin cells. ULK3-depleted cells proceeded through mitosis normally, but resolved their midbodies faster than control cells, at rates comparable to the abnormally rapid abscission observed in CHMP4C-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1 media2 media3">Videos 1–3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlton et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, endogenous ULK3 protein was detected by immunofluorescence staining at the Flemming body, where it is positioned to function during cytokinetic abscission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Based on these results, we tested whether ULK3 was required for abscission delays induced by the abscission checkpoint. One event that triggers the abscission checkpoint is the presence of defectively assembled nuclear pore complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mackay et al., 2010</xref>). As expected, partial depletion of Nucleoporin 153 (NUP153) induced abscission delays that increased the number of midbody-connected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 1 vs 2). This phenotype was abrogated upon ULK3-depletion, despite comparable levels of NUP153 depletion (lane 2 vs 4). Active Aurora B (Aurora B pT232) is known to localize to the midbody of dividing cells both in control or NUP153-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mackay et al., 2010</xref>). Immunofluorescence imaging of cells treated as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> revealed that ULK3 depletion did not alter the localization of phosphorylated Aurora B to the midbody in cells co-depleted of NUP153, indicating that ULK3 likely functions downstream of Aurora B in the abscission checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These results were confirmed by live-cell imaging experiments, which demonstrated that ULK3 depletion abolished the 30-min abscission delay triggered by nuclear pore disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, partial depletion of NUP153 in two different clonal ULK3-knockout cell lines, in which the endogenous ULK3 locus was removed using a lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ran et al., 2013</xref>), also failed to sustain the abscission checkpoint, as seen by a lack of an increase in midbody-connected cells when compared to non-targeting (NT) siRNA transfection, or control cell lines lacking guide RNAs against ULK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, lanes 8 and 10 vs lanes 2, 4, 6).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06547.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ULK3 regulates abscission timing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Asynchronous cultures of HeLa mCherry-Tubulin cells were transfected with the specified siRNA.

The presence of chromatin bridges within the midbody was monitored by time-lapse microscopy in cells expressing YFP-tagged lamina-associated polypeptide 2β (LAP2β) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steigemann et al., 2009</xref>). As described previously for CHMP4C-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlton et al., 2012</xref>), LAP2β bridges were also resolved more rapidly upon depletion of ULK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4 media5">Videos 4, 5</xref>). In control cells, persisting chromosome bridges were resolved in 680 min, whereas in ULK3-depleted cells, this resolution time was dramatically reduced to 300 min. Thus, our experiments demonstrate that ULK3 plays an essential role in supporting the Aurora B-dependent abscission checkpoint in response to either defective nuclear pore assembly or lagging chromosomes. Besides delaying abscission, Aurora B activation also prevents cleavage furrow regression in cells that contain chromosome bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steigemann et al., 2009</xref>). As expected, the frequency of furrow regression increased in cells with lagging chromosomes, but ULK3 depletion did not change this proportion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6 media7">Videos 6, 7</xref>). This result indicates that ULK3 does not control furrow regression, but instead likely functions downstream of Aurora B in delaying abscission in response to chromatin bridges.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media4" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-06547-media4.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06547.012</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Representative example of asynchronous HeLa cells stably expressing YFP-LAP2β transfected with NT siRNA.</title><p>Chromatin bridge resolution time is 510 min.

As with IST1, the proportion of midbodies exhibiting single Flemming body rings of GFP-CHMP4B also increased 20-fold upon ULK3 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of either ESCRT-binding deficient (M434D) or kinase-defective (K44H) ULK3 had no effect on GFP-CHMP4B localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, the ability of ULK3 constructs to induce aberrant ESCRT-III localization correlates with their ability to delay abscission. Both WT and K44H ULK3 co-localized with GFP-CHMP4B polymers at the intercellular bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), while only ULK3 WT co-localized with GFP-CHMP4B at the Flemming body (39% vs 61% of ULK3/GFP-CHMP4B at the midbody rings) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), more closely reflecting the Flemming body localization observed for endogenous ULK3 in a context without overexpression (compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This observation suggests that ULK3 does not delay abscission by directly blocking or outcompeting ESCRT-III interactions required for polymerization. Instead, ULK3 apparently induces abscission delays and ESCRT-III mislocalization by phosphorylating substrates important for abscission completion. Taken together, these data show that catalytically active ULK3 changes the steady-state distribution of ESCRT-III proteins at the midbody, suggesting that the abscission delays induced by ULK3 are due, at least in part, to defective ESCRT-III polymerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>ULK3 phosphorylates ESCRT-III subunits</title><p>We next tested whether ESCRT-III subunits are phosphorylated by ULK3.

These data indicate that ULK3 and CHMP4C act together in regulating abscission as part of the Aurora B-dependent abscission control pathway. The requirement for CHMP4C in abscission delay can be partially alleviated in cells overexpressing ULK3, however, suggesting that excess ULK3 can overcome upstream CHMP4C functions in regulating midbody resolution.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media23" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-06547-media23.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06547.040</object-id><label>Video 23.</label><caption><title>Representative example of asynchronous HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-CHMP4B and mCherry-Tubulin transfected with NT siRNA.</title><p>Midbody resolution is indicated with an arrow.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, the lowest mobility IST1 species observed in mitotically arrested cells was eliminated upon treatment with Aurora B inhibitor (lane 4 vs 3), whereas the intermediate mobility species was not altered by this treatment. These effects are similar to those observed for the IST1<sup>R</sup> 4SA mutant or upon ULK3 depletion. These observations suggest that the low-mobility species is required for abscission checkpoint function and that additional site(s) on IST1 could be phosphorylated by ULK3 or other mitotic kinases in an Aurora B-independent manner. We, therefore, tested whether immunoprecipitated HA-tagged CHMP4 proteins could be phosphorylated by ULK3 in vitro. CHMP4C was phosphorylated by recombinant ULK3 in these experiments, whereas CHMP4A and CHMP4B were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). ULK3 phosphorylation was retained in a CHMP4C deletion mutant that lacked both the ALIX-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McCullough et al., 2008</xref>) and the C-terminal insertion that is phosphorylated by Aurora B<sup>23,24</sup> (CHMP4C 1–200; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>, lane 3). However, ULK3 phosphorylation was lost upon further deletion of the MIM2 element (CHMP4C 1–184; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>, lane 4). These results show that ULK3 and Aurora B target different residues in CHMP4C and indicate that ULK3-dependent phosphorylation requires the MIM2 region. In agreement with the in vitro data, CHMP4C phosphorylation was also observed in cells co-transfected with Myc-CHMP4C and OSF-ULK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>) as was observed for other ULK3 ESCRT-III substrates.</p><p>We have previously shown that CHMP4C is phosphorylated at the start of mitosis and dephosphorylated as mitosis progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlton et al., 2012</xref>). This phosphorylation induces a mobility shift that can be followed by Western blot of cells expressing HA-CHMP4C at functional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlton et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Importantly, mitotic CHMP4C phosphorylation was also observed for a HA-CHMP4C mutant that lacked the Aurora B target residues (CHMP4CδINS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, Aurora B-independent phosphorylation of CHMP4C occurs during cell division. Quantitative Western blot revealed that mitotic arrest increased the fraction of phosphorylated CHMP4C (P-CHMP4C) to 81% vs 7% in asynchronous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>, lane 3 vs 1). However, depletion of ULK3 reduced the mitotic fraction of P-CHMP4C to just 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>, lane 4). These differences could not be attributed to gross changes in mitotic arrest because P-H3 levels remained constant upon ULK3 depletion. Similarly, the fraction of phosphorylated CHMP4CδINS increased in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>, lane 7 vs 3), and phosphorylation levels were again reduced by ULK3 depletion, albeit not as dramatically as in the case of WT CHMP4C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>, lane 8 vs 7 and 4). Hence, ULK3 contributes to mitotic CHMP4C phosphorylation, and ULK3-dependent phosphorylation and Aurora B-dependent phosphorylation of CHMP4C are separate events.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study reveals that ULK3 is an essential component of the abscission checkpoint. ULK3 provides inhibitory signals to the abscission machinery that are sustained in response to defective nuclear pore complex assembly or the presence of lagging chromosomes within the midbody, thereby ensuring faithful cytokinesis progression. ULK3 is also the first identified component of a pathway that delays abscission in response to midbody tension.</p><p>Both ULK3 kinase and ESCRT-III-binding activities are required for abscission regulation and our data support a model in which ULK3 phosphorylates ESCRT-III proteins, and thereby, delays the membrane cleavage step of abscission. Consistent with this model, we have identified a subset of ESCRT-III proteins, particularly IST1, which are bound and phosphorylated by ULK3. The MIT2 domain of ULK3 binds the MIM1 of IST1 with unusually high affinity. In contrast, both MIT domains contribute significantly to CHMP1A/B binding, suggesting that MIM1 elements of CHMP1 and IST1 proteins bind ULK3 in distinct ways. Both MIT domains contribute to ULK3 functions in the abscission checkpoint. These observations suggest that IST1 engages the ULK3 MIT2 domain, whereas the other MIT site is occupied by other ESCRT-III proteins and/or by yet unidentified binding partners.</p><p>IST1 phosphorylation is required to mediate the abscission checkpoint and an IST1 phosphomimetic mutant failed to support abscission, indicating that phosphorylation inhibits at least one IST1 abscission function. We can envision different, non-exclusive mechanisms by which ULK3 phosphorylation of ESCRT-III proteins could delay abscission. In one model, ULK3 phosphorylation could directly prevent extension of ESCRT-III filaments to the abscission site either because phosphorylation stabilizes the auto-inhibited ESCRT-III conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muziol et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bajorek et al., 2009b</xref>) or inhibits essential interactions within the polymer.</p><p>ESCRT-III phosphorylation could also modulate interactions with other components of the abscission machinery. Overexpression of catalytically active ULK3 induced both IST1 and CHMP4B to form single rings within the Flemming body, a phenotype rarely observed in control cells. Intriguingly, both endogenous ULK3 and functionally active CHMP4C also localize to the Flemming body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capalbo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlton et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that ULK3 may promote association of ESCRT-III subunits with abscission checkpoint regulators to form a cytokinetic inhibitory complex at the central region of the midbody. We also observed that phosphomimetic mutations enhanced IST1 interactions with the late-acting VPS4 protein and its activator LIP5 in cells. We speculate that these enhanced interactions are mediated by unidentified bridging factor(s) because the IST1 phosphorylation sites lie outside of the VPS4- and LIP5-binding sites. The Abscission/NoCut Checkpoint Regulator (ANCHR) protein delays abscission by retaining VPS4 at the Flemming body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thoresen et al., 2014</xref>), and it is, therefore, possible that phosphorylated IST1 may collaborate with ANCHR. Moreover, IST1 can also inhibit VPS4 ATPase activity by forming an inactive IST1-VPS4 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dimaano et al., 2008</xref>), and phosphorylated IST1 could, therefore, delay abscission by inhibiting VPS4 ATPase activity or by inhibiting productive VPS4 recruitment by ESCRT-III proteins, including CHMP1 and IST1, which help localize VPS4 to the midbody late in cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agromayor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bajorek et al., 2009a</xref>).</p><p>We have shown that ULK3 acts in concert with Aurora B to regulate abscission through CHMP4C. We favor a model in which ULK3 is activated during mitosis and functions downstream of Aurora B and CHMP4C. This would explain why mitotic phosphorylation of IST1 requires ULK3 and CHMP4C and why ULK3 overexpression can partially overcome the requirement for CHMP4C in abscission delay. Given that ULK3 phosphorylates multiple ESCRT-III subunits, the initial phosphorylation of CHMP4C by Aurora B could be subsequently ‘amplified’ by ULK3. Our data further show that ULK3 and Aurora B phosphorylate CHMP4C at different sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlton et al., 2012</xref>). This is consistent with the functional interdependence of ULK3 and CHMP4C in the abscission checkpoint and could contribute to creating a feedback loop that sustains the inhibitory signal. Mitotic phosphorylation of CHMP4C then decreases at (or near) the time of abscission, suggesting that a checkpoint-dependent phosphatase may override ULK3 activity and provide an ‘all clear’ signal to complete abscission.</p><p>Finally, the recent identification of CHMP4C variants as risk factors for ovarian cancer suggests that abscission checkpoint defects may increase the tumorigenic potential of the daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pharoah et al., 2013</xref>). The identification of ULK3 as an essential component of the abscission checkpoint, thus, opens a new avenue in the emerging relationship between the abscission checkpoint and tumor formation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Lists of plasmids, siRNA, antibodies, and cell lines used in this study are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Y2H assay</title><p>Yeast Y190 cells were co-transformed with 1 µg of each plasmid encoding the indicated proteins fused to the VP16 activation domain (pHB18) or the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (pGBKT7).

Phosphorylation sites were mapped onto the structure of IST1 (PDB ID 3FRR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bajorek et al., 2009b</xref>) using PyMOL (Version 1.3, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Thymidine–nocodazole block</title><p>Cells were incubated in 2 mM thymidine DMEM for 18 hr, washed with PBS, released into complete DMEM for 4 hr, and arrested in mitosis using DMEM containing 50 ng/ml nocodazole. Mitotic cells were collected the next day by shake-off, washed in PBS, and lysed in sample buffer. Asynchronous vehicle-treated (DMSO) cultures were lysed at equivalent time points. For siRNA treatments, cell synchronization was initiated 24 hr after the second transfection. Where indicated, the Aurora B inhibitor ZM447439 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) was used at 1 μM final concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>MHC I down-regulation assays</title><p>HeLa cells stably expressing KSHV-K3 (KK3) were a kind gift from Prof Paul Lehner (University of Cambridge, UK). HeLa KK3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hewitt et al., 2002</xref>) were seeded in a 12-well plate and transfected with siRNA (final concentration 100 nM) as described above. 24 hr after the second siRNA transfection, cells were harvested with PBS 0.5 mM EDTA, washed once in cold PBS, and incubated with PBS containing 2% serum and a FITC-conjugated α-MHC-I antibody (W6/32 clone, AbD Serotec) for 1 hr at 4°C. After washing with PBS 2% serum, cells were resuspended and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Surface MHC-I staining was analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACS-Calibur (Becton–Dickinson, UK).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Tetherin degradation assay</title><p>HT1080/THN-HA and HT1080/THN-HA K5 have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pardieu et al., 2010</xref>). Cells were seeded in 12-well plates and transfected with siRNA (final concentration 100 nM) as described above. 72 hr after the first siRNA transfection, cells were harvested with PBS 0.5 mM EDTA and resuspended in sample buffer. Total Tetherin-HA levels were analyzed by Western blot using α-HA and α-HSP90 antibodies, and visualized using Li-Cor secondary antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>HIV infectivity</title><p>293T cells were transfected with 100 nM of siRNA as described above. 48 hr later, cells were co-transfected with an additional 100 nM of siRNA and 300 ng of HIV pNL/HXB provirus using Lipofectamine 2000. After 48 hr, indicator HeLa-TZM-bl cells (CD4+, CXCR4+, CCR5+, HIV-1 LTR-LacZ) were infected with 100 µl of harvested supernatant from 293T cells. After an additional 48 hr, β-galactosidase activity in cell lysates was measured using the chemiluminescent detection reagent Galacto-Star (Applied Biosystems). In parallel, culture supernatants collected 48 hr after initial transfection were clarified by low-speed centrifugation, and virions were obtained through a 20% sucrose cushion (14,000 rpm, 2 hr). Viral protein contents in cells and particle lysates were analyzed by Western blot using α-Gag antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Cells were fixed with 4% PFA (20 min) or 0.1% Tween-20, 2% PFA in PBS (10 min), and 100% methanol (2 min). Cells were blocked with PBS 1% BSA or 3% FCS in PBS, stained with the indicated primary antibodies and Alexa 594, 488, or 647 conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Nuclei were visualized with Hoechst 33258. Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol. Samples were imaged using an AOBS SP2 confocal microscope (Leica, 60 × 1.4 N.A. oil-immersion objective). The AOTF was used to collect relevant narrow emission-λ windows for each fluorophore. Cells connected by midbodies were identified following tubulin staining, excluding multinucleated cells. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, data were collected using an Eclipse Ti-E Inverted CSU-X1 Spinning Disk Confocal (Nikon, Japan) equipped with an Ixon3 EM-CCD camera (Andor, UK). Images were acquired in series of 0.1 µm-spaced Z-stacks with a 100x objective.

Except where indicated, 24 hr after the second transfection cells were imaged for 24 hr on a Nikon Ti-Eclipse wide-field inverted microscope (Nikon 40 × 0.75 N.A. dry objective lens) equipped with Perfect Focus system and housed in a 37°C chamber (Solent Scientific, UK) fed with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Multiple fields of view were selected at various XY coordinates, where 3 slices were captured at a 1.25 μm Z-spacing. Images were acquired every 10 min using a CoolSnap HQ2 CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ), controlled by NIS-Elements software. Frame-by-frame analysis was performed within NIS-Elements, where abscission time was quantified as the period between midbody formation and severing. Midbody formation was scored as the first frame where two separate cells connected by a compacted bundle of tubulin and fully reformed nuclei were observed. YFP-LAP2β expressing cells were imaged for 72 hr, and chromatin bridge resolution time was scored as the time between nuclear envelope reassembly and bridge resolution. Intercellular bridges that regressed or left the field of view were excluded. For experiments with Aurora B inhibitor, cells at midbody stage were identified prior to treatment with 1 μM ZM447439 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), when imaging was initiated. Only cells at midbody stage where followed and time to abscission was scored following the same criteria as above. Selected TIF files were exported and assembled in Adobe Photoshop to generate movies with a 200-ms delay between each frame.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistical significance was tested using the Mann–Whitney two-tailed U test: ***p &lt; 0.0001, **p = 0.0003, *p &lt; 0.05, ns p &gt; 0.1.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Nikon Imaging Centre at KCL for technical support.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The referees’ comments are appended verbatim below. We have also specified the points that need to be addressed (with experiments or text changes).</p><p><italic>Referee 1</italic>:</p><p>This is an interesting paper by Martin-Serrano and colleagues on the mechanism of cytokinetic abscission. They identify a protein kinase, ULK3 that binds a number of components of the ESCRT III com-lex. ULK3 is the second kinase (after Aurora B) to enter into this pathway. Abscission happens more rapidly in cells defective in ULK3 and therefore the authors hypothesize that ULK3 is part of the abscission checkpoint that delays abscission until lagging chromosomes are fully segregated and until NPC are properly formed. ULK3 regulates the timing of abscission through phosphorylation and modulation of function of a member of the ESCRT complex protein IST1. ULK3 also functions with CHMP4C to regulate timing of abscission.</p><p>1) There is a large body of work in this paper and some important conclusions as well. My main concern stems from how the experiments are done in general, in that the entire study depends on over expression and siRNA based knockdown. In particular all protein-protein interactions have been performed with over expressed ULK3 and localization also done with over expressed ULK3. I think with genome editing working very efficiently through the suite of approaches (ZFN, TALEN, CRISPR/CAS9), I would want to see them make ULK3-HA or ULK3GFP in cell lines expressed off the native promoter to localize the protein and perform immunoprecipitations (for example see the Drubin lab papers on endocytosis in mammalian cells).</p><p>It is essential that this point is addressed either with a cell line expressing a chromosomally tagged ULK3 or the use of a ULK3 antibody, since all three referees have raised this point.</p><p>2) Similarly, given that ULK3 performs a checkpoint function via IST1 and CHMP4C (i.e. ULK3 is likely non-essential for growth and cell division), they should be also able to make a full deletion of ULK3 in cell lines to determine the precise phenotype. Having a precise deletion will also allow them to address the relationship between ULK3 and Aurora B (parallel vs. linear pathways) and ULK3 and CHMP4C more convincingly. They might also find that ULK3 deletion does not survive, in which case they would have unearthed something new.</p><p>You do not have to do this; however, you need to address the issue concerning Aurora B which is pointed out by all three referees.</p><p>Thus, despite the fact that the paper is full of very interesting findings, some more precise approaches will fortify the conclusions.</p><p><italic>Referee 2</italic>:</p><p>In this manuscript, Caballe et al. report the identification of the kinase ULK3 as a novel regulator of abscission. They show that ULK3 directly binds and phosphorylates several ESCRT-III subunits, and provide a detailed structural characterization of the interactions between the MIT domains of ULK3 and the MIM domains of ESCRT-III subunit IST1. They further show that ULK3 is required to delay abscission in response to the depletion of a nucleoporin (NUP153), to the release of mechanical midbody tension, and to the presence of chromosome bridges at the cleavage plane. The authors further identify ULK3-dependent phosphorylation sites on IST1, which contribute to the regulation of abscission timing, and they show that ULK3 phosphorylates CHMP4C to mediate the abscission delay. Based on these data, the authors propose that ULK3 is a regulator of a previously identified &quot;abscission checkpoint&quot; that monitors chromosome segregation and nuclear pore integrity. Overall, the manuscript presents high quality data and convincing interpretation. The new insights into the regulation of abscission are very interesting and relevant for a broad cell biological readership.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The authors show that depletion of ULK3 leads to premature resolution of anaphase chromosome bridges and use this as an argument that ULK3 functions in a previously identified Aurora B-dependent &quot;abscission checkpoint&quot; (Steigemann et al., 2009). The previous study, however, reported that loss-of-function of the Aurora B-dependent &quot;abscission checkpoint&quot; results in cleavage furrow regression rather than in premature resolution of chromosome bridges. The authors explain the different phenotypes by proposing that ULK3 functions downstream of Aurora B. There are, however, no data directly supporting this interpretation and ULK3 could also have a function independent of Aurora B. The authors should rephrase the Discussion accordingly.</p><p>It is essential you do this, since all three referees make this point.</p><p>2) The authors show that overexpressed HA-ULK3 co-localizes with IST1, either at the Flemming body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) or at midbody rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1C</xref>). As the overexpression of HA-ULK3 may potentially result in its mislocalization, it would be important to validate this observation by staining with antibodies against endogenous ULK3 in unperturbed conditions. In addition, quantification and statistical data analysis should be added to the ULK3 localization experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1C</xref>.</p><p>It is essential you address this, since all three referees have asked for this.</p><p><italic>Referee 3</italic>:</p><p>In this study, Caballe et al., describe the role of a novel protein kinase, ULK3, in the regulation of cytokinetic abscission. Using an impressive range of experimental approaches, this study characterizes ULK3 and dissects its interplay with ESCRT-III proteins as key regulators of abscission. An especially tight interaction was found between ULK3 and the ESCRT-III component IST1, and the authors determined the crystal structure of the ULK3 MIT2-IST1 MIM1 complex at 1.4 Å resolution. Importantly, by invoking a novel kinase as a central regulatory node, this study substantially develops our understanding of the poorly characterized abscission checkpoint. Considering the importance of cytokinetic/abscission fidelity in maintenance of genome integrity and prevention of tumorigenesis, this manuscript is of potential interest to a broad readership.</p><p>However, even though this study brings forward numerous exciting observations regarding ULK3 and ESCRT-III proteins, it does not always manage to combine these observations into a coherent story with a clear-cut molecular mechanism of action. Furthermore, the manuscript fails to relate ULK3 function to existing literature describing the abscission checkpoint and implicating Aurora B and downstream components.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The authors state that ULK3 is part of the Aurora B-mediated abscission checkpoint. If they want to maintain this statement they should further explore the ULK3-Aurora B relationship. Using similar nocodazole-release experiments to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>, the authors have previously concluded that the mobility shift of CHMP4C during mitosis (due to phosphorylation) was dependent on Aurora B activity (PMID:22422861; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-I</xref>). In turn, CHMP4C phosphorylation by Aurora B was found to depend on the 'INS' region. Using the same setup in the current study, the authors find that deleting the 'INS' region has no effect on CHMP4C phosphorylation during mitosis, with ULK3 being the main regulator of mitotic phosphorylation in the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). How do the authors explain this apparent discrepancy? To this end, and to mechanistically link the current study with existing literature, the authors should explore the relationship between Aurora B and ULK3 in more detail. Does ULK3 control interaction of Aurora B with CHMP4C? Does Aurora B provide the additional phosphorylation on IST1? This can be addressed using Aurora B inhibitors.</p><p>This point needs to be addressed with experiments as all referees have raised this.</p><p>2) The live imaging described in this study was performed by taking 3 z sections at 1.25μM intervals, and imaging every 10 minutes. This appears very little when considering the mildness of ULK3 phenotypes (with the mean difference sometimes as little as 20 minutes), the apparent variation between experiments (NT control mean values ranging from 80 to 100 minutes) and the fact that intercellular bridges can move significantly in Z, thus temporarily moving out of the plane of focus and obscuring time of abscission. Another consequence is poor temporal alignment of cells as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> (compare the t=0 time point for the non-targeting vs. ULK3 siRNAs in panel D; these cells are very different). To give the reader a better indication of the phenotypes involved, mean abscission time and associated standard deviation for important phenotypes should be mentioned in the Results text, as should the imaging frequency.</p><p>This point is important and needs to be validated with experiments.</p><p>3) The data relating to cell density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) are very interesting as they hint towards a role for ULK3 in tension-dependent abscission control, but they complicate interpretations of the other live imaging panels. These tension effects are larger (120min vs. 70min) than most other ULK3 live imaging phenotypes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figure 2 and 3</xref> (with only <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> exceeding this). The authors need to describe whether and how cell density, cell mobility and other tensile variables are considered and excluded as possible contributors to the phenotypes described in the other figure panels.</p><p>This requires careful explanation, but experiments are not required.</p><p>4) ULK3-dependent regulation of ESCRT-III subunits by phosphorylation is potentially one of the most exciting points of the study. However, in the current presentation, this regulation is incoherent and lacks mechanistic depth. For example, the authors describe ULK3 dependent phosphorylation of IST1, and identify 4 phosphorylation sites in IST1. However, it is unclear which of these are attributed to ULK3 and which are involved in abscission checkpoint signaling, complicating interpretation of results with the 4SA/E mutants in relation to ULK3. The authors should assess and clarify whether all 4 sites are ULK3 dependent, and if not, which ones are. This analysis could be done using in vitro kinase assays on recombinant proteins or by purifying IST1 from ULK3 depleted cells, followed by phospho-MS/MS analysis. Have the authors analyzed the single SA mutants? This is important since IST1 phospho-mutant phenotypes do not mimic ULK3 phenotypes, with ULK3 overexpression only mildly delaying abscission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), but the IST1 4SE showing strong effects on abscission and multinucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This discrepancy should be addressed.</p><p>Furthermore, does the IST1 4SA mutant mimic ULK3 depletion with respect to tension control of abscission or abscission in presence of chromatin bridges? Conversely, can the IST1 4SE mutant sustain checkpoint arrest in the absence of ULK3? (This is essential).</p><p>5) Overexpression of ULK3 alters the localization frequencies of IST1 and CHMP4B to the Flemming body. The authors should complement with localization studies in ULK3-depleted cells to rule out overexpression-induced artifacts.</p><p>This is essential.</p><p>6) A very interesting lead is provided by evidence that phosphorylated IST1 shows remarkably increased interaction with VPS4 and LIP5, but the implications of this exciting observation are not explored in a cellular context. This should be done, especially when considering the central position of VPS4 in the abscission checkpoint and ESCRT-III dynamics in general. Is VPS4 localization affected in the IST1 4SE mutant, and where does the 4SE mutant itself localize in normal cells? Does it localize to the Flemming body, as could be expected from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>? Furthermore, the position of the IST1 phosphorylation sites outside the MIM motifs leads the authors to suggest the existence of a bridging factor, but to lend more credibility to this statement the IST1 4SE mutant should be included in the yeast-2-hybrid setup shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>. Considering the published interaction between ANCHR, CHMP4C and VPS4, the authors should explore whether IST1 4SE, ANCHR and CHMP4C associate, and if so, whether this is stronger than for the WT IST1.</p><p>You do not have to do this, since it is beyond the scope of a study on IST1.</p><p>7) Furthermore, the relation between ULK3 and other ESCRT-III subunits should be explored further to see whether there is a more general trend in ULK3 effects on ESCRT-III: Does ULK3 overexpression similarly relocalize other phosphorylation targets such as CHMP1A, CHMP1B and CHMP2A to the Flemming body?</p><p>It is not essential that you do this, since the paper is mainly about IST1.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref> provide a critical argument that actual kinase activity is required for ULK3 function during abscission. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> suggests that association of kinase dead ULK3 (K44H) with ESCRT-III subunits is more tight than the WT ULK3 (2-10 fold higher beta-galactosidase activity), which could have major effects on cellular function of ULK3 and ESCRT-III. Since <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> suggests that kinase activity does not affect IST1 interaction with ULK3, is it possible that K44H affects ULK3 structure beyond its effect on kinase activity? This should be discussed. Also, since IST1 is a major component of this study, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> should include IST1 interaction data.</p><p>This is mostly about rewriting with some data that you might already have.</p><p>9) The proposed ULK3-CHMP4C link is not entirely convincing and seems almost like an afterthought. These proteins do not interact, and the authors do not explore the significance of the phosphorylation event in any detail (e.g. no mapping of target sites, no ULK3-specific phosphoCHMP4C mutants to see if this affects abscission timing etc.). On the other hand, several datasets points towards interplay between CHMP4C and ULK3 that are left undiscussed: For example, ULK3 KD seems to affect the overall level of CHMP4C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Can the authors explain this? Does ULK3 control CHMP4C stability, and can this be rescued by WT, K44M or M434D ULK3 alleles? Additionally, ULK3 SDS-PAGE mobility is altered upon CHMP4C knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Could this reflect altered ULK3 modifications, such as phosphorylation? This should be discussed. In the absence of further data the authors should play down their statements about the ULK3-CHMP4C link (This part could be deleted).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06547.048</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Referee 1:</p><p><italic>1) There is a large body of work in this paper and some important conclusions as well.

Nonetheless, we have taken the reviewer’s advice and used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to delete the ULK3 gene. New data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> shows that full deletion of ULK3 in two separate cell clones results in abscission checkpoint failure in response to disrupted nucleopores. This result is entirely consistent with our siRNA data.</p><p>We have also added new data to strengthen the conclusion that ULK3 and IST1 interact at physiological levels. In particular we have fused ULK3 to the R113G mutant of the <italic>E. coli</italic> BirA biotin ligase, which biotinylates lysine residues of proteins in close proximity. The BirA-ULK3 construct was then stably expressed in HeLa cells that were supplemented with biotin and subjected to streptavidin precipitation, demonstrating the specific association of BirA-ULK3 with the endogenous IST1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This new data is consistent with our result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, showing the interaction of HA-IST1 with the endogenous ULK3.</p><p>Lastly, we have now identified a commercial antibody that detects ULK3 in immunofluorescence imaging experiments. The new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> using this antibody shows the localization of endogenous ULK3 at the central region of the midbody. We also show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> that endogenous ULK3 co-localizes at the midbody with GFP-CHMP4C expressed at physiological levels, thus further supporting a role for ULK3 in cytokinetic abscission and a functional association between ULK3 and CHMP4C.</p><p><italic>2) Similarly, given that ULK3 performs a checkpoint function via IST1 and CHMP4C (i.e. ULK3 is likely non-essential for growth and cell division), they should be also able to make a full deletion of ULK3 in cell lines to determine the precise phenotype.

The fact that these cells are viable is consistent with our model that ULK3’s main function is to regulate the abscission machinery.</p><p>As requested by the three reviewers, we have addressed further the functional relationship between ULK3 and Aurora B and we now provide compelling evidence that abscission regulation by ULK3 requires Aurora B. More specifically, we show that the Aurora B inhibitor ZM447439 abrogates the abscission delays induced by ULK3 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). We also show that the treatment with the Aurora B inhibitor induces alterations in the mitotic phosphorylation of IST1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), a phenotype that is reminiscent of the effects in IST1 phosphorylation observed in ULK3-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Lastly, we have further analysed midbodies in the context of nucleopore disruption, showing that active Aurora B persists at the midbody in ULK3-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1E</xref>). Altogether, these new lines of evidence support our original model whereby ULK3 is a downstream component of the Aurora B-dependent abscission checkpoint.</p><p>Referee 2:</p><p><italic>In this manuscript, Caballe et al. report the identification of the kinase ULK3 as a novel regulator of abscission.

The authors should rephrase the Discussion accordingly</italic>.</p><p><italic>It is essential you do this, since all three referees make this point</italic>.</p><p>As discussed above we provide three new pieces of information supporting the idea that ULK3 functions downstream of Aurora B in the regulation of abscission.</p><p><italic>2) The authors show that overexpressed HA-ULK3 co-localizes with IST1, either at the Flemming body (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4B</italic></xref><italic>) or at midbody rings (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1"><italic>Figure 4–figure supplement 1C</italic></xref><italic>).

Nevertheless, we thank the reviewer for pointing the lack of clarity in our description of the localization of overexpressed HA-ULK3. This construct localizes to both the Flemming body (42% of midbodies analyzed) and the midbody rings (58%). We now have added a panel in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1C</xref> to show these localizations and we have included the corresponding quantification data in the figure legend. We have also scored the localization of the endogenous ULK3, finding a Flemming body localization in 93% of the cases vs 7% of cases showing localization to the midbody rings. Therefore overexpressed HA-ULK3 is not mislocalized although it has a higher tendency to localize to the midbody rings. Our interpretation of this difference is that the endogenous ULK3 likely shuttles between the Flemming body and the rings, whereas the overexpressed protein is more stabilized at the rings.</p><p>Owing to technical limitations, the co-localization of endogenous ULK3 and IST1 cannot be determined because both antibodies were raised in rabbits.</p><p>Referee 3:</p><p><italic>Even though this study brings forward numerous exciting observations regarding ULK3 and ESCRT-III proteins, it does not always manage to combine these observations into a coherent story with a clear-cut molecular mechanism of action. Furthermore, the manuscript fails to relate ULK3 function to existing literature describing the abscission checkpoint and implicating Aurora B and downstream components</italic>.</p><p><italic>Specific comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The authors state that ULK3 is part of the Aurora B-mediated abscission checkpoint. If they want to maintain this statement they should further explore the ULK3-Aurora B relationship. Using similar nocodazole-release experiments to those shown in Figure7–figure supplement 1, the authors have previously concluded that the mobility shift of CHMP4C during mitosis (due to phosphorylation) was dependent on Aurora B activity (PMID:22422861;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4D-I</italic></xref><italic>). In turn, CHMP4C phosphorylation by Aurora B was found to depend on the 'INS' region. Using the same setup in the current study, the authors find that deleting the 'INS' region has no effect on CHMP4C phosphorylation during mitosis, with ULK3 being the main regulator of mitotic phosphorylation in the current study (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7E</italic></xref><italic>). How do the authors explain this apparent discrepancy? To this end, and to mechanistically link the current study with existing literature, the authors should explore the relationship between Aurora B and ULK3 in more detail. Does ULK3 control interaction of Aurora B with CHMP4C? Does Aurora B provide the additional phosphorylation on IST1? This can be addressed using Aurora B inhibitors</italic>.</p><p><italic>This point needs to be addressed with experiments as all referees have raised this</italic>.</p><p>As discussed above, our new data demonstrate a functional connection between ULK3 and Aurora B, and support the notion that ULK3 is a downstream effector of Aurora B in the abscission checkpoint. This connection is further supported by our observation that mitotic phosphorylation of IST1 is reduced in cells treated with Aurora B inhibitor. This experiment shows that this additional phosphorylation of IST1 requires Aurora B but does not show that Aurora B itself phosphorylates IST1. We believe that a more likely alternative is that Aurora B activates a downstream kinase, such as ULK3, that phosphorylates IST1.</p><p>Based on the reviewer’s comments we realized that further clarification is needed to answer the apparent discrepancy on the Aurora B requirement for CHMP4C phosphorylation. It should be pointed out that we have looked at CHMP4C phosphorylation with two different approaches, by looking at changes in mobility using SDS-PAGE and by performing in vitro phosphorylation assays with recombinant kinases. These methods complement each other although it is well known that phosphorylation events do not result necessarily in mobility shifts. Our published data and the results in this manuscript indicate that Aurora B and ULK3 phosphorylate CHMP4C at separate sites with different consequences on the mobility of this protein in SDS-PAGE. In this context, we previously observed that the INS region is required for in vitro phosphorylation of CHMP4C by recombinant Aurora B (PMID:22422861; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-H</xref>), but we never showed that this insertion is required for the mobility shift observed in mitotically arrested cells. We have now done these experiments showing that deletion of the INS region does not alter the mobility shift of CHMP4C in mitosis whereas ULK3 depletion inhibits this shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). The fact that Aurora B inhibitors reduce the mitotic phosphorylation of CHMP4C as measured by mobility shifts (PMID:22422861; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) is now better explained by the new data indicating that ULK3 is a downstream effector of Aurora B, thus suggesting that Aurora B inhibition is likely to have a knock-on effect on ULK3 activity thus preventing the mitotic phosphorylation of CHMP4C. We have now included a model as the striking image to clarify this point.</p><p>Lastly, we agree with the reviewer that regulation of the Aurora B/CHMP4C interaction by ULK3 is possible. However, the Aurora B/CHMP4C interaction is not detectable by conventional methods other than in vitro kinase assays. This is not entirely surprising as the interaction of Aurora B with its physiological substrates is thought to be transient and these physical interactions have been rarely reported in the literature.</p><p><italic>2) The live imaging described in this study was performed by taking 3 z sections at 1.25μM intervals, and imaging every 10 minutes. This appears very little when considering the mildness of ULK3 phenotypes (with the mean difference sometimes as little as 20 minutes), the apparent variation between experiments (NT control mean values ranging from 80 to 100 minutes) and the fact that intercellular bridges can move significantly in Z, thus temporarily moving out of the plane of focus and obscuring time of abscission. Another consequence is poor temporal alignment of cells as exemplified in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1"><italic>Figure 2–figure supplement 1</italic></xref> <italic>(compare the t=0 time point for the non-targeting vs. ULK3 siRNAs in panel D; these cells are very different). To give the reader a better indication of the phenotypes involved, mean abscission time and associated standard deviation for important phenotypes should be mentioned in the Results text, as should the imaging frequency</italic>.</p><p><italic>This point is important and needs to be validated with experiments</italic>.</p><p>We disagree with the reviewer regarding the “mildness” of the ULK3 phenotypes. We emphasize the fact that these differences are highly significant and the magnitude of this difference is equivalent to the effects observed in CHMP4C-depleted cells, thus highlighting the biological relevance of this phenotype. Regarding the apparent variation between experiments, this reflects the normal day-to-day variation in abscission time that is observed in HeLa cells and our experiments are specifically designed to neutralize this issue. Crucially, equivalent cell cultures were treated in parallel with the different siRNAs, thus excluding cell density as a source of uncontrolled variability. Moreover, the data were acquired in parallel using a motorized microscope to ensure that the differences in abscission time are meaningful. Importantly, the small fraction of midbodies that moved out of the plane of focus were excluded from the analysis. Regarding the temporal alignment of cells, it is worth noting that midbody formation occurs less than 10 minutes after the end of anaphase. Hence, the apparent differences pointed by the reviewer represent stages that are very close in time. Moreover, to ensure that the differences observed are not due to potential artifacts associated with the scoring of midbody formation, we have re-analyzed an entire figure (including three independent experiments) using the end of anaphase instead of midbody formation as t=0. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref> shows, both types of analysis result in similar differences in the abscission time. The slightly longer abscission times observed when end of anaphase was used as t=0 are expected as this is an earlier event than midbody formation.</p><p>The mean abscission time and standard deviations are now mentioned in the text.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06547.049</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06547.049">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06547.049</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06547-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>3) The data relating to cell density (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref><italic>) are very interesting as they hint towards a role for ULK3 in tension-dependent abscission control, but they complicate interpretations of the other live imaging panels. These tension effects are larger (120min vs. 70min) than most other ULK3 live imaging phenotypes in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3"><italic>Figure 2 and 3</italic></xref> <italic>(with only</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref> <italic>exceeding this).

We now have modified the text to make this point clearer.</p><p><italic>4) ULK3-dependent regulation of ESCRT-III subunits by phosphorylation is potentially one of the most exciting points of the study. However, in the current presentation, this regulation is incoherent and lacks mechanistic depth. For example, the authors describe ULK3 dependent phosphorylation of IST1, and identify 4 phosphorylation sites in IST1. However, it is unclear which of these are attributed to ULK3 and which are involved in abscission checkpoint signaling, complicating interpretation of results with the 4SA/E mutants in relation to ULK3. The authors should assess and clarify whether all 4 sites are ULK3 dependent, and if not, which ones are. This analysis could be done using in vitro kinase assays on recombinant proteins or by purifying IST1 from ULK3 depleted cells, followed by phospho-MS/MS analysis. Have the authors analyzed the single SA mutants? This is important since IST1 phospho-mutant phenotypes do not mimic ULK3 phenotypes, with ULK3 overexpression only mildly delaying abscission (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>), but the IST1 4SE showing strong effects on abscission and multinucleation (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref><italic>). This discrepancy should be addressed</italic>.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, does the IST1 4SA mutant mimic ULK3 depletion with respect to tension control of abscission or abscission in presence of chromatin bridges? Conversely, can the IST1 4SE mutant sustain checkpoint arrest in the absence of ULK3? (This is essential)</italic>.</p><p>A) Regarding the reviewers’ concern that the 4SE mutant phenotype is more severe than our ULK3 overexpression phenotype, we would argue that this is the expected result because, the phosphomimetic Ser to Glu mutations are irreversible. We envision a model in which ULK3 delays abscission by phosphorylating IST1, rendering it incapable of functioning in abscission. If cells do not contain defects like lagging chromatin or misformed nuclear pores, they are released from the checkpoint, IST1 is dephosphorylated, and abscission proceeds. This model is consistent with our observation that IST1 cycles between phosphorylated and de-phosphorylated states throughout the cell cycle, with the phospho-IST1 species accumulating during mitosis (as mimicked by nocodazole treatment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). This “dephosphorylation” event cannot occur for the 4SE IST1 mutant. Moreover, we would point out that cells that express the IST1 4SE that escape abscission failure have delays (48 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), that are comparable to the delays induced by ULK3 overexpression (78 min and 39 min in two different experiments). Thus, IST1 4SE either inhibits abscission altogether or induces abscission delays that are comparable to ULK3 overexpression.</p><p>B) In response to the reviewer’s question whether the IST1 4SA mutant mimics ULK3 depletion with respect to tension control of abscission or abscission in presence of chromatin bridges, we have now examined the activities of the IST1 4SA mutant under both of these conditions (in addition to nuclear pore depletion, which was included in our original submission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, respectively). As expected the IST1 4SA mutant fails to delay abscission in response to nuclear pore depletion and lagging chromatin at the intercellular bridge. Surprisingly, however, the IST1 4SA mutant behaves like the wild type IST1 protein in response to tension. These observations imply that abscission delays that are triggered via (lack of) tension require different signals and/or may not be as sensitive to IST1 phosphorylation as delays triggered through nuclear pores or lagging chromatin. This result is interesting because it could mean that delays in abscission in response to tension may require additional ULK3 substrates and/or additional, unidentified phosphorylation sites on IST1.</p><p><italic>5) Overexpression of ULK3 alters the localization frequencies of IST1 and CHMP4B to the Flemming body. The authors should complement with localization studies in ULK3-depleted cells to rule out overexpression-induced artifacts</italic>.</p><p><italic>This is essential</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. However, we believe that the feasibility of the proposed experiment is unclear. Only a very small fraction of abscission events will be significantly delayed by the abscission checkpoint in unperturbed situations. For example, less than 5% of the cell division events have lagging chromosomes that delay abscission. Thus, the analysis of CHMP4B/IST1 localization in ULK3-depleted cells would mainly reveal the localization of these proteins in abscission events in which the abscission checkpoint would not normally be on. In contrast, ULK3 overexpression provides a unique opportunity for meaningful localization studies because this situation induces (or mimics) the abscission checkpoint in a large fraction of the cell division events. Additionally, our claim of ULK3-dependent midbody CHMP4B and IST1 relocalization is further supported by our new data showing that endogenous ULK3 and overexpressed ULK3 exhibit similar localization patterns.</p><p><italic>6) A very interesting lead is provided by evidence that phosphorylated IST1 shows remarkably increased interaction with VPS4 and LIP5, but the implications of this exciting observation are not explored in a cellular context. This should be done, especially when considering the central position of VPS4 in the abscission checkpoint and ESCRT-III dynamics in general. Is VPS4 localization affected in the IST1 4SE mutant, and where does the 4SE mutant itself localize in normal cells? Does it localize to the Flemming body, as could be expected from</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>? Furthermore, the position of the IST1 phosphorylation sites outside the MIM motifs leads the authors to suggest the existence of a bridging factor, but to lend more credibility to this statement the IST1 4SE mutant should be included in the yeast-2-hybrid setup shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1"><italic>Figure 6–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>. Considering the published interaction between ANCHR, CHMP4C and VPS4, the authors should explore whether IST1 4SE, ANCHR and CHMP4C associate, and if so, whether this is stronger than for the WT IST1</italic>.</p><p><italic>You do not have to do this, since it is beyond the scope of a study on IST1</italic>.</p><p><italic>7) Furthermore, the relation between ULK3 and other ESCRT-III subunits should be explored further to see whether there is a more general trend in ULK3 effects on ESCRT-III: Does ULK3 overexpression similarly relocalize other phosphorylation targets such as CHMP1A, CHMP1B and CHMP2A to the Flemming body</italic>?</p><p><italic>It is not essential that you do this, since the paper is mainly about IST1</italic>.</p><p><italic>8)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C and D</italic></xref> <italic>provide a critical argument that actual kinase activity is required for ULK3 function during abscission. However,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref> <italic>suggests that association of kinase dead ULK3 (K44H) with ESCRT-III subunits is more tight than the WT ULK3 (2-10 fold higher beta-galactosidase activity), which could have major effects on cellular function of ULK3 and ESCRT-III. Since</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref> <italic>suggests that kinase activity does not affect IST1 interaction with ULK3, is it possible that K44H affects ULK3 structure beyond its effect on kinase activity? This should be discussed. Also, since IST1 is a major component of this study,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref> <italic>should include IST1 interaction data</italic>.</p><p><italic>This is mostly about rewriting with some data that you might already have</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the K44H mutant gives a stronger signal than WT ULK3 with the ESCRT-III subunits but these differences should be interpreted with caution as the quantitative value of the yeast two-hybrid assay is very limited (beyond revealing whether or not two proteins interact). Moreover, the binding of WT or K44H ULK3 to ESCRT-III subunits such as IST1 is comparable when these interactions are tested by co-precipitation assays (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>), suggesting that the K44H mutation does not affect the ULK3 structure beyond its kinase activity.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06547.050</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06547.050">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06547.050</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06547-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>As noted in the text, two hybrid data for the ULK3/IST1 interaction are not included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> (or elsewhere) because both proteins induce reporter gene expression when they are fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain.</p><p><italic>9) The proposed ULK3-CHMP4C link is not entirely convincing and seems almost like an afterthought. These proteins do not interact, and the authors do not explore the significance of the phosphorylation event in any detail (e.g. no mapping of target sites, no ULK3-specific phosphoCHMP4C mutants to see if this affects abscission timing etc.). On the other hand, several datasets points towards interplay between CHMP4C and ULK3 that are left undiscussed: For example, ULK3 KD seems to affect the overall level of CHMP4C (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref><italic>). Can the authors explain this? Does ULK3 control CHMP4C stability, and can this be rescued by WT, K44M or M434D ULK3 alleles? Additionally, ULK3 SDS-PAGE mobility is altered upon CHMP4C knockdown (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5E</italic></xref><italic>). Could this reflect altered ULK3 modifications, such as phosphorylation? This should be discussed. In the absence of further data the authors should play down their statements about the ULK3-CHMP4C link (This part could be deleted)</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this is not a major aspect of our study, but we nevertheless believe that our paper is strengthened by its inclusion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
