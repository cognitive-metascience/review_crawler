specificity of these interactions are poorly understood. To discover these principles, we analyzed 26-residue model transmembrane proteins consisting exclusively of leucine and isoleucine (called LIL traptamers) that specifically activate the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) in mouse cells to confer growth factor independence. We discovered that the placement of a single side chain methyl group at specific positions in a traptamer determined whether it associated productively with the TMD of the human EPOR, the mouse EPOR, or both receptors. Association of the traptamers with the EPOR induced EPOR oligomerization in an orientation that stimulated receptor activity. These results highlight the high intrinsic specificity of TMD interactions, demonstrate that a single methyl group can dictate specificity, and define the minimal chemical difference that can modulate the specificity of TMD interactions and the activity of transmembrane proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transmembrane proteins</kwd><kwd>protein-protein interacctions</kwd><kwd>traptamers</kwd><kwd>membrane</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA037157</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiMaio</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kragelund</surname><given-names>Birthe B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kragelund</surname><given-names>Birthe B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM113132</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grigoryan</surname><given-names>Gevorg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB151032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grigoryan</surname><given-names>Gevorg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The placement of single methyl groups at certain positions in the sequence of small model transmembrane proteins consisting solely of leucines and isoleucines can modulate highly specific, productive interactions with the transmembrane domain of the erythropoietin receptor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Specific interactions between proteins underlie much of biology. Proteomics analysis has identified thousands of protein-protein interactions (<italic>e.g.</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bork et al., 2004</xref>]), but in most cases the molecular basis for the ability of a protein to bind to specific protein partners but not to closely related proteins is poorly understood. Integral membrane proteins constitute ~30% of the proteome of eukaryotic cells and serve many important biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lehnert et al., 2004</xref>). Transmembrane (TM) proteins contain TM domains (TMDs) that span the lipid bilayer. In multi-pass TM proteins, which span the membrane multiple times, TMDs interact to properly fold the protein into a functional state within the bilayer. For single-pass TM proteins, TMDs have traditionally been viewed as primarily serving to anchor the protein into the lipid bilayer, but they can engage in highly specific intermolecular protein-protein interactions that regulate protein oligomerization and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Langosch and Arkin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moore et al., 2008</xref>). TMDs can align laterally in the membrane and oligomerize via hydrogen bonds, salt-bridges, or van der Waals packing interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Langosch and Arkin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moore et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bugge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choma et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>). However, the analysis of TMD complexes has been hindered by the difficulties in obtaining high-resolution structures of protein segments that cross membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bugge et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Despite these limitations, TMDs also present advantages to the study of protein-protein interactions because they are short and usually adopt simple, helical structures in the membrane, which may fold independently of linked globular domains. The functional relevance of a free-standing TMD is illustrated by the E5 oncoprotein of bovine papillomavirus (BPV), a homodimeric, single-pass 44-residue TM protein that binds specifically to the TMD of the platelet-derived growth factor β receptor (PDGFβR), resulting in sustained receptor activation and cell transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petti et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schlegel et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldstein et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petti and DiMaio, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Talbert-Slagle and DiMaio, 2009</xref>).</p><p>To study the interactions between TMDs, we developed a genetic system to isolate small (&lt;50 residues), biologically active artificial TM proteins named traptamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Freeman-Cook and DiMaio, 2005</xref>). In this approach, we construct libraries expressing many different traptamers with randomized hydrophobic segments, and use genetic selection to isolate rare clones with a desired biological activity in mammalian cells. We have isolated traptamers that activate the PDGFβR and cause morphologic transformation of fibroblasts; others that down-regulate expression of the HIV co-receptor, CCR5, and confer resistance to R5-tropic strains of HIV; and still others that activate the human erythropoietin receptor (hEPOR) and induce cell proliferation and erythroid differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cammett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chacón et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freeman-Cook et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scheideman et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The EPOR is a single-pass TM protein that exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium in unstimulated cells and is driven toward a productive dimeric form by EPO binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Constantinescu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ebie and Fleming, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kubatzky et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Livnah et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moraga et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruan et al., 2004</xref>). Ligand-induced dimerization of the EPOR in the proper orientation results in autophosphorylation of constitutively bound JAK2 kinases, phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of the EPOR, and initiation of intracellular signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seubert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Syed et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witthuhn et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Remy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watowich, 2011</xref>). The mouse EPOR (mEPOR) but not the hEPOR is also activated by gp55-P, a 55 kDa viral TM protein with a large, glycosylated extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 1990</xref>). Point mutations in the TMDs of gp55-P and the mEPOR can prevent EPOR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amanuma et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zon et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Constantinescu et al., 1999</xref>). However, no gp55-P mutants displayed altered specificity, so the features of gp55-P that allow it to distinguish between the closely related mEPOR and hEPOR are unknown, and the role of extra-membrane segments of gp55-P has not been explored.</p><p>We reasoned that by shortening and drastically reducing the chemical complexity of traptamers as model TM proteins, we could determine the minimal chemical complexity required to construct a biologically active protein. Remarkably, we discovered that 26-residue traptamers consisting of only leucines and isoleucines following an initiating methionine (LIL traptamers) can specifically activate the PDGFβR and transform cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heim et al., 2015</xref>). Because these proteins are comprised exclusively of two hydrophobic amino acids that differ chemically only by the placement of a single side chain methyl group and cannot undergo post-translational modification, these results defined the minimal chemical complexity required to generate an active protein.</p><p>Here, we report the isolation and characterization of similar LIL traptamers that activate the mEPOR, the hEPOR, or both receptors. The active traptamers associated with the TMD of the target EPOR and induced EPOR oligomerization in an orientation that supported signaling. Most strikingly, the placement of a single methyl group at precise positions in the traptamer dictated its differential ability to associate with and activate the hEPOR or the mEPOR. These results reveal principles that govern the formation of an important class of protein-protein interactions by defining the minimal chemical difference that can determine specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Isolation of LIL traptamers that cooperate with the erythropoietin receptor</title><p>To isolate LIL traptamers that activate the EPOR, we screened the UDv6 traptamer library for proteins that support interleukin-3 (IL-3)-independent proliferation of BaF3 cells engineered to express the HA-tagged hEPOR (BaF3/hEPOR cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Most interestingly, the substitutions L9I and I10L dramatically changed the specificity of LH5: LH5-L9I cooperated with the hEPOR and not the mEPOR, and LH5-I10L cooperated with the mEPOR but not the human receptor.

To assess if the TMD of the EPOR determined whether it responded to the LH5 mutants, we constructed two chimeric EPORs by swapping the TMDs of hEPOR and mEPOR and tested the ability of the chimeras to respond to various traptamers. In the mhm chimera, the TMD of the mEPOR is replaced with the TMD of hEPOR, and in the hmh chimera, the TMD of the hEPOR was replaced with the TMD of mEPOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, top). EPO and LH5 induced IL-3 independence in BaF3 cells expressing either of these chimeras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, bottom panel), consistent with the ability of EPO and LH5 to activate both hEPOR and mEPOR. LH5-I10L, which is specific for the mEPOR, cooperated with hmhEPOR but not with mhmEPOR, whereas LH5-l9L, which is specific for hEPOR, cooperated with mhmEPOR and poorly with hmhEPOR. Thus, the ability of the traptamers to discriminate between the hEPOR and the mEPOR was determined by the amino acid sequence of the EPOR TMD.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Activation of EPOR and JAK2 by LIL traptamers</title><p>Tyrosine phosphorylation of the EPOR and its associated JAK2 kinases is a hallmark of EPOR activation.

Lysates were subjected to anti-HA immunoprecipitation to recover the HA-tagged EPOR, and immunoblotted with a broadly reactive anti-phosphotyrosine antibody.

LH5-L9I caused tyrosine phosphorylation of hEPOR but not mEPOR (lane 4), and LH5-I10L (lane 5) caused tyrosine phosphorylation of mEPOR but not hEPOR.

No EPOR was immunoprecipitated from cells not expressing a traptamer (lane 1) or expressing an untagged traptamer (lanes 3, 5, and 7), demonstrating that the anti-FLAG antibody does not cross-react with the EPOR. Similarly, EPOR was not co-immunoprecipitated from cells expressing FLAG-tagged LI-5, which activates PDGFβR but not the EPOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heim et al., 2015</xref>) (lane 2), or from cells expressing FLAG-tagged defective mutants LH5-L14I or LH5-L20I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), highlighting that these traptamers do not associate with the EPOR with sufficient affinity to be detected in this assay. In contrast, anti-FLAG antibody co-immunoprecipitated the HA-tagged hEPOR and mEPOR when FLAG-tagged LH5 was expressed in the cells (lane 4), showing that LH5 was indeed in a physical complex with the EPOR. Strikingly, the ability of the LH5 mutants to bind hEPOR or mEPOR in this assay correlated with their biological activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>): LH5-L9I bound to only hEPOR (lane 6), and LH5-I10L bound to only mEPOR (lane 8).

LH5 and LH5-L9I retained the ability to bind Δ259, whereas LH5-I10L was defective, consistent with its inability to bind the hEPOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>BaF3 cells expressing the full-length hEPOR, Δ259, or both full-length and truncated hEPOR were maintained in medium containing IL-3.

As described in the methods, we confirmed that the C-20 antibody did not directly immunoprecipitate Δ259 and that under these conditions there is little basal dimerization between full-length and truncated EPOR. BaF3/Δ259-hEPOR cells were then infected with the empty MSCVp vector, or MSCVp expressing LH5, LH5-L9I or LH5-I10L. If a traptamer promotes hEPOR dimerization, Δ259 should be immunoprecipitated with anti-C-20 due to its association with full-length hEPOR.

We used a 61-residue segment of the hEPOR (residues 217 to 277), comprising ~10 residues upstream of the TMD, the TMD itself, and ~30 residues downstream of the TMD. This segment (hEPOR<sub>217-277</sub>) was labeled with <sup>15</sup>N (or with <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>15</sup>N) and purified from bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bugge et al., 2015</xref>).

Earlier work showed that the EPOR TMD weakly dimerizes in C14SB detergent micelles, and similar to other TMDs its monomer-dimer equilibrium is determined by the protein-to-detergent ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ebie and Fleming, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mineev et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the hEPOR<sub>217-277</sub> monomer-dimer equilibrium was assayed by monitoring changes in protein backbone chemical shifts upon DHPC titration. The overlay of spectra at high (red) and low (black) DHPC concentrations showed clear changes in amide backbone chemical shifts (representative residues shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, a change in equilibrium occurred, likely reflecting a switch of the hEPOR TMD to a more monomeric state at increasing DHPC. The weighted and combined nitrogen and proton chemical shift changes per residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, red bars) revealed numerous residue-specific changes, most of which likely reflected packing differences with the detergent upon monomerization, most dramatically for residues close to the detergent head groups. Importantly, the chemical shift changes were not dependent on the concentration of DHPC in the sample but only on the ratio between protein and detergent (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that these residue-specific changes reflect the oligomerization state of the EPOR TMD.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27701.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>LH5 drives EPOR TMD peptides into dimers in detergent micelles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N- HSQC spectrum of <sup>15</sup>N-labelled hEPOR<sub>217-277</sub> in DHPC micelles with assignments indicated.

Addition of LH5 at low DHPC caused the chemical shifts of hEPOR<sub>217-277</sub> to change as illustrated by the NMR signals from Leu230 and Ala245 in the <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, blue peaks). The same resonances were affected by DHPC increase (red) or LH5 addition (blue), but in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Thus, these treatments most likely induce opposite changes in hEPOR<sub>217-277</sub>, with DHPC pushing the equilibrium toward the monomer and LH5 pushing it toward the dimer. We did not observe specific LH5-induced chemical shift changes in the middle of the TMD where LH5 Leu9 and Ile10 appear to interact with the EPOR. However, the interactions of LH5 with hEPOR<sub>217-277</sub> might be primarily side chain directed, as suggested by the mutation data, and thus not observable by backbone amide chemical shifts. In this case, dimerization-induced detergent repacking would dominate the changes in chemical shift. To further test the effect of LH5 on hEPOR<sub>217-277</sub> side chain chemical shifts, we recorded <sup>13</sup>C-HSQCs of <sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N-hEPOR<sub>217-277</sub> alone and in complex with LH5. Overall the two spectra aligned very well and no major chemical shift changes were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, addition of the traptamer caused the appearance of two novel peaks. Although we have not assigned these peaks, they do not appear to belong to hydrophobic side chain atoms, or a serine or threonine within the TMD, as the chemical shifts specific to the side chains of these residues were identical in the presence and absence of LH5. Regardless, these data show that the traptamers do change the chemical environment of a restricted number of side chains in the segment of the hEPOR included in these experiments.</p><p>When the mutant traptamer peptides were added to <sup>15</sup>N-labeled hEPOR TMD, the same residues were affected in the same direction as when LH5 was added, but the amplitudes of the chemical shift changes in the <sup>15</sup>N,<sup>1</sup>H-HSQC spectra were different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In accordance with the inability of LH5-I10L to cooperate with the hEPOR, this peptide induced the smallest chemical shift changes, whereas LH5-L9I and LH5, which cooperate with hEPOR, induced larger changes, illustrated for Leu230 and Ala245 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. These experiments indicate that all three peptides enhance dimerization of the hEPOR TMD, but the LH5 and LH5-L9I peptides were more active at inducing dimerization, consistent with the ability of the corresponding traptamers to cooperate with the hEPOR.</p><p>The differential ability of LH5-L9I and LH5-I10L to drive dimerization of the hEPOR TMD implies that this is a sequence-specific effect mediated by direct interactions between the TMDs, rather than by the traptamers changing the lipid/detergent environment of hEPOR TMD. If it is a direct effect, we predict that the traptamers would exert a saturable effect on the NMR spectra of the EPOR TMD, and additionally would not affect the TMD of an unrelated receptor. To test these predictions, we added traptamers at various ratios to hEPOR<sub>217-277</sub> and measured the induced chemical shift. As shown in Fig, 4E, the NMR shifts were clearly saturable at a traptamer-to-EPOR TMD ratio approaching 2 (as it would be for the 4:2 complex). Because of the small, induced chemical shift changes and the possibility of the experiment not being conducted at concentration well above <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>, we cannot assign a precise stoichiometry to the complex. Nevertheless, these results show that more than one and possibly four traptamer helices associate with each EPOR TMD dimer. Importantly, the saturability of this process shows that we observe a direct interaction rather than an indirect effect upon addition of LH5. We also investigated whether the equilibrium of the TMD of an unrelated receptor, the human growth hormone receptor (hGHR), was affected by LH5-L9I, the traptamer mutant that had the greatest effect on the hEPOR TMD. NMR spectra were obtained for the TMD of the hGHR in the presence and absence of LH5-L9I and at different protein-to-DHPC ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>).

However, the leucine or isoleucine substitution in the traptamer mutants would not modulate the hydrophobicity of LH5 to an extent that this effect could account for the diverse chemical shift changes observed. In addition, it seems likely that such an indirect effect would also affect the hGHR TMD. We thus conclude that the traptamers directly stabilize the dimeric form of the hEPOR TMD.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Residue at position 10 of traptamer LH5 plays an important role in determining specificity</title><p>We next sought to identify specific amino acids responsible for productive interaction between LH5 and the EPOR TMDs. We constructed LH5 mutants containing all combinations of leucine, isoleucine, valine and alanine at position 9 and 10 and tested the ability of these 16 proteins to cooperate with hEPOR or mEPOR in BaF3 cells. Valine is structurally similar to isoleucine except it lacks a terminal methyl group, and alanine has a small aliphatic side chain. The ability of a traptamer to cooperate with the hEPOR was determined solely by the presence of an isoleucine at position 10. Traptamers with an isoleucine at this position cooperated with the hEPOR, whereas mutants containing a leucine, valine, or alanine at position 10 displayed little if any ability to cooperate with the hEPOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, top panel). In contrast, the chemistry of the amino acid at position nine did not affect activity. Position 10 was also a prime determinant of activity with the mEPOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, bottom panel). Traptamers with leucine in position 10 cooperated with the mEPOR, regardless of the amino acid at position 9. Traptamers with isoleucine at position 10 activated the mEPOR only if they also contained a leucine or alanine at position 9. Traptamers with valine or alanine at position 10 did not cooperate with the mEPOR.

The activity of LH5-I10L was not affected by the mutation at position 236 or 239 in the mEPOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, the S238L mutation completely abrogated the ability of the mEPOR to respond to LH5-I10L, showing that Ser238 was important for specific recognition of the mEPOR by LH5-I10L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To confirm the role of Ser238 in determining traptamer specificity, we mutated Leu238 in the hEPOR to serine and tested the response of this mutant to LH5-I10L. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, left panel, LH5-I10L induced IL-3 independence in cells expressing the L238S hEPOR but not wild-type hEPOR. In addition, LH5-I10L formed a stable complex with the L238S hEPOR mutant but not with wild-type hEPOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, right panel). Thus, the absence of serine at position 238 in the TMD of hEPOR is the sole reason why hEPOR does not respond to LH5-I10L.</p><p>The analysis of LH5-L9I activity with these mutants was not straightforward. The L236V mEPOR mutant displayed the greatest ability to cooperate with LH5-L9I, but the S238L and L239V mutants displayed moderate ability to support LH5-L9I-mediated IL3-independent growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, several residues in the EPOR TMD controlled the response to LH5-I9L. Because of the secondary importance of position nine in determining traptamer specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we did not pursue the analysis of this position further.</p><p>We next determined which structural feature of Ser238 was required for activity with LH5-I10L. We mutated Ser238 to either of two small aliphatic residues, alanine and glycine, or to the polar residue threonine, which contains a side chain hydroxyl group like serine but is one methyl group larger. None of the mutants constitutively induced IL-3 independence (data not shown), and all were activated by LH5, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. Traptamer LH5-I10L induced IL-3 independence with the wild-type mEPOR and with the S238A and S238G mEPOR mutants. Thus, alanine or glycine can replace serine at position 238, demonstrating that the serine hydroxyl group is not important for activity in this assay. In contrast, LH5-I10L did not cooperate with the S238T mEPOR mutant, suggesting that the size of the side chain at position 238, rather than hydrophilicity, determined the ability of LH5-I10L to productively interact with the mEPOR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Compensatory mutations within the TMD of the EPOR receptor and a traptamer</title><p>The results described above raised the possibility that the long side chain at position 10 in the traptamer directly interacted with the short side chain of mEPOR TMD at position 238. If the residues at traptamer position 10 and mEPOR position 238 interact directly, we hypothesized that simultaneously swapping the residues at both of these positions might restore biological activity. We first tested the activity of a LH5 mutant with serine at position 10. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> (left panel), LH5-I10S did not cooperate with wild-type mEPOR to induce IL-3 independence. Strikingly, however, LH5-I10S cooperated with mEPOR/S238L to restore a significant level of IL3-independence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, left panel, black bar). Thus, LH5-I10S did not cooperate with the wild-type mEPOR and LH5-I10L did not cooperate with mEPOR S238L, but LH5-I10S did cooperate with mEPOR S238L.</p><p>We also conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments for the four combinations of proteins. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> (right panel), complex formation between mEPOR and LH5-I10L was abrogated by mutating position 10 in the traptamer to serine (lane 2) or by mutating Ser238 to leucine in the TMD of the mEPOR (lane 3). Notably, simultaneous mutation of position 10 of the traptamer and position 238 of the mEPOR restored complex formation (lane 4), consistent with restoration of biological activity by this combination of mutations. Restoration of activity by compensating mutations also implies that the defect of the position S238L mEPOR mutant is caused by direct disruption of the interaction with the traptamer and not, for example, by an indirect effect of the mutation on the receptor itself. Taken together, these results provide strong genetic evidence that the two proteins contact each other directly and suggest that this interaction is mediated by contacts between the side chains at position 10 in the traptamer and position 238 in the TMD of the mEPOR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Traptamers remodel the conformational landscape of EPOR TMD dimers in simulations</title><p>The TMD of the mEPOR (and to a lesser extent, the hEPOR) has intrinsic ability to homodimerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ebie and Fleming, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kubatzky et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2015</xref>).

We thus used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in an implicit membrane to determine whether traptamers may affect the conformation of EPOR TMDs within the dimer. Innate conformational preferences of mEPOR and hEPOR TMD dimers were first established by simulating these in the absence of traptamers (total simulation time of 1 μs; see Materials and methods). Ten independent simulations were run for each receptor, and inter-helical geometries in resulting trajectories were analyzed, focusing on helical phase. This parameter describes the rotation of individual TM helices about their helical axes, thus defining which helical faces pack into the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grigoryan and Degrado, 2011</xref>). Prior analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seubert et al., 2003</xref>) implies that close-to-symmetric configurations are likely most relevant in the context of the full-length EPOR, so we concentrated our analysis on these states. The helical phase distributions within such pseudo-symmetric conformations for both the hEPOR and mEPOR TMD are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> (black curves), with states corresponding to canonical coiled-coil heptad registers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grigoryan and Degrado, 2011</xref>) labeled with Roman numerals (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> for corresponding helical wheel diagrams).

We considered ratios of one, two, or four traptamer molecules per EPOR TMD dimer (designated 1:2, 2:2, and 4:2, respectively), with traptamers inserted in the membrane anti-parallel to EPOR TMDs. In addition, traptamers were restrained to remain in the proximity of the dimeric EPOR TMDs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> shows the helical phase distributions for EPOR TMD dimers in the presence of LH5 (red line), LH5-L9I (blue line), or LH5-I10L (green line) in the 2:2 stoichiometry. Introduction of traptamers caused substantial remodeling of the conformational landscape of the EPOR TMD dimers, as it did in the other stoichiometries we tested (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Notably, state <bold>III</bold> was nearly unpopulated with EPOR TMD dimers alone, but was sampled robustly in the presence of the traptamers. In state <bold>III</bold>, residue 238 of EPOR TMD mapped to a <bold>g</bold> position, making it available for quaternary interactions with traptamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; Ser238 labeled green), consistent with the experimentally-observed importance of position 238 in traptamer action. In contrast, in basal states <bold>IV</bold> and <bold>V</bold>, residue 238 was buried in the TMD dimer interface and therefore not accessible to the traptamer(s) and in basal state <bold>II</bold>, residue 238 was in position <bold>c</bold> far from the EPOR dimer interface. Remarkably, the placement of a single side chain methyl group at traptamer position 9 or 10 affected the phase distributions. For example, state <bold>IV</bold> in the hEPOR was populated in response to LH5 and LH5-L9I, but not in response to LH5-I10L. However, in the modeling there was no evident correlation between the biological activity of the wild-type and mutant traptamers against the different species of the EPOR and the ability of the traptamers to induce specific orientations of the EPOR TMDs. This is presumably because the biological activity of a particular mutant/EPOR combination arises from the ability of the traptamer to bind the EPOR, induce EPOR dimerization, and to trap it in a functional orientation, whereas our simulations capture only the latter effect because the sampling was limited to the associated state only.</p><p>To better understand how traptamers remodel the state distribution of EPOR TMDs, we considered state <bold>III</bold>, which is most clearly modulated in response to traptamers. We identified all snapshots from all trajectories that map to state <bold>III</bold> and extracted helical phases corresponding to position 238 in the EPOR TMD and positions 9 and 10 in the traptamers; these are represented as rosette plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> for hEPOR/LH5 and mEPOR/LH5 complexes. This analysis shows that positions 9 and 10 spend much of their time oriented towards the EPOR TMD, in a phase orientation that could enable them to engage EPOR position 238. In fact, analysis of simulation trajectories revealed that positions 9 or 10 are within van der Waals contact of position 238 (for at least one of the TMD helices) in 55% to 97% of all state-<bold>III</bold> trajectory snapshots, across all traptamers in all three tested stoichiometries. This is consistent with our genetic findings that TMD position 238 and traptamer positions 9 and 10 play crucial roles in establishing traptamer specificity in cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> also shows that there is considerable heterogeneity in traptamer rotational state, which suggests that traptamers act in a much more <italic>dynamic</italic> fashion than may typically be expected of signaling modulators. That is, rather than being frozen in a single preferred configuration with respect to the EPOR TMD dimer, traptamers appear to adopt a variety of orientations, yet still making specific contacts with the EPOR TMD and having a net effect of perturbing its conformational equilibrium.</p><p>NMR data suggest that EPOR TM dimers are symmetric, with or without traptamers, whereas we observe that many individual snapshots sampled in MD trajectories are significantly non-symmetric. Indeed, MD simulations showed that traptamers rapidly inter-convert between different helical phases in all stoichiometries, such that complexes can be expected to be symmetric only in an average sense. In fact, analysis of our MD trajectories revealed that all simulations are consistent with complexes approaching symmetry much faster than the typical ms NMR time scales (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these simulations demonstrated that traptamers significantly remodel the conformational landscapes of EPOR TMD dimers, shifting the populations towards states in which TMD position 238 interacted with traptamer residues 9 and 10. Furthermore, subtle chemical differences between traptamers can have dramatic consequences on this orientation. We point out that we have not established which EPOR TMD state is most relevant for EPOR activation by the traptamers, what the correct EPOR-traptamer stoichiometry is or, indeed, that there even is a single well-defined stoichiometry. Nevertheless, our results strongly suggest that the active LIL traptamers exhibit their functional effects through structurally specific interactions with the EPOR TMDs, even though they are likely to be dynamic and adopt a variety of conformations in complex with their target TMDs, consistent with their low information-content sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>All-atom simulations of the EPOR/traptamer complexes</title><p>Because the impact of lipids and water on interactions between the traptamers and the EPOR TMDs was not captured by the implicit modeling, we performed explicit-solvent all-atom MD simulations of the active and mutant traptamer-EPOR systems in 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayers. Representative 2:2 centroid models obtained from the implicit membrane-based simulations were used as starting points for all-atom simulations after adding short juxtamembrane domains to each end of the TMDs of the receptors. The helices were not restrained to remain associated in this modeling. After equilibration of the protein-bilayer system for 7 ns, each simulation was carried out for 50 ns (production run) in Gromacs 2016.1 in duplicate, with different random seeds. Although the resulting trajectories are not long enough to observe significant inter-state conversions of EPOR TMD dimers as with implicit-solvent simulations, several features of EPOR/traptamer complex were evident.</p><p>The EPOR TMDs remained associated with each other and with traptamers for the duration of the simulation in all systems and all replicates. Backbone root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) of the hEPOR TMD, relative to the equilibrated conformation, increased significantly in the presence of the parental LH5 traptamer, underscoring the dynamic nature of the complex, whereas the mEPOR TMD was much less dynamic than the hEPOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). When the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of individual residues were compared, these striking differences in the dynamics of the hEPOR and mEPOR TMDs in the presence of LH5 were distributed along the entire length of the TMDs in both complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Compared to LH5, the mutant traptamers caused a marked reduction in the dynamics of the hEPOR TMD along the length of the hEPOR TMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, top, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In contrast, dynamics of the mEPOR TMD were similar in the presence of LH5 and its mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). All of these trends were observed in both independent simulation replicas performed in each system. This analysis showed that the hEPOR and mEPOR TMDs responded differently to the traptamers and that repositioning a single methyl group in a traptamer can markedly affect the dynamics of the hEPOR TMD dimer along its entire length.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27701.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>All-atom simulations of the EPOR/traptamer complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RMSD profiles for the EPOR TMDs for the various receptor and traptamer systems.

The small size and chemical simplicity of the traptamers allowed us to analyze the basis for specificity in the absence of confounding factors such as contributions from protein segments outside of the membrane or hydrogen bonding between hydrophilic amino acid side chains. We discovered that single leucine-isoleucine substitutions at two positions in a traptamer, which change the placement of single methyl groups, determined whether it bound and activated the hEPOR, the mEPOR, or both receptors. Furthermore, corresponding changes on the receptor rescued activity. Because of the low sequence complexity of the traptamers and the minimal chemical differences that confer specificity, their ability to distinguish between the hEPOR and mEPOR is intriguing and potentially implies that entirely novel design principles can modulate the activity of TM proteins.</p><p>How does a protein composed of a 25-residue sequence of two similar hydrophobic amino acids activate a specific cellular target and discriminate between two closely related targets based on the placement of a single side chain methyl group in the sequence? Our data show that traptamer action is mediated by direct binding to the EPOR TMD. The biological activity of LH5 and its mutants correlates perfectly with their ability to associate with the hEPOR or mEPOR, the ability of the traptamers to activate the EPOR is determined by the sequence of the EPOR TMD, and the isolation of compensatory mutations in the traptamer and the mEPOR TMD constitutes formal genetic proof of a direct interaction. Finally, the molecular modeling and NMR studies provided additional evidence that the traptamers specifically interact with the EPOR TMD in simplified systems lacking other proteins. We therefore conclude that direct binding of the traptamers to the EPOR is mediated by complementarity between hydrophobic surfaces generated by the sequence of leucines and isoleucines in the traptamer and the sequence of the EPOR TMD. There are more than 33 million (2<sup>25</sup>) possible 25-residue sequences of leucine and isoleucine, suggesting that even such short, simple proteins can generate a large number of surfaces and thus potentially interact with a wide variety of target proteins.</p><p>The discovery of LH5 mutants that activate only the hEPOR or the mEPOR eliminates many trivial explanations for the specificity of the traptamers. Thus, the inability of such mutants to activate a particular EPOR is not the result of poor expression, incorrect localization, gross misfolding or major structural rearrangement or aggregation of the mutant traptamer, or of differential partitioning of the membrane into domains resulting in non-specific EPOR clustering and activation. Rather, our results strongly argue that the traptamers act by making specific, yet dynamic, contacts with the EPOR TMDs and that the amino acids at positions 9 and 10 in the traptamer and at specific positions in the EPOR TMD play key roles in this interaction, ultimately manifesting in differential ability to activate the human or mouse EPOR. Because van der Waals interactions require precise geometry and spacing, moving a methyl group at position 9 or 10 in LH5 one carbon closer or farther from the polypeptide backbone, respectively, generates a novel surface that is now complementary to only the hEPOR or the mEPOR, thereby altering specificity. Thus, the methyl group at these positions is acting as a molecular toggle switch to determine traptamer specificity. The ability of a traptamer to toggle back and forth between closely related targets in response to the placement of a single methyl group implies that the determinants of specificity within a membrane are controlled by minimal chemical differences.</p><p>The addition of the traptamers did not result in additional significant changes in the backbone NMR chemical shifts besides those resulting from dimerization. This observation suggests that the LIL traptamers have lipid-like chemical properties because of their low-complexity sequence containing purely hydrocarbon side chains, a feature which may favor dynamics in binding and allow for diversity in stoichiometry. It is therefore possible that traptamer:TMD complexes form un-conventional dynamic complexes, similar to the fuzzy interactions recently described for intrinsically disordered proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mittag et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Olsen et al., 2017</xref>), which may nevertheless still be of high affinity. The ability of the traptamers to productively interact in a highly specific manner with particular EPOR TMDs suggests that such dynamic interactions can also display high specificity in membranes. A route by which the traptamers would avoid non-specific interactions might be through a competition between the association of hetero- and homo-oligomeric complexes of EPOR as well as of the traptamer. The lipid-like properties of the traptamers may lead to the formation of traptamer polymer-islands in the membrane, implying that in order to bind a certain receptor, the traptamer:receptor interaction needs to be stronger than the internal affinity between traptamers and between the EPOR TMDs dimers in their inactive state.</p><p>Although the oligomerization state of the traptamer itself is not known, our co-immunoprecipitation and NMR experiments indicate that traptamer binding drives the EPOR toward the oligomeric, likely dimeric, form. Signaling by the EPOR is dependent on the orientation of its TMDs and linked cytoplasmic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moraga et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seubert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Syed et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Remy et al., 1999</xref>). In the absence of ligand, the TMDs of the mEPOR are in an inactive orientation stabilized by hydrogen bonds across the homodimer interface ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seubert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2015</xref>], and our MD results), but when the mEPOR dimer is in an active conformation Ser238 appears to be oriented away from this interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seubert et al., 2003</xref>). This implies that the traptamers not only stabilize the EPOR dimer but also cause it to adopt a productive orientation. Consistent with this interpretation, our implicit-membrane MD simulations indicate that the traptamers induce a fraction of the mEPOR TMDs to re-orient from an inactive orientation into one where Ser238 engages the traptamer <italic>via</italic> van der Waals interactions. Because of uncertainties in the stoichiometry of the complex, among other parameters, we cannot identify with certainty the active orientation, but rather our results imply that binding of the traptamers is likely to reorient the EPOR TMD from an inactive orientation into an active one. The differential response of the mEPOR and the hEPOR to the traptamers in the all-atom MD simulations raises the possibility that there are differences in the mechanisms by which the traptamers activate the two species of the EPOR.</p><p>The small size and chemical simplicity of the traptamers allowed us to interrogate all possible leucine-isoleucine substitutions in LH5. The results of these experiments established that specificity is determined by repositioning the methyl group at only a limited number of positions in LH5, whereas mutations that inhibit activity against both EPORs are distributed throughout the sequence. These results imply that the interaction of LH5 with the EPOR TMD is stabilized by multiple weak van der Waals interactions along the length of the TM helices, which, in aggregate, are sufficient to overcome the interhelical hydrogen bonds that stabilize the inactive conformations of the EPOR TMD. In such an association driven by shape complementarity, moving a single methyl group at numerous positions can cause steric clashes that disrupt or weaken the binding of the traptamer to the TMD of both the hEPOR and the mEPOR. In contrast, mutations at a few positions fine-tune specificity by generating surfaces that bind strongly to the TMD of only the hEPOR or the mEPOR, while retaining the ability to induce EPOR TMD dimerization and reorientation. Interestingly, the all-atom simulations demonstrated that the single leucine-isoleucine substitutions in the mutant traptamers generate conformational differences along the length of the hEPOR TMDs, showing that the structural consequences of these seemingly simple changes can be complex. We note that substitutions at positions 2 and 3 in LH5 also resulted in preferential activation of the hEPOR and the mEPOR, respectively, although the differences were not as dramatic as those caused by the L9I and I10L mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Because every seventh residue is on the same face of a TM coiled-coil, positions 2 and 9 are on one face of the TMD helix, and positions 3 and 10 are on a different face, implying that these two faces play particularly important roles in determining specificity.</p><p>Detailed analysis of a single traptamer does not provide a complete picture of the TM interactions that can drive EPOR activation. The active traptamers fall into two classes. LH1 to LH4 activate only the hEPOR, and LH5 activates both hEPOR and mEPOR. As shown in the boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, LH5 differs from the other traptamers at eleven positions, including the major specificity-determining positions 9 and 10. These striking sequence and specificity differences suggest that these two classes of traptamers interact with the hEPOR in fundamentally different ways, presumably though the formation of different interaction surfaces or different oligomeric states.</p><p>By developing a genetic system to study small TM proteins consisting of only leucines and isoleucines, we discovered that highly specific interactions can be fine-tuned by extremely subtle chemical differences confined to the membrane spanning segment and that this specificity can be driven exclusively by van der Waals interactions. The traptamers were not subjected to natural selection to eliminate undesired activities or interactions, implying that this high specificity is an intrinsic property of TMDs in the context of membrane lipids. This may be particularly true for TMDs that consist exclusively of hydrophobic residues, whose interaction partner(s) is dictated solely by shape complementarity along the length of the interacting helices. In contrast, hydrophilic amino acids can form interhelical hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions, in which interacting side chains may be sufficient to drive alternative TMD associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choma et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Although we studied extremely simple model transmembrane proteins, the principles uncovered here are likely to apply to at least some naturally occurring TMDs. For example, the TMD of the BPV E5 protein contains a stretch of 12 consecutive residues comprised exclusively of leucine and phenylalanine, and the TMD of the human colony stimulating factor receptor contains a conserved homopolymeric stretch of 10 consecutive leucines. In addition, the TMD of the PDGF β receptor contains diverse amino acids, but a leucine to isoleucine mutation in the middle of this TMD prevents binding of the E5 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edwards et al., 2013</xref>). Our results imply that naturally occurring TMD interactions based on shape complementarity would also display very high specificity, unless there was an evolutionary advantage to relax this specificity. During evolution, incorporation of a limited number of hydrophilic amino acids into TMDs consisting of otherwise hydrophobic amino acids may allow homologous interactions with a family of related but not identical TMDs containing hydrophilic residues, or may generate higher affinity interactions, even if that comes at the cost of reduced specificity. Our findings also show that supposedly conservative polymorphisms or mutations in TMDs can have profound effects on TM protein function and should be strictly evaluated for this possibility. These features of TMD interactions may also inform the design of biologically active TM proteins. Finally, our results suggest that agents including small hydrophobic molecules and peptides that disrupt or modulate specific interactions between TMDs could have valuable research and applied uses. Genetic selection of traptamers will be a powerful tool to elucidate additional rules governing transmembrane interactions and to identify lead compounds for these approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Vectors and cloning</title><p>The HA-tagged hEPOR and HA-tagged mEPOR genes (originally obtained from S.

Simulations of EPOR TMD dimers (hEPOR: LILTLSLILVVILVLLTVALL; mEPOR: LILTLSLILVLISLLLTVLALL) were initialized as ideal coiled-coils in the <bold>VI</bold> register, inserted normal to the membrane. Ten 100-ns simulations, with different random seeds, were then run from this starting conformation, with trajectory snapshots saved every 10 ps. To maximize productive sampling of dimeric states, a gentle harmonic restraint was applied to the distance between helical centroids with a force constant of 0.01 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup> and an equilibrium distance of 10 Å. No symmetry restraints were applied in simulations. To prevent artifacts at helical termini associated with the lack of the full-length protein context, backbone i-i +4 hydrogen bonding geometries were restrained for one residue at either terminus of each helix. The restraint was applied to the distance between corresponding backbone N and O atoms with a force constant of 1 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup> and the equilibrium distance of 2.87 Å<sup>2</sup>. Analysis of simulation trajectories revealed rapid sampling of helical phases with frequent switches between states (in fact, the initial <bold>VI</bold> state was rarely visited). The first 10 ns of each trajectory were treated as equilibration and discarded in all subsequent analysis. Starting conformations for simulating EPOR TMD dimers in the presence of traptamers were generated by extracting random EPOR TMD snapshots from the above trajectories and adding one, two, or four traptamer chains as ideal helices inserted anti-parallel to the EPOR TMD dimer. Traptamer chains were added with random displacements in the plane of the membrane within a radius of 20 Å from the EPOR TMD centroid. For each traptamer/stoichiometry/EPOR type, 100 such random starting points were generated and each used to initialize a 10-ns simulation with trajectory snapshots saved every 10 ps. To ensure proper equilibration of the larger traptamer/EPOR systems, the first 5 ns of each of these simulations were discarded in all analyses. The same restraints at helical termini as described above were applied to all traptamer chains. In addition, to prevent traptamers from diffusing away (and resulting in unproductive sampling), a flat-bottom semi-harmonic potential was applied to keep each traptamer within 20 Å of an EPOR TM helix. This constraint did not contribute energy if the traptamer centroid was within 20 Å of an EPOR helix centroid, while outside of this radius the restraint energy increased harmonically (applied to the distance by which the 20 Å limit was exceeded) with a force constant of 1 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup>. In the 2:2 and 4:2 topologies, half of the traptamer chains were restrained with respect to one EPOR helix and the other half with respect to the other helix.</p><p>To produce helical phase distributions, EPOR TM dimer structures from 10,000 randomly chosen trajectory snapshots for each simulation type were subjected to coiled-coil parameter analysis using the CCCP program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grigoryan and Degrado, 2011</xref>). CCCP finds an ideal coiled-coil structure that best fits to any given helical bundle. Snapshots that fit with root mean square deviation (RMSD) &gt;0.8 Å were ignored as not representing conformations sufficiently close to a coiled-coil to warrant clear interpretation of resulting parameters (~7,000–8,000 snapshots per simulation type survived this filter). Parameter values from remaining snapshots were used to construct the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>.</p><p>To study the rate at which the EPOR dimer may symmetrize, we analyzed all 100 independent implicit-solvent trajectories run for each EPOR/traptamer combination. To limit the effect of the starting conformation, the first 5 ns was discarded as equilibration, with the remainder used to study the extent to which the EPOR dimer would be expected to average out to a symmetric structure over time (i.e., an aggregate of 500 ns were analyzed). Because averaging the structure itself does not yield geometrically realistic conformations, we instead used a distance matrix-based measure of symmetry.

The AMBER99SB-ILDN-GORD_SLipids force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2010</xref>) force-field was used after adding the parameters for POPC molecules as established by SLIPIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jämbeck and Lyubartsev, 2012</xref>). Energy minimization was carried out in Gromacs with double precision to permit the system to stabilize. Following the minimization, an NVT equilibration was undertaken by applying a restraint on the lipids to allow the water molecules to re-orient around the lipid headgroups and exposed parts of the protein. Next, NPT equilibration was then carried out in two steps using the Nosé-Hoover thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nosé, 1984</xref>) and Parinello-Rahman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>) semi-isotropic coupling with a time constant of 2 fs and a temperature of 293°K. Long-range interactions were treated with the particle-mesh Ewald method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darden et al., 1993</xref>) (interpolation order of 4 with a grid spacing of 0.12 nm). Initially the protein was kept under restraint and the bilayer was allowed to equilibrate around the protein for 5 ns, following which a restraint on the bilayer was applied and the protein was allowed to equilibrate for 2 ns. The pressure progression and lateral area of the membrane was checked after the NPT equilibration to ensure system stability. The above protocol was followed for each of the prepared system, and these were set for a production MD run of 50 ns without any restraint on the water molecules, ions, protein or the bilayer. The analysis of the MD trajectories was also carried out with Gromacs 2016.1 and the data were plotted using MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">The MathWorks I, 2000</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Lisa Petti, Anne Edwards, Anne Bendsoe, and Katrine Bugge for helpful discussions, and Jan Zulkeski for assistance in preparing this manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jonathan Cooper (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Nir Ben-Tal (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Dieter Langosch (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the authors built on their previous approaches to identify protein-based ligands suited to activate cytokine receptors. Focusing on the erythropoetin receptor (EPOR), they applied a previously developed screening protocol whereby a large combinatorial library of transmembrane domains (26 residues long with either Ile or Leu in each position) was selected for candidates that induce ligand-independent cell survival. Indeed, they identified a number of sequences, referred to as traptamers, and went on to functionally characterize them. They demonstrate specificity in terms of human vs murine EPOR, the type of cytokine receptor, and transmembrane domain sequence. In addition, they show that i) the species-dependence of target receptor rests on the sequence of its own transmembrane segment, and ii) that compensatory mutations can be identified rescuing the activation of otherwise non-cognate pairs. Further, they can relate the activating potential of their novel traptamers to the dimerization of the target receptor, and applied NMR spectroscopy to support this claim. Finally, they present molecular models obtained by simulation that suggest a switch of receptor transmembrane helix-helix interface upon association with the activating traptamers.</p><p>Opinion: This is a beautiful study where different technical approaches are connected to provide a coherent view of how these novel artificial transmembrane domain ligands can activate those receptors. A main point is that there appears to be exquisite sequence-specificity behind those interactions. Although many transmembrane helix-helix interactions have been mapped now by mutation, few of them appear to be as specific as the ones presented here (this is almost too good to be true!).

Indeed, our data suggest that there is not a single defined structure of the complex, and rather that it is a dynamic structure in which the traptamers basically compete with the lipid to induce a larger fraction of EPOR to reside in an active conformation. Of course, this makes the specificity the traptamers display and the modulation of their activity by moving a single methyl group all the more interesting. These points are now discussed in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>We do not believe that the modeling and the NMR are in conflict, and rather that the apparent discrepancies reflect the different timescales of the experiments. In simulations, homo-dimers are always asymmetric at any given snapshot of time in solution at room temperature, which is what we observed in the modeling. In contrast, if the dimer is symmetric at the timescale of the NMR experiment (i.e., if the structure has time to equilibrate/average over the non-symmetric micro-states to arrive at a symmetric average), then there will be no peak doubling, as was indeed the case for the NMR data. To further address this, we extracted the timescale at which the dimer approaches symmetry in the implicit MD simulations. As shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>, the simulations approach symmetry much faster than NMR timescales, providing an explanation for the apparent discrepancy pointed out by the reviewer.</p><p>We also performed an additional NMR experiment, titrating increasing amounts of traptamer into the hEPOR TMD and measuring the chemical shifts in response to traptamer addition. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, we see clear saturation of the NMR signals for residues in the hEPOR TMD. These results provide further evidence that the traptamers bind specifically to the hEPOR TMD and suggest that there are multiple traptamers in association with each hEPOR TMD dimer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Furthermore, subtle changes of amide group signals reflect mostly the small perturbations of the backbone structure, e.g. helix bending due to the association.

Similarly, the detergents that are present tend to obscure the spectra to an extent that affects peak resolution. Nevertheless, we have performed 13C NMR as suggested and we see no doubling of signal in accordance with the symmetry of the complex. The addition of the traptamers did induce the appearance of a few new as-yet-unassigned EPOR side chain peaks supporting the conclusion that the traptamers and the EPOR TM region interact directly. This is shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In addition, NMR relaxation experiments can be used for estimation of the complex size.

This impacts tumbling rate, which makes it impossible to distinguish between a viscosity effect and a size effect, as discussed in the literature (Stanczak et al., JACS, 131(51): 18450-59, 2009). Furthermore, the presence of the micelles (DHPC micelle size of 4-5 nm), together with the very small size of the peptides, makes size determination unreliable. Thus, we do not believe it is possible to make a credible size determination in this system.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have performed all-atom MD simulations of the traptamer/EPOR TMD complex in an explicit lipid bilayer, with an aggregate of 100 ns of production sampling per system. Although this used a considerable amount of computational resources, these simulations are not long enough to produce a concrete model of structural modulation by traptamers. Indeed, developing an accurate model of action for a novel transmembrane protein purely from MD would be essentially unprecedented. Compounding the challenge here is the lack of clear evidence as to the specific traptamer/EPOR TMD stoichiometry. Nevertheless, we used explicit-solvent modeling to confirm and extend several of our conclusions from the implicit-solvent simulations. For example, we show that the complexes remain intact in the presence of lipid even in the absence of association restraints and that the traptamers can have dramatic effects on the structure and stability of the complex. These results are now shown in a new figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In principle, the simulations should give a very clear explanation of the effect of moving a methyl group on dimerization.

We are not yet able to assign specific consequences of moving the methyl group, but we have confirmed that moving these groups has a dramatic effect on the RMSD and RMSF of the hEPOR complexes, suggesting changes in dynamics.</p><p>Interestingly, these changes spread out along the entire TMD. These results are also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. In addition, in the implicit membrane modeling, we have further analyzed the movements of the side chains of the relevant amino acids (position 9 and 10 in the traptamer and position 238 of the EPOR), and now display the data as a rosette plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. We think that this is a clearer representation of the complex, because it highlights its dynamic character, and we have replaced the static structure in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> with it.</p></body></sub-article></article>
