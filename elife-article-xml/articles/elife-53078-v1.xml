Spacers are transcribed into guide RNAs that direct the Cas9 nuclease to its target on the invader. In liquid cultures, most bacteria acquire a single spacer. Multiple spacer integration is a rare event which significance for immunity is poorly understood. Here, we found that when phage infections occur on solid media, a high proportion of the surviving colonies display complex morphologies that contain cells with multiple spacers. This is the result of the viral-host co-evolution, in which the immunity provided by the initial acquired spacer is easily overcome by escaper phages. Our results reveal the versatility of CRISPR-Cas immunity, which can respond with both single or multiple spacer acquisition schemes to solve challenges presented by different environments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>coevolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1GM128184</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marraffini</surname><given-names>Luciano A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PATH Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marraffini</surname><given-names>Luciano A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marraffini</surname><given-names>Luciano A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cells must acquire multiple viral spacer sequences to neutralize mutant escaper phages and form colonies during the CRISPR-Cas immune response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clustered, regularly interspaced, short, palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci and their associated (<italic>cas</italic>) genes provide immunity against viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>) and plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2008</xref>) that infect prokaryotes.

This is because spacers are transcribed and processed into small RNAs (known as CRISPR RNAs, crRNAs) that guide Cas nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brouns et al., 2008</xref>) to destroy complementary nucleic acids of the invaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abudayyeh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garneau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Samai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Westra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zetsche et al., 2015</xref>). New spacers are acquired at a low rate from the invader’s genome upon infection and, remarkably, are invariably inserted in the first position of the CRISPR array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, spacer acquisition is comparable to an immunization of the bacterial or archaeal host, with the CRISPR array providing a temporal ‘vaccination’ record of the immunization events.</p><p>Depending on the <italic>cas</italic> gene content of a CRISPR locus, CRISPR systems are classified into six different types (I-VI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koonin et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we investigated spacer acquisition by the <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic> type II CRISPR-Cas systems, which employs the RNA-guided nuclease Cas9 to provide immunity through cleavage of the invader’s DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garneau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sapranauskas et al., 2011</xref>). This nuclease cleaves DNA targets that contain (i) a 20-nt complementary sequence with the crRNA guide, known as the protospacer, and (ii) a purine-rich sequence motif located immediately downstream of the protospacer, known as the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gasiunas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>). While these targeting rules are required to ensure that the response is specific against the virus, they also represent a liability to the host since phages carrying mutations in either the ‘seed’ sequence of the protospacer (a critical region of 6–8 nt at the 3’ end) or PAM can escape the type II CRISPR defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deveau et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our lab studies spacer acquisition in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> liquid cultures expressing the type II-A CRISPR-Cas locus of <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> SF370, after infection with the ϕNM4γ4 phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heler et al., 2015</xref>). In this system, approximately 1 in 10<sup>7</sup> non-immune infected cells survive through the incorporation of a new spacer, which occurs immediately upon infection and preferentially from the injected double-stranded DNA end of the phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Modell et al., 2017</xref>). The acquisition rate can be substantially increased in immune cells, where Cas9 cleavage of the viral DNA generates additional double-stranded DNA ends for the spacer acquisition machinery, a phenomenon known as ‘priming’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nussenzweig et al., 2019</xref>). The viral population often contains escaper phages that overcome the immunity mediated by a given guide RNA and can lyse bacteria harboring the cognate spacer. However, escaper phage propagation comes to a halt when they infect a host that contains a different spacer sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van Houte et al., 2016</xref>). Most staphylococci are immunized only once (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heler et al., 2019</xref>), therefore the spacer diversity required for the neutralization of escaper phage is achieved at the population, as opposed to the cellular, level. A small fraction of staphylococci that acquire multiple spacers can also be found, however whether this feature is important for survival is poorly understood.</p><p>We wondered how the growth on solid media would affect spacer acquisition. In this environment, bacteria that acquire new spacers grow into separated colonies that cannot mix to neutralize escapers. Therefore, it would be reasonable to expect that the rise of escapers within colonies would quickly end with the annihilation of the host. Indeed, theoretical studies have shown that due to the physical separation and clustering of different type of resistant hosts, a structured environment reduces the effective diversity of host resistance and promotes pathogen emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chabas et al., 2018</xref>). However, many CRISPR-resistant colonies can be formed after infection of staphylococci or streptococci with ϕNM4γ4 or ϕ2972 phage, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heler et al., 2017</xref>), results that suggest that the type II CRISPR-Cas immune response can limit the emergence of CRISPR-escaping viruses when cells are growing in solid media.</p><p>Here, we studied the formation of phage-resistant colonies in top agar media, using both our heterologous type II system and <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> cells that naturally encode this system. We found that the fate of the colony depends on the strength of the first spacer acquired. If the founder spacer has a very low proportion of escapers in the phage population, the colony grows smoothly and maintains a simple structure with the majority of cells harboring only this spacer. In contrast, when the viral population contains a high frequency of target mutations that avoid the type II CRISPR-Cas immunity mediated by the founder spacer, sectored colonies are formed, with each sector being composed of cells harboring additional spacers acquired after the founder spacer. In these colonies, the new spacers are selected by the escaper phage, which lyses bacteria containing only the founder spacer and thus promotes the formation of sectored colonies. While the colonies originated by weak founder spacers struggle to rise when compared to those founded by strong spacers, they undergo a co-evolution with the phage that leads to the generation of spacer diversity and higher viral resistance. Our study reveals the versatility of type II CRISPR-Cas systems, which can respond with both single or multiple spacer acquisition modes to generate immunological diversity at the population or cellular level, respectively, and ensure survival in different environments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bacteriophage-resistant colonies display two modes of spacer acquisition</title><p>After infection of a liquid culture of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> RN4220 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kreiswirth et al., 1983</xref>) carrying the type II-A CRISPR-Cas locus of <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> SF370 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deltcheva et al., 2011</xref>) in the plasmid pC194 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Horinouchi and Weisblum, 1982</xref>) with the ϕNM4γ4 phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldberg et al., 2014</xref>), bacterial survival is achieved through the acquisition of spacer sequences from the viral genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heler et al., 2015</xref>), with the new spacer inserted at the leader-end of the CRISPR array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

This distributes cells containing different spacers and ensures that escaper viruses are unable to spread. We wondered whether and how escapers are neutralized in a more structured environment where phage and CRISPR-adapted cells cannot mix. To test this, we performed the same experiment described above, but in semi-solid agar plates, mixing bacteria and phage at a multiplicity of infection, MOI, of 2: 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> staphylococci and 4 × 10<sup>9</sup> ϕNM4γ4 particles, conditions that minimize the rise of non-CRISPR resistance. About 2000 colonies grew after 48 hr of incubation, which we checked for spacer acquisition via PCR to find that some acquired a single spacer and others displayed a heterogenous composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>); that is they contained cells with 1, 2, 3 and 4 spacers. To analyze the spacer content of different cells within these colonies, we re-streaked three of them and amplified and sequenced the CRISPR locus of four of the resulting colonies. We found that the original mono-spacer colonies were composed of staphylococci harboring the same spacer sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). In contrast, the multi-spacer colonies contained cells with 1, 2, 3 or 4 spacers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). In addition, in all cases, the sequence of the first acquired spacer was the same, indicating that the founder cell of the colony acquired a single spacer that allowed phage resistance, but as this cell divided more, different, spacers were added. To corroborate that the different cells of the colony originated from the same single-spacer ancestor, we employed a version of the type II-A CRISPR plasmid containing a randomized sequence upstream of the first repeat, that functions as a unique barcode for each plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heler et al., 2019</xref>). We performed the same experiment using this plasmid and found a complete correlation between the barcode and first spacer sequence in each cell of the surviving colonies. This result shows (i) that the different spacers are not a consequence of the presence of different pCRISPR plasmids within the cells of the colony and (ii) that multi-spacer colonies are generated by a single cell that acquired a (founder) spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The sequence of the founder spacer determines the colony type</title><p>Next, we investigated the effect of the founder spacer on the expansion of the CRISPR array. We used plasmids isolated from one of the mono-spacer colonies or from one of the colonies that contained only the first acquired spacer obtained after re-streaking multi-spacer colonies. To eliminate any possible chromosomal mutations that could have played a role in the selection of the phage-resistant colonies, we re-introduced both plasmids into <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> RN4220 cells and performed a modified version of the soft-agar infection experiment. These staphylococci contain a spacer that makes them immune to phage lysis, therefore, to mimic the conditions that lead to survival in the original experiment, we mixed only 2000 CRISPR-immune cells (the previously determined number of CRISPR-survivors) with 1.3 × 10<sup>9</sup> susceptible (without the CRISPR plasmid) staphylococci and 2.6 × 10<sup>9</sup> ϕNM4γ4 particles (MOI = 2). As expected, after 48 hr of incubation, we obtained about ~ 2000 phage-resistant colonies on each plate and analyzed the spacer content of 8 of them. We found minimal spacer acquisition in the colonies obtained from the mono-spacer founder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast, the surviving colonies produced from the multi-spacer founder plasmid displayed substantial spacer acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This result indicates that the first spacer acquired by a CRISPR-adapted cell determines the spacer content of its progeny during the formation of the colony.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Priming by the first acquired spacer is likely involved in CRISPR expansion</title><p>To analyze in more detail the spacer content of the surviving population, we isolated 26 individual colonies from a replica of the experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, amplified their CRISPR array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and subjected the PCR products to next-generation sequencing (NGS). We found 10 colonies that produced &gt; 98% of single-spacer reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) and therefore they belong to the mono-spacer category, also evident from the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The remaining 16 colonies displayed a variable fraction of multi-spacer reads, ranging from 5% to 85%. We used these data to determine whether ‘priming’ is involved in the sequential acquisition of new spacers. During primed CRISPR adaptation, the frequency of spacer acquisition is significantly increased by the presence of a pre-existing targeting spacer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Datsenko et al., 2012</xref>). When we use our experimental system to investigate priming after infection of cells in liquid culture, the acquisition of additional spacers occurs from regions flanking the Cas9 target site determined by the pre-existing spacer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nussenzweig et al., 2019</xref>). To test for primed acquisition in solid media, we extracted 1711 spacer pairs from the NGS data and measured the first-to-second spacer distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). We found that, similarly to our previous results in liquid cultures, there is a marked enrichment of second spacers derived from the 500 bp region adjacent to the target of the first spacer. This result suggests that primed, or cleavage-mediated, spacer acquisition plays an important role to create multi-spacer cells and colonies.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CRISPR expansion likely involves priming by the first acquired spacer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Agarose gel electrophoresis of the products of the amplification of the pCRISPR array present in staphylococci infected in semi-solid media with ϕNM4γ4, using plasmid DNA templates extracted from 26 different surviving colonies and the unexpanded array (u); red and blue letters: mono- and multi-spacer colony names.

This finding demonstrates that multiple spacer acquisition occurs in both colony types, most likely through priming as shown above. Thus, the generation of multi-spacer colonies can be explained by at least two non-exclusive mechanisms. One possibility is that the founder spacer mediates very efficient priming that leads to the generation of high numbers of multi-spacer cells as the colony forms. Another scenario is that additional spacer acquisition through priming mediated by the founder spacer is equally infrequent, but the viral population contains a high frequency of escaper phages that can evade the immunity mediated by the founder spacer. This results in the positive selection of the few cells that contain an extended CRISPR array, leading to the formation of multi-spacer colonies. In this scenario, founder bacteria that acquired spacers with a low escape rate in the viral population grow largely unchallenged; cells harboring additional spacers are not selected and a mono-spacer colony is formed. We tested this hypothesis with three experiments. First, we measured the escape rate of different founder spacers by calculating the fraction of escapers within the phage population. We found that 8/9 founder spacers from multi-spacer colonies showed high rates of escape, where 1 in 10<sup>6</sup>–10<sup>7</sup> phages were able to evade type II CRISPR-Cas immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, founder spacers (10 tested) of mono-spacer colonies displayed a much lower frequency of escape, ranging from undetectable to a maximum of 10<sup>−8</sup>. Sequencing of the different targets confirmed that the escaper phages contained seed or PAM mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, we looked for the presence of escaper phage in the colonies that resulted from infection of mono-spacer founder cells in the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and were unable to detect phages that could bypass spacer F<sub>0</sub> immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Third, we measured the presence of phages that specifically evade targeting by the founder spacer within the surviving colony. To do this, we resuspended two multi-spacer phage-resistant colonies in media and centrifuged them to separate cells from soluble phage particles. The pelleted staphylococci were re-streaked and checked for the number of acquired spacers to isolate cells with only one, two or three spacers. Lawns of these bacteria were infected with 10-fold dilutions of phage from either the wild-type stock or isolated from each of the colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We found that staphylococci harboring only the founder spacer were readily infected by the phage isolated from their own colony, but not by the second phage. The acquisition of an additional spacer drastically reduced the propagation of the phage, and the insertion of the third spacer drove plaque formation below the limit of detection of the assay.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The ability of phage to escape targeting by the founding spacer determines colony heterogeneity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Efficiency of plaquing (EOP), calculated as the number of ϕNM4γ4 plaques on the test strain relative to the total number of phage particles in the stock.

We isolated a phage that can overcome targeting by spacer F<sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), a mono-spacer colony founder, and repeated the experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> infecting with a mixture of wild-type and escaper phage. We previously measured that the frequency of escape of spacer F<sub>0</sub>is ~ 10<sup>−8</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>); we added escaper phage to raise this rate to 10<sup>−5</sup>. As opposed to the previous results, the increase in the proportion of escaper phage generated multi-spacer colonies from this otherwise mono-spacer colony founder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and contained phage that escaped the immunity provided by the F<sub>0</sub> spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that the escape rate of the founder spacer determines the spacer content of the colony, with high levels of escape leading to the formation of multi-spacer colonies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Multi-spacer colonies emerge late</title><p>Given that primed spacer acquisition is a relatively rare event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nussenzweig et al., 2019</xref>), the majority of cells in a developing colony contain only the founder spacer. Therefore, a high rate of escape of this spacer would lead to the predation of most cells in the bacterial community by target mutant phages, possibly even abrogating the formation of the colony. To corroborate this, we quantified the number of colonies obtained in the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>. Indeed, whereas about 1000 of the 2000 staphylococci harboring the mono-spacer founder F<sub>0</sub> added to the top agar survived infection, only about 500 cells containing the multi-spacer founder C<sub>0</sub> were able to form colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Analysis of the spacer content of several of these colonies revealed that while the smooth colonies contained a single spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), the sectored ones harbored multiple spacers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

Moreover, in the absence of spacer acquisition the addition of escaper phage resulted in the formation of translucent Δ<italic>cas2</italic> colonies, most likely formed before the rise of escapers and then disintegrated. To corroborate these results, we grew mono-spacer, smooth, colonies in the absence of phage for 24 hr and then added an excess of escaper phage on top of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

After 24 hr of incubation, we observed that PBS did not alter the morphology of the colonies; that is they remained smooth. As expected, lysostaphin lysed the cells and produced translucent colonies. In contrast, the addition of exogenous escaper phage altered the morphology of the colonies, from smooth to sectored.

Strong founder spacers, in contrast, should quickly neutralize the phage. To test these hypotheses, we performed a time-shift experiment that evaluates the resistance of bacterial samples over time against phage from past, concurrent, and future time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Common et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laanto et al., 2017</xref>).

Finally, each colony, as well as their respective founders, were grown in liquid cultures and used to seed top agar media. On these plates, 2 μl of stock phage (which has not co-evolved with CRISPR-resistant staphylococci and was used to obtain the ‘time zero’ datapoint) or phage isolated from each colony was spotted. After overnight incubation at 37°C, we evaluated the resistance of the bacteria on the top agar as follows: bacterial growth in the zone where phage was spotted was considered as ‘full resistance’ and given a score of 1; complete inhibition of growth (clear spot) was determined to be ‘no resistance’ and given a score of 0. Partial inhibition was given a score of 0.5. The resistance scores for the bacteria against these 12 phage populations of a given time-point were averaged for each host, with the exception of the time zero datapoints, obtained with only the stock phage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate whether colonies of a given time-point gained or lost resistance over time, we calculated the average resistance of a colony against all the phage from the same time point and plotted the score averages for each colony over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). We found that the mono-spacer founder F is initially resistant to the stock phage, but experiences a small decrease in immunity (from a score of 1 to 0.83) against all ‘future’ phages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), demonstrating that the co-evolution of the phage with cells carrying this spacer generates a low number of escapers that increases over time. This co-evolution also increases the resistance of post-infection bacteria collected at 24, 36 and 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>), leading to a stable co-existence of phage and resistant bacteria at the end of the experiment. In contrast, the results obtained after following the infection of spacer C hosts revealed more drastic co-evolution dynamics. First, founder cells showed a marked susceptibility to ‘future’ phages that co-evolved over time (from a score of 1 to 0.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), an observation in agreement with previous results showing that spacer C is more likely to encounter escaper phages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Strain DGCC7710 harbors two type II-A CRISPR loci (CRISPR1 and CRISPR3) that function independently from one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carte et al., 2014</xref>) and although both are capable of spacer acquisition, CRISPR1 is preferentially used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). We infected naive cells with the phage ϕ2972 in soft agar to isolate resistant colonies as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hynes et al., 2017</xref>). After inspection under the microscope, we detected colonies with or without small satellites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), and we selected three of each type for PCR analysis. DNA samples obtained from the center of the colonies showed only one spacer inserted into the CRISPR1 locus except for the satellite-containing colony B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). As we did before, to analyze the spacer content of different cells within these colonies, we re-streaked them and amplified and sequenced the CRISPR1 locus of four of the resulting colonies. We found that regular colonies were composed of streptococci harboring the same spacer sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The satellite-containing colonies B1 and C2, but not B2, contained cells with 1, 2 or 3 spacers, with a common sequence for the first spacer acquired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Finally, we isolated DNA from specific satellites to determine their spacer content. We found that colony B2, for which we detected only mono-spacer cells with the central body, contained satellites with 1, 2 or 3 spacers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). A similar outcome was obtained after the analysis of satellites surrounding colony C2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Based on the above results with staphylococci, we wondered whether the immunity provided by founder spacer of satellite colonies is easily bypassed by escaper phages present within the colony. To test this, we performed the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, isolating phage from the B2 and C2 colonies and measuring their propagation on streptococci harboring only the founder spacers for these colonies or an additional spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Indeed, we found that the B2 founder spacer provided strong immunity to cells infected with the phage collected from the C2 colony but failed to protect the host from phage isolated from the B2 colony. The additional B2 spacer, on the other hand, restored full immunity. Similarly, no plaques were observed upon infection of the streptococci carrying the C2 founder spacer with phage obtained from the B2 colony, but no protection was conferred by this founder spacer against infection with phage from colony C2, a result that was reverted by the addition of a second spacer. Altogether, these results show that CRISPR-adapted <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> colonies contain satellites with multiple spacers, all harboring the same first, founder spacer. Phages within the colony can escape the immunity provided by the founder spacer, but not the protection conferred by the presence of additional spacers. Although there are differences with the previous results obtained with our heterologous experimental system (that could be explained in part by the use of different organisms and viruses; see Discussion below), these results indicate that the type II CRISPR-Cas immune response similarly affects the development of <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> and <italic>S. aureus-</italic>resistant colonies: the immunological strength of founder spacers determine the morphology of the colony they originate, most likely by affecting the viral-host co-evolution dynamics.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Analysis of <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> phage-resistant colonies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phage-resistant colonies obtained 24 or 72 hr after infection of <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> DGCC7710 with ϕ2972.

CRISPR immunity starts with the acquisition of a spacer sequence from the invading phage, which confers resistance to the cell. When infection occurs in solid media, each of these resistant bacteria can form a colony. We found that the strength of the immunity provided by the spacer acquired in the founder cell determines the nature of the virus-host co-evolution that occurs during the formation of the colony. This co-evolution in turn defines the spacer diversity, emergence rate, morphology and overall resistance of the colony. Founder cells harboring a weak spacer, which immunity can be overcome by a relatively high number of target mutant phages in the viral population, engage in a dynamic co-evolution with the virus. These cells suffer the predation of escaper phages and struggle to emerge; members of the colony in formation that carry additional spacers are positively selected and their growth leads to the formation of micro-colonies (either within or surrounding the original colony) composed of cellular conglomerates with the increased spacer diversity necessary to limit the propagation of escaper phages. On the other hand, the phage is largely contained by founder cells harboring strong spacers, and little viral-host co-evolution occurs. Escapers do not rise, cell growth is not limited, and smooth, mono-spacer colonies are formed. Interestingly, the initial and final levels of resistance of the colonies are reverted. The virus-host co-evolution mediated by the CRISPR-Cas immune response enables the conversion of a genotype that initially confers a high level of susceptibility to the host (a weak founder spacer) into a new genotype that not only promotes survival from co-evolving phages, but also creates a completely resistant host.</p><p>How are multiple spacers acquired within the same cell? In one scenario, as the mutant phages that escape the immunity provided by the founder spacer rise in the colony, the infection of the now susceptible founder cells results in a second event of spacer acquisition. In this case, the accumulation of multiple spacers in the same CRISPR array will require several consecutive episodes of escape and reinfection. Since the fraction of cells that acquire additional spacers is very low, about one cell per 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> in our <italic>S. aureus</italic> experimental system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heler et al., 2017</xref>), the low number of cells in a developing colony would make it mathematically impossible for naive CRISPR adaptation to occur three or four consecutive times. A second, more plausible, scenario involves the ‘primed’ acquisition of multiple spacers during a single infection event. After the initial insertion of the founder spacer, cells contain Cas9 molecules programmed to cleave the viral genome. This cleavage generates double-strand DNA breaks that not only protects the host, but also generates the free DNA ends from which new spacers are acquired. The result is the acquisition of additional spacers from the vicinity of the target site specified by the founder spacer and allow the host to anticipate the rise of escapers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nussenzweig et al., 2019</xref>). The high proportion of second spacers that are located within 1 kb of the founder spacer target site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) suggest that this is the preferred mechanism, although more detailed work will have to be carried out in the future to decisively understand how multiple spacers are acquired within one colony. In contrast to the infrequent and sequential ‘naive’ spacer acquisition from escaper phages, ‘primed’ spacer acquisition can lead to the addition of several spacers within a single infection event. We think that this can occur in a small fraction of the cells, early during colony formation. These multi-spacer cells are amplified or not throughout the development of the colony, depending on the abundance of escaper phage that evade the founder spacer.</p><p>Interestingly, the most detailed analysis performed in this study, that is the detection of expanded CRISPR arrays via next generation sequencing, showed that the fraction of multi-spacer loci within each colony is highly variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). There are two non-mutually exclusive factors that could affect this value: the escape frequency and/or the priming efficiency of the founder spacer. We believe that the phage escape frequency of the founder spacer impacts more profoundly the fraction of multi-spacer cells in colonies that, when analyzed with less powerful methods such as colony PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>), display a multi-spacer and sectored phenotype. This is because high efficiency of priming would lead to the immediate acquisition of multiple spacers by a high proportion of the infected cells early during the development of the colony. This should result in the formation of smooth multi-spacer colonies, as it would achieve an early neutralization of the founder spacer escapers and allow the unchallenged emergence of the colony. Therefore, we believe that the wide distribution of the fraction of multi-spacer cells within sectored colonies reflects the different escape frequencies for each founder spacer. While we defined founder spacers as weak or strong, in truth the escape frequencies have many different values depending on the region of the phage genome targeted by each spacer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chabas et al., 2019</xref>). At one end of the spectrum, there will be the spacers that target viral protospacers for which any modification of the seed or PAM sequence would lead to complete loss of phage viability. At the other end will be the spacers that match a protospacer that when their seed or PAM sequences are changed, the mutation enhances viral propagation. Many escaper mutations, however, will fall in between these two scenarios, and will include mutations that only decrease or are neutral for the fitness of the phage. This will produce a wide range of escaper mutation frequencies in the viral population that will lead to different levels of selection and accumulation of multi-spacer cells within sectored colonies. We looked for a correlation between the mono-spacer founders and gene function. However, we could not find an enrichment of essential genes targeted by these spacers, probably because even within essential genes there are non-critical amino acids that can be mutated without any fitness effect on the phage. Future work using deep sequencing to detect both all possible phage escape mutations and acquired spacers could shed light on this issue.</p><p>On the other hand, the priming efficiency of the founder spacer should be determinant for the different proportions of multi-spacer cells in colonies that appear as mono-spacer and smooth. While founder spacers of smooth colonies also display different escape frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), these are not high enough to affect the growth of the cells within the colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Once cells reach stationary phase, they can no longer be infected by the escaper phage (bacteria in this growth stage are commonly refractory to phage infection) and therefore they cannot propagate to promote the expansion the small fraction of multi-spacer cells present in smooth colonies. Instead, low levels of escaper phage remain in these colonies, even after 48 hr of the initial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We determined an empirical value of 2% as the maximum fraction of multi-spacer array that can produce a mono-spacer and smooth phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Since the multi-spacer members of these colonies are not important to limit the propagation of the escaper phages and are not subject to strong positive selection during colony formation, their fraction is most likely a result of the different priming efficiencies of their founder spacers.</p><p>We performed our studies with two different experimental type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems: <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells harboring the <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> locus and <italic>S. thermophilus</italic>, containing its own locus. While results were similar, that is multi-spacer colonies contained additional sectors or satellites as well as high titers of phage able to escape the immunity provided by the founder spacer, there were also interesting differences. First, infection of liquid cultures produced apparently opposite results. For the heterologous system, this experiment led to a multi-spacer population composed of mono-spacer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heler et al., 2019</xref>). This is because the initial spacer diversity neutralizes most escape variants present in the viral population and allows the fast growth of the culture. When it reaches stationary phase, it becomes immune to further infection and viral-host co-evolution stops. In contrast, previous experiments with <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> DGCC7710, in which the infected liquid cultures are artificially diluted before cells can reach stationary phase, resulted in the accumulation of multi-spacer CRISPR loci in the population. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Common et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paez-Espino et al., 2015</xref>). It has been shown that under a dilution regiment, <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> and its phage ϕ2972 both increase their resistance and infectivity, respectively, a result that demonstrates the existence of a co-evolutionary arms race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Common et al., 2019</xref>). After 9 days of the initial infection phages lose their infectivity and the surviving cells contain multiple spacers. However, we believe that these divergent results are the consequence of the lack of dilution in our experiments with the <italic>S. aureus</italic> heterologous system. This is because dilution (i) prevents the culture from accumulating phage-resistant stationary phase cells, and (ii) reduces the spacer diversity of the culture and leads to the selection of multi-spacer that can contain the escapers.</p><p>A second disparity is the phenotype and proportion of the multi-spacer colonies:~50% of <italic>S. aureus</italic> colonies display different sectors and ~10% of <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> colonies are surrounded by small satellites. We speculate that this could be the result of differences in growth between these organisms, as well as differences in the ability of the ϕNM4γ4 and ϕ2972 phages to disseminate within forming colonies. Streptococcal cells may form tight communities that cannot be penetrated by ϕ2972, restricting phage predation to the outskirts of the colony. If so, the bulk of the viral-host co-evolution will occur in this space, and selection of multi-spacer survivors will lead to the formation of satellite colonies. On the other hand, <italic>S. aureus</italic> growth may happen in a way that does not shield the internal cells from ϕNM4γ4 predation, leading to selection of multi-spacer members of the community within the whole colony. This model is supported by the opposite outcomes of the initial amplification of the CRISPR locus. In order to preserve the colonies for further analysis (to determine the spacer content at different times or from different parts of the colony, or to isolate phages), we scooped a small fraction of the center of the colony to extract DNA. Although we were able to detect multiple spacers in the <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells obtained in this way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we did not in the case of <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> cells, even in those derived from colonies with satellites, which prove to contain multiple spacers upon more detailed analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we found that the acquisition of multiple spacers within a single CRISPR array compensates for the inefficient defense provided by an initial weak spacer, in conditions of structured growth where this compensation cannot be offered by a strong neighbor cell. Therefore, the type II CRISPR-Cas immune response is able to provide robust immunity through the generation of either a diverse population composed of weak and strong cells or a diverse cell harboring weak and strong spacers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>Cultivation of <italic>S. aureus</italic> RN4220 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kreiswirth et al., 1983</xref>) or OS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schneewind et al., 1992</xref>) was carried out in tryptic soy broth (TSB) at 37°C. <italic>S. aureus</italic> media was supplemented with chloramphenicol at 10 μg/ml to maintain pCRISPR plasmids. <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> DGCC7710 was grown in LM17 media at 42°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Spacer acquisition in liquid cultures</title><p>Overnight cultures of <italic>S. aureus</italic> RN4220 containing pCRISPR or pCRISPR(Δ<italic>cas2</italic>) (pWJ40 or pRH61, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heler et al., 2015</xref>) were diluted 1:100 in 20 mL of BHI and grown for 4 hr shaking at 37°C.

profound results for the development of effective immunity. The structured environment of the solid media enables repeated encounters between phage and host, which increases the acquisition of multiple spacers in the Type II CRISPR-Cas system, particularly in cases where the initial spacer was suboptimal.

Your article has now been reviewed by Aleksandra Walczak as the senior editor, myself acting as the Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. Joe Bondy-Denomy (Reviewer #1) has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers were enthusiastic about your work describing the acquisition of bacterial immunity against phage in structured environments. The question addressed by the study was deemed novel and the major finding – that the first spacer acquired dictates the course of subsequent immune adaptation – was regarded novel and interesting. However, all three reviewers agreed that the manuscript was difficult to read, and the data were at times presented in a confusing manner. Adding schematics to represent the relationship between colonies or the order of experimentation would be one way of improving the readability of the article. To make the article accessible to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, we therefore request that the article be edited in accordance with the comments below before it can be accepted for publication.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>CRISPR-mediated adaptive immunity relies on the acquisition of spacers from the genome of invading phages that enables CRISPR (cr)RNA-guided targeting and degradation of the phage nucleic acid upon subsequent infection. The authors describe spacer acquisition of a Type II CRISPR-Cas system when the host is challenged by phage in solid media. The structured environment of the solid media enables repeated encounters between phage and host, which increases the acquisition of multiple spacers in cases where the initial spacer was suboptimal. The latter mode of immunity leads to the emergence of greater spacer diversity in the population, increasing the likelihood of surviving subsequent challenge with escaper phage.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please clarify the mentions of priming (subsection “CRISPR expansion involves priming by the first acquired spacer”, subsection “The ability of phage to escape targeting by the founding spacer determines colony heterogeneity” and the Discussion section). The conclusion of priming seems exaggerated given that the majority of spacers are spread throughout the genome and likely are not primed. For subsection “The ability of phage to escape targeting by the founding spacer determines colony heterogeneity”: The caveat provided is unclear. As the authors mention in the Discussion section, is it not expected that most spacers acquired following phage escape are through priming during colony formation? If this is the case, why is it necessary to choose an escaper phage that can no longer be targeted by Cas9? In addition, although there are two mutations present in the escaper phage (one each in the PAM and seed), the PAM mutation is 5'-NAG-3'. G to A substitutions in the PAM are known to be tolerated by S. pyogenes Cas9 (e.g. see PMID: 27041224). While the efficiency of Cas9 binding to the escaper target is likely significantly decreased, it remains possible that this crRNA can still direct Cas9 to bind the phage DNA. At this point, priming in type II-A systems is not characterized well enough to know for certain whether or not this escaper could be targeted for escaper-mediated priming.</p><p>2) Please correct the labeling of Figure 6. There appears to be a is miscommunication between the labelling of Figure 6 and the description in subsection “Host-phage co-evolution within multi-spacer colonies leads to increased resistance”; i.e. it says that F is initially resistant to phage but then has small decrease in immunity-score 1 to 0.83-referencing Figure 6A, but the figure showing those data is 6B, which is labelled as the C founder strain; similarly, also in this subsection is not describing Figure 6E.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53078.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please clarify the mentions of priming (subsection “CRISPR expansion involves priming by the first acquired spacer”, subsection “The ability of phage to escape targeting by the founding spacer determines colony heterogeneity” and the Discussion section).

Patterns of priming in type II systems had been obtained in two independent studies, one from our group examining the exact same experimental system used in the present study (PMID: 31585845) and one from the Fineran’s group analyzing several different type II systems (PMID: 30157725). In both studies priming is quantified using double-acquisition events, plotting a histogram of the distance between the first and second acquired spacer (not “throughout the genome”). While it is true that distances have a wide distribution, in all studies there are many more second spacers located within a short distance (~ 1kb) of the first spacer, than second spacers at longer distances. In both studies this have been accepted as a measure of priming in type II systems, and it is the same result we show in Figure 2C. Therefore, we believe that our conclusion, that the “result suggests that primed, or cleavage-mediated, spacer acquisition plays an important role to create multi-spacer cells and colonies”, is valid.</p><p>Having clarified this, we agree that not all sections where we referred to priming conveyed the same message. Therefore, we have modified the text as required.</p><p>Introduction (we deleted the reference to priming):</p><p>“In these colonies the new spacers are selected by the escaper phage, which lyses bacteria containing only the founder spacer and thus promotes the formation of sectored colonies.”</p><p>Subsection title:</p><p>“Priming by the first acquired spacer is likely involved in CRISPR expansion”</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“The high proportion of second spacers that are located within 1 kb of the founder spacer target site (Figure 2C) suggest that this is the preferred mechanism, although more detailed work will have to be carried out in the future to decisively understand how multiple spacers are acquired within one colony.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For subsection “The ability of phage to escape targeting by the founding spacer determines colony heterogeneity”: The caveat provided is unclear.

We also agree that the caveat is not clear. We have eliminated this passage to avoid confusion:</p><p>“We isolated a phage that can overcome targeting by spacer F0 (Figure S2), a mono-spacer colony founder, and repeated the experiment of Figure 1F infecting with a mixture of wild-type and escaper phage. We previously measured that the frequency of escape of spacer F0 is ~ 10<sup>-8</sup> (Figure 3A); we added escaper phage to raise this rate to 10<sup>-5</sup>. As opposed to the previous results, the increase in the proportion of escaper phage generated multi-spacer colonies from this otherwise mono-spacer colony founder (Figure 3C) and contained phage that escaped the immunity provided by the F0 spacer (Figure S3B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please correct the labeling of Figure 6.
