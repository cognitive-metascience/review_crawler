and spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic inputs is unclear. Here, we develop a biologically realistic computational model of striatal spiny projection neurons with sophisticated calcium dynamics, based on data from rodents of both sexes, to investigate how spatiotemporally clustered and distributed excitatory and inhibitory inputs affect spine calcium. We demonstrate that coordinated excitatory synaptic inputs evoke enhanced calcium elevation specific to stimulated spines, with lower but physiologically relevant calcium elevation in nearby non-stimulated spines. Results further show a novel and important function of inhibition—to enhance the difference in calcium between stimulated and non-stimulated spines. These findings suggest that spine calcium dynamics encode synaptic input patterns and may serve as a signal for both stimulus-specific potentiation and heterosynaptic depression, maintaining balanced activity in a dendritic branch while inducing pattern-specific plasticity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38588.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>How do we form new memories? The human brain contains almost 90 billion neurons, which communicate with one another at junctions called synapses. Each neuron has a shape a little like that of a tree, and is covered in branches called dendrites. Synapses typically form between the end of one neuron and a dendrite on another. Most scientists believe that the brain forms new memories by changing the strength of these synapses. But a number of questions remain about how this process works.</p><p>There are two types of synapses: excitatory and inhibitory. When an excitatory synapse becomes active, calcium ions flow into the dendrite of the receiving neuron. The calcium ions then trigger processes inside the cell that are essential for changing the strength of the synapse, and thus forming a memory. But what happens when an inhibitory synapse becomes active? How does this affect memory?</p><p>Additionally, each neuron forms synapses with thousands of others, with several synapses on a single dendrite. To form a memory about a specific experience, the brain must strengthen only the synapses that relate to that experience. How does the brain manage to target these synapses specifically? Do the synapses need to be clustered on the same dendritic branch, or can they be spread apart? And do all the synapses need to be active at exactly the same time?</p><p>Dorman et al. investigated these questions by developing a computer model of a neuron. Testing the model revealed that the synapses related to an experience do not all need to be active at exactly the same time to form a memory. Moreover, the synapses can be spread across multiple dendrites. Finally, the model showed that inhibitory synapses are critical for preventing calcium ions from spreading within dendritic branches and entering inactive synapses. This ensures that only the synapses active during a specific experience become stronger.</p><p>Many brain disorders, including substance abuse and addiction, involve errors in the processes that underlie learning and memory. By increasing our understanding of how the structure of brain cells supports these processes, the current findings could one day lead to better treatments for these and other disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>dendritic integration</kwd><kwd>spine calcium</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>computational model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA033390</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blackwell</surname><given-names>Kim T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AA16022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blackwell</surname><given-names>Kim T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibition enhances the spatial specificity of high calcium influx for cooperatively stimulated synapses, suggesting that inhibitory inputs may regulate both synapse-specific and heterosynaptic plasticity to support learning and memory.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons receive information from other neural cells in the form of patterns of activation of different synaptic inputs. Such input patterns differ in their locations on the dendritic tree (spatial properties) and their timing (temporal properties) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">London and Häusser, 2005</xref>). As a given neuron may receive synaptic inputs from hundreds to thousands of other neurons, a critical question in neuroscience is <italic>how</italic> multiple synaptic inputs are integrated to produce neuronal output. Further, certain patterns of input can induce synaptic plasticity—neural activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy that underlie learning and memory. Yet, it remains unclear how spatiotemporal properties of synaptic input patterns may affect synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Destexhe and Marder, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van Bommel and Mikhaylova, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Dendrites are capable of complex, non-linear forms of synaptic integration, which are sensitive to the spatiotemporal properties of synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stuart and Spruston, 2015</xref>). For instance, in vitro studies have shown that near-simultaneous stimulation of a group of spatially clustered excitatory synapses on a thin dendritic branch can elicit supralinear, prolonged membrane depolarizations in the soma (known as plateau potentials). These plateau potentials have been observed in pyramidal neurons of the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schiller et al., 2000</xref>) and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golding et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harnett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Makara and Magee, 2013</xref>), and also in spiny projection neurons of the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Du et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mahfooz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oikonomou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Plotkin et al., 2011</xref>). These non-linear responses to spatiotemporally clustered synaptic input can induce synaptic plasticity. Specifically, long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic inputs can be induced by stimulation of clustered synapses, independently of postsynaptic action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brandalise et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golding et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gordon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Losonczy et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Calcium influx into neuronal dendrites and spines is a critical mechanism linking synaptic input patterns to synaptic plasticity, as calcium is required for most forms of neuronal plasticity throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Greer and Greenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Higley and Sabatini, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zucker, 1999</xref>). The conjunction of synaptic inputs and postsynaptic depolarization produces calcium influx through the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor (NMDAR) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartol et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schiller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sjöström and Nelson, 2002</xref>). Activation of calcium-permeable ligand-gated or voltage-gated ion channels also yields calcium influx. The resulting elevation in intracellular calcium acts as a second messenger to initiate multiple signaling cascades that produce various forms of synaptic plasticity. Calcium, therefore, connects the electrical activity at the network or neuronal level to the subcellular level of biochemical signaling and plasticity. The relationship between calcium and plasticity is complex, as calcium elevation is required for both LTP and long-term depression (LTD). Both experiments and theory propose that plasticity outcomes depend on the specific dynamics of intracellular calcium, including amplitude, duration, and location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Evans and Blackwell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graupner and Brunel, 2012</xref>). Thus, determining how calcium dynamics in dendrites and spines depend on spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic input will advance our understanding of how those same patterns induce plasticity and ultimately influence learning and memory.</p><p>Spatiotemporally clustered synaptic inputs that produce supralinear plateau potentials (also called NMDA spikes) also cause elevated dendritic calcium concentration localized to the stimulated dendritic branch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Major et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schiller et al., 2000</xref>). In vivo, NMDAR-dependent calcium transients that are limited to specific dendritic branches and spines of pyramidal neurons correspond with spine-specific structural plasticity and behavioral learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cichon and Gan, 2015</xref>). In vitro, repeated synaptic stimulation of neighboring spines can result in supralinear spine calcium transients and LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Weber et al., 2016</xref>), even in the absence of somatic plateau potentials. Thus, spatiotemporally clustered patterns of synaptic inputs are critical for information processing and plasticity, but it is unclear how distributed input patterns, which likely occur frequently in vivo, produce non-linear synaptic responses and affect synaptic plasticity.</p><p>Although much of the literature has focused on synaptic integration in pyramidal neurons, NMDAR-dependent plateau potentials also have been observed in the spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the striatum, which is the input nucleus of the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Du et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mahfooz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oikonomou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Plotkin et al., 2011</xref>). The striatum integrates glutamatergic input from cortex and thalamus and dopaminergic input from substantia nigra to learn goal-directed actions, motor skills, and habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2008</xref>). Calcium elevation and dopamine are required for synaptic plasticity in SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yagishita et al., 2014</xref>). It has been suggested that calcium elevation (through downstream signaling events) may generate a ‘synaptic eligibility trace’ that, when followed by dopamine stimulation, produces LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shindou et al., 2018</xref>); thus calcium dynamics are critical even in brain regions that require dopamine for synaptic plasticity. Similar to pyramidal neurons, near-synchronous synaptic input to a cluster of 10 – 20 neighboring spines evokes NMDAR-dependent plateau potentials in SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Du et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Plotkin et al., 2011</xref>), but only when the cluster of spines is located distally, and not proximally. Although not yet demonstrated, this supralinearity may produce synaptic plasticity at these distal SPN synapses.</p><p>SPNs and pyramidal neurons exhibit key differences which motivate the further study of SPNs. In contrast to pyramidal cells, SPNs lack the morphologically distinct apical, oblique, and basal dendritic branches characteristic of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gertler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Spruston, 2008</xref>). Whereas pyramidal neurons exhibit sodium- and calcium-spikes in addition to NMDA spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stuart and Spruston, 2015</xref>), SPNs lack sodium channels in distal dendrites and dendritic calcium-spikes have not been measured in these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Day et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Plotkin et al., 2011</xref>). SPNs rest at more hyperpolarized membrane potentials than pyramidal neurons, in part because of differences in hyperpolarization-activated ion channels—SPNs strongly express inward rectifying potassium channels (KIR) and lack the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels seen in pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nisenbaum and Wilson, 1995</xref>). SPNs also transition between hyperpolarized down-states and depolarized up-states in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilson and Kawaguchi, 1996</xref>), and dendritic non-linearities may play an important role in driving these state transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Du et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Plotkin et al., 2011</xref>). Lastly, cortical axons make only 1 – 3 synapses with a single SPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kincaid et al., 1998</xref>), and the large number of synaptic inputs required to produce an upstate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blackwell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stern et al., 1998</xref>) suggests that in SPNs spatiotemporally dispersed synaptic inputs occur frequently.</p><p>The striatal microcircuit also differs significantly from that of the cortex or hippocampus. The local circuit of the striatum is almost entirely inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burke et al., 2017</xref>), including the SPN collaterals. Other sources of inhibition include fast spiking interneurons (FSIs), low-threshold spiking interneurons (LTSIs), and neurogliaform (NGF) interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ibáñez-Sandoval et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kawaguchi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Koos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Straub et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tepper and Bolam, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koós and Tepper, 1999</xref>). Synaptic inputs onto SPNs from these sources exhibit distinct spatial and temporal properties. FSIs fire at high rates and are limited to the soma and proximal dendrites of SPNs. In contrast, SPN collaterals, LTSIs, and NGFs target distal dendrites of SPNs, and NGF synapses further display distinctly slow GABA<sub>A</sub> kinetics. These distinct sources of inhibition have been shown to regulate plateau potentials in somatic recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Du et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, although inhibition is clearly important for striatal function, its role in regulating local calcium transients in dendritic spines is unknown.</p><p>When clustered synaptic input produces a plateau potential, it is unclear how synapse-specificity is maintained. Calcium imaging experiments indicate that the entire dendritic branch at the site of clustered synaptic input experiences robust calcium elevation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Plotkin et al., 2011</xref>), and the plateau potential likely propagates from the dendritic branch into neighboring non-stimulated dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koch and Zador, 1993</xref>), which could minimize synapse-specificity. However, neither experiments nor models have investigated the degree of synapse-specificity in the calcium response during supralinear plateau potentials, in any neuron type.</p><p>Given the importance of synaptic activity patterns for information processing and plasticity, understanding the role of both spatiotemporally clustered and distributed synaptic input patterns on calcium dynamics is critical. However, because of experimental technical constraints, computational modeling is required to investigate the response to spatiotemporally dispersed inputs. We address these critical issues regarding the effect of spatiotemporal input patterns on calcium dynamics in stimulated spines, non-stimulated spines, and dendritic branches in a detailed computational SPN model. We show that both dispersed and clustered synaptic inputs can evoke supralinear calcium influx into stimulated spines with spatial specificity. Lastly, our most novel finding is that inhibition enhances spatial- and synapse-specificity of spine calcium transients during plateau potentials.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Multiscale model reproduces electrophysiology and calcium-imaging experiments</title><p>We developed a detailed biophysical SPN model to investigate the effect of spatially and temporally clustered and distributed synaptic inputs on spine calcium dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To further assess model robustness, we evaluated the fates of calcium entering a dendritic spine during a single EPSP for 100 ms following synaptic stimulation. Calcium fates, which were calculated as the quantity (moles) of free calcium, buffered calcium, pumped calcium, and diffused calcium per timestep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), exhibited similar dynamics to a published computational model with three-dimensional reaction-diffusion in reconstructed dendritic spines from pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartol et al., 2015</xref>).

At distal locations, a sharp threshold emerges where the stimulation of a single additional spine produces a supralinear spine calcium elevation.

The threshold is distance-dependent, with fewer stimulated spines required to produce a supralinear calcium response closer to the terminal end of the dendritic branch. These results suggest that the distal dendritic spines of SPNs may be important sites for synaptic cooperativity—the ability of synapses to evoke supralinear responses when stimulated together. Furthermore, the supralinear spine calcium elevation evoked by clustered synaptic inputs may be an important mechanism for synaptic plasticity.</p><p>A critical question is whether spatial clustering of cortical inputs is required, or if spatially dispersed inputs can still cooperate to produce plateau potentials and supralinear spine calcium elevation. To address this question, excitatory inputs were randomly distributed over the proximal (27 – 119 μm from soma) or distal (135 – 225 μm from soma) regions of a dendritic branch, or over the entire branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Synaptic inputs that are spatially dispersed over the distal half of the branch still produce a supralinear response, although it is slightly smaller than the response to spatially clustered inputs. Too much spatial dispersion is not tolerated, as distributing 20 inputs over the entire branch no longer elicits supralinear spine calcium elevation. These results suggest that simultaneously stimulated synapses on distal dendritic spines still produce robust calcium influx when distributed within a 90 μm segment, indicating that close spatial clustering may not be a strong requirement for synaptic plasticity.

Similarly, when synaptic inputs were spatially dispersed, peak calcium elevation in stimulated spines was again an order of magnitude higher than in non-stimulated, interspersed spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

This suggests that heterosynaptic effects that may occur during a plateau potential would be limited to neighboring non-stimulated spines located on the distal dendritic branch. This distal-to-proximal gradient in calcium elevation is also observed in the dendritic shaft. Therefore, other calcium-dependent types of plasticity, such as homeostatic scaling or branch strength plasticity, also may occur in the distal dendritic shaft during plateau potentials.

To investigate which of these mechanisms distinguishes stimulated spines, we analyzed membrane potential, spine calcium concentration, and calcium channel currents in a stimulated spine and a neighboring non-stimulated spine during clustered distal synaptic stimulation.

Consequently, calcium transients exhibit a robust synapse-specific signal in stimulated spines despite highly similar membrane potentials in neighboring spines during plateau potentials. Further, as membrane potential is sharply attenuated as depolarization propagates towards the soma, the VGCC-mediated elevation is limited to distal non-stimulated spines whereas proximal non-stimulated spines exhibit negligible calcium elevation. The distinct calcium transients and sources observed may therefore support stimulus-specific synaptic plasticity in stimulated spines and heterosynaptic plasticity in neighboring, non-stimulated spines.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Synaptic cooperativity is strongest for synaptic inputs located on the same dendritic branch</title><p>Synaptic inputs are likely to be spatially and temporally dispersed on multiple dendritic branches in vivo.

Further, would synaptic inputs on multiple branches act independently—such that the number of synaptic inputs per branch required to evoke supralinear calcium transients is independent of synaptic inputs to other branches—or would they interact (cooperate) to lower the threshold number of synaptic inputs per branch required for supralinear calcium transients? To address these questions, we investigated the effect of spatial dispersion of synaptic inputs to multiple dendritic branches. Synaptic inputs were randomly distributed on two tertiary branches with a common secondary branch parent; on four tertiary branches with a common primary branch parent; or on eight tertiary dendritic branches. Additionally, we used both simultaneous synaptic inputs and temporal dispersion, created from random, exponentially distributed intervals. Simulations used average interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 2.5, 5, or 10 ms between synaptic inputs on each branch (e.g. with a 10 ms mean ISI per branch, when two branches are stimulated, the overall mean ISI is 5 ms for all inputs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Stimulating multiple branches with the same number of spines/branch does not strongly affect spine calcium elevation (e.g. green arrowhead, eight spines per branch on two to eight branches with 0.0 ISI), indicating branch independence. However, near threshold (e.g. purple arrowhead, 16 spines/branch on two versus four branches for 0.0 ms ISI), stimulating multiple branches enhances spine calcium elevation, indicating small branch interactions whereby inputs to other branches can reduce the threshold of required inputs on a branch for supralinear spine calcium elevation. Spine calcium elevation decreases with increasing ISI (i.e. decreased peak calcium in panels from left to right), indicating that cooperation among synaptic inputs is limited to a temporal window of 10 s of ms. Note that for temporally distributed simulations, the ISIs are exponentially distributed with the average value indicated. The average ISI per branch means (for example) that an average ISI of 10 ms per branch corresponds to a total average ISI of 5 ms for all inputs when two branches are stimulated, and 2.5 ms for all inputs when four total branches are stimulated.

To investigate the mechanism underlying this temporal dependence, we evaluated the voltage in the dendritic shaft at the base of the proximal spine. The enhancement of peak calcium in the proximal spine correlated with the amplitude of the depolarization propagating from the distally evoked plateau potential. Together, these results indicate that distally evoked plateau potentials can interact with proximal synaptic inputs within a 25 ms temporal window, and that the interaction shows asymmetrical dependence on timing.

A train of 20 GABAergic inputs (ISI = 3 ms) was applied to the proximal, primary dendritic branch while 16 or 32 glutamatergic inputs per branch were dispersed over the entire branch on one or two neighboring tertiary branches with an ISI of 2.5 ms per branch. The onset of the FSI input train and the glutamatergic stimulation was simultaneous. Interestingly, we found that a train of proximal GABAergic stimulation enhanced spine calcium responses when glutamatergic inputs were sub- or near-threshold (16 spines/branch on one or two branches), but not when above threshold (32 spines/branch on two branches) for supralinear spine calcium elevation. We assessed whether the effect of FSI input trains on spine calcium elevation depended on distance of stimulated spines from the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), and we found that distal spines, but not proximal spines, exhibit elevated calcium in response to proximal FSI inputs relative to the control (no FSI) condition. Our finding that proximal GABAergic stimulation may enhance spine calcium elevation is consistent with experiments demonstrating that when SPNs are in the hyperpolarized downstate, GABAergic stimulation produces depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blackwell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bracci and Panzeri, 2006</xref>). This depolarization may propagate to distal dendritic spines to enhance supralinear spine calcium elevation in stimulated spines when SPNs are in a hyperpolarized downstate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Inhibition enhances stimulus-specificity of spine calcium transients</title><p>Notably, although we observed above that inhibition close to excitatory inputs can reduce the magnitude of spine calcium elevation in stimulated spines (likely by lowering dendritic propagation of potentials), inhibition neither abolished the plateau potential nor fully blocked supralinear spine calcium elevation. This raised the intriguing possibility that the reduced local membrane resistance caused by inhibition may also influence non-stimulated spines. Thus, we evaluated the effect of inhibition by measuring the peak calcium response in non-stimulated spines relative to the peak calcium response in stimulated spines in the presence or absence of a co-located and simultaneously stimulated GABAergic synapse during simultaneous excitatory stimulation of a distal cluster of dendritic spines.</p><p>The most significant functional effect of distal GABAergic synaptic input is to enhance spatial specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). When compared to the control (no-GABAergic input) condition, stimulation of a single GABAergic synapse on the distal dendrite reduces the ratio of peak calcium elevation in non-stimulated spines relative to the peak in stimulated spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Further, GABAergic stimulation narrows the spatial extent of calcium influx in non-stimulated spines and in the dendritic shaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), reducing the ratio of non-stimulated spine peak calcium to stimulated spine peak calcium much more for distant than adjacent spines and thereby limiting the spatial extent of heterosynaptic calcium elevation. As calcium elevation can lead to both LTP and LTD, with lower levels of calcium elevation associated with LTD and higher levels associated with LTP, inhibition may critically regulate heterosynaptic plasticity by reducing calcium elevation in non-stimulated spines from a level that could lead to LTP to a level that could lead to LTD, thereby preserving synapse-specific potentiation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38588.012</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Inhibition enhances spatial specificity of spine calcium elevation.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Stimulation of a single GABAergic synapse on the distal dendrite reduces the ratio of peak calcium in nonstimulated spines (<bold>A</bold>) and dendritic shaft (<bold>B</bold>) relative to the peak in synaptically stimulated spines for fast or slow GABA<sub>A</sub> kinetics. For both fast and slow GABA<sub>A</sub> kinetics, the GABAergic synapse is on the dendritic shaft, co-located with and synchronously stimulated with glutamatergic stimulation of a cluster of 16 distal dendritic spines (location of synaptic input indicated by blue arrowhead). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the sensitivity of the effect of inhibition on spatial specificity to parameter variations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the robustness of this main finding to model assumptions.

To assess the robustness of the effect of inhibition on synapse-specificity, we systematically varied conductances of voltage-gated and synaptic channels, calcium buffer quantities and pump densities, and spine neck axial resistance by ±10% and 20%. For each condition, we computed the specificity ratio as the ratio of peak calcium of non-stimulated spines to peak calcium of stimulated spines, such that a smaller value indicates higher specificity. We then divided the specificity ratio observed with inhibition by the specificity ratio observed without inhibition (called GABA/No GABA specificity ratio), such that a value &lt;1 indicates that inhibition enhances specificity, while a value &gt;1 indicates that inhibition reduces specificity. Inhibition consistently enhanced spatial specificity across all parameter variations, except for a 20% decrease in NMDAR conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The magnitude of the effect of inhibition was most sensitive to NMDAR, CaR, and GABAR conductances. As expected, a larger GABAR conductance enhanced the GABA/No GABA specificity ratio. Larger inward currents reduced specificity, and the large effect with NMDAR and CaR conductances confirms our previous results showing that these are critical parameters for the supralinear spine calcium response. Surprisingly, decreases in NMDAR or CaR conductances also reduced the GABA/No GABA specificity ratio. When either CaR or NMDAR conductance is lowered, stimulation is below threshold, and the reduced activation of VGCCs greatly enhances spatial specificity in the absence of inhibition. The sensitivity to CaR and NMDAR conductances suggests that neurons may regulate the balance of these channels; thus, we repeated simulations with an increase of CaR and a decrease of NMDAR (and vice versa, no attempt was made to balance these changes). As predicted, sensitivity to the paired parameter change was smaller than sensitivity to a single parameter change. In summary, this parameter sensitivity analysis suggests that the balance of NMDAR and CaR channels may fine-tune spatial specificity of spine calcium transients.</p><p>In addition to robustness to parameter variations, it is important that our main result does not depend on underlying assumptions in the modeling method. Specifically, our model of calcium dynamics assumes that deterministic, one-dimensional diffusion and reaction equations are sufficient to capture the dynamics of calcium elevation in dendritic spines. We evaluated whether the following variations affected the central finding that inhibition enhances synapse-specificity: (1) spatial and temporal discretization step size; (2) variations in calcium diffusion rates; (3) facilitated calcium diffusion between spine neck and dendritic shaft; and (4) variations in calcium influx and efflux caused by channels and pumps. Importantly, these findings did not qualitatively change the main result that inhibition enhances spatial specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>A critical functional question is whether inhibition regulates synaptic specificity for spatiotemporally distributed inputs, which are likely to occur in vivo. To answer this question, we applied both excitatory (n = 200 or 300) and inhibitory (n = 50) synaptic inputs with random spatial dispersion, with each individual synaptic input consisting of an independent Poisson process with an average frequency of 2.5 Hz. We assessed spine calcium with histograms of integrated calcium for the 1 s simulation duration, as well as scatter plots of peak values versus normalized duration (i.e. integrated calcium concentration/peak calcium concentration) for each spine. At the lower (n = 200) activity level, synaptic specificity was robust with or without inhibition, with little overlap in integrated calcium and no overlap for peak versus duration scatter points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). However, with higher (n = 300) activity and no inhibition, synaptic specificity was reduced, as overlap in both the histogram and scatter points occurred for stimulated and non-stimulated spines. Notably, when inhibition was included during higher activity, synaptic specificity was increased, indicating that inhibition may function in vivo to maintain spatial specificity of spine calcium transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>To quantify the extent to which inhibition increased separation between stimulated and non-stimulated spine calcium responses, we performed a cluster analysis using duration and peak calcium as parameters. For the cluster analysis, we performed K-means clustering on the unlabeled data, and then computed the confusion matrix—the number of correctly and incorrectly clustered data points in the unlabeled cluster analysis compared to the real, labeled dataset, where the label is whether the spine received synaptic input. We evaluated the number of incorrectly clustered spines in the confusion matrix and computed the distance between clusters as a metric for the effect of inhibition on synaptic specificity. For the higher activity level without inhibition, the cluster analysis incorrectly identified the stimulation status of 58 spines, whereas with inhibition, the stimulation status of only 19 spines was incorrectly identified (out of 3280 total spines). For the lower activity level, no spines were incorrectly identified, but inhibition increased the distance between cluster centroids by 5.3%. Altogether, these results suggest that although inhibition reduces calcium elevation in stimulated spines, its most significant effect is to enhance stimulus-specific calcium signaling and it may therefore regulate heterosynaptic plasticity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We demonstrated that spatial and temporal patterns of synaptic input to SPNs produce spatially specific and stimulus-specific spine calcium responses in a biologically detailed computational model with sophisticated calcium dynamics. A sufficient number of excitatory inputs to a distal dendritic branch can cooperate to evoke supralinear spine calcium responses in the synaptically stimulated spines, whether the stimulated spines are clustered or dispersed along the distal portion of the branch. The resulting spine calcium responses exhibit specificity for synaptically stimulated spines, with an order of magnitude higher calcium influx than non-stimulated neighboring spines, and this spatial specificity is further enhanced by nearby GABAergic synaptic stimulation. Synaptic cooperativity exhibits dendritic-branch specificity, as synaptic inputs to one branch produce higher spine calcium responses than the same number of inputs distributed to multiple branches. Additionally, the calcium elevation in a proximal spine can be facilitated when the synaptic input to that spine occurs synchronous with or shortly following distally evoked plateau potentials, indicating potential interactions between distal and proximal synaptic input. Together, our results suggest that spine calcium elevation is a stimulus-specific signal which can differentiate between synaptically stimulated and non-stimulated spines. We predict that these distinct calcium responses will enable both input-specific LTP and heterosynaptic LTD, and that inhibition critically regulates heterosynaptic activity.</p><p>In key ways, our results extend other experimental and modeling studies which have found that striatal spiny projection neurons exhibit plateau potentials in response to clustered excitation of neighboring spines on a distal dendritic branch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Du et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Plotkin et al., 2011</xref>). First, our focus is on spine calcium dynamics, whereas previous studies focused on somatic voltage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Plotkin et al. (2011)</xref> did find robust calcium elevation at the site of clustered synaptic stimulation; however, our results additionally show the spatial specificity of spine calcium elevation. Second, our model predicts that spatial clustering within the branch is not required for supralinear spine calcium elevation or plateau potentials, if enough inputs are located distally on the same dendritic branch. SPNs receive few (one to three) synapses from any individual cortical neuron and convergent inputs from thousands of cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kincaid et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zheng and Wilson, 2002</xref>), and the likelihood of clustered, synchronous inputs to occur in vivo is unknown, so the ability for dispersed inputs to a distal branch to also evoke supralinear responses may increase the likelihood of supralinear spine calcium transients occurring in vivo.</p><p>Our finding that coordinated synaptic inputs produce supralinear spine calcium elevation suggests a mechanism for ‘cooperative LTP’ (LTP produced by stimulation of multiple synaptic inputs in the absence of a postsynaptic action potential) in striatal SPNs. Although the induction of cooperative LTP by clustered synaptic input has not been demonstrated in SPNs, it has been observed in pyramidal neurons in cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brandalise et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golding et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gordon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harnett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Losonczy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Makara and Magee, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schiller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Weber et al., 2016</xref>). In pyramidal neurons, cooperative LTP requires NMDAR activation and can be induced by synaptic stimulation of a small number of neighboring spines on a thin dendritic branch. Similarly, we observe that supralinear spine calcium responses in SPNs are NMDAR-dependent and are achieved by coordinated synaptic inputs to a (thin) distal branch. The dependence of supralinear spine calcium elevation on spatially and temporally distributed inputs also is similar to observations in pyramidal neurons. Spatially and temporally distributed inputs to a single distal dendritic branch in CA3 pyramidal neurons have been shown to evoke NMDA spikes, for inputs spatially distributed within a 60 micron length of dendritic branch or temporally distributed with intervals up to 2 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Makara and Magee, 2013</xref>). These results are consistent with our findings that inputs spatially dispersed over the distal half of a dendritic branch or temporally dispersed with a mean interval of 2.5 ms can still evoke supralinear spine calcium elevations. Although LTP induced by supralinear spine calcium elevation in response to coordinated synaptic inputs has not been experimentally demonstrated in the striatum, results from our model along with findings from other brain regions predict that striatal SPNs will exhibit cooperative LTP, and that strict spatial clustering and precise temporal synchrony of synaptic inputs may not be required.</p><p>Our finding that non-stimulated neighboring spines exhibit intermediate levels of calcium elevation suggests that these spines may undergo heterosynaptic plasticity (potentiation or depression) or metaplasticity. For instance, synaptic stimulation and induction of plasticity can induce metaplastic changes at nearby, non-stimulated spines in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Govindarajan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harvey and Svoboda, 2007</xref>). In contrast to metaplasticity, a recent hippocampal study found heterosynaptic depression of nearby non-stimulated spines when a cluster of synaptically stimulated spines underwent potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Oh et al., 2015</xref>). Our results suggest that coordinated synaptic stimulation of clustered spines causes sufficient depolarization of neighboring non-stimulated spines for calcium elevation via VGCCs, which may underlie heterosynaptic changes (LTP or LTD) in nearby spines.</p><p>Calcium-dependent plasticity may also occur in the dendritic shaft. Dendritic spikes in pyramidal neurons can induce branch-specific potentiation of dendritic branch strength, via NMDAR-dependent regulation of dendritic potassium (Kv4.2) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Losonczy et al., 2008</xref>). Our results showing a moderate calcium elevation in the distal dendritic shaft suggest a mechanism linking NMDAR-dependent plateau potentials to dendritic branch strength plasticity. As the same (Kv4.2) potassium channels are expressed in SPN dendrites, we predict that branch-strength plasticity may also occur in SPNs.</p><p>Our most novel result is that inhibition enhances spatial specificity. Although inhibition also attenuates the supralinear response to coordinated synaptic inputs, the reduction in non-stimulated spines is more significant. Our finding that inhibitory synaptic input located distally on the dendritic branch attenuates the supralinear response to coordinated excitatory synaptic inputs is consistent with recent studies in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Du et al., 2017</xref>) and in cortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doron et al., 2017</xref>). However, we additionally found that inhibition enhances the spatial specificity of spine calcium elevation in response to coordinated excitatory inputs, a novel finding with implications for calcium-dependent signaling pathways. The role of distal (but not proximal) inhibition in regulating dendritic and spine calcium transients is consistent with a study showing that distal inhibition regulates bAP-induced calcium influx in cortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marlin and Carter, 2014</xref>), and a study showing that distal inhibitory inputs exhibit stronger inhibition of excitatory potentials than proximal inhibitory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gidon and Segev, 2012</xref>). Our findings also are consistent with a model study showing that inhibition can regulate the direction of homosynaptic (input-specific) plasticity for dendritic shaft synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bar-Ilan et al., 2012</xref>), but we additionally show that inhibition can regulate both heterosynaptic and homosynaptic calcium signaling in dendritic spines. Our results suggest that the complex functional roles of inhibition may include regulating the balance of LTP and LTD within the dendritic branch by, for instance, changing heterosynaptic LTP to LTD; heterosynaptic LTD to no change in synaptic strength; or limiting the spatial extent in the dendrite of heterosynaptic plasticity. In agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Du et al. (2017)</xref>, inhibition located distally on the dendritic branch (near the site of excitatory inputs) within a limited time window relative to excitatory inputs exerted the strongest inhibitory effect. These results suggest that interneurons targeting distal dendrites, such as LTSIs or neuropeptide Y-expressing NGFs, as well as SPN collaterals, may regulate cooperative LTP to support cell assembly formation in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ibáñez-Sandoval et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ponzi and Wickens, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Straub et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tepper et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, our results are robust to parameter variations. The enhancement of spatial specificity by inhibition is most sensitive to NMDAR, CaR, and GABAR conductances, consistent with the NMDAR and CaR channels being the major sources of depolarization and calcium influx on synaptically stimulated and non-stimulated spines, respectively. The main finding that inhibition enhances spatial specificity was observed for all parameter variations (except for a 20% decrease in NMDAR conductance), although the amount that inhibition enhanced spatial specificity did depend on parameter values. Interestingly, both increases and decreases in NMDAR and CaR conductance reduced the ability for inhibition to increase spatial specificity. In the case of increased NMDAR or CaR conductance, greater depolarization would spread into non-stimulated spines, and the ability of the inhibitory current to counter the depolarization would be reduced. In the case of decreased NMDAR or CaR conductance, synapse-specificity is increased in the control (no inhibition) condition because weaker depolarization leads to significantly lower calcium influx to non-stimulated spines; thus, the ability of inhibition to further enhance spatial specificity is reduced. The sensitivity to NMDAR and CaR conductances is consistent with these channels being critical for plateau potential generation and duration in SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Plotkin et al., 2011</xref>), and suggests that an optimal balance of inward currents may be necessary for spatial specificity.</p><p>The degree to which inhibition enhances spatial-specificity also is quite sensitive to GABAR conductance; however, the qualitative outcome is consistent for the entire range of GABAR conductances we evaluated. Therefore, the strength of inhibitory synapses may critically regulate spatial specificity and synaptic plasticity. We predict that calcium-dependent plasticity of inhibitory synapses, as has been observed in pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiu et al., 2018</xref>), may regulate the degree of spatial specificity in a branch-specific manner.</p><p>The computational modeling methods we employed assume that calcium dynamics in dendritic spines can be modeled deterministically with one-dimensional axial diffusion of calcium and mobile buffers. These assumptions may limit our ability to fully capture calcium dynamics in dendritic spines. However, the scope of the model, which includes the entire dendritic morphology with thousands of dendritic spines, precludes simulating stochastic reaction kinetics and diffusion in three-dimensions. Crucially, we verified that our conclusions did not depend on limitations of our modeling methodology. Specifically, our method may underestimate the calcium diffusion rate from narrow spine necks to the dendritic shaft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stiles et al., 1996</xref>). However, neither varying the calcium diffusion rate nor facilitating spine-neck diffusion affected our main result that spine calcium transients exhibit spatial specificity which is enhanced by inhibition. Our examination of mechanisms underlying spatial specificity showed that calcium permeable ligand-gated and voltage-gated ion channels on synaptically stimulated and non-stimulated spines, respectively, were the main contributors to the amplitude of the calcium transients, and that diffusion only had a limited effect on the duration of calcium elevation in non-stimulated spines.</p><p>The calcium modeling method of the GENESIS simulator also does not account for the local radius of curvature of the cell membrane, which may affect fluxes and reactions (i.e. calcium pumps) at the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rangamani et al., 2013</xref>). However, our main result—that inhibition enhances spatial specificity—is robust to variations in parameters affecting calcium influx and efflux. Thus, although the exact magnitude of calcium concentration we report may be limited in accuracy because of methodological limitations, the key conclusions based on the ratios of calcium concentration in stimulated versus non-stimulated spines are qualitatively unchanged. Our conclusions are also supported by the model’s ability to reproduce observations from calcium imaging experiments for stimulation of individual spines. Further, the quantity of spine calcium that is free, bound, pumped or diffuses out during synaptic stimulation in our model exhibits similar dynamics to a detailed three-dimensional model of spine calcium dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartol et al., 2015</xref>). However, as our model does not include variations in spine geometry, it would be of interest for future work to consider the effects of realistic spine geometries (including curvatures) and three-dimensional reaction-diffusion modeling on spine calcium transients during dendritic plateau potentials.</p><p>Together, our results have implications for striatal function and plasticity in vivo. With inputs likely to be spatiotemporally distributed, our results suggest that fewer than 10 spines per branch may produce supralinear spine calcium when a few hundred total synapses on the dendritic tree are stimulated, similar to estimates of the number of synaptic inputs driving striatal upstates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blackwell et al., 2003</xref>). Inhibitory inputs in vivo may control stimulus-specific and heterosynaptic plasticity, serving as a homeostatic mechanism to balance potentiation of excitatory inputs on a dendritic branch-specific level. Our recent work has shown that a calcium-based plasticity rule reproduces diverse in vitro plasticity protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jędrzejewska-Szmek et al., 2017</xref>). Qualitatively extending this calcium-based plasticity rule to our results using clustered synaptic inputs (using the same threshold values reported) would predict that, in the absence of inhibition, supralinear spine calcium transients would produce LTP in synaptically stimulated spines, but also that non-stimulated neighboring spines would be above the LTP threshold and undergo heterosynaptic LTP. In this scenario, inhibition could reduce spine calcium elevation in non-stimulated spines to be above the LTD threshold but below the LTP threshold, switching the response from heterosynaptic LTP to heterosynaptic LTD for many (although not all) non-stimulated spines, whereas the responses in synaptically stimulated spines would remain above the LTP threshold. In the more in vivo-like conditions we simulated with spatiotemporally distributed inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>), the spine calcium values we observed are more consistent with the plasticity rule thresholds, predicting LTP in synaptically stimulated spines and LTP, LTD, or no change in non-stimulated spines, with inhibition switching heterosynaptic LTP to LTD for non-stimulated spines. Extending this calcium-based plasticity rule to assess plasticity during repeated in vivo-like inputs may yield key predictions about how spatiotemporally distributed in vivo activity with trial-to-trial variability induces stable, synapse-specific plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We developed a biologically detailed multicompartment SPN model to investigate the effects of spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic input on calcium signaling.

This was done to make the total time of stimulation independent of number of branches stimulated, and to facilitate comparisons between simulations on a per-branches-stimulated basis (i.e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

For simulations evaluating the effect of a coupling surface area from the spine head to neck or the spine neck to dendritic shaft, the GENESIS source code was changed to calculate the surface area for diffusion between two difshells (or difbuffers) using the geometric average of the surface areas of the two shells, rather than the GENESIS default of the minimum of the two shell surface areas.</p><p>Analysis was done in Python 2.7, using the Numpy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib python packages. Model simulation and analysis files are available on ModelDB. For statistical analysis of simulus specificity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>, a cluster analysis was performed in SAS9.4, using duration and peak calcium as parameters to quantify the extent to which inhibition increased separation between stimulated and non-stimulated spines. The procedure FASTCLUS was used to create two clusters, and the output gave a measure of the distance between clusters of stimulated and non-stimulated spines. In addition, the procedure FREQ was applied to the output of the cluster analysis to generate the confusion matrices and identify the number of incorrectly labeled

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Mary B Kennedy as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas M Bartol (Reviewer #2); Joshua Plotkin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Dorman et al. describes a biologically grounded compartmental model of a striatal spiny projection neuron developed with the program GENESIS. The authors use the model to examine dendritic synaptic integration and calcium dynamics. The model incorporates channels responsible for the experimentally observed electrical behavior of the neurons. Numbers and locations of membrane channels and pumps have been &quot;tuned&quot; to reproduce observed electrical behavior, as well as observed calcium transients in activated spines. The model includes both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic &quot;inputs&quot;.</p><p>The authors verify that activation of a cluster of distal, but not proximal, dendritic spines produces a non-linear dendritic plateau potential, as observed experimentally. They then extend these findings to make testable predictions about synaptic cooperativity and heterosynaptic calcium dynamics in stimulated vs. unstimulated dendritic spines. They explore the effects of simultaneous vs. non-simultaneous coordinated stimulation of groups of distal spines on individual dendritic branches. They report that simultaneous coordinated synaptic stimulation evokes enhanced (&quot;supralinear&quot;) elevation of calcium in stimulated spines and increases the specificity of the increase for stimulated vs. non-stimulated spines. This effect is specific to distal dendritic spines, suggesting that co-activation of spines on individual branches may lead to the most potent potentiation, and that distal branches may therefore act as relatively independent integrating units.</p><p>They also explore the effect of coordinated distal synaptic stimulation onto different, neighboring dendritic branches, finding that the effects of coordinate activation are less pronounced when the inputs are on different branches. The data offer several new insights into these processes, such as the effects of spatial and temporal dispersion of stimulation on calcium summation and the contribution of NMDA receptors vs. VGCCs in mediating spine-specific supralinear calcium responses.</p><p>The most novel finding, however, concerns the role of GABAergic inputs in shaping synaptic specificity during multi-synaptic stimulation. The authors show that single GABAergic synaptic inputs to distal dendrites can drastically increase the specificity of intra-spine calcium dynamics by increasing the difference between the sizes of calcium transients in stimulated vs. neighboring unstimulated spines. This has important implications for synaptic plasticity, and helps resolve a paradox of how synapse-specificity may be achieved under conditions where converging synaptic stimulation pushes an entire dendritic region into a depolarized plateau, a scenario that is now appreciated to represent a physiologically meaningful and important event.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The work represents the kind of modeling that the reviewers would like to see published in <italic>eLife</italic>.

This will not detract from the significance of the present work, rather it will enhance it. The supralinear response of a calcium transient in spines resulting from activation of NMDA receptors has long been studied in cortical and hippocampal synapses. Earlier hippocampal/cortical papers should be cited; for example, Schiller, Schiller and Clapham, 1998. A good early review is Sjöström and Nelson, 2002. A stochastic computer model of a hippocampal neuron that includes differential contributions to spine calcium from various sources is Bartol et al., 2015.</p><p>The Introduction should contain a separate paragraph discussing the key differences between the anatomy and physiology of striatal spiny projection neurons and hippocampal and cortical projection neurons, including the observed synaptic plateau potentials, the up-state and down-state, and the observed differences between proximal and distal spines. In the Introduction and/or Discussion, a separate paragraph on the potential roles of the different sources of inhibitory inputs should be included. The present organization of the manuscript includes this background material interspersed throughout the Introduction, Results and Discussion, which becomes confusing.</p><p>Model Structure:</p><p>1) GENESIS (and also a recent module added to Neuron) treat the problem of reaction/diffusion between compartments connected by bottlenecks (such as the spine neck connected to the dendritic shaft) as a 1D problem (i.e. diffusion along the axial dimension of a cylinder). It has been shown previously that this treatment greatly underestimates the diffusion flux across the mouth of the bottleneck (see Stiles et al., 1996). The underestimate is due to the formation of a 3D concentration gradient in the neighborhood of the mouth as the diffusing particles enter the larger space. This 3D diffusion gradient greatly increases the apparent flux area of the mouth. Only a full 3D method that captures this fine structure provides an accurate quantitative estimate of diffusion as it occurs in the space and time scales of real dendrites and spines. Because major conclusions of this study concern fluxes and exchange of calcium among clusters of spines on the dendrite, getting the diffusion rate right may be of critical importance to the conclusions. The authors should discuss this aspect of the model explicitly and, at the very least, include information about the sensitivity of the conclusion of the model to the diffusion rate of calcium out of spines into the dendrite. For example, if the diffusion rate were faster, as described in the Stiles paper, would the tuning of channel numbers have to be adjusted to reproduce experimental data? And would the major conclusions of the study regarding size and specificity of calcium fluxes in spines still hold?</p><p>2) In computational science and numerical methods, the choice of temporal and spatial discretization of a PDE model is critical to achieve physically accurate results. For this reason, it is customary to validate a model by a test of convergence at ever finer space and time scales and through cross-validation with other simulation methods to demonstrate a robust solution. The authors should test the validity of their model using one or more of these techniques.</p><p>3) The boundary conditions in PDE models of reaction/diffusion are also a critical factor to get right. It is very important to account for the localradius of curvature at the boundary in the diffusion and flux terms at the boundary. It is not clear that the PDEs employed in the difshell module of GENESIS account for this curvature. See equation 3 of Rangamani et al., 2013. This could have a significant impact on the inward Ca flux and outward pump fluxes.</p><p>4) After addressing points 1-3 the calcium dynamics in the spines and dendrite may very well be different and will require the authors to re-tune the tunable parameters to compensate and restore a good fit to the experimental observations. It is unclear whether the authors' conclusions will hold up or be weakened.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38588.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>The work represents the kind of modeling that the reviewers would like to see published in eLife.

This 3D diffusion gradient greatly increases the apparent flux area of the mouth. Only a full 3D method that captures this fine structure provides an accurate quantitative estimate of diffusion as it occurs in the space and time scales of real dendrites and spines.

The authors should discuss this aspect of the model explicitly and, at the very least, include information about the sensitivity of the conclusion of the model to the diffusion rate of calcium out of spines into the dendrite.

And would the major conclusions of the study regarding size and specificity of calcium fluxes in spines still hold?</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the reviewers’ comments addressing the model structure. We acknowledge that the one-dimensional approximation for diffusion and reaction is an approximation that should be more fully explored. The scope of our model, which includes the entire dendritic morphology and explicitly includes 3,280 dendritic spines, precludes a full 3D representation of reaction and diffusion. However, it is critical that our conclusions do not depend on the limitation of simulating calcium dynamics with a 1D approximation. To address the sensitivity of our conclusions that spine calcium transients exhibit stimulus-specificity and that inhibition enhances this specificity to the calcium diffusion parameters, we performed several simulations addressed here and in response to the subsequent specific items of concerns raised by the reviewers.</p><p>First, we conducted additional sensitivity analysis simulations while varying the calcium diffusion rate from -50% to +100% (Figure 7—figure supplement 2) and observed no qualitative change in the outcome of our main result. We have added a description in the Results explaining our analysis of model robustness and sensitivity to diffusion parameters (subsection “Inhibition enhances stimulus-specificity of spine calcium transients”, fourth paragraph) and added paragraphs in the Discussion (ninth and tenth paragraphs) on the limitations of modeling 1D, deterministic calcium diffusion and reactions. Similar to what we showed with our initial sensitivity analysis (Figure 7—figure supplement 1) and our analysis of mechanisms underlying synapse-specific calcium transients (Figure 3), these additional results confirm that the specificity of spine calcium responses most strongly depends on distinct sources of calcium influx, and that diffusion of calcium only has a small effect.</p><p>To further explore diffusion rate between the neck and dendritic shaft (or spine head), we modified the GENESIS source code to replace the default coupling coefficient for the shared surface area, which was the smaller of the two surface areas, with the geometric average of the two surface areas, which facilitates diffusion from the spine neck to the dendrite (Holmes, 2005) This result has been included in the additional sensitivity analysis figure (Figure 7—figure supplement 2, subsection “Inhibition enhances stimulus-specificity of spine calcium transients”, fourth paragraph), showing no qualitative effect on the main result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In computational science and numerical methods, the choice of temporal and spatial discretization of a PDE model is critical to achieve physically accurate results.

The authors should test the validity of their model using one or more of these techniques.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the concern about temporal and spatial discretization by simulating the model with finer temporal and spatial scales. We decreased the simulation time step from 10 to 1 microsecond; we decreased the voltage compartment length in tertiary dendrites from 3 microns to 1 micron; and we increased the number of diffusion shells in the dendritic shafts, spine necks, and spine heads. We verified that our discretization of diffusion met stability requirements given by the equation D∆t(∆x)2≤12.</p><p>This finer discretization had a trivial effect on the outcome of membrane potential in the soma or a dendritic spine and spine calcium transients in stimulated or non-stimulated spines. Finer discretization did not qualitatively change the main result that inhibition enhances spatial specificity of spine calcium elevation (see Figure 7—figure supplement 2, subsection “Inhibition enhances stimulus-specificity of spine calcium transients”, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The boundary conditions in PDE models of reaction/diffusion are also a critical factor to get right. It is very important to account for the localradius of curvature at the boundary in the diffusion and flux terms at the boundary. It is not clear that the PDEs employed in the difshell module of GENESIS account for this curvature. See equation 3 of Rangamani et al., 2013. This could have a significant impact on the inward Ca flux and outward pump fluxes.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the difshell object in GENESIS does not account for local radius of curvature, but rather approximates each discretized calcium shell as a well-mixed volume, and the fluxes at the membrane are approximated using the total difshell membrane surface area and calcium concentration in the submembrane volume. While the scope of our model precludes simulating calcium dynamics at the same scale as Rangamani et al., 2013, we have assessed the sensitivity of our results to inward calcium flux and outward pump flux, shown by Rangamani et al. to be influenced by local curvature. We performed simulations that varied inward calcium flux through calcium permeable channels (while not varying the contribution of these channels to membrane depolarization) and calcium pump density from -50% to +100%. These results, which have been added to the new sensitivity analysis figure (Figure 7—figure supplement 2, subsection “Inhibition enhances stimulus-specificity of spine calcium transients”, fourth paragraph) indicate that our main results are not qualitatively affected by the specific membrane calcium fluxes. Indeed, although the magnitudes of calcium transients depend strongly on these parameters, the role of inhibition in enhancing spine-specificity does not depend strongly on the absolute magnitudes of calcium fluxes. With as much as a 50% reduction in calcium influx, inhibition still enhanced spatial specificity, though the degree to which inhibition did so was reduced.</p><p>Additionally, to further address the limitations of the 1D approximation of calcium dynamics in our model, we have compared the fate of calcium influx into a spine in our model during a single synaptic stimulation (i.e. the amount of free, bound, pumped, or diffused calcium) with a published computational model incorporating 3D, stochastic calcium reaction-diffusion in reconstructed dendritic spines (Bartol et al., 2015) (subsection “Multiscale model reproduces electrophysiology and calcium-imaging experiments”, last paragraph). We show the fraction of buffered, free, diffused, and pumped calcium in response to a single synaptic stimulation (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), which is similar to Figure 9 in Bartol et al., 2015. We have addressed the limitations regarding calcium influx and efflux (and their dependence on membrane curvature) in the Discussion (tenth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) After addressing points 1-3 the calcium dynamics in the spines and dendrite may very well be different and will require the authors to re-tune the tunable parameters to compensate and restore a good fit to the experimental observations. It is unclear whether the authors' conclusions will hold up or be weakened.</p></disp-quote><p>As our main results were robust to the additional simulations we performed (presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 2, and Figure 7—figure supplement 2), we concluded that retuning the model was not necessary.</p></body></sub-article></article>
